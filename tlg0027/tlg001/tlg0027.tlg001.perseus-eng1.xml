					<p>The systematic and untiring efforts of my enemies, gentlemen, to do me every
						possible injury, by fair means or by foul, from the very moment of my
						arrival in this city,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Four years earlier,
							in 403.</note> are known to almost all of you, and it is unnecessary for
						me to pursue the subject. Instead, I shall make a request of you, gentlemen,
						a fair request, which it is as easy for you to grant as it is valuable for
						me to gain.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Much of 1, 6, 7 and 9 consists
							of <foreign xml:lang="latin">loci communes</foreign> which recur in
							Lysias and Isocrates. Both they and Andocides were making use of the
							same handbook of proems.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">
					<p>First, I ask you to bear in mind that it is not because I have been forced to
						face my trial that I am here today—I have not been on bail, nor have I been
						kept in confinement.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This was not customary
							in a case of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ndeicis</foreign>. The
							accused, if a citizen, was usually given the choice of furnishing
							sureties (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)gguhtai/</foreign>) or suffering
							imprisonment until the case came into court. Possibly it was felt that
							the conditions in the present instance were exceptional and that
							Andocides should be allowed the opportunity of quitting <placeName
								key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> if he so desired.</note> I am
						here, first and foremost because I rely upon justice and secondly because I
						rely upon you; I believe that you will decide my case impartially and, far
						sooner than allow my enemies to defy justice by taking my life, will uphold
						justice by protecting me, as your laws and your oaths as jurors require you
						to do. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>With defendants who face a trial of their own free will, gentlemen, it stands
						to reason that you should feel as convinced of their innocence as they do
						themselves. When a defendant admits himself guilty by refusing to await
						trial, you naturally endorse the verdict which he has passed upon himself;
						so it follows that if a man is prepared to face his trial because his
						conscience is clear, you should let his verdict upon himself determine your
						own in the same way, instead of presuming him guilty. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<p>Mine is a case in point. My enemies have been saying, or so I keep hearing,
						that I would take to my heels instead of standing my ground. “What motive
						could Andocides possibly have for braving so hazardous a trial?” they argue.
						“He can count upon a livelihood sufficient for all his needs, if he does no
						more than withdraw from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>;
						while if he returns to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>
						whence he has come,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The <title>De
								Reditu</title> shows that Andocides had spent a considerable time in
								<placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> during his years of
							exile. He was on very friendly terms with Evagoras, who had succeeded in
							regaining the throne of <placeName key="perseus,Salamis, Cyprus"
								>Salamis</placeName> in 410. Evagoras was notoriously eager to
							attract likely Greek settlers.</note> an abundance of good land has been
						offered him and is his for the asking. Will a man in his position want to
						risk his life? What object could he have in doing so? Cannot he see the
						state of things in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>?” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>That entirely misrepresents my feelings, gentlemen. I would never consent to
						a life abroad which cut me off from my country, whatever the advantages
						attached to it; and although conditions in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
							>Athens</placeName> may be what my enemies allege, I would sooner be a
						citizen of her than of any other state which may appear to me to be just now
						at the height of prosperity. Those are the feelings which have led me to
						place my life in your hands. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>I ask you, then, to show more sympathy to me, the defendant, gentlemen, than
						to my accusers, in the knowledge that even if you give us an impartial
						hearing, the defence is inevitably at a disadvantage. The prosecution have
						brought their charge in perfect safety, after elaborating their plans at
						leisure; whereas I who am answering that charge am filled with fear; my life
						is at stake, and I have been grossly misrepresented. You have good reason
						for showing more sympathy to me than you do to my accusers. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>And there is another thing to be borne in mind. Serious charges have often
						before now been disproved at once, and so decisively that you would much
						rather have punished the accusers than the accused. Again, witnesses have
						caused the death of innocent men by giving false evidence, and have only
						been convicted of perjury when it was too late to be of help to the victims.
						When this kind of thing has been so common, you can hardly do less than
						refuse for the Present to consider the prosecution's statement of the case
						trustworthy. You may use it to judge whether the charge is serious or not
						but you cannot tell whether the charge is true or false until you have heard
						my reply as well. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>Now I am wondering at what point to begin my defence, gentlemen. Shall I
						start with what ought to be discussed last and prove that the prosecution
						disobeyed the law in lodging their information against me?<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">A reference, apparently, to the amnesty of 403.
							According to Andocides, it debarred the prosecution from reopening his
							case.</note> Shall I take the decree of Isotimides and show that it has
						been annulled? Shall I start with the laws which have been passed and the
						oaths which have been taken? Or shall I tell you the story right from the
						beginning? I will explain the chief reason for my hesitation. Doubtless the
						different charges made have not moved you all to the same degree, and each
						of you has some one of them to which he would like me to reply first; yet to
						answer them all simultaneously is impossible. On the whole, I think it best
						to tell you the entire story from the beginning, omitting nothing; once you
						are properly acquainted with the facts, you will see immediately how
						unfounded are the charges which my accusers have brought against me. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<p>Now to return a just verdict is already, I feel sure, your intention; indeed,
						it was because I relied upon you that I stood my ground. I have observed
						that in suits public and private the one thing to which you attach supreme
						importance is that your decision should accord with your oath; and it is
						that, and that alone, which keeps our city unshaken, in spite of those who
						would have things otherwise. I do, however, ask you to listen to my defence
						with sympathy; do not range yourselves with my opponents; do not view my
						story with suspicion; do not watch for faults of expression. Hear my defence
						to the end: and only then return the verdict which you think best befits
						yourselves and best satisfies your oath. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<p>As I have already told you, gentlemen, my defence will begin at the beginning
						and omit nothing. I shall deal first with the actual charge which furnished
						grounds for the lodging of the information that has brought me into court
						today, profanation of the Mysteries. I shall show that I have committed no
						act of impiety, that I have never turned informer, that I have never
						admitted guilt, and that I do not know whether the statements made to you by
						those who did turn informers were true or false. Of all this you shall have
						proof.</p>

				<div type="section" n="11">
					<p>The Assembly had met<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">June, <date>415</date>
							B.C. Andocides is our only authority for this last-minute meeting of the
							Assembly. It was probably convened to make final arrangements for the
							expedition.</note> to give audience to Nicias, Lamachus, and Alcibiades,
						the generals about to leave with the Sicilian expedition—in fact, Lamachus'
						flag-ship was already lying offshore—when suddenly Pythonicus rose before
						the people and cried: “Countrymen, you are sending forth this mighty host in
						all its array upon a perilous enterprise. Yet your commander, Alcibiades,
						has been holding celebrations of the Mysteries in a private house, and
						others with him; I will prove it. Grant immunity<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">The word <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/deia</foreign> is
							used in two slightly different senses. (a) It is the immunity granted by
							the Assembly or Council to persons who have a statement to make to them,
							but who are debarred from addressing them without special permission.
							This applied to slaves, metics, and women. Hence Andromachus, Teucrus,
							and Agariste all have to obtain an <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)/deia</foreign> before lodging their information. (b) It is the
							immunity granted to a criminal who is prepared to turn informer. Often
							the two senses are combined, as here Andromachus was both debarred from
							addressing the Assembly in normal circumstances, and he was implicated
							in the crime which he was exposing. The same applies to Teucrus.</note>
						to him whom I indicate, and a non-initiate, a slave belonging to someone
						here present, shall describe the Mysteries to you. You can punish me as you
						will, if that is not the truth.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="12">
					<p>Alcibiades denied the charge at great length; so the Prytanes<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That section of the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">boulh/</foreign> which presided at meetings of the
							Ecclesia for the time being. For further details see <bibl
								n="Antiph. 6.45">Antiph. 6.45</bibl> note 1.</note> decided to clear
						the meeting of non-initiates and themselves fetch the lad indicated by
						Pythonicus. They went off, and returned with a slave belonging to
						Archebiades, son of Polemarchus. His name was Andromachus. As soon as
						immunity had been voted him, he stated that Mysteries had been celebrated in
						Pulytion's house. Alcibiades, Niciades and Meletus —those were the actual
						celebrants; but others had been present and had witnessed what took place.
						The audience had also included slaves, namely, himself, his brother, the
						fluteplayer Hicesius, and Meletus' slave. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="13">
					<p>Such was the statement of Andromachus, the first of the informers. He gave
						the following list of persons concerned,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
							>The names of a number of those whose goods were confiscated and sold
							after the mutilation of the Hermae have survived on a fragmentary
							inscription (I.G. i 2. 327, 332). They confirm the lists given by

							list of Andromachus: Axiochus, Adeimantus, Cephisodorus, and Euphiletus
							from the later lists of Teucrus and Andocides himself.</note> all of
						whom, save Polystratus, fled the country and were sentenced to death by you
						in their absence; Polystratus was arrested and executed. Take the list,

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="14">
					<p>This was the first information, gentlemen; it was due to Andromachus, and
						implicated the persons mentioned. Now call Diognetus, please.</p>
					<quote type="Witness"><title>Witness</title>You were on the commission of

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="15">
					<p>A second information followed. An alien named Teucrus, resident in <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, quietly withdrew to <placeName
							key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>. From <placeName
							key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> he informed the Council that if

						with regard to the Mysteries—as one of the participants, he would reveal the
						names of his companions—but he would also tell what he knew of the
						mutilation of the Hermae. The Council, which had supreme powers at the time,
						voted acceptance; and messengers were sent to <placeName
							key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> to fetch him. He was brought to
							<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and on being granted
						immunity, furnished a list of his associates. No sooner had Teucrus

					<p>Let me remind you, gentlemen, that you are receiving confirmation of these
						further facts in every detail.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e.
							Diognetus, who had first-hand knowledge, had listened to the recital in
							silence.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="16">
					<p>A third information followed. According to the wife of Alcmaeonides—she had
						previously been married to Damon and was named Agariste—according, as I say,
						to Alcmaeonides' wife, Alcibiades, Axiochus, and Adeimantus celebrated
						Mysteries in Charmides' house, next to the Olympieum. No sooner had the
						information been lodged than those concerned left the country to a man. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="17">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There was still one more information.
						According to Lydus, a slave of Pherecles of Themacus, Mysteries were
						celebrated at the house of his master, Pherecles, at Themacus. He gave a
						list of those concerned, including my father among them; my father had been
						present, so Lydus said, but asleep with his head under his cloak.
						Speusippus, one of the members of the Council, was for handing them all over
						to the proper court; whereupon my father furnished surieties and brought an
						action against Speusippus for making an illegal proposal.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">Lydus gave his information before the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">boulh/</foreign>. Speusippus at once proposed that
							the offenders named be tried by the Heliaea in the usual way. Leogoras
							protested against his incluson in the list (a) because he had never been
							near Themacus and (b) because even Lydus did not go so far as to assert
							that he had had any part in the celebration. He then blocked Speusippus'
							proposal by a <foreign xml:lang="greek">grafh\ parano/mwn</foreign>
							which had to be settled before the proposal could take effect. The
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">grafh/</foreign> came before the Heliaea
							in the usual way; and Leogoras obtained a verdict in his favour. He had,
							of course, to furnish sureties for his own appearance in the event of
							his losing his case against Speusippus.</note> The case was tried before
						six thousand citizens.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This represents the
							whole of the Heliasts for the year. A jury of this size occurs nowhere
							else; but there are no good grounds for doubting Andocides'
							figures.</note> There were six thousand jurors, I repeat; yet Speusippus
						failed to gall the votes of two hundred. I may add that my father was
						induced to stay in the country partly by the entreaties of his relatives in
						general, but principally by my own. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="18">
					<p>Kindly call Callias and Stephanus—yes, and call Philippus and Alexippus.
						Philippus and Alexippus are related to Acumenus and Autocrator, who fled in
						consequence of the information lodged by Lydus; Autocrator is a nephew of
						the one, and Acumenus is the other's uncle. They have little reason to love
						the man who drove the them from this country, and they should also know
						better than anyone who it was who caused their exile in the first
							instance.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. (1) Speusippus, who had
							initiated proceedings against them, and (2) Lydus, from whom the
							information had originated.</note> Face the court, gentlemen, and state
						whether I have been telling the truth. <quote type="Witnesses"
								><title>Witnesses</title></quote>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="19">
					<p>Now that you have heard the facts, gentlemen, and the witnesses have
						confirmed them for you, let me remind you of the version of those facts
						which the prosecution had the effrontery to give—for after all, the right
						way to conduct a defence is to recall the statements of the prosecution and
						disprove them. According to the prosecution, I myself gave information in
						the matter of the Mysteries and included my own father in my list of those
						present: yes, turned informer against my own father. I cannot imagine a more
						outrageous, a more abominable suggestion. My father was denounced by
						Pherecles' slave, Lydus: it was I who persuaded him to remain in <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> instead of escaping into
						exile—and it was only after numberless entreaties and by clinging to his
						knees that I did so. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="20">
					<p>What, pray, was I about in informing against my father, as we are asked to
						believe that I did, when at the same time I was begging him to remain in
							<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>—begging him, that is,
						to let me be guilty of the consequences to himself? Again, we are to suppose
						that my father himself consented to face a trial which was bound to have one
						or other of two terrible results for him; if my information against him was
						deemed true, his blood would be upon my hands: if he himself was acquitted,
						mine would be upon his; because the law ran that whereas an informer's claim
						to immunity should be allowed if his information were true, he should be put
						to death, if it were not. Yet if there is one thing of which you are all
						certain, it is the fact that my father and I both escaped with our lives.
						That could not have happened, if I had informed against my father: either he
						or I would have had to die. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="21">
					<p>Then again, assume that he actually desired to stay. Do you imagine that his
						friends would have let him do so? Would they have gone bail for him? Would
						they not have urged him to change his mind? Would they not have begged him
						to find some place of refuge abroad, where he would be out of harm's way
						himself and would avoid causing my death also? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="22">
					<p>But to return to facts: when prosecuting Speusippus for making an illegal
						proposal, one thing upon which my father insisted repeatedly was that he had
						never visited Pherecles at Themacus in his life; and he offered the defence
						the opportunity of examining his slaves under torture<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">For the torturing of slaves cf. p. 70. note.</note>;
						those who were ready to hand over their slaves, he said, ought not to meet
						with a refusal of the test which they were proposing, when those who were
						not ready to hand them over were forced to do so. You all know my father's
						challenge to be a fact. Now if there is any truth in the prosecution's
						assertion, what had Speusippus to reply but: “Why talk of slaves, Leogoras?
						Has not your son here informed against you? Does not he say that you were at
						Themacus? Andocides, prove your father guilty, or your chance of a pardon is
						gone.” Was that Speusippus' natural retort or not, gentlemen? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="23">
					<p>I for one think so. In fact, if I ever entered a court, if I was ever
						mentioned in connexion with the affair, or if there is any recorded
						information or list containing my name, let alone any for which I was myself
						responsible, anyone who wishes is welcome to step up here and prove it
						against me. For my own part, I have never known anyone tell so outrageous or
						so unconvincing a story. All that was necessary, they imagined, was
						sufficient effrontery to bring a charge; the possibility of their being
						refuted did not disturb them in the least. Be consistent, then. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="24">
					<p>Had this accusation of theirs been true, your anger would have fallen upon
						me, and you would have considered the severest penalty justified. So now
						that you see them to be lying, I demand that you look upon them instead as
						scoundrels—and with good reason too: for if the worst of their charges are
						shown to be conspicuously false, I shall hardly find it difficult to prove
						the same of those which are less serious. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="25">
					<p>Such, then, were the informations lodged in connexion with the Mysteries;
						they were, as I say, four in number. I have read you the names of those who
						went into exile after each, and the witnesses have given their evidence. I
						shall now do something more to convince you, gentlemen. Of those who went
						into exile as a result of the profanation of the Mysteries, some died
						abroad; but others have returned and are living in <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. These last are present in court
						at my request. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="26">
					<p>Any of them who wishes is welcome to prove, in the time now allotted to
							me,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The time allowed for the speeches
							of the prosecution and defence in an Athenian court of law was limited.
							It was measured by a water-clock (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>kleyu/dra</foreign>) which varied in size according to the nature
							of the case. The outflow of water was stopped during the reading of
							documents, depositions, etc. Here Andocides offers to stand aside with
							the clock still running.</note> that I was responsible for the exile of
						any of their number, that I informed against any of them, or that the
						various groups did not go into exile in consequence of the particular
						informations which I have described to you. If I am shown not to be speaking
						the truth, you may punish me as you will. I shall now interrupt my defence
						and give place to anyone who wishes to step up here. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="27">
					<p>And now, gentlemen, what followed? After the various informations had been
						laid, the question of rewards arose: for Cleonymus' decree had offered one
						thousand drachmae, and Peisander's ten.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The
							question of offering rewards for information probably arose when the
							commission of inquiry was being appointed. After Cleonymus' thousand
							drachmae was found to be producing insufficient results, it would be
							supplemented by the much more substantial sum proposed by Peisander. For
							Peisander see p.366, note.</note> Conflicting claims were made by the
						informers I have mentioned,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e.
							Andromachus, Teucrus, Agariste, and Lydus. Pythonicus' claim was based
							on the fact that he had been originally responsible for bringing the
							matter to the notice of the Assembly. Androcles is here mentioned for
							the first time. From <bibl n="Thuc. 8.65">Thuc. 8.65</bibl> and <bibl
								n="Plut. Alc. 19">Plut. Alc. 19</bibl> it is clear that he played an
							important part in the investigations; probably it was through his agency

					<p>So much for the profanation of the Mysteries, gentlemen, on which the

						have not a single offence against the Two Goddesses<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">Demeter and Kore, the central figures of the

						And it is vitally important for me to convince you of this; for the stories

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="30">
					<p>It is I, in fact, who am much more truly the accuser, and they the accused.
						They have been guilty of impiety; and therefore, I maintain, they deserve

						go unharmed. It would be nothing less than monstrous to vent upon me the
						wrath which the misdeeds of others have aroused in you, or to let the
						malicious attack to which I have been subjected weigh more with you than the
						truth, when you know that it is my enemies who are responsible for it.
						Obviously anyone who was guilty of an offence such as that with which we are
						concerned could not clear himself by denying that he had committed it: for
						the scrutiny to which a defendant's statements are subjected is formidable
						indeed when the court already knows the truth. But to me the inquiry into
						the facts is the very opposite of embarrassing; I have no need to resort to
						entreaties or appeals for mercy to gain an acquittal upon a charge such as
						this: I have merely to show the absurdity of the statements of my accusers
						by reminding you of what actually occurred. </p>

						witnessed the rites of the Two Goddesses, in order that you may punish those
						who are guilty of impiety and protect those who are innocent. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="32">
					<p>Understand, then, that to condemn the innocent for impiety is no less an act

						for the sake both of the rites which you have witnessed and of the Greeks
						who are coming to this city for the festival. If I have committed any act of

						another has informed against me, then put me to death; I ask no mercy. </p>

					<p>At this appeal from Charmides, gentlemen, which was echoed by the rest, who

					<p>Then a further thought struck me, gentlemen. I reminded myself that a number
						of the offenders responsible for the mutilation had already been executed
						upon the information lodged by Teucrus, while yet others had escaped into
						exile and been sentenced to death in their absence. In fact, there remained
						only four of the criminals whose names had not been divulged by Teucrus:
						Panaetius, Chaeredemus, Diacritus, and Lysistratus; </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="53">
					<p>and it was only natural to assume that they had been among the first to be

						put to death. It was thus still doubtful whether they would escape: but it
						was certain that my own kindred would perish, unless <placeName

						that it was better to cut off from their country four men who richly

				<div type="section" n="54">
					<p>If, then, any of you yourselves, gentlemen, or any of the public at large has

					<p>Come now, in considering a case, a judge should make allowances for human

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="58">
					<p>But the alternatives before me were precisely the opposite. On the other
						hand, if I remained silent, I myself died in disgrace for an act of impiety
						which I had not comitted, and I allowed my father, my brother-in-law, and a
						host of my relatives and cousins to perish in addition. Yes, I, and I alone,
						was sending them to their death, if I refused to say that others were to
						blame; for Diocleides had thrown them into prison by his lies, and they
						could only be rescued if their countrymen were put in full possession of the

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="59">
					<p>That is what silence meant. On the other hand, by revealing the truth I saved

						was working such havoc. True, I was sending four men into exile; but all
						four were guilty. And for the others, who had already been denounced by
						Teucrus, I am sure that none of them, whether dead or in exile, was one whit
						the worse off for any disclosures of mine. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="60">
					<p>Taking all this into consideration, gentlemen, I found that the least
						objectionable of the courses open to me was to tell the truth as quickly as
						possible, to prove that Diocleides had lied, and so to punish the scoundrel
						who was causing us to be put to death wrongfully and imposing upon the
						public, while in return he was being hailed as a supreme benefactor and
						rewarded for his services. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="61">
					<p>I therefore informed the Council that I knew the offenders, and showed
						exactly what had occurred. The idea, I said, had been suggested by
						Euphiletus at a drinking-party; but I opposed it, and succeeded in
						preventing its execution for the time being. Later, however, I was thrown
						from a colt of mine in Cynosarges<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A
							gymnasium sacred to Heracles on the eastern outskirts of <placeName
								key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, near the Diomean
							Gate.</note>; I broke my collar-bone and fractured my skull, and had to
						be taken home on a litter. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="62">
					<p>When Euphiletus saw my condition, he informed the others that I had consented
						to join them and had promised him to mutilate the Hermes next to the shrine
						of Phorbas<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">One of the many <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|a</foreign> scattered over the city. Phorbas
							was an Attic hero; he had been the charioteer of Theseus.</note> as my
						share in the escapade. He told them this to hoodwink them; and that is why
						the Hermes which you can all see standing close to the home of our family,
						the Hermes dedicated by the Aegeid tribe, was the only one in <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> unmutilated, it being understood
						that I would attend to it as Euphiletus had promised. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="63">
					<p>When the others learned the truth, they were furious to think that I was in
						the secret without having taken any active part; and the next day I received
						a visit from Meletus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Meletus had also been
							connected with the profanation of the Mysteries; his name appears on
							Andromachus' list (<bibl n="Andoc. 1.13">Andoc. 1.13</bibl>). Like
							Euphiletus, he was denounced by Teucrus for mutilation of the Hermae
								(<bibl n="Andoc. 1.35">Andoc. 1.35</bibl>).</note> and Euphiletus.
						“We have managed it all right, Andocides,” they told me. “Now if you will
						consent to keep quiet and say nothing, you will find us just as good friends
						as before. If you do not, you will find that you have been much more
						successful at making enemies of us than at making fresh friends by turning
						traitor to us.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="64">
					<p>I replied that I certainly thought Euphiletus a scoundrel for acting as he
						had; although he and his companions had far less to fear from my being in
						the secret than from the mere fact that the deed was done. </p>
					<p>I supported this account by handing over my slave for torture, to prove that
						I was ill at the time in question and had not even left my bed; and the

						used as their base. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="65">
					<p>The Council and the commission of inquiry went into the matter closely, and
						when at length they found that it was as I said and that the witnesses
						corroborated me without exception, they summoned Diocleides. He, however,
						made a long cross-examination unnecessary by admitting at once that he had
						been lying, and begged that he might be pardoned if he disclosed who had
						induced him to tell his story; the culprits, he said, were Alcibiades of
							Phegus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A deme in the neighborhood of

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="66">
					<p>Alcibiades and Amiantus fled from the country in terror; and when you heard

					<p>Not only do the circumstances in which I here found myself entitle me to the

						the scorn which he deserved. Yet once his companions had committed the
						crime, I kept their secret; it was Teucrus who lodged the information which
						led to their death or exile, before we had been thrown into prison by

						defaulted or were liable to the state as sureties for a defaulter,<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Tax-farmers usually formed themselves into
							companies headed by an <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxw/nhs</foreign> who
							personally contracted with the state for the purchase of the right to
							collect a given tax. The agreed sum was not paid until the tax had been
							collected; and so the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxw/nhs</foreign> had
							to furnish sureties, who became liable if he himself defaulted. It was
							the practice to auction the various taxes, the highest bidder obtaining
							the right to farm them, cf. <bibl n="Andoc. 1.133">Andoc.
							1.133</bibl>.</note> had to pay within eight Prytanies; otherwise, the
						sum due was doubled and the delinquent's property distrained upon.<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The six classes of state-debtor here

							unpaid. They were allowed eight Prytanies (i.e. roughly nine months) in

							distrained upon for double the original amount. Should the confiscation
							fail to produce the requisite sum, they remained <foreign

							forthcoming.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="74">
					<p>Such was one form of disfranchisement. According to a second, delinquents
						lost all personal rights, but retained possession of their property. This
						class included all persons convicted of theft or of accepting bribes—it was
						laid down that both they and their descendants should lose their personal
						rights. Similarly, all who deserted on the field of battle, who were found
						guilty of evasion of military service, of cowardice, or of withholding a

						were deprived of their personal rights, while retaining possession of their
						property. </p>

				<div type="section" n="75">
					<p>Others again had their rights curtailed in specified directions; they were

						Hundred are a case in point.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This penalty
							appears to have been inflicted in 410, after the restoration of the

					<p>But you must let me tell you how the son to whom Callias tried to have the

						quite worth hearing, gentlemen. Callias married a daughter of Ischomachus;
						but he had not been living with her a year before he made her mother his
						mistress. Was ever man so utterly without shame? He was the priest of the
						Mother and the Daughter; yet he lived with mother and daughter and kept them
						both in his house together. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="125">
					<p>The thought of the Two Goddesses may not have awoken any shame or fear in
						Callias; but the daughter of Ischomachus thought death better than an
						existence where such things went on before her very eyes. She tried to hang
						herself: but was stopped in the act. Then, when she recovered, she ran away
						from home; the mother drove out the daughter. Finally Callias grew tired of
						the mother as well, and drove her out in her turn. She then said she was
						pregnant by him; but when she gave birth to a son, Callias denied that the
						child was his. </p>

						I am he.” “Yes, and the child is yours.” Callias took hold of the altar and
						swore that the only son he had or had ever had was Hipponicus, and the
						mother was Glaucon's daughter. If that was not the truth, he prayed that he
						and his house might perish from the earth—as they surely will. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="127">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now some time afterwards, gentlemen, he fell

						introduce his son, if he swears that it is his own son whom he is

					<p>Let us just see, gentlemen, whether anything of this kind has ever happened

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="129">
					<p>Personally, I do not believe that there is anyone ingenious enough to find

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="130">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As a matter of fact, I want to remind you
						briefly, gentlemen, of a certain incident connected with Callias. As you may
						remember, when <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was
						mistress of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and at the
						height of her prosperity, and Hipponicus was the richest man in <placeName
							key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, a rumour with which you are all
						familiar was on the lips of little children and silly women throughout the
						city: “Hipponicus,” they said, “has an evil spirit in his house, and it
						upsets his books.”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Lit. “his table,” with a
							play on <foreign xml:lang="greek">tra/peza</foreign> meaning a “bank.”
							The pun cannot be rendered exactly in English.</note> You remember it,
						gentlemen. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="131">
					<p>Now in what sense do you think that the saying current in those days proved
						true? Why, Hipponicus imagined that he had a son in his house; but that son
						was really an evil spirit, which has upset his wealth, his morals, and his
						whole life. So it is as Hipponicus' evil spirit that you must think of
						Callias. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="132">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now take my other accusers, Callias' partners,
						who have helped to institute this trial and have financed the prosecution.
						Why, I ask, did it never strike them that I was committing sacrilege during
						the three years which I have spent in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
							>Athens</placeName> since my return from <placeName key="tgn,1000112"
							>Cyprus</placeName>? I initiated A— from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi"
							>Delphi</placeName> and other friends of mine besides from outside
						Attica, and I frequented the Eleusinium and offered sacrifices, as I
						consider I have a perfect right to do. Yet so far from prosecuting, they
						actually proposed me for public services, first as Gymnasiarch<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">One of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)gku/klioi lh|tourgi/ai</foreign> which recurred annually.
							Citizens owning property to the value of three talents or over were
							liable to them. Other such liturgies were the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>xorhgi/a, lampadarxi/a, a)rxeqewri/a, e(sti/asis</foreign>. The
							various tribes selected suitable persons to perform them from among
							their members. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">gumnasiarxi/a</foreign> is
							practically identical with the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>lampadarxi/a</foreign>. It involved the provision of torches for
							the great torch-race at the festival of Hephaestus and the training of
							the runners. The expense was considerable; Isaeus classes the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">gumnasiarxi/a</foreign> with the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">xorhgi/a</foreign>, and puts the cost at twelve

						the Isthmus and to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia"
							>Olympia</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Another regular

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="133">
					<p>
						<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I will tell you the reason for this change of
						front. Last year and the year before our honest Agyrrhius here was chief
						contractor for the two per cent customs duties.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">Levied on all imports and exports at Peiraeus.</note> He
						farmed them for thirty talents, and the friends he meets under the
							poplar<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Apparently a well-known spot. It
							is not mentioned elsewhere.</note> all took shares with him. You know
						what they are like; it is my belief that they meet there for a double
						purpose: to be paid for not raising the bidding, and to take shares in taxes
						which have been knocked down cheap. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="134">
					<p>After making a profit of six talents, they saw what a gold-mine the business
						was; so they combined, gave rival bidders a percentage, and again offered
						thirty talents. There was no competition; so I went before the Council and
						outbid them, until I purchased the rights for thirty-six talents. I had
						ousted them. I then furnished you with sureties, collected the tax, and
						settled with the state. I did not lose by it, as my partners and I actually
						made a small profit. At the same time I stopped Agyrrhius and his friends
						from sharing six talents which belonged to you. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="135">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>They saw this themselves, and discussed the
						situation. “This fellow will not take any of the public money himself,” they
						argued, “and he will not let us take any either. He will be on the watch and
						stop our sharing what belongs to the state; and furthermore, if he catches
						any of us acting dishonestly, he will bring him into the public courts and
						ruin him. He must be got rid of at all costs.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="136">
					<p>The prosecution were bound to behave thus, gentlemen; but you must do the
						opposite: for I should be happy to see you with as many men as possible like
						myself and to see my accusers stamped out of existence, or at least
						confronted by those who will not countenance their activities. Such men
						should show themselves staunch and impartial champions of your interests,
						and they will be able to serve you well, if they are willing to do so. I for
						one promise you either to put a stop to the practices of the prosecution and
						render them better citizens, or to bring such of them as are guilty of
						criminal behaviour into court and have them punished. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="137">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The prosecution have also found grounds for
						attacking me in the fact that I am a merchant who owns ships. We are asked
						to believe that the only object of the gods in saving me from the dangers of
						the sea was, apparently, to let Cephisius put an end to me when I reached
							<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. No, gentlemen. I for
						one cannot believe that if the gods considered me guilty of an offence
						against them, they would have been disposed to spare me when they had me in
						a situation of the utmost peril—for when is man in greater peril than on a
						winter sea-passage? Are we to suppose that the gods had my person at their
						mercy on just such a voyage, that they had my life and my goods in their
						power, and that in spite of it they kept me safe? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="138">
					<p>Why, could they not have caused even my corpse to be denied due burial?
						Furthermore, it was war-time; the sea was infested with triremes and
						pirates, who took many a traveller prisoner, and after robbing him of his
						all, sent him to end his days in slavery. And there were foreign shores on
						which many a traveller had been wrecked, to be put to death after meeting
						with shameful indignities and maltreatment. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="139">
					<p>Is it conceivable that the gods saved me from perils of that nature, only to
						let themselves be championed by Cephisius, the biggest scoundrel in
							<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, whose citizen he
						claims to be when he is nothing of the kind, and whom every one of you
						sitting in this court knows too well to trust with any thing belonging to
						him? No, gentlemen; to my mind the dangers of a trial like the present are
						to be regarded as the work of man, and the dangers of the sea as the work of
						God. So if we must perforce speculate about the gods, I for one am sure that
						they would be moved to the deepest wrath and indignation to see those whom
						they had themselves preserved brought to destruction by mortal men. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="140">
					<p>There is yet another thing worth your consideration, gentlemen. At the moment
						the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> thinks that you
						have shown the greatest generosity and wisdom in devoting yourselves, not to
						revenge, but to the preservation of your city and the reuniting of its
						citizens. Many before now have suffered no less than we; but it is very
						rightly recognized that the peaceable settlement of differences requires
						generosity and self-control. Now it is acknowledged on all sides, by friend
						and foe alike, that you possess those gifts. So do not change your ways: do
						not hasten to rob <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> of the
						glory which she has gained thereby, or allow it to be supposed that you
						authorized your decree more by chance than by intention. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="141">
					<p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I beg you one and all, then, to hold towards
						me the feelings which you hold towards my ancestors, so that I may have the
						opportunity of imitating them. They rank, remember, among the most tireless
						and the greatest benefactors of our city; and foremost among the many
						motives which inspired them came devotion to your welfare and the hope that
						if they or any of their children were ever in danger or distress, they would
						find protection in your sympathy. You have good reason, indeed, for
						remembering them; </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="142">
					<p>for from the heroic deeds of your own forefathers <placeName

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="144">
					<p>Think, furthermore, what a citizen you will have in me, if you give me your
