                              indictment against any Athenian, nor vexed any man when he was
                              rendering account of his office<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The
                                    Athenian Constitution provided for rigid auditing of the

                                    and gave full opportunity to any citizen to bring charges
                                    against any act of their administration. Such opportunity might
                                    easily be used for malicious or blackmailing attack</note>; but
                              in all such matters I have, as I believe, shown myself a quiet and
                              modest man.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A quiet citizen, as
                                    distinguished from the professional political blackmailer,

                              when I saw that the city was being seriously injured by the defendant,
                              Timarchus, who, though disqualified by law, was speaking in your
                                    assemblies,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As the speech
                                    proceeds we shall see that Aeschines declares that Timarchus was
                                    guilty of immoral practices that disqualified him from speaking
                                    before the people.</note> and when I myself was made a victim of
                              his blackmailing attack—the nature of the attack I will show in the
                              course of my speech—</p>

                  <div n="2" type="section">
                        <p>I decided that it would be a most shameful thing if I failed to come to
                              the defence of the whole city and its laws, and to your defence and my
                              own; and knowing that he was liable to the accusations that you heard
                              read a moment ago by the clerk of the court, I instituted this suit,
                              challenging him to official scrutiny. Thus it appears,fellow citizens,
                              that what is so frequently said of public suits is no mistake, namely,
                              that very often private enmities correct public abuses.</p>

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You will see, then, that Timarchus cannot
                              blame the city for any part of this prosecution, nor can he blame the
                              laws, nor you, nor me, but only himself. For because of his shameful
                              private life the laws forbade him to speak before the people, laying
                              on him an injunction not difficult, in my opinion, to obey—nay, most
                              easy; and had he been wise, he need not have made his slanderous
                              attack upon me. I hope, therefore, that in this introduction I have
                              spoken as a quiet and modest citizen ought to speak.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="section">
                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I am aware, fellow citizens, that the
                              statement which I am about to make first is something that you will
                              undoubtedly have heard from other men on other occasions; but I think
                              the same thought is especially timely on this occasion, and from me.
                              It is acknowledged, namely, that there are in the world three forms of
                              government, autocracy, oligarchy, and democracy: autocracies and
                              oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of their lords,
                              but democratic states according to established laws.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="5" type="section">
                        <p>And be assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that
                              guard the person of the citizen and the constitution of the state,
                              whereas the despot and the oligarch find their protection in suspicion
                              and in armed guards. Men, therefore, who administer an oligarchy, or
                              any government based on inequality, must be on their guard against
                              those who attempt revolution by the law of force; but you, who have a
                              government based upon equality and law, must guard against those whose
                              words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only
                              will you be strong, when you cherish the laws, and when the
                              revolutionary attempts of lawless men shall have ceased.</p>

                        <p>And it behooves us, I think, not only when we are enacting laws, to
                              consider always how the laws that we make may be good and advantageous
                              to the democracy, but when once we have enacted them, it equally
                              behooves us, if all is to be well with the state, to obey the laws
                              that we have enacted, and to punish those who do not obey
                                    them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Consider, fellow citizens,
                              how much attention that ancient lawgiver, Solon, gave to morality, as

                        <p>First, you recall, they laid down laws to protect the morals of our
                              children, and they expressly prescribed what were to be the habits of
                              the freeborn boy, and how he was to be brought up; then they
                              legislated for the lads, and next for the other age-groups in
                              succession, including in their provision, not only private citizens,
                              but also the public men. And when they had inscribed these laws, they
                              gave them to you in trust, and made you their guardians.</p>

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it is my desire, in addressing you on
                              this occasion, to follow in my speech the same order which the
                              lawgiver followed in his laws. For you shall hear first a review of
                              the laws that have been laid down to govern the orderly conduct of
                              your children, then the laws concerning the lads, and next those
                              concerning the other ages in succession, including not only private
                              citizens, but the public men as well. For so, I think, my argument
                              will most easily be followed. And at the same time I wish, fellow
                              citizens, first to describe to you in detail the laws of the state,
                              and then in contrast with the laws to examine the character and habits
                              of Timarchus. For you will find that the life he has lived has been
                              contrary to all the laws.</p>

                              the teachers. Although the very livelihood of these men, to whom we
                              necessarily entrust our own children, depends on their good character,
                              while the opposite conduct on their part would mean poverty, yet it is
                              plain that the lawgiver distrusts them; for he expressly prescribes,
                              first, at what time of day the free-born boy is to go to the
                              school-room; next, how many other boys may go there with him, and when
                              he is to go home.</p>

                              the doors before sunset; for he is exceeding suspicious of their being
                              alone with a boy, or in the dark with him. He prescribes what children
                              are to be admitted as, pupils, and their age at admission. He provides
                              for a public official who shall superintend them, and for the
                              oversight of slave-attendants of school-boys. He regulates the
                              festivals of the Muses in the school-rooms, and of Hermes in the
                              wrestling-schools. Finally, he regulates the companionships that the
                              boys may form at school, and their cyclic dances.<note resp="Loeb"

                              down laws regarding crimes which, great as they undoubtedly are, do
                              actually occur, I believe, in the city. For the very fact that certain
                              unbecoming things were being done was the reason for the enactment of
                              these laws by the men of old. At any rate the law says explicitly: if
                              any boy is let out for hire as a prostitute, whether it be by father
                              or brother or uncle or guardian, or by any one else who has control of
                              him, prosecution is not to he against the boy himself, but against the
                              man who let him out for hire and the man who hired him; against the
                              one because he let him out for hire, and against the other, it says,
                              because he hired him. And the law has made the penalties for both
                              offenders the same. Moreover the law frees a son, when he has become a
                              man, from all obligation to support or to furnish a home to a father
                              by whom he has been hired out for prostitution; but when the father is
                              dead, the son is to bury him and perform the other customary
                              rites.</p>

                              For it was not for the slaves that the lawgiver was concerned, but he
                              wished to accustom you to keep a long distance away from the crime of
                              outraging free men, and so he added the prohibition against the
                              outraging even of slaves. In a word, he was convinced that in a
                              democracy that man is unfit for citizenship who outrages any person

                              to make this obligatory upon them, since he cannot call on each one of
                              them by name, he comprehends them all under the designation of the
                              age-group as a whole, invites them to the platform, and urges them to
                              address the people. At the same time he teaches the younger men to
                              respect their elders, to yield precedence to them in every act, and to
                              honor that old age to which we shall all come if our lives are

                              his arm inside his cloak. Now this is a reminiscence, fellow citizens,

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Fellow citizens, there is one Misgolas,
                              son of Naucrates, of the deme Collytus, a man otherwise honorable, and
                              beyond reproach save in this, that he is bent on that sort of thing
                              like one possessed, and is accustomed always to have about him singers
                              or cithara-players. I say this, not from any liking for indecent talk,
                              but that you may know what sort of man Misgolas is. Now this Misgolas,
                              perceiving Timarchus' motive in staying at the house of the physician,
                              paid him a sum of money in advance and caused him to change his
                              lodgings, and got him into his own home; for Timarchus was well
                              developed, young, and lewd, just the person for the thing that
                              Misgolas wanted to do, and Timarchus wanted to have done.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="42" type="section">
                        <p>Timarchus did not hesitate, but submitted to it all, though he had income
                              to satisfy all reasonable desires. For his father had left him a very
                              large property, which he has squandered, as I will show in the course
                              of my speech. But he behaved as he did because he was a slave to the
                              most shameful lusts, to gluttony and extravagance at table, to
                              flute-girls and harlots, to dice, and to all those other things no one
                              of which ought to have the mastery over a man who is well-born and
                              free. And this wretch was not ashamed to abandon his father's house
                              and live with Misgolas, a man who was not a friend of his father's,
                              nor a person of his own age, but a stranger, and older than himself, a
                              man who knew no restraint in such matters, while Timarchus himself was
                              in the bloom of youth.</p>

                              Timarchus did in those days was one which I wish to relate to you. The
                              occasion was the procession at the City Dionysia. Misgolas, who had
                              taken possession of him, and Phaedrus, son of Callias, of the deme
                              Sphettus, were to march in the procession together. Now Timarchus here
                              had agreed to join them in the procession, but they were busy with
                              their general preparations, and he failed to come back. Misgolas,
                              provoked at the thing, proceeded to make search for him in company
                              with Phaedrus. They got word of him and found him at lunch with some
                              foreigners in a lodging-house. Misgolas and Phaedrus threatened the
                              foreigners and ordered them to follow straight to the lock-up for
                              having corrupted a free youth. The foreigners were so scared that they
                              dropped everything and ran away as fast as they could go.</p>

                              very glad that the suit that I am prosecuting is against a man not
                              unknown to you, and known for no other thing than precisely that
                              practice as to which you are going to render your verdict. For in the

                              notorious, I think it is no very difficult matter to conduct the
                              prosecution, for one has only to appeal to the recollection of his
                              hearers.</p>

                              we are in court, and so I have drafted an affidavit for Misgolas, true
                              and not indelicate in phrasing, as I flatter myself. For I do not set
                              down the actual name of the thing that Misgolas used to do to him, nor
                              have I written anything else that would legally incriminate a man who
                              has testified to the truth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is,
                                    Misgolas can testify to the truth of the affidavit without
                                    thereby testifying to any criminal act of his own.</note> But I
                              have set down what will be no news for you to hear, and will involve
                              the witness in no danger nor disgrace.</p>

                              forward here and testify to the truth, he will be doing what is right;
                              but if he prefers to refuse the summons rather than testify to the
                              truth, the whole business will be made clear to you. For if the man
                              who did the thing is going to be ashamed of it and choose to pay a
                              thousand drachmas into the treasury rather than show his face before

                              been done is to be a speaker in your assembly, then wise indeed was

                              shameless course, denial of the truth under oath, as a grateful return
                              to Timarchus, and a demonstration to the rest of them that he well
                              knows how to help cover up such conduct, in the first place he will
                              damage himself, and in the second place he will gain nothing by it.
                              For I have prepared another affidavit for those who know that this man
                              Timarchus left his father's house and lived with Misgolas, though it
                              is a difficult thing, no doubt, that I am undertaking. For I have to
                              present as my witnesses, not friends of mine nor enemies of theirs,
                              nor those who are strangers to both of us, but their friends. </p>

                              reputation which he owes to no act of mine, but to his own conduct.
                              For the life of a virtuous man ought to be so clean that it will not

                              take him to his own house, thinking, doubtless, that here was a man of

                              shows an openmindedness and a spirit of accommodation that are truly

                              Hegesandrus, who kept Timarchus, had married an heiress. So long as
                              her inheritance held out, and the money that Hegesandrus had brought
                              back with him from his voyage with Timomachus, they lived in all
                              luxury and lewdness. But when these resources had been wasted and
                              gambled away and eaten up, and this defendant had lost his youthful
                              charm, and, as you would expect, no one would any longer give him
                              anything, while his lewd and depraved nature constantly craved the
                              same indulgences, and with excessive incontinence kept making demand

                              one may so say, he also drank it up! He sold one piece of property
                              after another, not for what it was worth—he couldn't wait for a higher
                              offer nor even for the bare value, but let it go for what it would
                              fetch on the instant, so urgently did he hasten to gratify his

                              well-to-do I will tell you. There were three brothers in this family,

                              blind. Of these, Eupolemus was the first to die, before the estate had
                              been divided; next, Arizelus, the father of Timarchus. So long as
                              Arizelus lived, he managed the whole estate, because of the ill-health
                              of Arignotus and the trouble with his eyes, and because Eupolemus was
                              dead. By agreement with Arignotus he regularly gave him a sum of money

                              the estate. He gave nothing to Arignotus for his support, but was

                              to my words. For he is amazed, he says, if you do not all remember
                              that every single year the senate farms out the tax on prostitutes,
                              and that the men who buy this tax do not guess, but know precisely,
                              who they are that follow this profession. When, therefore, I have
                              dared to bring impeachment against Timarchus for having prostituted
                              himself, in order that I may deprive him of the right to address the
                              people in assembly, Demosthenes says that the very act complained of
                              calls, not for an accuser's arraignment, but for the testimony of the
                              tax-gatherer who collected this tax from Timarchus.</p>

                              having done nothing shameful. Come, dare to look the jury in the face
                              and say that which a decent man ought to say of his youth: “Fellow

                              have spent my time is no secret to you, and you see me with you in

                              of a kind-hearted and generous soul; but to hire for money and to
                              indulge in licentiousness is the act of a man who is wanton and
                              ill-bred. And whereas it is an honor to be the object of a pure love,
                              I declare that he who has played the prostitute by inducement of wages
                              is disgraced. How wide indeed is the distinction between these two
                              acts and how great the difference, I will try to show you in what I

                        <p> your fathers, when they were laying down laws to regulate the habits of
                              men and those acts that inevitably flow from human nature, forbade
                              slaves to do those things which they thought ought to be done by free
                              men. “A slave,” says the law, “shall not take exercise or anoint
                              himself in the wrestling-schools.” It did not go on to add, “But the
                              free man shall anoint himself and take exercise;” for when, seeing the
                              good that comes from gymnastics, the lawgivers forbade slaves to take
                              part, they thought that in prohibiting them they were by the same
                              words inviting the free. </p>

                        <p> again, the same lawgiver said, “A slave shall not be the lover of a free

                              public lash.” But the free man was not forbidden to love a boy, and
                              associate with him, and follow after him, nor did the lawgiver think
                              that harm came to the boy thereby, but rather that such a thing was a
                              testimony to his chastity. But, I think, so long as the boy is not his
                              own master and is as yet unable to discern who is a genuine friend,
                              and who is not, the law teaches the lover self-control, and makes him
                              defer the words of friendship till the other is older and has reached
                              years of discretion; but to follow after the boy and to watch over him
                              the lawgiver regarded as the best possible safeguard and protection
                              for chastity. </p>

                              which the poet expresses. He says that before now he has been made
                              judge of many cases, as you today are jurors; and he says that he
                              makes his decisions, not from what the witnesses say, but from the
                              habits and associations of the accused; he looks at this, how the man
                              who is on trial conducts his daily life, and in what manner he
                              administers his own house, believing that in like manner he will
                              administer the affairs of the state also; and he looks to see with
                              whom he likes to associate. And, finally, he does not hesitate to
                              express the opinion that a man is like those whose “company he loves
                              to keep.” It is right, therefore, that in judging Timarchus you follow
                              the reasoning of Euripides. </p>

                              persons were referred to as “big Timarchian prostitutes,” nobody
                              thought of it as aimed at the youth, but, one and all, as meant for
                              you, so unquestioned is your title to the practice. Again, Anticles,

                              see, Timarchus, you are not to be permitted to desert the company

                              concerning prostitution; in them the lawgiver has nowhere made mention

                              person had defiled himself, but in comprehensive terms, no matter how
                              the deed is done, he commands that the man who did it shall take no
                              part in public affairs. And he is right; for the man who in his youth
                              was led by shameful indulgence to surrender honorable ambition, that
                              man, he believed, ought not in later life to be possessed of the

                              because we do not trust one another, the object being that the party
                              who has not violated the written terms may receive satisfaction by
                              verdict of the courts from the one who has. If, therefore, this
                              business needs the help of the courts, those who have served as
                              prostitutes by contract, in case they are wronged, have left them,

                        <p> I will explain to you the reason. It is because you enact the laws with
                              no other object than justice, not moved by unrighteous gain, or by
                              either partiality or animosity, looking solely to what is just and for
                              the common good. And because you are, as I think, naturally, more
                              clever than other men, it is not surprising that you pass most
                              excellent laws. But in the meetings of the assembly and in the courts,
                              you oftentimes lose all hold of the discussion of the matter in hand,
                              and are led away by deceit and trickery; and you admit into your cases
                              at law a custom that is utterly unjust, for you allow the defendants
                              to bring counter accusations against the complainants. </p>

                              entirely, and leave the court-room without having received
                              satisfaction from either party—not from the complainant, for you are
                              given no opportunity to vote with reference to him, and not from the
                              defendant, for by his extraneous charges he has brushed aside the

                              the official scrutiny of public speakers is not a trivial law, but a
                              most excellent one; and we must expect that the boys and young men
                              will ask the members of their families how the case was decided. </p>
