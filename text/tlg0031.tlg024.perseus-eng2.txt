The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;

for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:

Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children
walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.

Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new
commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one
another.

This is love, that we should walk according to his
commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
beginning, that you should walk in it.

For many deceivers have
gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came
in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.

Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished,
but that we receive a full reward.

Whoever transgresses and
doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who
remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.

If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't
receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,

for he who
welcomes him participates in his evil works.

Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so
with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to
face, that our joy may be made full.

The children of your chosen
sister greet you. Amen.
