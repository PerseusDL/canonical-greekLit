I will sing of well-founded Earth, mother of all, eldest of all beings. She feeds all
 creatures that are in the world, all that go upon the goodly land, and all that are in the
 paths of the seas, and all that fly: all these are fed of her store.

Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children and blessed in their
 harvests, and to you it belongs to give means of life to mortal men and to take it away.
 Happy is the man whom you delight to honor! He has all things abundantly: his fruitful land
 is laden with corn, his pastures are covered

with cattle, and his house is filled with good things. Such men rule orderly in
 their cities of fair women: great riches and wealth follow them: their sons exult with
 ever-fresh delight, and their daughters in flower-laden bands

play and skip merrily over the soft flowers of the field. Thus is it with those whom
 you honor O holy goddess, bountiful spirit. Hail, Mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven;
 freely bestow upon me for this my song substance that cheers the heart! And now I will
 remember you and another song also.
