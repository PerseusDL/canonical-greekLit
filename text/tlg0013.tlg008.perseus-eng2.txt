Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart,
 shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty
 with the spear, O defence of Olympus , father of
 warlike Victory, ally of Themis,

stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptred King of
 manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through
 the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven;
 hear me, helper of men, giver of dauntless youth!

Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life, and strength of war, that I may be
 able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my
 soul. Restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread

the ways of blood-curdling strife. Rather, O blessed one, give you me boldness to
 abide within the harmless laws of peace, avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends
 of death.
