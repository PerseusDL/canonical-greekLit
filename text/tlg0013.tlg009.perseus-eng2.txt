Muse, sing of Artemis, sister of the Far-shooter, the virgin who delights in arrows,
 who was fostered with Apollo. She waters her horses from Meles deep in reeds, and swiftly
 drives her all-golden chariot through Smyrna

to vine-clad Claros where Apollo, god of the silver bow, sits waiting for the
 far-shooting goddess who delights in arrows. And so hail to you, Artemis, in my song and to
 all goddesses as well. Of you first I sing and with you I begin; now that I have begun with
 you, I will turn to another song.
