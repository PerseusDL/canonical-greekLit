I Prithee, clear-voiced Muse, daughter of mighty Zeus, sing of the mother of all gods
 and men. She is well-pleased with the sound of rattles and of timbrels, with the voice of
 flutes and the outcry of wolves and bright-eyed lions,

with echoing hills and wooded coombes. And so hail to you in my song and to all
 goddesses as well!
