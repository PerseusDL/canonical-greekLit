In Surrye, not fer fro the Ryvere Eufrate, is a
Cytee that Holy highte and holy is in sothe, for it
is of Iuno Assurien. Yit I wene that the cyteene
hadde not this name atte firste, whan that it was
founded, but of olden tyme it was other, and after,”
whan here servys of the Goddesse wex gret, it was their
chaunged to this. Touching this cytee I purpos
me to seyn alle that is in it, and I schalle speke of
the customes that thei folwen in here rytes, and the
feste dayes that thei kepen, and the sacrifises that
thei perfourmen. And I schalle reherce alle the
tales that men tellen of hem that establisschede the
holy place, and how that the temple was bylded.
And I that write am Assurien, and of that that I
devyse you, some partie saughe I with mine owne
eyen, and some partie I lerned be informacioun fro _
the prestes, that is to seyn, tho thynges that I
descryve that weren beforn min owne tyme.

Of alle peples whereof wee knowen, Egyptyens
weren firste, as men seyn, for to taken conceyte of




 

Goddes, and to stablisschen holy places and closes,
and to apoynten feste dayes. And thei firste knewen
holy names and maden holy tales. But no long
tyme after, Assuryens herden rumour and speche
of Egyptyens as touching to goddes, and rereden
seyntuaryes and temples, in the whiche thei lette
putten ymages and setten symulacres.

But auncientlye amonges Egyptyens weren temples withouten symulacres. And in Surrye ben temples almost
als olde as tho in Egypte, of the whiche I have seen
the moste, and namely the temple of Hercules in
Tyre, not that Hercules that Grekes preysen in here
songes, but that oon wherof I speke is moche elder,
and is Tyres patroun.

In Phenicye is another grete temple that men of
Sidon kepen. Thei seyn, it is of Astarte, and
Astarte, I trowe, is Luna the Mone. But oon of
the prestes tolde me, it belongeth to Europe, Cadmus
suster. Sche was Agenor the Kinges daughter ;
and after that sche vanisched, Phenicyens yafen
hir that temple for worschipe and maden a storie
of hir, that sithe sche was fair, love coveytede hir,
and transformed his lyknesse in to a bole, and than
ravissched hir awey and bar hir on his bac to Crete.
That same storie I herde of othere Phenicyens also ;





 

and the moneye that Sidonyes usen hath Europe
sittynge on the bole that is Iove. Natheles wille
thei not avowen that the temple is of Europe.

And Phenicyens han an other maner servys, not
Assuryen but Egyptyen, that cam from Elyople into
Phenicye. I have not seen it, but it also is gret and
auncien.

But I saughe in Byblos a gret temple of Venus of
Byblos, wherin thei perfourmen cerimonyes in mynde
of Adoon; and I lernede tho cerimonyes. Thei
seyn that the dede that was don to Adoon be the
bore befell in here londe, and for memorie of that
myschaunce everyche yeer thei beten here brestes
and sorwen and perfourmen tho cerimonyes, makynge gret doel thorgh that contree. And whan mournthe betynge and the wepynge is atte ende, first thei
maken offringes to Adoon, as though he were ded;
and than, on the morwe, thei fablen that he is quick,
and fecchen him forth in to the eyr, and lette air





 

schaven here hedes as don Egyptyens whan that
Apis is ded. And alle wommen that wole not lette
schaven hem, thei payen this penance, that upon
o day thei profren hem for achat of here beautee ;
but the merkat is open to straungers alle only, and
the huyr becometh an offring to Venus.

Natheles, ther ben somme men of Byblos that
seyn Osiris of Egypte lyeth enterred amonges hem,
and the doel and the cerimonyes ben alle made in
mynde of Osiris in stede of Adoon. And I schalle
seye you the cause whi this semeth hem trewe.
Eech yeer an heed cometh from Egypte to Byblos, heaa
that passeth the see betwene in seven iorneyes, and the
windes dryven it, be governaunce of the Goddes,
and it torneth not asyde in no wyse but cometh all
only to Byblos. And this is hoolyche merveylle. whoty
It befalleth everyche yere, and befel that tyme that
I was in Byblos, and I saughe the heed, that is of
Byblos.

And in the londe of Byblos is arf other merveylle,
a Ryvere goynge out of the Mount Libanon in to the
See, the which is cleped Adoon. Everyche yeer it
is bebledde and leseth his kyndely hewe, and whan natural
it falleth in to the See, it maketh mochel therof
rede; and so it betokneth the doel to hem of
Byblos. For they seyn that in tho dayes Adoon
is ywounded up Libanon, and his blod that cometh
into the water chaungeth the ryvere and yeveth the
streme his name. Thus seyn lewed folk. But I
trowe that a man of Byblos spak sothe that devysed
me an other cause of the chaunge, seyinge: “The
Flom Adoon, o straunger, renneth thorgh Libanon,
and erthe of Libanon is right broun. Therfore whan
roughe windes that arysen in tho dayes beren the
erthe to the ryvere, the erthe, that is ful rody,
maketh him blody. So of this chaunge nys not the
blod, as they seyn, the resoun, but the lond.” He
of Byblos devysed me thus; but and al it so be that
he spak trewely, yit to me it semeth passing
merveyllous that the wind aryseth at the righte
tyme.

Also, I went up on Libanon fro Byblos, oon
iorneye, be cause I lernede that ther was an old



 

seyntuarye of Venus that Cinyras founded; and I
saughe the temple, and it was old. 
Thise ben the olde and grete seyntuaryes in
Surrye.

But of hem alle, as I wene, is non gretter
than tho in the Holy Cytee, ne non other temple
mo blessed, ne non other lond holier. Costevouse costly
werkes ben therinne, and aunciene offringes, and
manye merveylles, and symulacres in lyknesse of
goddes. Also, the goddes ben apertely reveled unto
hem; for here symulacres sweten and meven and
prophecyen, and ofte tymes hath ben schowtynge
in the temple whan the holy place was under lokke,
and many han herde. Certes, in richesse it is first
amonges alle that I knowe; for thider cometh moche
tresor from Arabye and Phenicye and Babiloyne,
and moche fro Cappadocye, and som Cilicyens
bryngen, and som Assuryens. And I saughe what
hath ben prively put up in the temple, many robes
and other thinges that have ben chosen out as
silver outher gold. And of festes and solempnytees
noon other folk in the world hath apoynted so
many.

Whan I asked how many yeres the seyntuarye
hadde dured, and who thei wenden that here supposed
Goddesse were, manye stories weren tolde, both



 

prestes lore and lewede folkes, and verraye fables;
and some weren outlandissche, but othere somme
acordeden to hem of Grece. Alle thise seyinges
schalle reherce, but I beleve hem not in no kynde.

The more partie seyn, Deucalioun, the Scythe, 
founded the seyntuarye—that Deucalioun in the
tyme thereof the grete Flode befel. Of Deucalioun
Ihave herd a tale amonges Grekes, that thei tellen
in mynde of him; and the storie is of this maner
kynde. 

 
This generacioun, the men of now a dayes, nas not
the firste, but that firste generacioun al perissched,
and thise ben of the seconde generacioun that cam
of Deucalioun and multiplyed eftsones. Of tho
firste men, thei seyn that thei were right felonouse
and didde wikkede dedis, for thei ne kepten not non
othes, ne herberweden no straungers, ne receyveden harno fugityves; and for that skylle the grete tribu- cause
lacioun cam upon hem. Anon the erthe sent forthe
moche water and grete reynes were made and the
ryveres flowede gretli and the see wex wondur high,
in to tyme that alle thinges weren chaunged to water
and alle men weren dede, outtaken Deucalioun that
was laft unto the seconde generacioun for his gode
conseil and his gode werkes. And his deliveraunce
cam in this wyse. In to a gret arke that he hadde he
putte his children and his wyves, and thanne entrede,
and at entrynge ther camen to him swyn and hors
and lyouns kynd and serpentes and alle bestes that



 

lyven on erthe, two and two. And he resceyvede as
hem alle, and thei diden him non harm, but betwene
hem was great charitee fro the goddes, and in oon;
arke thei alle seyleden whyl the water prevayled.
So seyn Grekes of Deucalioun.

But of that that sewede, men of the Holy Cytee sotiowed
tellen a tale that is worthy of gret merveylle, how
that in here londe opnede a huge hole and resceyvede
alle the water; and whan this happed, Deucalioun
leet maken awteres and leet bylden over the hole a atars
temple halowed to Iuno. I saughe the hole, that is
benethe the temple, a right lityl oon. If whilom it
was gret and now is become suche as it is, I wot
neer, but that I saughe is smal. 

 
In tokene of that storie thei don thus. Twyes
eech yeer water cometh fro the See in to the temple.
And not prestes only bryngen it, but al Surrye and
Arabye; and fro beyonden Eufrate gon manye men
to the See and bryngen alle watre, that anon thei
scheden out in the temple, and thanne it goth
adoun in to that hole; and al be it that the hole is
smal, natheles it taketh inne gret plentee of water.
And in doynge thus thei seyn that Deucalioun made
suche ordeynaunce for the seyntuarye in memorie of
that tribulacioun and that benefice. a





 

Now that is the olde aunciene storie amonges
hem touching to the temple.

But othere men ,
trowen that Semiramys of Babyloyne, of the which
sothely ben manye werkes in Asye, sche made this
foundacioun, and not for Iuno but for hir owne
Moder, that hadde to name Derketoun. . And I
beheld the schap of Derketoun in Phenicye, a
straunge merveylle, halfundel womman, but the
tothere half, wel fro thighes to feet, streccheth out
in a fissches tayl. . But the ymage in the Holy
Cytee is hoolyche woman, and the tokenes of here
seyinge ben not right certeyn. Thei leven fissches
holy thynge, and thei ne touchen fissche never; and




 

though of othere foules thei eten alle, the dowve
thei ne eten not, but sche is holy, as thei wenen. 
And thise thinges ben don, thei trowen, be cause of
Derketoun and Semiramys, the oon for that Derketoun hath schap of a fissche, and the tother
because that atte laste Semiramys tornede to a
dowve. But to me, that the temple was bylded of
Semiramys peraventure may I graunte; but that it
longeth to Derketoun I ne leve not in no kynde. 
For amonges somme peples of Egypte thei ne eten
not fissche, and that is not-don for no favour to
Derketoun.

Ther is also an other holy storie that I herde from a
wys man, how that the goddesse is Cibella and the
servys founded of Attis. Attis was a Lydien of
kynde, that first leet teche the ceremonyes that
longen to Cibella. And alle rytes that Phrygiens and
Lydiens and Samothracyens perfourmen, tho rytes
lerneden thei of Attis. For whan Cibella gelt him,
he cessed to lede the lyf of a man, but chaunged
to femele schappe, and did on wommenes clothynge,
and goynge to every londe perfourmed ceremonyes
and reherced what betyd him and preysed Cibella
in songes. Ther with alle cam he to Surrye, and for
als moche as the peple beyonden Eufrate resceyvede






 

him not, ne his cerimonyes nouther, he founded the
seyntuarye in this place. And for a signe thereof,
the goddesse for the most partie ressembleth Cibella,
for lyouns drawen hir and sche holt a timbre and
bereth tours on hir hede, right as Lydiens formen
Cibella. Also he spak of Galles that ben in the
temple, seyinge that Galles gelden hem and counterfeten Attis not at alle for no worschipe of luno but
for worschipe of Cibella. 
 

 
But after myn avis, al be it that this is wel
semynge, it is not trewe, for I have herde an other
cause whi thei gelden hem that is a gret dele mo to
beleven.

Me liketh what men seyn of the seyntuarye
that acorden fulle wel to hem of Grece,that demen the
goddesse Iuno and the seyntuarye mad of Bachus,
Semeles sone. For withouten doubte Bachus cam
to Surrye in that passage in the whiche he wente to
Ethiope. And in the temple ben manye tokenes of
Bachus foundour, as namely foreyne garnements and
precious stones of Ynde and olifauntes hornes, that
Bachus broght from Ethiope. And two yerdes, or
pileres, stont in the entree, passynge highe, on the
whiche is writen this scripture : “I Bachus presentede


 

thise yerdes to Iuno my step moder.” Now to
me this sufficeth, natheles I schalle seye you another
thing that is in the temple, that longeth to ceremonyes of Bachus. Men of Grece formen yerdes
for worschipe of Bachus that beren on hem litylle
men made of wode that han grete membres, the
whiche men thei nempnen Popets. And in the
temple ther is this same thing; on the righte syde
sitt a lityl man of brasse that hath a gret membre.

So seyn thei of the foundours of the holy place.
And now I schalle speke of the temple, wher that it
was sett and who that leet bylden it. Men seyn,
the temple that stont now is not that oon the
whiche was bylded atte firste, but that was beten
doun sithen som tyme, and the temple that stont
now is the werk of Stratonice, wyf to the Kyng
of Assurye. 

 
I trowe, this is thilke Stratonice that hir step
sone lovede, that was betraysed by the phisicyens 
invencioun, For whan the infortune oppressed him,






 

he mighte not susteyne the mysese that semede
him schamful, and so he stille (quietly) felle into syknesse,
and lay withouten ony peyne; and his hewe
chaunged outerly, and his bodye feblede eech
day. But whan the phisicyen saughe that he
was wayk withouten pleyne cause, he iugged that
the syknesse was love. For of derne (secret) love ther
ben manye signes, as waike eyen, voyce, hewe,
teeres. And whan that he perceyved it, he did
thus. With his righte honde he kepte the yonge
mannes herte, and thanne he sent after all tho that
weren in the house. And whan everyche of the
othere entrede, this was in gret ese, but whan his
step moder cam, he chaunged his hewe and swatte
and schoke and his herte stirte (leaped). Thise thinges
scheweden his love to, the phisicyen, that helede
him thus.

After that he hadde clepede the yonge
mannes fader, that was sor adrad, “This syknesse,”
quod he, “wherof thy child is wayk nis not syknesse
but synne, for verrayly he soffreth of no peyn, but
of love and wodenesse (frenzy). And he coveyteth that
he may not have in no wyse, lovynge my wyf
that I wil not forgon.” So that oon lyde in gyle.
And anon that other besoghte him: “Be thy
conynge and thy phisik, destroie me not my sone ;
for he is not in this cas of his owne wille but hath
the syknesse mawgree himself. Therfore do thou not
thorghe despyt make sorwe in alle the rewme, ne
thou that art phisicyen brynge manslaughtre in to
phisik.” Thus preyde he, al unwar. And_ that
oon answerde: “Thou forthrest wykked dedis,
revynge me from my mariage and destreyninge a
pore leche. What woldestow thiself have don and
he coveytede thy wyf, thou that axest suche bones (boons)

 

of me?” Therwith he replyede that he him self
wolde never have ben ialous over his wyf ne grucched (begrudged)
his sone deliveraunce, if so be he hadde coveyted his
step moder; for it was not the lyke infortune to
lese awyfasasone. _ And whan the phisicien herde
that, “Wherfore than,” quod he, “dostow beseche
me? Parfey, he loveth thy wyf, and alle that I
seyde was fausse!” Than was the fader overcomen, and yold bothe wyf and rewme (realm) to his sone,
and goyinge himself to the contree of Babyloyne leet
make a cytee nyghe Eufrate that was cleped after
his owne name, ther as his dethe befel. Thus did
the phisicien bothe knowe and hele love.

Now, I seye you, why] yit that Stratonice duellede
with her formere housbond, hir mette a dreme how
that Iuno bade hir to bylde the temple for hir in the
Holy Cytee, and if sche sholde not obeye, sche
manaced hir with manye harmes. Atte first, sche
ne took no fors (note) of it ; but after, whan a grete sykness
hent hir, sche told the dreme to hir housbond and
enforced hir to apayen (appease) Iuno, and behight (promised) to bylde
the temple. Anon sche becam hool, and thanne hir
housbond wolde sende hir to the Holy Cytee, and
with hir a gret tresor and a gret hoost, some for to
bylden and other some for here seurtee. Therfore
he sompned oon of his frendes, a right fayr yong man




 

that highte Combabe, and seyde: “For thou art
noble, Daun Combabe, I love thee most of alle mine
frendes, and I preyse thee gretli for thy coninge and
for thy gode wille to me, that thou hast discovered
beforn. And now me nedeth of grete feyth,
wherfore I wole that thou folwe my wyf, for to
acomplisshe the werke in my name, and to perfourme the sacrifises, and to reule the hoost ; and
whan thou retornest thou schalt gete highe worschipe
fro me.”
Therwith anon Combabe gan preye and beseche
him ful besily that he scholde not send him forth ne
betaken (entrust) him nouther that tresor, that was moche to en:rust
gret for him, ne his wyf, ne the holy werk. For he
was adrad lest that ialousie scholde assayle him
afterwardes as touching to Stratonice, that he moste
lede forthe allone.

But sithe the kyng wolde not
herknen in no kynde, he assayde an other requeste,
for to graunte him seven dayes space, and than sende
him forth, whan he hadde don a thing thereof he
hadde most nede. And whan he obteyned this
bone lightely, he wente to his owne house and caste
himself adoun and pleyned right so: ‘Allas wrecche,
what have I to don with this feythe, what have I to
don with this viage, whereof I seighe now the ende ?
I am yong, and schal folwen a fayre womman. This
schalle be gret meschief to me, but if I putte awey



 

al cause of evylle ; therfore most I perfourme a gret
dede that schal hele me of alle fere.”
 

 
Thus he seyde, and thanne he marrede him self ;
and whan he hadde kutte offe his genitours he put
hem into a lityl pot, and bawme with alle, and hony
and othere thinges of swete smelle. Thanne he
selede it with a signet that he bar, and helede his
wounde. And after, whan him wel semede for to
don iorneye, goynge to the kyng, beforn manye men
that ther weren he toke (gave) him the pot, seyinge thus :
“O sire, this grete tresor I was wont for to kepe
prevely, and I lovede it wel ; but now, for als moche
as I schal gon a fer weye, I wole betaken it to you.
Kepeth it sikkerly ; for this to me is bettre than
gold, this to me is als dereworth as my lyf. Whan
I retorne, I schal bere it home ayen saf and sound.”
So the kyng resceyved it and seelede it with an
other signet and bad his stywardes for to kepen it
curyously.

Than Combabe mad his weye safly ; and whan thei
were comen to the Holy Cytee thei gan bylde the
temple besily, and thei spenten three yeres in the werk,
and in tho yeres that Combabe dredde befel. For
in companyinge with him a gret whyl Stratonice
began for to love him, and thanne sche wex right
wode over him. Men of the Holy Cytee seyn that
Iuno was voluntarie cause thereof, to the entente
that Combabes godeness scholde not lye hidde and
Stratonice scholde ben punissched be cause that
sche ne behight not the temple buxomly (readily).

Atte firste sche was mesurable and hyd hir
maladye; but whan as hir miseyse becam to gret
for pees, sche sorwede openly and wepte everyche
day, and cryde on the name of Combabe, and Com-


 

babe was alle the worlde to hir. And fynally, for
sche ne mighte not susteyne suche adversitee, sche
soughte a wel semynge peticioun. Now sche was
war for to avowen hir love to ony other, yit sche
hadde scham for to assayen ought hirself. _Therfore
sche bethoghte hir of this devys, that sche scholde
make hirself dronke with wyn and thanne speke
with him ; for what tyme wyn cometh inne, boldness
of speche cometh inne with alle, and disconfiture
nys not over schamful, but all that is don passeth
into foryetynge (forgetfulness).
 

 
Right as hir thoghte, right so sche didde. For
aftre mete sche wente to the house wherin Combabe
was logged, and besoghte him and embraced his
knees and avowed hir love. But he resceyved hir
wordes rudeliche, and wolde not assente to the dede,
and reprevede hir of dronkenesse. But whan sche
made manace to don hirself som gret harm, thanne
for fere he told hir alle the storie and descryved al
his owne cas and discovered his doynge. And
whan Stratonice saughe that hir ne thoghte never
fulness
to seen, sche stente of (desisted from) hir wodenesse, yit sche forgat desisted
not at alle of hir love, but companyed with him “™
alle weyes and in that gyse solacede the love, therin
sche mighte not speden. That maner love abydeth
yit in the Holy Cytee, and is mad now a dayes;
wommen coveyten Galles and Galles wexen wode
for love of wommen; natheles is no man ialous, but
hem thenketh this thing right holy.

Now that that had happened in the Holy Cytee
touching Stratonice scaped not the kyng in no
kynde, but manye that retorneden acuseden hem
and reherceden here doynges; wherfore the kyng
was grevously troubled and sompnede Combabe fro


 

the werk or it was finissched. Othere men seyn not
sooth, that whan Stratonice fayled of hir purpos,
sche hir self wroot lettres to hir housbond and
acused Combabe, blamynge him of assayinge _hir.
Right as men of Grece seyn of Steneboye and of
Fedre Cnossien, right so seyn Assuriens of Stratonice. Now to me, I ne beleve not that Steneboye
dide no suche thing, ne Fedre nouther, if Fedre
trewely lovede Ypolite. But lat tho thinges worth (go)
right as thei weren.

Whan the tidinges were come to the Holy Cytee,
and Combabe lernede the acusaccioun, he wente
boldely, for because he had laft his answere-at home.
And at arryvinge, anon the kyng bond him and
kepte him in prisoun; and after, whan his frendes
there weren that there weren beforn, whan Combabe
was sent forth, he ladde him in presence and began
for to blamen him, reprevinge him of avowtrie and
vileinye ; and in sore bitternesse of herte he putte
him in remembraunce of feythe and frendschipe,
seyinge that Combabe didde three fold wrong be cause
he was avowtrer and brak feyth and synned ayeyns
the goddesse in whoos servys that he so wroughte.
And manye stode forth and made witnessing that
thei sanghen hem companye togider openly. And
atte laste alle demeden that Combabe scholde dye
right anon, for his dedis disserveden dethe.

In this tyme he stondynge seyde noght. But
whan thei wolde leden him to his dethe, he spak,



 

and requered that tresor, seyinge, he wolde sleen
him, not for no vileinye ne avowtrie, but coveytinge
tho thinges that in goynge he hadde betoken him.
Thanne the kyng called his styward and bad him ~
brynge what hadde ben goven him for to kepe; and
whan he broght it, Combabe brak the seel and
schewed what was with inne and what he himself
hadde soffred. And he seyde: “O Kyng, for I was
adrad of this whan ye wolde sende me on this weye,
therfore me was loth to gon; and whan ye gretly constreyned me, I wroghte this maner dede, that is gode
for my maistre but not wel for me. Natheles, I that
am such as ye seen am reprevede of a mannes synne.”

At this seyinge that other youled and toke him in
armes and wepynge seyde: “O Combabe, wherfore
hastow wrought gret mescheef? Wherfore hastow
don thiself suche a despyt that never yit no man ne
sayde? I preyse this not at alle. O herde herte,
that wast hardy for to don suche thinges, that I
wolde thou hadde neer soffred ne I neer seen! Me
wantede not this answere. But for als moche
as it was goddes wille, first shaltow han vengeaunce
of oure grace, the dethe of thi false chalengeres
hem self, and after schal comen a gret yifte, moche
gold and gret plentee silver and Assuriene clothes
and rialle destreres (royal chargers). And thou shalt come before
me withouten that ony man presente thee, and
noon schalle lette thee fro sight of me, thoghe I be
abedde with my wyf.” Right as he seyde, right so
he didde. Tho weren ladde to dethe anon, but to
him the yiftes were goven and grettere frendschipe


 

was graunted. And it semede that Combabe hadde
not his pere in Assurye for wisdom and for blisse. 

 
And after, ther as he besoghte to finissche the
remenant of the temple, for he hadde laft it unfinissched, he was sent eftsones and broght it to an
ende, and abood there fro thens fromward. And be
cause of his vertue and wel doynge, the kyng vouchede
saf that his ymage in brasse scholde ben set in the
seyntuarye. And so for gerdon Combabe dwelleth yit
in the close, formed of brasse be crafte of Ermocle
the Rodien, lyk a womman in schappe, but clothed
as a man. 

 
The storie telleth that his beste frendes, for solas
of his wo, chosen to parte his lot; for thei gelten
hem and ladde that same manere lyf. But othere
men rehercen prestes lore to this matere, how that
Iuno lovynge Combabe putte it in the thoghtes of
manye to gelden hem, in the entente that he
scholde not mourne allone for manhode.

But evermore sithen that this custom was first establissched,
it abydeth yit, and everyche yeer manye men
gelden hem in the close and becomen as wommen,
wher it be that thei solacen Combabe or reioysen
Iuno. Algates thei gelden hem. And thise no
lenger clothen hem as men, but weren wommenes
wedes and don wommenes werkes. And as I herde,
the blame of this also is leyde on Combabe; for a
thyng befel him in this wyse. A straunge womman
that cam thider on pilgrimage saughe him whyl
he was fayre and clad yit as a man, and sche was
seysed of gret love. But after, whan sche lernede



 

that he was marred, sche slowe hirself. Thanne for
despeyr that Combabe hadde be cause he was
acurst in love, he didde on femele clothinge to the
ende that never non other womman scholde ben
so begyled. That is whi Galles weren femele
aparayl. 

 
Of Combabe have I seyd ynow, and of Galles I
schalle make mencioun sone in another partie of my
boke, how that they ben gelded, and in what
manere that thei ben buryed, and wherfore thei
entren not into the temple. But first it listeth me
to telle of the site of the temple and his gretnesse,
and therfore I schalle don right so.

The place therinne the temple sytt isa hille ; and *
it liggeth wel in the myddes of the cytee, and two
walles enviroune it. Oon of tho walles is auncien,
but the tother is not mocheles elder than oure tyme.
The entree of the holy place maketh out toward the
Septemtryon, wel a 100 fadmes of largenesse; and in
that entree stont tho yerdes that Bachus leet set,
on heighte a 300 fadmes. A man goth up the oon





 

of thise yerdes twyes in the yeer and woneth at the
cop of the yerde for the space of 7 dayes. And the
cause of his goynge up, as men seyn, is this. Lewed
folk trowen that he speketh with the goddes on highe
and axeth bones for alle Surrye, and the goddeg
heren his preyeres fro there nyghe. But othere
wenen that this also is don be cause of Deucalioun,
in tokene and mynde of that tribulacioun, whan
men wenten into montaynes and into the gret highe
trees for fere of the flode. Now to me, that is not
to beleven. I suppose wel that thei don this for
worschipe of Bachus, and I conclude it thus. Yerdes
that thei maken for worschipe of Bachus, on tho yerdes
thei setten alle weyes wodene men; but I schalle
not seye whi. Therfore me thenketh, in goynge
up, that oon countrefeteth that other woden man.

The manere of his goynge up is this. He putteth
a schort corde abouten himself and the yerde, and
thanne he climbeth on peces of wode ynaylled on
the yerde, bigge ynow for to lette setten (set his toes) on his
toon; and ther as he climbeth he throweth up the
corde with bothe hondes right as he mighte schake
the reynes of a charre. If ony ther be that hath
not seen this thing, but hath seen men that climben
trees of palme in Arabye or in Egypte, or elles
where, he undirstondeth wherof I speke. 





 
 

 
Whan he is comen to the ende of his weye, he
letteth falle an other corde that he hath, that is
long, and draweth uppe what him list, wode and
clothes and purveyaunce, of the whiche he frameth
a sete lyk as a nest, theron he sytteth and abydeth
for the space of the before seyde dayes, And
manye comynge putten gold or silver or peraunter
brasse, that thei usen for here moneyes, in to a
vesselle that lyeth there neer, seyinge everychon
his name. Thann oon that stondeth there beside
calleth it uppe ; and whan that other resceyveth the
name of eech, he preyeth for him, and in preyinge
schaketh a thyng of brasse that souneth gret and
schrille whan it is stered. And he ne slepeth never.
For if that ever he falle on slepe, a scorpioun goynge
up awaketh him and doth him pitous harm; and
that is the peyne that is leyde on him for slepynge. 
Now this tale that is told of the scorpioun is a holy
tale and wel semyng, but wher it be trewe or non,
I wot neer. Natheles, me semeth that drede of
fallynge avayleth moch to wakfulnesse.
 

 Now thanne, of yerde-climberes have I seyd y
now.

But as touching the temple, it loketh ayenst
the sonnes rysynge, and the form and makyng
therof is right as thei bylden temples in Ionye. A
gret platte forme ryseth fro the erthe 2 fadmes of
highte, where on the temple sytt. The weye up to




 

it is mad of stone, that is not over long. And
whan thou art aboven, the parvys of the temple
scheweth thee a thing of grete merveylle, for it is
dight with dores of gold. And with inne, the temple
schyneth with mocheles gold, and the ceylours ben
alle goldene. And a hevenlyche savour cometh out
of it, lyk as cometh, men seyn, out of the londe of
Arabye. In goynge up, fro fer it sendeth toward
thee a wondur swete brethe; and ther as thou gost
thy weye, it fayleth never, but thi clothes kepen
that brethe ful longe tyme, and thou schalt evermore ben in remembraunce ther of.

And with inne, the temple is not oon, but in it is
mad an other chambre, to the which is an other weye
up, that is but schort. That chambre is not dight
with dores but liggeth alle open ayens thee. In to
the grete temple comen alle men, but in to the
litylle chambre the prestes only, and not alle the
prestes, but only thei that ben most nyghe to
the Goddes and han in governaunce alle the servys
of the temple. And in that chambre arn throned
the ydoles, that oon Iuno and that other that is
Tove, algates thei clepen him be another name. 
And both ben of gold, and both sytten, but lyouns
beren Iuno, and that other sytt on boles. 




 
 

 
And certeynely the symulacre of Iove ressembleth
Iove in alle pointes, as heed and garnements and
throne; and thou mightest not lyknen him unto
no thing elles, and thou wolde.

But whan thou
lokest on Iuno, sche wil schewe thee grete dyversitee of semblauntz; for al be it that the hool, trewely
considered, be luno, natheles it conteyneth some
dele of Minerve and Venus and Luna and Cibella
and Deane and Fortune and Parcas. And in that
oon hond sche holt a troncheon, and in that
other a distaf; and on hir hede sche bereth rayes,
and a tour, and that ceynt that men arayen with
Venus Celestial allone. And abouten hir sche hath
mo gold and precious stones right costlewe, some
whyte and some watry, and manye lyk wyn and
manye lyk fuyr; and therto sardoynes withouten
nombre and berylles and emeraudes. Thise stones
bryngen men of Egypte and Inde and Ethyope and
Medye and Ermonye and Babyloyne. But I schal
devyse you a thyng that is yit mo to speke of.
Sche bereth on hir hede a ston that hight Lampe
and hath his name after that that it doth. That ston
schyneth in the nyght with grete claretee and
serveth all the temple with light, right as it were
of lampes. In the daye his schyninge is feble but



 

it hath a right fuyry aspect. And ther is an
other merveylle in that ydole. Gif thou loke on
hir stondynge ayenst hir, sche loketh on thee, and
if thou remeve thee, hir regard folweth thee; natheles
if an other beholde hir fro the tothere syde, sche
doth right so to him also.

And betwene hem stont a symulacre of gold, not
lyk the othere symulacres in no kynde, that hath
no propre schap but bereth the qualitees of the
other goddes. And the Assuriens hem selve clepen
it Tokene, for thei han not goven him no propre name ;
in sothe thei mowe not seyn whens it cam ne what
maner thyng it is. But some beleven, it is of Bachus, ~
and othere that it is of Deucalioun, and othere that it
is of Semiramys. And for sothe a dowve of gold
stont on his hede, and so thei devisen that it is
Semiramys Tokene. And it doth iorney twyes
eech yeer to the See, for to fecchen that water
aforseyde.

In the temple himself on the left syde in entrynge is
first a thron of Elye the sonne, but noon ymage of him
sytt there on. For of Sonne and Mone only schewen
thei non symulacres, and I lernede wherfore thei
folwen this usaunce. Thei seyn that of othere
goddes it is leful to lete make symulacres, for that




 

here schappes ben not seen of alle men. But Sonne
and Mone ben wel visible and alle men beholden
hem. Whi thanne make symulacres of thynges that
aperen in the eyr?

And ther nyghe this throne is sett a symulacre ~
of Apollo, not lyk as he is wont to ben formed. For
alle othere Jeven Apollo yong and formen him as a
stripling, but thise allone schewen a symulacre of
Apollo berded. And doynge this thei preisen hem
selve and repreven Grekes and alle othere men that
worschippen Apollo in lyknesse of a child. And the
resoun is, for it semeth hem gret folye to maken
schappes of Goddes inperfyt, and al that is yong
thei demen yit inperfyt. And here Apollo hath
other novelrye; for thei allone arayen him with
clothynges.

Now of the wondres that he doth I can speke
largely, but I wol telle only that that is most
marveyllous; and first I schalle make mencioun
of the oracle. Ther ben manye oracles amonges
Grekes and manye amonges Egyptyens, and some in
Libye, and also manye in Asye. But thise oracles
speken not withouten prestes or prophetes; but




 

that oon meveth be himself and be himself acomplischeth his fercastinge, wher of the maner is right
so. Whan heis in wille for to make predicatioun, atte
firste he meveth on his thron, and thanne anon the
prestes beren him up; but if thei ne beren him
not up, he sweteth and meveth ever the more. And
whyls thei carryen him on here scholdres, he dryveth
hem, tornynge hem in alle weyes and lepynge fro
that oon to that other. And atte last the Chefe
Preste meteth him and axeth him of alle manere
thinges; and gif he wole not that a thyng ben don,
he draweth him backwardes; but if he commende a
thyng, he dryveth his bereres forwardes right as he
were dryvinge a charre. So assemblen thei the
predicatiounes, and withouten this don thei no
thing, ne solempne ne lewede. And he speketh of
the yeer and the sesouns ther of, ye, whan thei
ne axe not; and he speketh of the Tokene, whan
it schal gon that iorney aforseyde.

And I schalle
seye you an other wonder that he wroghte in min
owene presence. Whan the prestes wolde beren
him up and carryen him, he lafte hem doun on the
erthe and fleighe in the eyr al be him self.

There beside Apollo is a symulacre of Atlas, and
there neer, of Mercure and of Lucine.

Now have I devysed you how that the temple
is aparaylled with innen. Withouten is set a gret
awtere of brasse, and there nyghe ben othere symulacres of kynges and prestes withouten nombre ; and
I schalle telle you tho that ben moste worthy of
mencioun. At the lefte syde of the temple stont a
symulacre of Semiramys schewinge the temple with
hir righte hond, the whiche was sett up for this
resoun. Sche made ordeynaunce unto alle that
duelleden in Surrye that thei scholde worschippe hir
as here goddesse, recchynge nought of the othere
goddes and [uno hirself. And thei didde right
so. But after, for als moche as syknesses and tribulaciouns and peynes weren leyde on hir by the
goddes, sche cessed of that folye and knouleched that
sche was mortalle and commaunded alle hir subgettes
to tornen hem ayen un to Iuno. Wherfore sche
stont yit in suche gyse, devysing to alle that comen
that thei schulle worschippe luno, and knoulechynge
that sche is not goddesse no more, but that other.

And in that place saughe I also ymages of Eleyne
and Ecube and Andromacha and Parys and Ector
and Achilles. And I saughe Nireos ymage, that
was sone of Aglaye, and Philomele and Progne, that
weren yit wommen, and Tereus himself, that was a
brid, and an other ymage of Semiramys, and of
Combabe that that I spak of, and a right fayr of
Stratonice, and oon of Alexaundre lyk as it were the
verray man, and there beside him stont Sardanapalle
in other schappe and other aparayl.

And in the clos at large pasturen grete boles
and hors and egles and beres and lyouns; and thei
don no manere harm to men but ben everyche of
hem holy and tame.

Prestes thei apoynten withouten nombre, of the
whiche some sleen the victimes and some beren the
offrynges of licours and some ben cleped Fuyrbereres
and some Awtere Prestes. Whan I was there, mo
than a 300 weren wont to assemblen hem for sacrifise.
Thei ben clothed in whyte robes alle, and thei han
a poynted cappe on here hedes. And everyche
yeer a newe chefe preste is sett over hem, that
allone wereth a robe of purpre and is crouned with a
coronale of gold.

And therto is other gret multytude of religious men, of floyteres and piperes and
Galles, and also wommen that ben wode and out of
here witte.

Twyes each day sacrifise is perfourmed, to the
which allecomen. To Iove thei sacrificen withouten
ony noys, ne syngynge not ne floytynge; but whan
thei presenten offrynges to Iuno, thanne thei syngen
and floyten and sounen cymbales. And as to this
thei mighte not telle me no thing certeyn.

Ther is also a lak, a lityl fro the temple, in the
whiche holy fissches ben norysscht, withouten nombre
and of dyverse kyndes. Some of hem ben ful grete,
and thise han names and comen whan thei ben





 

cleped. And whan I was there, amonges hem was
oon that werde gold. On his fynne was festned a
ioyelle of gold; and often tymes I saughe him, and
he hadde that ioyelle.

That lak is passynge depe. I assayde it not, but
men seyn that it hath wel mo than a 200 fadmes ;
and in the myd place ther of stont an awtere of
stone. Seeynge it on a sodeyne, thou woldest
trowen that it fleyted and rode upon the water, and
manye men wenen thus; but I suppose that a gret
piler pight undernethe bereth up the awtere. And
it is ever more dressed with gerlondes and hath
encens brennynge, and manye swymmen overthwart
to it eech day for a vowe that thei han, and bryngen
gerlondes.

At that place ben wondur grete festes, the which
highte Desceyntes unto the Lak, be cause that in
tho festes alle the ydoles gon doun to the lak.
Amonges hem Iuno cometh first, be cause of the
fissches, to the entente that Iove schalle not seen
hem first; for if so be that this happeth, thei dyen
alle, as men seyn. And for sothe he cometh to




 

seen hem, but sche, stondynge beforn him, letteth ; «3
him, and with manye supplicatiouns sendeth him his : **
weye.

Wondur grete ben also the festes that thei ben
wont to make in goynge to the see. Of tho festes
ne can I not seye no thing certeyn, be cause that
I ne wente not myself ne assayde not that pilgrimage. But what thei don whan thei retornen,
that I saughe and schalle devyse you. Thei beren
everychon a pot fulle of water, and thise pottes ben
seeled with waxe. And of hem self thei ne breke
not the seel for to schede it out; but ther is a holy
Cokke, that woneth (dwells) nyghe to the lak, that whan
he resceyveth the vesseles he loketh to the seel, and
getteth him a fee for to undon the bond and remeve
the waxe; and the Cokke gadereth moche silver
thorghe this werk. And fro thens thei hem self
bryngen it in to the temple, and scheden it out;
and after this thei perfourmen sacrifise, and than
thei wenden hoom ayen.

But the grettest of alle festes wherof I knowe is
kepte in the firste somer sesoun, and some men
clepen it Fuyr Feste and some Torche Feste. Ther
inne thei don sacrifise in this wyse. Thei kutten
grete trees and setten hem in the clos, and after,
brynginge gotes and schepe and othere bestes, thei
hangen hem fro the trees, alle on lyve, and eke
briddes (birds) and clothes and ioyelles of gold and of silver,
And whan thei han mad everyche thing complet and
perfyt, thei beren the ydoles aboute the trees, and
thanne thei casten inne fuyr and als swythe alle tho




 

thinges brennen. To this feste comen manye bothe
fro Surrye and from alle the marches there aboute ;
and alle bryngen here owne holy thinges and han
alle here Tokenes made in lyknesse of that on.

And upon sette dayes the multytude assemblen
hem in the clos, and manye Galles and tho religious
men that I spak of pertourmen here cerimonyes ;
and thei kutten here owne armes and beten that oon
that other upon the bak. — And manye that stont
ther neer floyten, and manye beten timbres, and
othere syngen wode songes and holy. This is don
withouten the temple, and thei that don it comen
not in to the temple.

And in thise dayes Galles ben made. For whan
tho floyten and perfourmen here rytes, that folye
sone entreth into manye, and manye ther ben that
camen for to seen and thanne wroghten in thilke
manere. And I shal descryve what thei don. ‘The
yong man to whom Fortune hath goven this adversitee, he casteth offe his clothinge and cometh in to
the myddes, cryinge in a grete voyce, and taketh
up a swerd that hath stode there thise manye
yeeres, I wene. Thanne he geldeth him right anon
and renneth throghe the Cytee berynge in his
hondes tho parties therof he gelt him. And that
house into the whiche he schalle casten thise, he




 

getteth thens femele wedes and wommanlyche
aparayles. Thus don thei whan thei gelden hem.

And Galles at here dyenge ben not enterred in
lyk manere as other men, but gif a Galle dye, his
felawes liften him up and carryen him in to the
skirtes of the Cytee and sette doun the man himself
and the fertre on the whiche thei broghte him, and
easten stones aboven; and whan this is don, thei
wenden hoom ayen. And thei wayten for the nombre
of 7 dayes or that thei entren in to the temple; for
if thei entren before, thei misdon.

And the customes that thei folwen therto ben thise. If so
be that ony of hem seeth a dede man, he cometh
not in to the temple that day; but on the nexte
daye, aftre that he hath pured him, thanne he
entreth. And tho that ben of the dede mannes kyn
wayten for the space of 30 dayes and lette schaven
here hedes or thei entren; but before that this hath
ben don, it is not leful for to entren.

Thei sacrificen boles and kyn and gotes and schepe.
Swyn only thei ne sacrificen not nouther eten be cause
that thei demen hem unclene. But othere men
demen hem not unclene but holy. And amonges
briddes the dowve semeth hem wondur holy thing,





 

and thei ben not wont so moche as to touchen hem ;
and gif thei touchen hem maugree hem selven, thei
ben unclene that day. Therfore dowves lyven:
amonges hem and entren here houses and gadren
here mete for the moste part atte erthe.

And I schal telle you what the pilgrimes alle don.
Whan that a man wole faren for the firste sythe (time) to
the Holy Cytee, he schaveth his heed and his browes, 
and after that, he sacrificeth a schep; and than he
kerveth it and eteth it alle, saf only the flees that
he leyeth on the erthe and kneleth ther on, and
taketh the bestes feet and heed and putteth upon
his owne heed. Ther with alle he preyeth, askynge
that this present sacrifise be resceyved and behotynge (promising) a grettere that nexte sythe. And whan alle this is
atte ende, he putteth a gerlond on his owne heed
and on the hedes of his felawes that wolle gon that
ilke pilgrimage. Thanne levynge his owne contree
he doth iorney; and he useth cold watre bothe for
to wasschen with and to drynken, and slepeth
alle weyes on the erthe; for he ne may not liggen
in no maner bedde un to tyme that his pilgrimage
be fulfilled and he be comen ayen to his owne
contree.

And in the Holy Cytee he is reseeyved






 

of an hoste that he knoweth not propurly. For
certeyne men in that place ben apoynted unto
everyche cytee as hostes, and dyverse kynredes han
this office of linage. And Assuryens clepen tho
men Maistres be cause thei techen hem everyche
thing.

And the sacrifises ben not perfourmed in the
temple, but whan he hath presented his victime
beforn the awtere, he schedeth offrynge of wyn
there on, and thanne he ayen ledeth him on lyve
to his logging, and’ whan he is comen there he
sacrificeth and preyeth be him self.

Ther is also this other maner sacrifise. Theidressen
here victimes with gerlondes and hurlen hem doun
the degrees of the entree on lyve, and in fallynge
doun thei dyen. And some men hurlen here owne
children thens, but not in lyke manere as the bestes.
Thei putten hem in a walet and beren hem doun
in hond, and thei scornen hem with alle, seyinge
that thei ben not children but oxen.

And alle Ieten marke hem, some on the wriste
and some on the nekke; and for that skylle alle
Assuryens beren markes.

And thei don another thing, in the whiche thei
acorden to men of Trosen allone of Grekes, and I
schalle telle you what tho don. Men of Trosen han
made ordeynaunce as touchinge the maydens and
the bachelers, that thei schulle not maryen or thei
lette scheren here lokkes for worschipe of Ypolite ;
and so thei don. That thing is don also in the
Holy Cytee. The bacheleres offren of here berdes,
and the children from here birthe leten holy crulles
growe, the which thei scheren whan thei ben presented in the temple and putten in boystes outher
of silver or often tymes of gold, that thei naylen
faste in the temple, and than gon here weye; but
first thei wryten there on here names everychon.
Whan I was yong, I fulfilled that ryte; and bothe
my crulle and my name ben yit in the seyntuarye.
