I will sing of Heracles, the son of Zeus and much the mightiest of men on earth.
 Alcmena bare him in Thebes , the city of lovely
 dances, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had lain with her. Once he used to wander over
 unmeasured tracts of land and sea

at the bidding of King Eurystheus, and himself did many deeds of violence and endured
 many; but now he lives happily in the glorious home of snowy Olympus , and has neat-ankled Hebe for his wife. Hail, lord, son of Zeus' Give
 me success and prosperity.
