Of Cytherea, born in Cyprus , I will sing. 
 She gives kindly gifts to men: smiles are ever on her lovely face, and lovely is the brightness that plays over it.
 Hail, goddess, queen of well-built Salamis

and sea-girt Cyprus ; grant me a cheerful song. 
 And now I will remember you and another song also.
