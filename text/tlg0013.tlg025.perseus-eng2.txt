I will begin with the Muses and Apollo and Zeus. For it is through the Muses and
 Apollo that there are singers upon the earth and players upon the lyre; but kings are from
 Zeus. Happy is he whom the Muses

love: sweet flows speech from his lips. Hail, children of Zeus! Give honor to my
 song! And now I will remember you and another song also.
