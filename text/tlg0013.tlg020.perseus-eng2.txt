Sing, clear-voiced Muse, of Hephaestus famed for inventions. With bright-eyed Athena
 he taught men glorious crafts throughout the world, â€”men who before used to dwell in caves
 in the mountains like wild beasts.

But now that they have learned crafts through Hephaestus the famed worker, easily
 they live a peaceful life in their own houses the whole year round. Be gracious, Hephaestus,
 and grant me success and prosperity!
