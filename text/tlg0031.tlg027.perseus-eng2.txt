This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to
show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent
and made known by his angel to his servant, John,

who testified
to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything
that he saw.

Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the
prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is
at hand.

John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you
and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from
the seven Spirits who are before his throne;

and from Jesus
Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler
of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our
sins by his blood;

and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his
God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever.
Amen.

Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see
him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will
mourn over him. Even so, Amen.

"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and
who was and who is to come, the Almighty."

I John, your brother and partner with you in oppression,
kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is
called Patmos because of God's Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.

I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a
loud voice, as of a trumpet

saying, "What you see, write in a
book and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."

I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned,
I saw seven golden lampstands.

And in the midst of the
lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down
to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.

His head
and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a
flame of fire.

His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had
been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.

He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded
a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its
brightest.

When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.

 He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid. I am the
first and the last,

and the Living one. I was dead, and behold,
I am alive forevermore. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.

Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things
which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;

the
mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the
seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven
assemblies. The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.

To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write:

 "He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the
midst of the seven golden lampstands says these things:

"I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that
you can't tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves
apostles, and they are not, and found them false.

You have
perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown
weary.

But I have this against you, that you left your first
love.

Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent
and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly, and will
move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.

But this
you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also
hate.

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of
life, which is in the Paradise of my God.

"To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:

 "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says
these things:

"I know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you are
rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are
not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

Don't be afraid of the things
which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some
of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have
oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the
crown of life.

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won't be harmed by the second
death.

"To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:

 "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:

"I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan's throne
is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days of
Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where
Satan dwells.

But I have a few things against you, because you
have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to
throw a stumbling block before the children of
 Israel 
 , to eat things
sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.

So you
also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same
way.

Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I
will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.

He who
has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him
who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give
him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one
knows but he who receives it.

"To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:

 "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet
are like burnished brass, says these things:

I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient
endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.

But
I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to
commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual
immorality.

Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who
commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of
her works.

I will kill her children with Death, and all the
assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I
will give to each one of you according to your deeds.

But to you
I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don't have this
teaching, who don't know what some call 'the deep things of Satan,' to
you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.

Nevertheless that which you have, hold firmly until I come.

He
who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give
authority over the nations.

He will rule them with a rod of
iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my
Father:

and I will give him the morning star.

He who has
an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.

"And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write:

 He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these
things:

 "I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but
you are dead.

Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you
were about to throw away, for I have found no works of yours perfected
before my God.

Remember therefore how you have received and
heard. Keep it, and repent. If therefore you won't watch, I will come
as a thief, and you won't know what hour I will come upon you.

Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their
garments. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no
way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name
before my Father, and before his angels.

He who has an ear, let
him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.

"To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write:

 "He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who
opens and no one can shut, and that shuts and no one opens, says these
things:

"I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open
door, which no one can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my
word, and didn't deny my name.

Behold, I give of the synagogue of
Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie.
Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to
know that I have loved you.

Because you kept the word of my
patience, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that which is
to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.

I come quickly. Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one
takes your crown.

He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in
the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more. I will
write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,
the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my
own new name.

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says to the assemblies.

"To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write:

 "The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God's
creation, says these things:

"I know your works, that you are
neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.

So, because
you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my
mouth.

Because you say, 'I am rich, and have gotten riches, and
have need of nothing;' and don't know that you are the wretched one,
miserable, poor, blind, and naked;

I counsel you to buy from me
gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments,
that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may
not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.

As many as I love, I reprove and chasten. Be zealous therefore,
and repent.

Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will
dine with him, and he with me.

He who overcomes, I will give to
him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down
with my Father on his throne.

He who has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says to the assemblies."

After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven,
and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was
one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must
happen after this."

Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne
set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne

that looked like a
jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like
an emerald to look at.

Around the throne were twenty-four
thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in
white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.

Out of the
throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps
of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like a
crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four
living creatures full of eyes before and behind.

The first
creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the
third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying
eagle.

The four living creatures, having each one of them six
wings, are full of eyes around about and within. They have no rest day
and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to
come!"

When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him
who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,

the
twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and
worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before
the throne, saying,

"Worthy are you, our Lord and our God, the
Holy One, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you
created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were
created!"

I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book
written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.

I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the
book, and to break its seals?"

No one in heaven above, or on the
earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.

And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the
book, or to look in it.

One of the elders said to me, "Don't
weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David,
has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals."

I saw
in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the
midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain,
having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God,
sent out into all the earth.

Then he came, and he took it out of
the right hand of him who sat on the throne.

Now when he had
taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders
fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls
full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

They sang a
new song, saying,
"You are worthy to take the book,
 And to open its seals:
For you were killed,
 And bought us for God with your blood,
 Out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,

And made them kings and priests to our God,
 And they reign on earth."

I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels
around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number
of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;

saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been
killed to receive the power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and
blessing!"

I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth,
under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, "To him
who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the
glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen."

The four living creatures said, "Amen!" The elders fell down
and worshiped.

I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard
one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder,
"Come and see!"

And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it
had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and
to conquer.

When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living
creature saying, "Come!"

Another came forth, a red horse. To him
who sat on it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they
should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.

When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living
creature saying, "Come and see!" And behold, a black horse, and he who
sat on it had a balance in his hand.

I heard a voice in the midst
of the four living creatures saying, "A choenix of wheat for a
denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't damage the
oil and the wine!"

When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living
creature saying, "Come and see!"

And behold, a pale horse, and he
who sat on him, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority
over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with
death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.

When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the
souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the
testimony of the Lamb which they had.

They cried with a loud
voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and true, do you not judge
and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"

A long
white robe was given them. They were told that they should rest yet for
a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also
be killed even as they were, completed their course.

I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great
earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the
whole moon became as blood.

The stars of the sky fell to the
earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a
great wind.

The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled
up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich,
the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the
caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

They told the mountains
and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits
on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,

for the great day
of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"

After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of
the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would
blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.

I saw another
angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He
cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm
the earth and the sea,

saying, "Don't harm the earth, neither the
sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on
their foreheads!"

I heard the number of those who were sealed,
one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the
children of Israel:

Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,

Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,

Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,

Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,
Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude,
which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes,
peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,
dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.

They
cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation be to our God, who sits on
the throne, and to the Lamb!"

All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders,
and the four living creatures; and they fell before his throne on their
faces, and worshiped God,

saying, "Amen! Blessing, glory,
wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever
and ever! Amen."

One of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are
arrayed in white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?"

I told him, "My lord, you know."

 He said to me, "These are those who came out of the great
tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's
blood.

Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve
him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread
his tent over them.

They will never be hungry, neither thirsty
any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;

for
the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads
them to living springs of waters. God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes."

When he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in
heaven for about half an hour.

I saw the seven angels who stand
before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

Another angel
came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was
given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on
the golden altar which was before the throne.

The smoke of the
incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the
angel's hand.

The angel took the censer, and he filled it with
the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed
thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.

The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound.

The first sounded, and there followed hail
and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown on the earth. One
third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt
up, and all green grass was burnt up.

The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning
mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,

and one third of the creatures which were in the sea died, those
who had life. One third of the ships were destroyed.

The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky,
burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on
the springs of the waters.

The name of the star is called
"Wormwood." One third of the waters became wormwood. Many men died from
the waters, because they were made bitter.

The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was
struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that
one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one
third of it, and the night in the same way.

I saw, and I heard
an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe!
Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of
the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!"

The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky fallen
to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.

He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like
the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened
because of the smoke from the pit.

Then out of the smoke came
forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the
scorpions of the earth have power.

They were told that they
should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing,
neither any tree, but only those men who don't have God's seal on their
foreheads.

They were given power not to kill them, but to torment
them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion,
when it strikes a man.

In those days men will seek death, and
will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee
from them.

The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared
for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their
faces were like men's faces.

They had hair like women's hair, and
their teeth were like those of lions.

They had breastplates, like
breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of
chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.

They have tails like
those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm
men for five months.

They have over them as king the angel of
the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the
name "Apollyon."

The first woe is past. Behold, there are still
two woes coming after this.

The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of
the golden altar which is before God,

saying to the sixth angel
who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great
river Euphrates!"

The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that
hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of
mankind.

The number of the armies of the horsemen was ten
thousands of ten thousands. I heard the number of them.

Thus I
saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having
breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the
heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.

By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the
fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.

For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their
tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them
they harm.

The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these
plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't
worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and
of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.

They didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor
of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.

I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with
a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his
feet like pillars of fire.

He had in his hand a little book
open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.

He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the
seven thunders uttered their voices.

When the seven thunders
sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying,
"Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don't write
them."

The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land
lifted up his right hand to the sky,

and swore by him who lives
forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the
earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that
are in it, that there will no longer be delay,

but in the days
of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the
mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the
prophets.

The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking
with me, said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the
angel who stands on the sea and on the land."

I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.

 He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your belly
bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."

I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my belly
was made bitter.

They told me, "You must prophesy again over
many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."

A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, "Rise, and
measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.

Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don't
measure it, for it has been given to the gentiles. They will tread the
holy city under foot for forty-two months.

I will give power to
my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty
days, clothed in sackcloth.

These are the two olive trees and
the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth.

If
anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and
devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be
killed in this way.

These have the power to shut up the sky,
that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power
over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with
every plague, as often as they desire.

When they have finished
their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war
with them, and overcome them, and kill them.

Their dead bodies
will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called
Sodom and
 Egypt 
 , where also their Lord was crucified.

From among
the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their
dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead
bodies to be laid in a tomb.

Those who dwell on the earth
rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one
another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the
earth.

After the three and a half days, the breath of life from
God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on
those who saw them.

I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to
them, "Come up here!" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their
enemies saw them.

In that day there was a great earthquake, and
a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the
earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.

The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes
quickly.

The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven
followed, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of
our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!"

The twenty-four elders, who sit before God's throne on their
thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,

saying: "We
give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was;
because you have taken your great power, and reigned.

The
nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead
to be judged, and to give your servants the prophets, their reward, as
well as the saints, and those who fear your name, the small and the
great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth."

God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of
the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds,
thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed.

A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the
sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve
stars.

She was with child. She cried out, laboring and in pain,
giving birth.

Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven
crowns.

His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and
threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was
about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her
child.

She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all
the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to
his throne.

The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a
place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two
hundred sixty days.

There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on
the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.

They didn't
prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.

The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the
devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to
the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

I heard a
loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power,
and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the
accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before
our God day and night.

They overcame him because of the Lamb's
blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn't love
their life, even to death.

Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you
who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil
has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a
short time."

When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he
persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.

Two
wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly
into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a
time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river,
that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.

The
earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up
the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.

The dragon
grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of
her seed, who keep God's commandments and hold Jesus' testimony.

Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up
out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten
crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.

The beast which I
saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his
mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his
throne, and great authority.

One of his heads looked like it had
been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth
marveled at the beast.

They worshiped the dragon, because he
gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying,
"Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"

A
mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority
to make war for forty-two months was given to him.

He opened his
mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his
dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.

It was given to him to make
war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe,
people, language, and nation was given to him.

All who dwell on
the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written
from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who
has been killed.

If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

If
anyone has captivity, he goes away. If anyone is with the sword, he
must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.

I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two
horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.

He exercises all
the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth
and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound
was healed.

He performs great signs, even making fire come down
out of the sky on the earth in the sight of men.

He deceives my
own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was
given to him to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on
the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the
sword wound and lived.

It was given to him to give breath to
it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both
speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to
be killed.

He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and
the poor, and the free and the slave, so that they should give them
marks on their right hand, or on their forehead;

and that no
one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name
of the beast or the number of his name.

Here is wisdom. He who
has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is
the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.

I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the
name of his Father, written on their foreheads.

I heard a sound
from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a
great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpers playing
on their harps.

They sing a new song before the throne, and
before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the
song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been
redeemed out of the earth.

These are those who were not defiled
with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb
wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the
first fruits to God and to the Lamb.

In their mouth was found no
lie, for they are blameless.

I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal gospel
to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation,
tribe, language, and people.

He said with a loud voice, "Fear
the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come.
Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of
waters!"

Another, a second angel, followed, saying, "Babylon the great
has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the
wrath of her sexual immorality."

Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great
voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark
on his forehead, or on his hand,

he also will drink of the wine
of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger.
He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy
angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

The smoke of their
torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night,
those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the
mark of his name.

Here is the patience of the saints, those who
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

I heard the voice from heaven saying, "Write, 'Blessed are
the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'"

 "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors; for
their works follow with them."

I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one
sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in
his hand a sharp sickle.

Another angel came out from the
temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Send
forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the
harvest of the earth is ripe!"

He who sat on the cloud thrust
his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.

Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven.
He also had a sharp sickle.

Another angel came out from the
altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to
him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle,
and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's
grapes are fully ripe!"

The angel thrust his sickle into the
earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the
great winepress of the wrath of God.

The winepress was trodden
outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the
bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.

I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven
angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is
finished.

I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire,
and those who overcame the beast, and his image, and the number of his
name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.

They
sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,
saying,
"Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty;
 Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.

Who wouldn't fear you, Lord,
 And glorify your name?
For you only are holy.
 For all the nations will come and worship before you.
 For your righteous acts have been revealed.

After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle
of the testimony in heaven was opened.

The seven angels who had
the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and
wearing golden sashes around their breasts.

One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and
ever.

The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the
seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.

I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven
angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the
earth!"

The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and
it became a harmful and evil sore on the men who had the mark of the
beast, and who worshiped his image.

The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it
became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.

The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of
water, and it became blood.

I heard the angel of the waters
saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because
you judged this way.

For they poured out the blood of the saints
and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve
this."

I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty,
true and righteous are your judgments."

The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given
to him to scorch men with fire.

People were scorched with great
heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over
these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory.

The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,
and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the
pain,

and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their
pains and their sores. They didn't repent of their works.

The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the
Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for
the kings that come from the sunrise.

I saw coming out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like
frogs;

for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which
go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them
together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.

"Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and
keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked, and they see his
shame."

He gathered them together into the place which is
called in Hebrew, Megiddo.

The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice
came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is
done!"

There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the
earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.

The great city was
divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon
the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of
the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

Every island fled
away, and the mountains were not found.

Great hailstones, about
the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on men. Men blasphemed
God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly
severe.

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and
spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the
great prostitute who sits on many waters,

with whom the kings of
the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth
were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."

He
carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting
on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns.

The woman was dressed in purple and
scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in
her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the
sexual immorality of the earth.

And on her forehead a name was
written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND
OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."

I saw the woman drunken with
the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.

The angel said
to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman,
and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the
ten horns.

The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about
to come up out of the abyss, and to go into destruction. Those who
dwell on the earth will wonder, whose name has not been written in the
book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see that the
beast was, and is not, and will pe present.

Here is the mind
that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the
woman sits.

They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is,
the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little
while.

The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an
eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.

The
ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as
yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.

These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to
the beast.

These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will
overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also
will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."

He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute
sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.

The ten
horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and
will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her
flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.

For God has put in
their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to come to unity of mind,
and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should
be accomplished.

The woman whom you saw is the great city,
which reigns over the kings of the earth."

After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of
the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his
glory.

He cried with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is
Babylon the great, and has become a habitation of demons, and a prison
of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful
bird!

For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual
immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the
abundance of her luxury."

I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come forth, my
people, out of her, that you have no participation in her sins, and
that you don't receive of her plagues,

for her sins have reached
to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities.

Return to her
just as she returned, and double back doubles as she did, and according
to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.

However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her
of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and
am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'

Therefore in one
day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be
utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is
strong.

The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality
and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they
look at the smoke of her burning,

standing far away for the
fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the
strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.'

The
merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their
merchandise any more;

merchandise of gold, silver, precious
stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood,
every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of
brass, and iron, and marble;

and cinnamon, incense, perfume,
frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses,
chariots, bodies, and people's souls.

The fruits which your
soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were
dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no
more at all.

The merchants of these things, who were made rich
by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and
mourning;

saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was
dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and
precious stones and pearls!

For in an hour such great riches
are made desolate.' Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere,
and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,

and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning,
saying, 'What is like the great city?'

They cast dust on their
heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great
city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by
reason of her great wealth!' For in one hour is she made desolate.

Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and
prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her."

A mighty
angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea,
saying, "Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown
down, and will be found no more at all.

The voice of harpers
and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters will be heard no more at
all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at
all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.

The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice
of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you;
for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery
all the nations were deceived.

In her was found the blood of
prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth."

After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a
great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and
glory belong to our God:

for true and righteous are his
judgments. For he has judged the great prostitute, her who corrupted
the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of
his servants at her hand."

A second said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and
ever."

The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell
down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen!
Hallelujah!"

A voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Give praise to
our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the
great!"

I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and
like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders,
saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!

Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to
him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made
herself ready."

It was given to her that she would array herself
in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts
of the saints.

He said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to
the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" He said to me, "These are true words
of God."

I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me,
"Look! Don't do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your
brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the
testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."

I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he
who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges
and makes war.

His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head
are many crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one
knows but he himself.

He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with
blood. His name is called "The Word of God."

The armies which
are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure,
fine linen.

Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged
sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them
with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fierceness of the
wrath of God, the Almighty.

He has on his garment and on his
thigh a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."

I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, "Come! Be gathered
together to the great supper of God,

that you may eat the flesh
of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh
of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both
free and slave, and small and great."

I saw the beast, and the
kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war
against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.

The
beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in
his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of
the beast and those who worshiped his image. They two were thrown alive
into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.

The rest were
killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came
forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.

I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of
the abyss and a great chain in his hand.

He seized the dragon,
the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole
inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,

and cast
him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should
deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished.
After this, he must be freed for a short time.

I saw thrones,
and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls
of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the
word of God, and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image, and
didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They
lived, and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.

The rest
of the dead didn't live until the thousand years were finished. This is
the first resurrection.

Blessed and holy is he who has part in
the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but
they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one
thousand years.

And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his
prison,

and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in
the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together
to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

They
went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the
saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God,
and devoured them.

The devil who deceived them was thrown into
the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are
also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place
for them.

I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing
before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened,
which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which
were written in the books, according to their works.

The sea
gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who
were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works.

Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the
second death, the lake of fire.

If anyone was not found written
in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.

I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.

I saw
the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made
ready like a bride adorned for her husband.

I heard a loud voice
out of heaven saying, "Behold, God's dwelling is with men, and he will
dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be
with them as their God.

He will wipe away from them every tear
from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning,
nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away.

He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all
things new." He said, "Write, for these words of God are faithful and
true."

He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty
from the spring of the water of life.

He who overcomes, I will
give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.

But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers,
sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in
the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were
laden with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying,
"Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb's bride."

He
carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed
me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious
stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

having a
great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve
angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve
tribes of the children of
 Israel 
 .

On the east were three gates;
and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the
west three gates.

The wall of the city had twelve foundations,
and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

He
who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the
city, its gates, and its walls.

The city lies foursquare, and
its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the
reed, twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length, breadth, and height
are equal.

Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the
measure of a man, that is, of an angel.

The construction of its
wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass.

The
foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all kinds of precious
stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the
third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

the fifth, sardonyx;
the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the
ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the
twelfth, amethyst.

The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each
one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure
gold, like transparent glass.

I saw no temple in it, for the
Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.

The city
has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very
glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.

The
nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory
and honor of the nations into it.

Its gates will in no way be
shut by day (for there will be no night there),

and they shall
bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may
enter.

There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or
one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written
in the Lamb's book of life.

He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,

in the
midst of its street. On this side of the river and on that was the tree
of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every
month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the
Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.

They will see
his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.

There will be
no night, and they need no lamp light; for the Lord God will illuminate
them. They will reign forever and ever.

He said to me, "These words are faithful and true. The Lord
God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his
bondservants the things which must happen soon."

"Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of
the prophecy of this book."

Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When
I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel
who had shown me these things.

He said to me, "See you don't do
it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the
prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God."

He said to me, "Don't seal up the words of the prophecy of this
book, for the time is at hand.

He who acts unjustly, let him
act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who
is righteous, let him do righteousness still. He who is holy, let him
be holy still."

"Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to
each man according to his work.

I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.

Blessed are
those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree
of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.

Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the
idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the
assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David; the Bright and
Morning Star."

The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" He who hears, let him
say, "Come!" He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him
take the water of life freely.

I testify to everyone who hears
the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God
add to him the plagues which are written in this book.

If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God
take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city,
which are written in this book.

He who testifies these things
says, "Yes, I come quickly."

 Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus.

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints.
Amen.
