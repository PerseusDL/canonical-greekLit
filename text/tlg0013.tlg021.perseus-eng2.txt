Phoebus, of you even the swan sings with clear voice to the beating of his wings, as
 he alights upon the bank by the eddying river Peneus; and of you the sweet-tongued minstrel,
 holding his high-pitched lyre, always sings both first and last.

And so hail to you, lord! I seek your favor with my song.
