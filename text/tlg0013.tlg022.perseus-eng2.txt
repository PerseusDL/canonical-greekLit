I begin to sing about Poseidon, the great god, mover of the earth and fruitless sea,
 god of the deep who is also lord of Helicon and wide Aegae . A two-fold office the gods allotted you, O Shaker of the Earth,

to be a tamer of horses and a saviour of ships! Hail, Poseidon, Holder of the Earth,
 dark-haired lord! O blessed one, be kindly in heart and help those who voyage in ships!
