ZEUS 
(To an attendant.) You arrange the benches and
make the place ready for the men that are coming.
(To another avrenpant.) You bring on the philosophies and put them in line ; but first groom them up,
so that they will look well and will attract as many
as possible. (Zo nErmeEs.) You, Hermes, be crier
and call them together.
 
 HERMES 
Under the blessing of Heaven, let the buyers
now appear at the sales-room. We shall put up for
sale philosophies of every type and all manner of
creeds; and if anyone is unable to pay cash, he is to
name a surety and pay next year.

ZEUS 
Many are gathering, so we must avoid wasting
time and delaying them. Let us begin the sale,
then.
 
 HERMES 
Which do you want us to bring on first ?
 
 ZEUS 
This fellow with the long hair, the Ionian, for he
seems to be someone of distinction.
 

 HERMES 
You Pythagorean, come forward and let yourself
be looked over by the company.
 
 ZEUS 
Hawk him now.
 
 HERMES 
The noblest of philosophies for sale, the most
distinguished ; who'll buy ? Who wants to be more
than man? Who wants to apprehend the music of
the spheres and to be born again ?
 
 BUYER 
For looks, he is not bad, but what does he know
best ?
 
 HERMES 
Arithmetic, astronomy, charlatanry, geometry,
music and quackery; you see in him a first-class
soothsayer.
 
 BUYER 
May I question him?
 
 HERMES 
Yes, and good luck to you!

BUYER 
Where are you from?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
From Samos. 
 BUYER 
Where were you educated ?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
In Egypt, with the sages there.

 

 BUYER 
Come now, if I buy you, what will you teach me?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
I shall teach thee nothing, but make thee remember. 
 BUYER 
How will you make me remember ?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
First by making thy soul pure and purging off the
filth upon it.
 
 BUYER 
Well, imagine that my purification is complete,
what will be your method of making me remember?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
In the first place, long silence and speechlessness,
and for five entire years no word of talk.
 
 BUYER 
My good man, you had better teach the son of
Croesus!? I want to be talkative, not a graven
image. However, what comes after the silence and
the five years?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Thou shalt be practised in music and geometry.
 
 BUYER 
That is delightful ; I am to become a fiddler before
being wise!

PYTHAGOREAN 
Then, in addition to this, in counting.

 

 BUYER 
I know how to count now.
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
How dost thou count ?
 
 BUYER 
One, two, three, four—
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Lo! what thou thinkest four is ten, and a perfect
triangle, and our oath. 
 BUYER 
Well, by your greatest oath, by Four, I never
heard diviner doctrines or more esoteric.
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Thereafter, my friend, thou shalt learn of earth
and air and water and fire, what their flux is, and
what form they have and how they move.
 
 BUYER 
Why, has fire form, or air, or water ?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Yea, very notably, for without shape and form
there can be no motion. And in addition thou
shalt learn that God is number and mind and
harmony.
 
 BUYER 
What you say is wonderful.

PYTHAGOREAN 
And beside all that I have said, thou shalt learn

 

that thou, who thinkest thyself a single individual,
art one person in semblance and another in reality.
 
 BUYER 
What’s that? I am another and not this man
who now talks to you!
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Now thou art he, but erstwhile thou didst manifest thyself in another body and under another name,
and in time thou shalt again migrate into another
person.
 
 BUYER 
You mean that I shall be immortal, changing into
many forms? But enough of this.

How do you
stand in the matter of diet ?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
I eat nothing at all that hath life, but all else save
beans.
 
 BUYER 
Why so? Do you dislike beans?
 
 PYTHAGOREAN 
Nay, but they are holy, and wonderful is their
nature. First, they are nought but seed of man, and
if thou open a bean while it is still green, thou wilt
see that it resembleth in structure the member of a
man ; and again, if thou cook it and set it in the
light of the moon for a fixed number of nights, thou
wilt make blood. But more than this, the
Athenians are wont to choose their magistrates with
beans. 

 

 BUYER 
You have explained everything duly and sacerdotally. Come, strip, for I want to see you unclothed.
Heracles! His thigh is of gold! He seems to be a
god and not a mortal, so I shall certainly buy him.
(Yo Hermes.) What price do you sell him for ?
 
 HERMES 
Ten minas.
 
 BUYER 
I'll take him at that figure.
 
 ZEUS 
Write down the buyer’s name and where he comes
from.
 
 HERMES 
He appears to be an Italian, Zeus, one of those
who live in the neighbourhood of Croton and
Tarentum and the Greek settlements in that
quarter of the world. But there is more than one
buyer; about three hundred have bought him in
shares. 
 ZEUS 
Let them take him away ; let us bring on another.

HERMES 
Do you want the dirty one over yonder, from the
Black Sea ? 
 ZEUS 
By all means.
 
 HERMES 
You there with the wallet slung about you, you

 

with the sleeveless shirt, come and walk about the
room. I offer for sale a manly philosophy, a noble
philosophy, a free philosophy ; who'll buy ?
 
 BUYER 
Crier, what’s that you say? Are you selling
someone who is free ?
 
 HERMES 
That I am.
 
 BUYER 
Then aren’t you afraid he may have the law on
you for kidnapping or even summon you to the
Areopagus ?
 
 HERMES 
He doesn’t mind being sold, for he thinks that
he is free anyhow.
 
 BUYER 
What use could a man make of him, filthy as he is,
and in such a wretched condition? However, he
might be made a shoveller or a drawer of water.
 
 HERMES 
Not only that, but if you make him doorkeeper,
you will find him far more trusty than a dog. In
tact, he is even called a dog. 
 BUYER 
Where is he from, and what creed does he profess ?
 
 HERMES 
Ask the man himself; it is better to do so.
 
 BUYER 
I am afraid of his sullen, hang-dog look; he may
bark at me if I go near him, or even bite me, by
Zeus! Don’t you see how he has his cudgel poised

 

and his brows bent, and scowls in a threatening,
angry way?
 
 HERMES 
Don’t be afraid ; he is gentle.

BUYER 
First of all, my friend, where are you from?
 
 CYNIC 
Everywhere.
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean ?
 
 CYNIC 
You see in me a citizen of the world.
 
 BUYER 
Whom do you take for your pattern ?
 
 CYNIC 
Heracles.
 
 BUYER 
Then why don’t you wear a lion’s skin? For as
to the cudgel, you are like him in that.
 
 CYNIC 
This short cloak is my lion-skin; and I am a
soldier like him, fighting against pleasures, no conscript but a volunteer, purposing to make life clean.
 
 BUYER 
A fine purpose! But what do you know best, and
what is your business?
 
 CYNIC 
I am a liberator of men and a physician to their
ills; in short I desire to be an interpreter of truth
and free speech.

BUVER 
Very good, interpreter! But if IT buy you, what
course of training will you give me ?
 
 CYNIC 
First, after taking you in charge, stripping you of
your luxury and shackling you to want, I will puta
short cloak on you. Next I will compel you to
undergo pains and hardships, sleeping on the ground,
drinking nothing but water and filling yourself with
any food that comes your way. As for your money,
in case you have any, if you follow my advice you
will throw it into the sea forthwith. You will take
no thought for marriage or children or native land:
all that will be sheer nonsense to you, and you will
leave the house of your fathers and make your home
in atomb or a deserted tower or even a jar. Your
wallet will be full of lupines, and of papyrus rolls
written on both sides. Leading this life you
will say that you are happier than the Great King ;
and if anyone flogs you or twists you on the rack,
you will think that there is nothing painful in it.
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean by not feeling pain when I am
flogged? I am not enclosed in the carapace of a
turtle or a crab !
 
 CYNIC 
You will put in practice the saying of Euripides,
slightly revised.
 
 BUYER 
What saying?

 

 CYNIC 
Your mind will suffer, but your tongue will not.

The traits that you should possess in particular are
these : you should be impudent and bold, and should
abuse all and each, both kings and commoners, for
thus they will admire you and think you manly. Let
your language be barbarous, your voice discordant
and just like the barking of a dog: let your expression be set, and your gait consistent with your
expression. In a word, let everything about you be
bestial and savage. Put off modesty, decency and
moderation, and wipe away blushes from your face
completely. Frequent the most crowded place, and
in those very places desire to be solitary and uncommunicative, greeting nor friend nor stranger; for to
do so is abdication of the empire. Do boldly in full
view of all what another would not do in secret ;
choose the most ridiculous ways of satisfying your
lust ; and at the last, if you like, eat a raw devilfish
or squid, and die. That is the bliss we vouchsafe
you.

BUYER 
Get out with you! The life you talk of is
abominable and inhuman.
 
 CYNIC 
But at all events it is easy, man, and no trouble
for all to follow ; for you will not need education and
doctrine and drivel, but this road is a short cut to
fame. Even if you are an unlettered man,—a tanner

 

or a fish-man or a carpenter or a money-changer—
there will be nothing to hinder you from being
wondered at, if only you have impudence and _ boldness and learn how to abuse people properly.
 
 BUYER 
I do not want you for any such purpose, but you
might do at a pinch for a boatman or a gardener, and
only then if my friend here is willing to sell you for
two obols at the outside.
 
 HERMES 
He’s yours: take him. We shall be glad to get
rid of him because he is annoying and loud-mouthed
and insults and abuses everybody without exception.

ZEUS 
Call another; the Cyrenaic in the purple cloak,
with the wreath on his head. 
 HERMES 
Come now, attend, everyone! Here we have
high-priced wares, wanting a rich buyer. Here you
are with the sweetest philosophy, the thrice-happy
philosophy! Who hankers for high living? Who'll
buy the height of luxury?
 
 BUYER 
Come here and tell me what you know ; I will buy
you if you are of any use.
 
 HERMES 
Don’t bother him, please, sir, and don’t question
him, for he is drunk, and so can’t answer you
because his tongue falters, as you observe.

 

 BUYER 
Who that is in his senses would buy so corrupt and
lawless a slave? How he reeks of myrrh, and how
he staggers and reels in his gait! But you yourself,
Hermes, might tell me what traits he has and what
his object in life is.
 
 HERMES 
In general, he is accommodating to live with, satisfactory to drink with, and handy to accompany
an amorous and profligate master when he riots
about town with a flute-girl, Moreover, he is a
connoisseur in pastries and a highly expert cook: in
short, a Professor of Luxury. He was educated in
Athens, and entered service in Sicily, at the court of
the tyrants, with whom he enjoyed high favour.
The sum and substance of his creed is to despise
everything, make use of everything and cull pleasure
from every source.
 
 BUYER 
You had better look about for someone else, among
these rich and wealthy people ; for I can’t afford to
buy a jolly life.
 
 HERMES 
It looks as if this fellow would be left on our
hands, Zeus.

ZEUS 
Remove him ; bring on another—stay ! those two,
the one from Abdera who laughs and the one from
Ephesus who cries, for I want to sell them together. 

 

 HERMES 
Come down among us, you two. I sell the two
best philosophies; we offer the two that are sagest
of all.
 
 BUYER 
Zeus ! What a contrast! One of thei never stops
laughing, and the other is apparently mourning a
death, as he weeps incessantly. What is the matter,
man? Why are you laughing?
 
 DEMOCRITEAN 
Dost thou need to ask? Because to me it seemeth
that all your affairs are laughable, and yourselves as
well.
 
 BUYER 
What, are you laughing at us all, and do you think
nothing of our affairs?
 
 DEMOCRITEAN 
Even so; for there is nothing serious in them, but
everything is a hollow mockery, drift of atoms,
infinitude.
 
 BUYER 
No indeed, but you yourself are a hollow mockery
in very truth and an infinite ass.

Oh, what effrontery! Will you never stop laughing? (Zo the other.)
But you, why do youcry? For I think it is much
more becoming to talk with you.
 
 HERACLITEAN 
Because I consider, O stranger, that the affairs of
man are woeful and tearful, and there is naught in
them that is not foredoomed; therefore I pity and
grieve for men. And their present woes I do not
consider great, but those to come in future will be
wholly bitter; I speak of the great conflagrations

 

and the collapse of the universe. It is for this that
I grieve, and because nothing is fixed, but all things are in a manner stirred up into porridge, and joy and joylessness, wisdom and unwisdom, great and small are all but the same, circling about, up and down, and interchanging in the game of Eternity.

 
 BUYER 
And what is Eternity ?
 
 HERACLITEAN 
A child playing a game, moving counters, in discord, in concord.
 
 BUYER 
What are men?
 
 HERACLITEAN 
Mortal gods.
 
 BUYER 
And the Gods ?
 
 HERACLITEAN 
Immortal men.
 
 BUYER 
Are you telling riddles, man, or making conundrums? You are just like Apollo, for you say
nothing plainly. 
 HERACLITEAN 
Because you matter naught to me.
 
 BUYER 
Then nobody in his sense will buy you.
 
 HERACLITEAN 
I bid ye go weep, one and all, buy you or buy you
not.

 

 BUYER 
This fellow’s trouble is not far removed from
insanity. However, I for my part will not buy
either of them.
 
 HERMES 
They are left unsold also.
 
 ZEUS 
Put up another.

HERMES 
Do you want the Athenian over there, who has so
much to say? 
 ZEUS 
By all means.
 
 HERMES 
Come here, sir. We are putting up a righteous
and intelligent philosophy. Who'll buy the height
of sanctity ?
 
 BUYER 
Tell me what you know best ?
 
 ACADEMIC 
I am a lover, and wise in matters of love.
 
 BUYER 
How am I to buy you, then? What I wanted was
a tutor for my son, who is handsome.
 
 ACADEMIC 
But who would be more suitable than I to associate
with a handsome lad? It is not the body I love, it
is the soul that I hold beautiful. As a matter of

 

fact, even if they lie beneath the same cloak with
me, they will tell you that I have done them no
wrong. 
 BUYER 
I can’t believe what you say, that you, though a
lover, take no interest in anything beyond the soul,
even when you have the opportunity, lying beneath
the same cloak.

ACADEMIC 
But I swear to you by the dog and the plane-tree
that this is so.
 
 BUYER 
Heracles! What curious gods!
 
 ACADEMIC 
What is that you say? Don’t you think the dog
is a god? Don’t you know about Anubis in Egypt,
how great he is, and about Sirius in the sky and
Cerberus in the world below ?

BUYER 
Quite right ; I was entirely mistaken. But what
is your manner of life?
 
 ACADEMIC 
I dwell in a city that I created for myself, using
an imported constitution and enacting statutes of
my own. 
 BUYER 
I should like to hear one of your enactments.
 
 ACADEMIC 
Let me tell you the most important one, the view


 

that I hold about wives ; it is that none of thei shall
belong solely to any one man, but that everyone who so
desires may share the rights of the husband.
 
 BUYER 
You mean by this that you have abolished the
laws against adultery ?
 
 ACADEMIC 
Yes, and in a word, all this pettiness about such
matters.
 
 BUYER 
What is your attitude as to pretty boys?
 
 ACADEMIC 
Their kisses shall be a guerdon for the bravest
after they have done some splendid, reckless deed.

BUYER 
My word, what generosity! And what is the gist
of your wisdom ?
 
 ACADEMIC 
My “ideas”; I mean the patterns of existing
things: for of everything that you behold, the
earth, with all that is upon it, the sky, the sea,
invisible images exist outside the universe.
 
 BUYER 
Where do they exist ?
 
 ACADEMIC 
Nowhere ; for if they were anywhere, they would
not be. 
 BUYER 
I do not see these patterns that you speak of.


 

 ACADEMIC 
Of course not, for the eye of your soul is blind ;
but I see images of everything,—an invisible “you,”
another “me,” and in a word, two of everything.
 
 BUYER 
Then I must buy you for your wisdom and your
sharp sight. (Zo Hermes.) Come, let’s see what price
you will make me for him?
 
 HERMES 
Give me two talents.
 
 BUYER 
He is sold to me at the price you mention, But
I will pay the money later on.

HERMES 
What is your name?
 
 BUYER 
Dion of Syracuse. 
 HERMES 
He is yours; take him, with good luck to you.
Epicurean, I want you now. Who will buy him?
He is a pupil of the laugher yonder and of the
drunkard, both of whom we put up a short time ago. 
In one way, however, he knows more than they,
because he is more impious. Besides, he is agreeable
and fond of good eating.
 
 BUYER 
What is his price?
 
 HERMES 
Two minas.

 

 BUYER 
Here you are. But, say! I want to know what
food he likes.
 
 HERMES 
He eats sweets and honey-cakes, and, above all,
figs.
 
 BUYER 
No trouble about that; we shall buy him cakes of
pressed figs from Caria.

ZEUS 
Call another, the one over there with the cropped
head, the dismal fellow from the Porch.
 
 HERMES 
Quite right; at all events it looks as if the men
who frequent the public square were waiting for him
in great numbers. I sell virtue itself, the most
perfect of philosophies. Who wants to be the only
one to know everything ?
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean by that?
 
 HERMES 
That he is the only wise man, the only handsome
man, the only just man, brave man, king, orator,
rich man, lawgiver, and everything else that
there is. 
 BUYER 
Then he is the only cook,—yes and the only
tanner or carpenter, and so forth ?


 

 HERMES 
So it appears.

BUYER 
Come here, my good fellow, and tell your buyer
what you are like, and first of all whether you are
not displeased with being sold and living in slavery?
 
 STOIC 
Not at all, for these things are not in our control,
and all that is not in our control is immaterial.
 
 BUYER 
I don’t understand what you mean by this.
 
 STOIC 
What, you do not understand that of such things
some are “approved,” and some, to the contrary,
“disapproved”’ ? 
 BUYER 
Even now I do not understand.
 
 STOIC 
Of course not, for you are not familiar with our
vocabulary and have not the faculty of forming concepts; but a scholar who has mastered the science of
logic knows not only this, but what predicaments
and bye-predicaments are, and how they differ from
each other. 
 BUYER 
In the name of wisdom, don’t begrudge telling me



 

at least what predicaments and bye-predicaments are ;
for I am somehow impressed by the rhythm of the
terms.
 
 STOIC 
Indeed, I do not begrudge it at all. If a man who
is lame dashes his lame foot against a stone and
receives an unlooked-for injury, he was already in a
predicament, of course, with his lameness, and with
his injury he gets into a bye-predicament too.

BUYER 
Oh, what subtlety! And what else do you claim to
know best ?
 
 STOIC 
The word-snares with which I entangle those who
converse with me and stop their mouths and make
them hold their peace, putting a very muzzle on
them. This power is called the syllogism of wide
renown. 
 BUYER 
Heracles! An invincible and mighty thing, by
what you say.
 
 STOIC 
See for yourself. Have you a child?
 
 BUYER 
What of it ?
 
 STOIC 
If a crocodile should seize it on finding it straying
beside the river, and then should promise to give it
back to you if you told him truly what he intended

 

to do about giving it back, what would you say he
had made up his mind to do? 
 BUYER 
Your question is hard to answer, for I don’t know
which alternative I should follow in my reply, in
order to get back the child. Come, in Heaven’s
name answer it yourself and save the child for me,
for fear the beast may get ahead of us and devour it !
 
 STOIC 
Courage! I'll teach you other things that are more
wonderful.
 
 BUYER 
What are they ?
 
 STOIC 
The Reaper, the Master, and above all, the Electra
and the Veiled Figure.
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean by the Veiled Figure and the
Electra ?
 
 STOIC 
The Electra is the famous Electra, the daughter of
Agamemnon, who at once knew and did not know
the same thing; for when Orestes stood beside her
before the recognition she knew that Orestes was



 

her brother, but did not know that this was Orestes. 
As to the Veiled Figure, you shall hear a very
wonderful argument. Tell me, do you know your
own father ?
 
 BUYER 
Yes.
 
 STOIC 
But if I put a veiled figure before you and asked
you if you know him, what will you say?
 
 BUYER 
That I don’t, of course.

STOIC 
But the veiled figure turns out to be your own
father ; so if you don’t know him, you evidently don’t
know your own father.
 
 BUYER 
Not so: I should unveil him and find out the
truth! But to go on—what is the purpose of your
wisdom, and what shall you do when you reach the
summit of virtue ?
 
 STOIC 
I shall then devote myself to the chief natural
goods, I mean wealth, health, and the like. But
first I must go through many preparatory toils,
whetting my eyesight with closely-written books,



 

collecting learned comments and stufting myself with
solecisms and uncouth words; and to cap all, a man
may not become wise until he has taken the hellebore
treatment three times running. 
 BUYER 
These projects of yours are noble and dreadfully
courageous. But tobe a Gnipho and a usurer—for I
see that this is one of your traits too—what shall we
say of this? That it is the mark of a man who has
already taken his hellebore-treatment and is consumuinate in virtue ?
 
 STOIC 
Yes; at any rate money-lending is especially
appropriate to a wise man, for as drawing inferences
is a specialty of his, and as money-lending and
drawing interest is next-door to drawing inferences,
the one, like the other, belongs particularly to the
scholar: and not only getting simple interest, like
other people, but interest upon interest. For don’t
you know that there is a first interest and a second
interest, the offspring, as it were, of the first? And
you surely perceive what logic says: “If he gets
the first interest, he will get the second; but he
will get the first, ergo he will get the second.”

BUYER 
Then we are to say the same of the fees that you
get for your wisdom from young men, and obviously
none but the scholar will get paid for his virtue ?


 

 STOIC 
Your understanding of the matter is correct. You
see, I donot take pay on my own account, but for the
sake of the giver himself: for since there are two
classes of men, the disbursive and the receptive, I
train myself to be receptive and my pupil to be
disbursive.
 
 BUYER 
On the contrary, the young man ought to be
receptive and you, who alone are rich, disbursive !
 
 STOIC 
You are joking, man. Look out that I don’t shoot
you with my indemonstrable syllogism. 
 BUYER 
What have I to fear from that shaft ?
 
 STOIC 
Perplexity and aphasia and a sprained intellect.

But the great thing is that if I wish I can turn you
into a stone forthwith.
 
 BUYER 
How will you turn me into a stone? You are not
a Perseus, I think, my dear fellow.
 
 STOIC 
In this way. Isa stone a substance?
 
 BUYER 
Yes.
 
 STOIC 
And how about this—is not an animal a substance ?
 
 BUYER 
Yes.

 

 STOIC 
And you are an animal ?
 
 BUYER 
So it appears, anyhow.
 
 STOIC 
Then you are a substance, and therefore a stone !
 
 BUYER 
Don’t say that! Distribute my middle, for
Heaven’s sake, and make me a man again.
 
 STOIC 
That is not difficult. Be a man once more !—Tell
me, is every substance an animal?
 
 BUYER 
No.
 
 STOIC 
Well, is a stone an animal?
 
 BUYER 
No.
 
 STOIC 
You are a substance?
 
 BUYER 
Yes.
 
 STOIC 
But even if you are a substance, you are an animal.
 
 BUYER 
Yes.
 
 STOIC 
Then you are not a stone, being an animal.
 
 BUYER 
Thank you kindly ; my legs were already as cold
and solid as Niobe’s. Iwill buy you. (Zo uunmes.)
How much have I to pay for him?

 

 HERMES 
Twelve minas.
 
 BUYER 
Here you are.
 
 HERMES 
Are you the sole purchaser ?
 
 BUYER 
No, indeed; there are all these men whom you
see.
 
 HERMES 
Yes, there are many of them, heavy-shouldered
fellows, fit associates for the Reaper.

ZEUS 
Don’t delay ; call another, the Peripatetic.
 
 HERMES 
(To renivatetic.) I say, you who are handsome,
you who are rich! (Yo the buyers.) Come now,
buy the height of intelligence, the one who knows
absolutely everything !
 
 BUYER 
What is he like!
 
 HERMES 
Moderate, gentlemanly, adaptable in his way of
living, and, what is more, he is double.
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean?
 
 HERMES 
Viewed from the outside, he seems to be one man,
and from the inside, another ; so if you buy him, be
sure to call the one self “exoteric” and the
other “esoteric.”
 
 BUYER 
What does he know best ?

 

 HERMES 
That goods are threefold, in the soul, in the body,
and in things external. 
 BUYER 
He has common sense. How much is he?
 
 HERMES 
Twenty minas.
 
 BUYER 
Your price is high.
 
 HERMES 
Not so, bless you, for he himself appears to have a
bit of money, so you can’t be too quick about buying
him. Besides, he will tell you at once how long a
gnat lives, how far down into the sea the sunlight
reaches, and what the soul of an oyster is like.
 
 BUYER 
Heracles, what insight !
 
 HERMES 
What if I should tell you of other information
demanding far keener vision, about sperm and
conception and the shaping of the embryo in the
womb, and how man is a creature that laughs, while
asses do not laugh, and neither do they build houses
nor sail boats.
 
 BUYER 
This is high and helpful information that you tell
of, so I shall buy him for the twenty minas.

HERMES 
Very well.
 
 ZEUS 
Whom have we left ?

 

 HERMES 
This Sceptic is still on our hands. Reddy, come
here and be put up without delay. The crowd
is already drifting away, and there will be but few
at his sale. However,—who'll buy this one?
 
 BUYER 
I will. But first tell me, what do you know?
 
 SCEPTIC 
Nothing.
 
 BUYER 
What do you mean by that?
 
 SCEPTIC 
That in my opinion nothing at all exists.
 
 BUYER 
Then do not we exist ?
 
 SCEPTIC 
I don’t even know that.
 
 BUYER 
Not even that you yourself exist ?
 
 SCEPTIC 
I am far more uncertain about that.
 
 BUYER 
Oh, what a state of doubt? But what are these
scales of yours for ?
 
 SCEPTIC 
I weigh arguments in them and make them
balance one another, and when I see they are

 

precisely alike and equal in weight, then, ah! then
I do not know which is the truer.
 
 BUYER 
What else can you do fairly well ?
 
 SCEPTIC 
Everything except catch a runaway slave.
 
 BUYER 
Why can’t you do that?
 
 SCEPTIC 
Because, my dear sir, I am unable to apprehend
anything. 
 BUYER 
Of course, for you look to be slow and lazy. But
what is the upshot of your wisdom ?
 
 SCEPTIC 
Ignorance, and failure of hearing and vision.
 
 BUYER 
Then you mean being both deaf and blind?
 
 SCEPTIC 
Yes, and devoid of judgement and feeling, and, in a
word, no better than a worm.
 
 BUYER 
I must buy you for that reason. (Zo uenmes.)
How much may I call him worth?
 
 HERMES 
An Attie mina.
 
 BUYER 
Here you are. (Yo scertic.) What have you to
say, fellow? Have I bought you?

 

 SCEPTIC 
Doubtful.
 
 BUYER 
No, indeed, I have bought you and paid the price
in cash.
 
 SCEPTIC 
I am suspending judgement on that point and
thinking it over.
 
 BUYER 
Come now, fellow, walk along behind me as my
servant should.
 
 SCEPTIC 
Who knows if what you say is true?
 
 BUYER 
The crier, the mina, and the men present.
 
 SCEPTIC 
Is there anyone here present ?
 
 BUYER 
Come, I'll chuck you into the mill and convince
you that I am your master, with sorry logic!
 
 SCEPTIC 
Suspend judgement on that point.
 
 BUYER 
No, by Heaven! I have already affirmed my
judgement.
 
 HERMES 
(To scertic.) Stop hanging back and go with
your buyer. (Zo the company.) We invite you all
here to-morrow, for we intend to put up for sale the
careers of laymen, workingmen, and tradesmen.
