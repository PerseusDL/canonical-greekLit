The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.

Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be
healthy, even as your soul prospers.

For I rejoiced greatly, when
brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in
truth.

I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children
walking in truth.

Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for
those who are brothers and strangers.

They have testified about
your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on
their journey in a manner worthy of God,

because for the sake of
the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.

We
therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the
truth.

I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first
among them, doesn't accept what we say.

Therefore, if I come, I
will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us
with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself
receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of
the assembly.

Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but
that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil hasn't
seen God.

Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth
itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.

I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to
write to you with ink and pen;

but I hope to see you soon, and
we will speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you.
Greet the friends by name.
