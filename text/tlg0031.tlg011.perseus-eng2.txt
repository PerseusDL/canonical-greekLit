Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;

 To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the
overseers and deacons:

Grace to you, and peace from God, our
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I thank my God whenever I
remember you,

always in every request of mine on behalf of you
all making my requests with joy,

for your fellowship in
furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;

being
confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will
complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.

It is even right for
me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my
heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of
the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace.

For God is my
witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ
Jesus.

This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and all discernment;

so that you may approve the
things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense
to the day of Christ;

being filled with the fruits of
righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise
of God.

Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things
which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the
gospel;

so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard,
and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;

and that most
of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more
abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.

Some
indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of
good will.

The former insincerly preach Christ from selfish
ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;

but
the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of
the gospel.

What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in
pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and
will rejoice.

For I know that this will turn out to my
salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ,

according to my earnest expectation and hope, that
I will in no way be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, now
also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.

For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

But if I
live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't
make known what I will choose.

But I am in a dilemma between the
two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far
better.

Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your
sake.

Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes,
and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,

that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my
presence with you again.

Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of
Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of
your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving
for the faith of the gospel;

and in nothing frightened by the
adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of
salvation, and that from God.

Because it has been granted to you
on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on
his behalf,

having the same conflict which you saw in me, and
now hear is in me.

If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any
consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender
mercies and compassion,

make my joy full, by being like-minded,
having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;

doing
nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each
counting others better than himself;

each of you not just looking
to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.

Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,

who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider it robbery to be
equal with God,

but emptied himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men.

And being found in
human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the
death of the cross.

Therefore God also highly exalted him, and
gave to him the name which is above every name;

that at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and
those under the earth,

and that every tongue should confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only
in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.

For it is God who works in
you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.

Do all
things without murmurings and disputes,

that you may become
blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of
a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in
the world,

holding up the word of life; that I may have
something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor
labor in vain.

Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and
service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.

In
the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.

But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon,
that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.

For
I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.

For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.

But
you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he
served with me in furtherance of the gospel.

Therefore I hope to
send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.

But I
trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.

But I
counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow
worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need;

since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you
had heard that he was sick.

For indeed he was sick, nearly to
death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also,
that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.

I have sent him
therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may
rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

Receive him
therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,

because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life
to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.

Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.

Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the
false circumcision.

For we are the circumcision, who worship God
in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in
the flesh;

though I myself might have confidence even in the
flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I
yet more:

circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of
the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a
Pharisee;

concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning
the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.

However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted
loss for Christ.

Yes most assuredly, and I count all things to be
loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for
whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but
refuse, that I may gain Christ

and be found in him, not having a
righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is
through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;

that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;

if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I
press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was
taken hold of by Christ Jesus.

Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but
one thing I do. Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching
forward to the things which are before,

I press on toward the
goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in
anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.

Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let us walk
by the same rule. Let us be of the same mind.

Brothers, be
imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you
have us for an example.

For many walk, of whom I told you often,
and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,

whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose
glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.

For our
citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the
Lord Jesus Christ;

who will change the body of our humiliation
to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by
which he is able even to subject all things to himself.

Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and
crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.

I exhort Euodia,
and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.

Yes, I
beg you also, true yoke-fellow, help these women, for they labored with
me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers,
whose names are in the book of life.

Rejoice in the Lord always!
Again I will say, Rejoice!

Let your gentleness be known to all
men. The Lord is at hand.

In nothing be anxious, but in
everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests
be made known to God.

The peace of God, which surpasses all
understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things
are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,
whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if
there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these
things.

The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in
me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

But
I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your
thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked
opportunity.

Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have
learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.

I know how
to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all
things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry,
both to abound and to be in need.

I can do all things through
Christ, who strengthens me.

However you did well that you had
fellowship with my affliction.

You yourselves also know, you
Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from
Macedonia, no assembly had fellowship with me in the matter of giving
and receiving but you only.

For even in Thessalonica you sent
once and again to my need.

Not that I seek for the gift, but I
seek for the fruit that increases to your account.

But I have
all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus
the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an
acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.

My God will
supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ
Jesus.

Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!
Amen.

Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with
me greet you.

All the saints greet you, especially those who are
of Caesar's household.

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.
