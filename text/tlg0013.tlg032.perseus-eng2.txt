And next, sweet voiced Muses, daughters of Zeus, well-skilled in song, tell of the
 long-winged Moon. From her
 immortal head a radiance is shown from heaven and embraces earth; and great is the beauty
 that ariseth

from her shining light. The air, unlit before, glows with the light of her golden
 crown, and her rays beam clear, whensoever bright Selene having bathed her lovely body in
 the waters of Ocean, and donned her far-gleaming raiment, and yoked her strong-necked,
 shining team,

drives on her long-maned horses at full speed, at eventime in the mid-month: then
 her great orbit is full and then her beams shine brightest as she increases. So she is a
 sure token and a sign to mortal men.

Once the Son of Cronos was joined with her in love; and she conceived and bare a
 daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods. Hail, white-armed goddess,
 bright Selene, mild, bright-tressed queen! And now I will leave you and sing the glories of
 men half-divine, whose deeds minstrels,

the servants of the Muses, celebrate with lovely lips.
