					<head>CHAPTER I. THE PROŒMIUM</head>
					<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> chronic diseases the pain is great, the period
						of wasting long, and the recovery uncertain; for either they are not
						dispelled at all, or the diseases relapse upon any slight error; for neither
						have the patients resolution to persevere to the end; or, if they do
						persevere, they commit blunders in a prolonged regimen. And if there also be
						the suffering from a painful system of cure,--of thirst, of hunger, of
						bitter and harsh medicines, of cutting or burning,--of all which there is
						sometimes need in protracted diseases, the patients resile as truly
						preferring even death itself. Hence, indeed, is developed the talent of the
						medical man, his perseverance, his skill in diversifying the treatment, and
						conceding such pleasant things as will do no harm, and in giving
						encouragement. But the patient also ought to be courageous, and co-operate
						with the physician against the disease. For, taking a firm grasp of the
						body, the disease not only wastes and corrodes it quickly, but</p>
					<pb n="294"/>
					<p>frequently disorders the senses, nay, even deranges the soul by the
						intemperament of the body. Such we know mania and melancholy to be, of which
						I will treat afterwards. At the present time I shall give an account of <hi

					<head>CHAPTER II. ON CEPHALÆA</head>
					<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> the head be suddenly seized with pain from a
						temporary cause, even if it should endure for several days, the disease is
						called Cephalalgia. But if the disease be protracted for a long time, and
						with long and frequent periods, or if greater and more untractable symptoms
						supervene, we call it Cephalæa.</p>
					<p>There are infinite varieties of it; for, in certain cases, the pain is
						incessant and slight, but not intermittent; but in others it returns
						periodically, as in quotidian fevers, or in those which have exacerbations
						every alternate day: in others it continues from sunset to noon, and then
						completely ceases; or from noon to evening, or still further into night;
						this period is not much protracted. And in certain cases the whole head is
						pained; and the pain is sometimes on the right and sometimes on the left
						side, or the forehead, or the bregma; and these may all occur the same day
						in a random manner.</p>
					<p>But in certain cases, the parts on the right side, or those on the left
						solely, so far that a separate temple, or ear, or one eyebrow, or one eye,
						or the nose which divides the face into two equal parts; and the pain does
						not pass this limit, but remains in the half of the head. This is called <hi
							rend="ital">Heterocrania</hi>, an illness by no means mild, even though
						it intermits, and although it appears to be slight. For if at any time it
						set in acutely, it occasions unseemly and dreadful symptoms; spasm</p>
					<pb n="295"/>
					<p>and distortion of the countenance take place; the eyes either fixed intently
						like horns, or they are rolled inwardly to this side or to that; vertigo,
						deep-seated pain of the eyes as far as the meninges; irrestrainable sweat;
						sudden pain of the tendons, as of one striking with a club; nausea; vomiting
						of bilious matters; collapse of the patient; but, if the affection be
						protracted, the patient will die; or, if more slight and not deadly, it
						becomes chronic; there is much torpor, heaviness of the head, anxiety, and
							<hi rend="ital">ennui.</hi> For they flee the light; the darkness
						soothes their disease: nor can they bear readily to look upon or hear
						anything agreeable; their sense of smell is vitiated, neither does anything
						agreeable to smell delight them, and they have also an aversion to fetid
						things: the patients, moreover, are weary of life, and wish to die.</p>
					<p>The cause of these symptoms is coldness with dryness. But if it be protracted
						and increase, as regards the pains, the affection becomes Vertigo.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER III. ON VERTIGO, OR SCOTOMA</head>
					<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> darkness possess the eyes, and if the head be
						whirled round with dizziness, and the ears ring as from the sound of rivers
						rolling along with a great noise, or like the wind when it roars among the
						sails, or like the clang of pipes or reeds, or like the rattling of a
						carriage, we call the affection <hi rend="ital">Scotoma</hi> (or <hi
							rend="ital">Vertigo</hi>); a bad complaint indeed, if a symptom of the
						head, but bad likewise if the sequela of cephalæa, or whether it arises of
						itself as a chronic disease. For, if these symptoms do not pass off, but the
						vertigo persist, or if, in course of time, from the want of any one to
						remedy, it is</p>
					<pb n="296"/>
					<p>completed in its own peculiar symptoms, the affection vertigo is formed, from
						a humid and cold cause. But if it turn to an incurable condition, it proves
						the commencement of other affections--of mania, melancholy, or epilepsy, the
						symptoms peculiar to each being superadded. But the mode of vertigo is,
						heaviness of the head, sparkles of light in the eyes along with much
						darkness, ignorance of themselves and of those around; and, if the disease
						go on increasing, the limbs sink below them, and they crawl on the ground;
						there is nausea and vomitings of phlegm, or of yellow or black bilious
						matter. When connected with yellow bile, mania is formed; when with black,
						melancholy; when with phlegm, epilepsy; for it is liable to conversion into
						all these diseases.</p>
				</div>
				<div type="chapter" n="4">
					<head>CHAPTER IV. ON EPILEPSY</head>
					<p>E<hi rend="smallcaps">PILEPSY</hi> is an illness of various shapes and
						horrible; in the paroxysms, brutish, very acute, and deadly; for, at times,
						one paroxysm has proved fatal. Or if from habit the patient can endure it,
						he lives, indeed, enduring shame, ignominy, and sorrow: and the disease does
						not readily pass off, but fixes its abode during the better periods and in
						the lovely season of life. It dwells with boys and young men; and, by good
						fortune, it is sometimes driven out in another more advanced period of life,
						when it takes its departure along with the beauty of youth; and then, having
						rendered them deformed, it destroys certain youths from envy, as it were, of
						their beauty, either by loss of the faculties of a hand, or by the
						distortion of the countenance, or by the deprivation of some one sense. But
						if the mischief lurk there until it strike root,</p>
					<pb n="297"/>
					<p>it will not yield either to the physician or the changes of age, so as to
						take its departure, but lives with the patient until death. And sometimes
						the disease is rendered painful by its convulsions and distortions of the
						limbs and of the face; and sometimes it turns the mind distracted. The sight
						of a paroxysm is disagreeable, and its departure disgusting with spontaneous
						evacuations of the urine and of the bowels.</p>
					<p>But also it is reckoned a disgraceful form of disease; for it is supposed,
						that it is an infliction on persons who have sinned against the Moon: and
						hence some have called it the Sacred Disease, and that for more reasons than
						one, as from the greatness of the evil, for the Greek word <foreign
							xml:lang="grc">I(ERO\S</foreign> also signifies <hi rend="ital"
							>great</hi>; or because the cure of it is not human, but divine; or from
						the opinion that it proceeded from the entrance of a demon into the man:
						from some one, or all these causes together, it has been called Sacred.</p>
					<p>Such symptoms as accompany this disease in its acute form have been already
						detailed by me. But if it become inveterate, the patients are not free from
						harm even in the intervals, but are languid, spiritless, stupid, inhuman,
						unsociable, and not disposed to hold intercourse, nor to be sociable, at any
						period of life; sleepless, subject to many horrid dreams, without appetite,
						and with bad digestion; pale, of a leaden colour; slow to learn, from
						torpidity of the understanding and of the senses; dull of hearing; have
						noises and ringing in the head; utterance indistinct and bewildered, either
						from the nature of the disease, or from the wounds during the attacks; the
						tongue is rolled about in the mouth convulsively in various ways. The
						disease also sometimes disturbs the understanding, so that the patient
						becomes altogether fatuous. The cause of these affections is coldness with
						humidity.</p>

				<div type="chapter" n="5">
					<head>CHAPTER V. ON MELANCHOLY</head>
					<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">LACK</hi> bile, if it make its appearance in acute
						diseases of the upper parts of the body, is very dangerous; or, if it pass
						downwards, it is not free from danger. But in chronic diseases, if it pass
						downward, it terminates in dysentery and pain of the liver. But in women it
						serves as a purgation instead of the menses, provided they are not otherwise
						in a dangerous condition. But if it be determined upwards to the stomach and
						diaphragm, it forms melancholy; for it produces flatulence and eructations
						of a fetid and fishy nature, and it sends rumbling wind downwards, and
						disturbs the understanding. On this account, in former days, these were
						called melancholics and flatulent persons. And yet, in certain of these
						cases, there is neither flatulence nor black bile, but mere anger and grief,
						and sad dejection of mind; and these were called melancholics, because the
						terms <hi rend="ital">bile</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">XOLH\</foreign>)
						and <hi rend="ital">anger</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">O)RGH\</foreign>)
						are synonymous in import, and likewise <hi rend="ital">black</hi> (<foreign
							xml:lang="grc">ME/LAINA</foreign>), with <hi rend="ital">much</hi>
							(<foreign xml:lang="grc">POLLH\</foreign>) and <hi rend="ital"
							>furious</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">QHRIW/DHS</foreign>). Homer is
						authority for this when he says:--</p>
					<p>"Then straight to speak uprose The Atreidan chief, who `neath his sway a
						wide-spread empire held: Sore vexed was he; his mighty heart in his dark
						bosom swelled With rage, and from his eyes the fire like lightning-flashes
							broke."<note n="1"><p>------------------- <foreign xml:lang="grc"

					<p>The melancholics become such when they are overpowered by this evil.</p>
					<p>It is a lowness of spirits from a single phantasy, without</p>
					<pb n="299"/>
					<p>fever; and it appears to me that melancholy is the commencement and a part of
						mania. For in those who are mad, the understanding is turned sometimes to
						anger and sometimes to joy, but in the melancholics to sorrow and
						despondency only. But they who are mad are so for the greater part of life,
						becoming silly, and doing dreadful and disgraceful things; but those
						affected with melancholy are not every one of them affected according to one
						particular form; but they are either suspicious of poisoning, or flee to the
						desert from misanthropy, or turn superstitious, or contract a hatred of
						life. Or if at any time a relaxation takes place, in most cases hilarity
						supervenes, but these persons go mad.</p>
					<p>But how, and from what parts of the body, the most of these complaints
						originate, I will now explain. If the cause remain in the hypochondriac
						regions, it collects about the diaphragm, and the bile passes upwards, or
						downwards in cases of melancholy. But if it also affects the head from
						sympathy, and the abnormal irritability of temper change to laughter and joy
						for the greater part of their life, these become mad rather from the
						increase of the disease than from change of the affection.</p>
					<p>Dryness is the cause of both. Adult men, therefore, are subject to mania and
						melancholy, or persons of less age than adults. Women are worse affected
						with mania than men. As to age, towards manhood, and those actually in the
						prime of life. The seasons of summer and of autumn engender, and spring
						brings it to a crisis.</p>
					<p>The characteristic appearances, then, are not obscure; for the patients are
						dull or stern, dejected or unreasonably torpid, without any manifest cause:
						such is the commencement of melancholy. And they also become peevish,
						dispirited, sleepless, and start up from a disturbed sleep.</p>
					<p>Unreasonable fear also seizes them, if the disease tend to increase, when
						their dreams are true, terrifying, and clear:</p>
					<pb n="300"/>
					<p>for whatever, when awake, they have an aversion to, as being an evil, rushes
						upon their visions in sleep. They are prone to change their mind readily; to
						become base, mean-spirited, illiberal, and in a little time, perhaps,
						simple, extravagant, munificent, not from any virtue of the soul, but from
						the changeableness of the disease. But if the illness become more urgent,
						hatred, avoidance of the haunts of men, vain lamentations; they complain of
						life, and desire to die. In many, the understanding so leads to
						insensibility and fatuousness, that they become ignorant of all things, or
						forgetful of themselves, and live the life of the inferior animals. The
						habit of the body also becomes perverted; colour, a darkish-green, unless
						the bile do not pass downward, but is diffused with the blood over the whole
						system. They are voracious, indeed, yet emaciated; for in them sleep does
						not brace their limbs either by what they have eaten or drunk, but
						watchfulness diffuses and determines them outwardly. Therefore the bowels
						are dried up, and discharge nothing; or, if they do, the dejections are
						dried, round, with a black and bilious fluid, in which they float; urine
						scanty, acrid, tinged with bile. They are flatulent about the hypochondriac
						region; the eructations fetid, virulent, like brine from salt; and sometimes
						an acrid fluid, mixed with bile, floats in the stomach. Pulse for the most
						part small, torpid, feeble, dense, like that from cold.</p>
					<p>A story is told, that a certain person, incurably affected, fell in love with
						a girl; and when the physicians could bring him no relief, love cured him.
						But I think that he was originally in love, and that he was dejected and
						spiritless from being unsuccessful with the girl, and appeared to the common
						people to be melancholic. He then did not know that it was love; but when he
						imparted the love to the girl, he ceased from his dejection, and dispelled
						his passion and sorrow; and with joy he awoke from his lowness of spirits,
						and he became restored to understanding, love being his physician.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER VI. ON MADNESS</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> modes of mania are infinite in species, but one
						alone in genus. For it is altogether a chronic derangement of the mind,
						without fever. For if fever at any time should come on, it would not owe its
						peculiarity to the mania, but to some other incident. Thus wine inflames to
						delirium in drunkenness; and certain edibles, such as mandragora and
						hyoscyamus, induce madness: but these affections are never called mania;
						for, springing from a temporary cause, they quickly subside, but madness has
						something confirmed in it. To this mania there is no resemblance in the
						dotage which is the calamity of old age, for it is a torpor of the senses,
						and a stupefaction of the gnostic and intellectual faculties by coldness of
						the system. But mania is something hot and dry in cause, and tumultuous in
						its acts. And, indeed, dotage commencing with old age never intermits, but
						accompanies the patient until death; while mania intermits, and with care
						ceases altogether. And there may be an imperfect intermission, if it take
						place in mania when the evil is not thoroughly cured by medicine, or is
						connected with the temperature of the season. For in certain persons who
						seemed to be freed from the complaint, either the season of spring, or some
						error in diet, or some incidental heat of passion, has brought on a
						relapse.</p>
					<p>Those prone to the disease, are such as are naturally passionate, irritable,
						of active habits, of an easy disposition, joyous, puerile; likewise those
						whose disposition inclines to the opposite condition, namely, such as are
						sluggish, sorrowful, slow to learn, but patient in labour, and who when they
						learn anything, soon forget it; those likewise are more prone to melancholy,
						who have formerly been in a mad condition. But in those periods of life with
						which much heat and blood are</p>
					<pb n="302"/>
					<p>associated, persons are most given to mania, namely, those about puberty,
						young men, and such as possess general vigour. But those in whom the heat is
						enkindled by black bile, and whose form of constitution is inclined to
						dryness, most readily pass into a state of melancholy. The diet which
						disposes to it is associated with voracity, immoderate repletion,
						drunkenness, lechery, venereal desires. Women also sometimes become affected
						with mania from want of purgation of the system, when the uterus has
						attained the development of manhood; but the others do not readily fall into
						mania, yet, if they do, their cases are difficult to manage. These are the
						causes; and they stir up the disease also, if from any cause an accustomed
						evacuation of blood, or of bile, or of sweating be stopped.</p>
					<p>And they with whose madness joy is associated, laugh, play, dance night and
						day, and sometimes go openly to the market crowned, as if victors in some
						contest of skill; this form is inoffensive to those around. Others have
						madness attended with anger; and these sometimes rend their clothes and kill
						their keepers, and lay violent hands upon themselves. This miserable form of
						disease is not unattended with danger to those around. But the modes are
						infinite in those who are ingenious and docile,--untaught astronomy,
						spontaneous philosophy, poetry truly from the muses; for docility has its
						good advantages even in diseases. In the uneducated, the common employments
						are the carrying of loads, and working at clay,--they are artificers or
						masons. They are also given to extraordinary phantasies; for one is afraid
						of the fall of the oilcruets ..... and another will not drink, as fancying
						himself a brick, and fearing lest he should be dissolved by the liquid.</p>
					<p>This story also is told:--A certain joiner was a skilful artisan while in the
						house, would measure, chop, plane, mortice, and adjust wood, and finish the
						work of the house correctly; would associate with the workmen, make a
						bargain with them,</p>
					<pb n="303"/>
					<p>and remunerate their work with suitable pay. While on the spot where the work
						was performed, he thus possessed his understanding. But if at any time he
						went away to the market, the bath, or on any other engagement, having laid
						down his tools, he would first groan, then shrug his shoulders as he went
						out. But when he had got out of sight of the domestics, or of the work and
						the place where it was performed, he became completely mad; yet if he
						returned speedily he recovered his reason again; such a bond of connection
						was there between the locality and his understanding.</p>
					<p>The cause of the disease is seated in the head and hypochondriac region,
						sometimes commencing in both together, and the one imparting it to the
						other. In mania and melancholy, the main cause is seated in the bowels, as
						in phrenitis it is mostly seated in the head and the senses. For in these
						the senses are perverted, so that they see things not present as if they
						were present, and objects which do not appear to others, manifest themselves
						to them; whereas persons who are mad see only as others see, but do not form
						a correct judgment on what they have seen.</p>
					<p>If, therefore, the illness be great, they are of a changeable temper, their
						senses are acute, they are suspicious, irritable without any cause, and
						unreasonably desponding when the disease tends to gloom; but when to
						cheerfulness, they are in excellent spirits; yet they are unusually given to
						insomnolency; both are changeable in countenance, have headache, or else
						heaviness of the head; they are sharp in hearing, but very slow in judgment;
						for in certain cases there are noises of the ears, and ringings like those
						of trumpets and pipes. But if the disease go on to increase, they are
						flatulent, affected with nausea, voracious and greedy in taking food, for
						they are watchful, and watchfulness induces gluttony. Yet they are not
						emaciated like persons in disease (<hi rend="ital">embonpoint</hi> is rather
						the condition of melancholics) and they are somewhat pale.</p>
					<pb n="304"/>
					<p>But if any of the viscera get into a state of inflammation, it blunts the
						appetite and digestion; the eyes are hollow, and do not wink; before the
						eyes are images of an azure or dark colour in those who are turning to
						melancholy, but of a redder colour when they are turning to mania, along
						with purplecoloured phantasmata, in many cases as if of flashing fire; and
						terror seizes them as if from a thunderbolt. In other cases the eyes are red
						and blood-shot.</p>
					<p>At the height of the disease they have impure dreams, and irresistible desire
						of venery, without any shame and restraint as to sexual intercourse; and if
						roused to anger by admonition or restraint, they become wholly mad.
						Wherefore they are affected with madness in various shapes; some run along
						unrestrainedly, and, not knowing how, return again to the same spot; some,
						after a long time, come back to their relatives; others roar aloud,
						bewailing themselves as if they had experienced robbery or violence. Some
						flee the haunts of men, and going to the wilderness, live by themselves.</p>
					<p>If they should attain any relaxation of the evil, they become torpid, dull,
						sorrowful; for having come to a knowledge of the disease they are saddened
						with their own calamity.</p>
					<p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">ANOTHER SPECIES OF
						MANIA</hi>.</hi></p>
					<p>Some cut their limbs in a holy phantasy, as if thereby propitiating peculiar
						divinities. This is a madness of the apprehension solely; for in other
						respects they are sane. They are roused by the flute, and mirth, or by
						drinking, or by the admonition of those around them. This madness is of
						divine origin, and if they recover from the madness, they are cheerful and
						free of care, as if initiated to the god; but yet they are pale and
						attenuated, and long remain weak from the pains of the wounds.<note n="1"

					<head>CHAPTER VII. ON PARALYSIS</head>
					<p><hi rend="ital">Apoplexy, Paraplegia, Paresis, Paralysis</hi>, are all
						generically the same. For they are all a defect of motion, or of touch, or
						of both; sometimes also of understanding, and sometimes of other sense. But
						apoplexy is a paralysis of the whole body, of sensation, of understanding
						and of motion; wherefore to get rid of a strong attack of apoplexy is
						impossible, and of a weak, not easy. But paraplegia is a remission of touch
						and motion, but of a part, either of the hand or of the leg. Paralysis for
						the most part is the remission (<hi rend="ital">paresis</hi>) of motion
						only, and of energy.<note n="1">It is difficult to find an appropriate word
							either in the Latin or English for the term <foreign xml:lang="grc"
								>PA/RESIS</foreign>. It would seem to be particularly applied to "a
							partial loss" either of sensibility or of motion. Alexander, however,
							makes little or no distinction between it and paralysis, x. 2.</note>
						But if the touch alone is wanting--(but such a case is rare)--the disease is
						called Anæsthesia rather than paresis. And when Hippocrates says, "the leg
						on the same side was apoplectic," he means to say that it was in a
						death-like, useless, and incurable state; for what is strong apoplexy in the
						whole body, that he calls paraplegia in the limb. <hi rend="ital"
							>Paresis</hi>, properly speaking, is applied to suppression or
						incontinence of urine in the bladder. But distortion of the eye-brows, and
						of the cheeks, and of the muscles about the jaws and chin to the other side,
						if attended with spasm, has got the appellation of Cynic spasm. Loss of tone
						in the knees, and of sensibility for a time, with torpor, fainting, and
						collapse, we call <hi rend="ital">lipothymia.</hi></p>
					<p>Wherefore, the parts are sometimes paralysed singly, as one eye-brow, or a
						finger, or still larger, a hand, or a leg; and sometimes more together; and
						sometimes the right or the left</p>
					<pb n="306"/>
					<p>only, or each by itself, or all together, either entirely or in a less
						degree; and the parts only which are distant, homonymous, and in pairs--the
						eyes, hands, and legs; and also the parts which cohere, as the nose on one
						side, the tongue to the middle line of separation, and the one tonsil, the
						isthmus faucium, and the parts concerned in deglutition to one half. I
						fancy, also, that sometimes the stomach, the bladder, and the rectum, as far
						as its extremity, suffers in like manner; but the internal parts, when in a
						paralytic state, are concealed from the sight. Their functions, however, are
						but half performed; and from this I conclude, that these parts are half
						affected, as being cut in twain by the disease. And, indeed, this thing
						teaches us a lesson in respect to the diversity of power and discrimination
						between the right side and the left. For the inherent cause is equal; and
						means which occasion the affection are common in both cases, whether cold or
						indigestion, and yet both do not suffer equally. For Nature is of equal
						power in that which is equally paired; but it is impossible that the same
						thing should happen where there is an inequality. If, therefore, the
						commencement of the affection be below the head, such as the membrane of the
						spinal marrow, the parts which are homonymous and connected with it are
						paralysed: the right on the right side, and the left on the left side. But
						if the head be primarily affected on the right side, the left side of the
						body will be paralysed; and the right, if on the left side. The cause of
						this is the interchange in the origins of the nerves, for they do not pass
						along on the same side, the right on the right side, until their
						terminations; but each of them passes over to the other side from that of
						its origin, decussating each other in the form of the letter X. To say all
						at once, whether all together or separate parts be affected with paralysis
						..... or of both; sometimes the nerves from the head suffer (these,
						generally, induce loss of sensibility, but, in a word, they do not readily
						occasion loss of sensibility; but if they sympathise with the</p>
					<pb n="307"/>

						it to those from the head; for the latter possess the greater part of their
						motory power from them, but yet have it, to a small extent, of themselves:
						the former, too, principally suffer loss of motion, but rarely of themselves

						ligaments of nerves, which derive their origin from certain of the bones,
						and terminate in others, be loosened or torn, the parts become powerless,
						and are impeded in their movements, but do not become insensible.<note n="3"

					<p>The varieties of paralysis are these: sometimes the limbs lose their
						faculties while in a state of extension, nor can they be brought back into
						the state of flexion, when they appear very much lengthened; and sometimes
						they are flexed and cannot be extended; or if forcibly extended, like a
						piece of wood on a rule, they become shorter than natural. The pupil of the
						eye is subject to both these varieties, for sometimes it is much expanded in
						magnitude, when we call it <hi rend="ital">Platycoria;</hi> but the pupil is
						also contracted to a small size, when I call it <hi rend="ital"
							>Phthisis</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Mydriasis.</hi> The bladder, also, is
						paralysed in respect to its peculiar functions; for either it loses its
						powers as regards distension, or it loses its retentive powers, or it
						becomes contracted in itself, when being filled with urine, it cannot expel
						the same. There are six causes of paralytic disorders; for they arise from a
						wound, a blow, exposure to cold, indigestion, venery, intoxication. But so
						likewise the vehement affections of the soul, such as astonishment, fear,
						dejection of spirits, and, in children, frights. Great and unexpected joy
						has also occasioned</p>
					<pb n="308"/>
					<p>paralysis, as, likewise, unrestrained laughter, even unto death. These,
						indeed, are the primary causes; but the ultimate and vital cause is
						refrigeration of the innate heat. It suffers from humidity, or dryness, and
						is more incurable than the other; but if also in connection with a wound,
						and complete cutting asunder of a nerve, it is incurable. In respect to age,
						the old are peculiarly subject, and difficult to cure; in children, the
						cases are easily restored. As to seasons, the winter; next, the spring;
						afterwards, the autumn; least of all, the summer. Of habits, those naturally
						gross, the humid, indolent, brutish.</p>
					<p>When the affections are confirmed, they are made manifest by loss of motion,
						insensibility of heat and cold; and also of plucking the hair, of tickling,
						and of touching. It is rare indeed when in them the extremities are painful;
						but insensibility to pain is not worse as regards recovery. Wherefore the
						disease occurs suddenly; but if at any time it have prolonged onsets, there
						supervene heaviness, difficulty of motion, torpor, a sensation of cold,
						sometimes an excess of heat, short sleeps, greater phantasies, when they
						become suddenly paralytic.</p>
					<p>But in the Cynic spasm, it is not usual for all parts of the face to be
						cramped; but those of the left side are turned to the right, and those of
						the right to the left, when there is a considerable distortion of the jaw to
						this side or to that, as if the jawbone were dislocated. And in certain of
						these cases, also, there is luxation at the joint, when in yawning the jaw
						is displaced to the opposite side: strabismus of the affected eye, and
						palpitation in the under eyelid; the upper eyelid also palpitates, sometimes
						along with the eye, and at other times alone. The lips are distended, each
						on its own side; but sometimes both being collapsed, they splutter; in
						others, they are closely compressed, and are suddenly separated so as to
						expel the common spittle with a noise.</p>
					<pb n="309"/>
					<p>The tongue, also, is drawn aside; for it consists of a muscle and nerves, and
						at certain times, along its whole extent, it starts up to the palate, and
						makes an unusual sound. The uvula, also, is drawn aside; and if the mouth is
						shut, there is an unexpected noise within. And if you separate the mouth,
						you will perceive the uvula sometimes attached to the palate through its
						whole surface, and sometimes swiftly palpitating with force, like a
						bag-fish, when likewise a sound is produced. But there is apt to be
						deception in cynic spasms; for to the spectator it appears as if the parts
						unaffected were those possessed by the disease; for owing to the tension and
						colour of the affected parts, and the enlargement of the eye, they appear as
						if they were diseased. But in laughter, speaking, or winking, the true state
						of matters becomes manifest; for the parts affected are all drawn aside with
						a smack; the lip expresses no smile, and is motionless in talking; the
						eyelid is immoveable, the eye fixed, and the sense of touch is lost; while
						the sound parts speak, wink, feel, laugh.</p>

						of empyema, but takes that of <hi rend="ital">Phthoe</hi> instead of it. It
						is accompanied with febrile heat of a continual character, but latent</p>
					<pb n="310"/>
					<p>ceasing, indeed, at no time, but concealed during the day by the sweating and
						coldness of the body; for the characteristics of phthoe are, that a febrile
						heat is lighted up, which breaks out at night, but during the day again lies
						concealed in the viscera, as is manifested by the uneasiness, loss of
						strength, and colliquative wasting. For had the febrile heat left the body
						during the day, how should not the patient have acquired flesh, strength,
						and comfortable feeling? For when it retires inwardly, the bad symptoms are
						all still further exacerbated, the pulse small and feeble; insomnolency,
						paleness, and all the other symptoms of persons in fever. The varieties of
						the sputa are numerous: livid, black, streaked, yellowish-white, or
						whitish-green; broad, round; hard, or glutinous; rare, or diffluent; devoid
						of smell, fetid. There are all these varieties of pus. But those who test
						the fluids, either with fire or water, would appear to me not to be
						acquainted with <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi>;<note n="1">Our author would
							appear to allude here to certain passages in the pseudo-Hippocratic
							treatises, wherein these tests of pus are recommended. See de Morbis,
							ii. 47, t. vii. p. 72, ed. Littr・ Coæ prænot. et alibi. See also Paulus
							Ægineta, t.i. 452, etc., Syd. Soc. edit.</note> for the sight is more to
						be trusted than any other sense, not only with regard to the sputa, but also
						respecting the form of the disease. For if one of the common people see a
						man pale, weak, affected with cough, and emaciated, he truly augurs that it
						is <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi> (consumption). But in those who have no ulcer
						in the lungs, but are wasted with chronic fevers--with frequent, hard, and
						ineffectual coughing, and bringing up nothing, these, also, are called <hi
							rend="ital">consumptive</hi>, and not without reason. There is present
						weight in the chest (for the lungs are insensible of pain),--anxiety,
						discomfort, loss of appetite; in the evening coldness, and heat towards
						morning; sweat more intolerable than the heat as far as the chest;
						expectoration varied, as I have described.</p>
					<p>Voice hoarse; neck slightly bent, tender, not flexible,</p>
					<pb n="311"/>
					<p>somewhat extended; fingers slender, but joints thick; of the bones alone the
						figure remains, for the fleshy parts are wasted; the nails of the fingers
						crooked, their pulps are shrivelled and flat, for, owing to the loss of
						flesh, they neither retain their tension nor rotundity; and, owing to the
						same cause, the nails are bent, namely, because it is the compact flesh at
						their points which is intended as a support to them; and the tension thereof
						is like that of the solids. Nose sharp, slender; cheeks prominent and red;
						eyes hollow, brilliant and glittering; swollen, pale, or livid in the
						countenance; the slender parts of the jaws rest on the teeth, as if smiling;
						otherwise of a cadaverous aspect. So also in all other respects; slender,
						without flesh; the muscles of the arms imperceptible; not a vestige of the
						mammæ, the nipples only to be seen; one may not only count the ribs
						themselves, but also easily trace them to their terminations; for even the
						articulations at the vertebræ are quite visible; and their connections with
						the sternum are also manifest; the intercostal spaces are hollow and
						rhomboidal, agreeably to the configuration of the bone; hypochondriac region
						lank and retracted; the abdomen and flanks contiguous to the spine. Joints
						clearly developed, prominent, devoid of flesh, so also with the tibia,
						ischium, and humerus; the spine of the vertebræ, formerly hollow, now
						protrudes, the muscles on either side being wasted; the whole
						shoulder-blades apparent like the wings of birds. If in these cases disorder
						of the bowels supervene, they are in a hopeless state. But, if a favourable
						change take place, symptoms the opposite of those fatal ones occur.</p>
					<p>The old seldom suffer from this disease, but very rarely recover from it; the
						young, until manhood, become phthisical from spitting of blood, and do
						recover, indeed, but not readily; children continue to cough even until the
						cough pass into <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi>, and yet readily recover. The
						habits most prone to the disease are the slender; those in which the
						scapulæ</p>
					<pb n="312"/>
					<p>protrude like folding doors, or like wings; in those which have prominent
						throats; and those which are pale and have narrow chests. As to situations,
						those which are cold and humid, as being akin to the nature of the

					<head>CHAPTER IX. ON PERSONS AFFECTED WITH EMPYEMA.</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HOSE</hi> persons in whose cavities above, along the
						region of the chest, or, in those below the diaphragm, abscesses of matter
						form, if they bring it up, they are said to be affected with Empyema; but if
						the matter pass downwards, they are said to labour under Apostemes. And in
						the ulcers in the chest, or in the lungs, if <hi rend="ital">phthoe</hi>
						supervene, or in the pleura, or the sternum, or anywhere below at the
						junction of the lungs with the spine -- in all these cases the passage for
						the matter upwards is by the lungs. But in the viscera below the diaphragm,
						the liver, spleen, and kidneys, it is by the bladder; and in women by the
						womb. And I once made an opening into an abscess in the colon on the right
						side near the liver, and much pus rushed out, and much also passed by the
						kidneys and bladder for several days, and the man recovered.</p>
					<p>The common causes of all are a blow, indigestion, cold and the like. Of those
						in the chest also, chronic cough, pleuritis, peripneumony, and protracted
						defluxion; but also the determination of some acute diseases to any one of
						them.</p>
					<p>The humour is sometimes inert, weak, and rests on something else; sometimes
						bitingly acrid, and occasioning putrefactions even unto death. And there are
						many other varieties, as I shall presently declare. It is a wonder how</p>
					<pb n="313"/>
					<p>from a thin, slender membrane, having no depth, like that which lines the
						chest, so much pus should flow; for in many cases there is a great
						collection. The cause is an inflammation from redundancy of blood, by which
						the membrane is thickened; but from much blood much pus is formed
						intermediately. But if it be determined inwards, the ribs being the bones in
						this region. . . . . . . I have said above, that another species of <hi
							rend="ital">phthisis</hi> would naturally occur. But if it point
						outwards, the bones are separated, for the top of the abscess is raised in
						one of the intercostal spaces, when the ribs are pushed to this side or to
						that.</p>
					<p>There are certain symptoms common to all, and certain ones peculiar to each.
						A heaviness rather than pain is a common symptom (for the lungs are
						insensible), weak fevers, rigor towards evening, sweats in the remission,
						insomnolency, swellings in the extremities of the feet, and fingers of the
						hands, which at one time abate and at another increase; uncomfortable
						feeling; loss of appetite; wasting of the whole body; and if the change be
						prolonged, the phthisical habit is formed; for Nature can no longer perform
						her office, for the digestion is not as before, nor is there the plump habit
						of body; the colour dark; respiration in all cases bad, but worse in those
						affecting the upper cavity; but also cough at first as long as the
						inflammation is urgent, when the pains also are greater, and rigor, and
						heat, and watchfulness, and dyspnœa still more; pulse small, sluggish,
						feeble; they are disordered in the intellect; distension of the thorax.</p>
					<p>But if it be already come to the formation of pus, all the the greatest
						symptoms take place. Expectoration small with greater cough, and from an
						urgent abscess, at first of pituitous matters, tinged with bile of a darker
						colour as if from soot, but likewise tinged with blood, and thick; but if
						about to burst, of fleshy and deep-seated matter. And, if it burst, there is
						danger of suffocation should much pus be suddenly</p>
					<pb n="314"/>
					<p>poured forth; but if gradually, there is no danger. If then the pus is going
						to pass downwards, the upper part, where the abscess is situated,
						experiences sharp pain; discharges from the bowels fluid, at first watery
						with phlegm, afterwards bloody matter; and then again, substances resembling
						flesh floating in a fluid, if it has already burst. Pus follows them either
						by the bowels or the urine. Metastasis to the kidneys and bladder peculiarly
						favourable.</p>
					<p>The pus, whether it be carried upwards or downwards, is of various
						colours--pale, white, ash-coloured, or livid, black and fetid; or devoid of
						smell and very thick; or intermediate; or smooth and consistent; or rough
						and unequal, with fleshy substances floating in it, these being round or
						broad, readily separated or viscid. To say all in a word respecting the pus,
						such kinds as are white, concocted, devoid of smell, smooth, rounded, and
						are quickly coughed up, or pass downwards, are of a salutary character; but
						such as are very pale, bilious, and inconsistent, are bad. Of these by far
						the worst are the livid and black, for they indicate putrefaction and
						phagedenic ulcers.</p>
					<p>Along with these things, it will be proper to know also the habit and other
						concomitants of the disease. If at the time of the discharge, he feels
						comfortable, and gets rid of the fever; has good digestion, good colour, and
						a good appetite, if he coughs up readily, has a good pulse, and good
						strength; the patient is free from danger. But if fever supervene, and all
						the other symptoms turn worse, he is in a hopeless state. One ought also to
						consider the places in which the abscesses are seated. For where the matter
						forms in the sternum, it is slowly turned to a suppuration; for the parts
						are slender, devoid of flesh and cartilaginous; and such parts do not
						readily receive the superfluities of inflammation, but remain a long time
						without being formed into pus; for cartilage is of a cold nature, but the
						inflammations thereof are</p>
					<pb n="315"/>
					<p>innocuous. The wasting of the constitution is bad; for the suppuration lasts
						a long time; the spleen, the liver, the lungs, and diaphragm pass more
						quickly into suppuration, but they are dangerous and fatal.</p>

						formed, then, there is no necessity for the same harsh measures and pains to
						procure the rupture and discharge of it as in the solid parts of the body,
						as it is readily brought up; for the distension of its pores is required
						rather than of the solid texture of its parts; for the lungs being a porous
						body and full of perforations like a sponge, it is not injured by the
						humour, but transmits it from pore to pore, until it reach the trachea. Thus
						the fluid finds a ready outlet, the pus being a flexible and slippery
						substance, and the respiration blows the breath (<hi rend="ital"
						>pneuma</hi>) upwards. For the most part they recover, unless at any time
						one be suffocated by the copious influx of the fluid, when, owing to the
						quantity of the pus, the trachea does not admit the air. Others die a
						protracted death, after the manner of those labouring under <hi rend="ital"
							>phthisis</hi> and <hi rend="ital">empyema.</hi> The pus is white and
						frothy, being mixed with saliva, but sometimes ash-coloured or blackish. And
						sometimes one of the bronchia has been spit up in a case of large
						ulceration, if the abscess is deep, when portions of the</p>
					<pb n="316"/>
					<p>viscus are also brought up. Hoarse, breathing short, voice heavy-toned, their
						chest becomes broad, and yet they stand in need of its being still broader,
						owing to the collection of fluid; the dark parts of the eyes glancing, the
						whites are very white and fatty; cheeks ruddy; veins in the forehead
						protuberant. There is a marvel in connection with these cases, how the
						strength is greater than the condition of the body, and the buoyancy of

							xml:lang="grc">O)RQI/W| SXH/MATI</foreign>) that they breathe freely;
						for when reclined there is a sense of suffocation. From the confinement in
						the breathing, the name <hi rend="ital">Orthopnœa</hi> is derived. For the
						patient sits erect on account of the breathing; and, if reclined, there is
						danger of being suffocated.</p>
					<p>The lungs suffer, and the parts which assist in respiration, namely the
						diaphragm and thorax, sympathise with them. But if the heart be affected,
						the patient could not stand out long, for in it is the origin of respiration
						and of life.</p>
					<p>The cause is a coldness and humidity of the spirit (<hi rend="ital"
							>pneuma</hi>); but the <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> is a thick and
						viscid humour. Women are more subject to the disease than men, because they
						are humid and cold. Children recover more readily than these, for nature

					<p>the increase is very powerful to heat. Men, if they do not readily suffer
						from the disease, die of it more speedily. There is a postponement of death
						to those in whom the lungs are warmed and heated in the exercise of their
						trade, from being wrapped in wool, such as the workers in gypsum, or
						braziers, or blacksmiths, or the heaters of baths.</p>
					<p>The symptoms of its approach are heaviness of the chest; sluggishness to
						one's accustomed work, and to every other exertion; difficulty of breathing
						in running or on a steep road; they are hoarse and troubled with cough;
						flatulence and extraordinary evacuations in the hypochondriac region;
						restlessness; heat at night small and imperceptible; nose sharp and ready
						for respiration.</p>
					<p>But if the evil gradually get worse, the cheeks are ruddy; eyes protuberant,
						as if from strangulation; a <hi rend="ital">a râle</hi> during the waking
						state, but the evil much worse in sleep; voice liquid and without resonance;
						a desire of much and of cold air; they eagerly go into the open air, since
						no house sufficeth for their respiration; they breathe standing, as if
						desiring to draw in all the air which they possibly can inhale; and, in
						their want of air, they also open the mouth as if thus to enjoy the more of
						it; pale in the countenance, except the cheeks, which are ruddy; sweat about
						the forehead and clavicles; cough incessant and laborious; expectoration
						small, thin, cold, resembling the efflorescence of foam; neck swells with
						the inflation of the breath (<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>); the præcordia
						retracted; pulse small, dense, compressed; legs slender: and if these
						symptoms increase, they sometimes produce suffocation, after the form of
						epilepsy.</p>
					<p>But if it takes a favourable turn, cough more protracted and rarer; a more
						copious expectoration of more fluid matters; discharges from the bowels
						plentiful and watery; secretion of urine copious, although unattended with
						sediment; voice louder; sleep sufficient; relaxation of the præcordia;
						sometimes</p>
					<pb n="318"/>
					<p>a pain comes into the back during the remission; panting rare, soft, hoarse.

						is connected with the lungs as is the case in asthma. The attendant symptoms
						are common, and there is but little difference; for dyspnœa, cough,
						insomnolency, and heat are common symptoms, as also loss of appetite and
						general emaciation. Moreover, the disease is protracted for a time, yet not
						longer than one year; for, if the autumn begin it, the patients die in the
						spring or in the summer; or if the winter, they terminate their life towards
						the autumn. Old persons also are at certain times readily seized; and being
						seized with rigors, it requires but a slight inclination of the scale to lay
						them on the bed of death. All labour in particular under want of breath;
						pulse small, frequent, feeble. But these symptoms are also common to asthma;
						they have this as peculiar; they cough as if going to expectorate, but their
						effort is vain, for they bring up nothing; or if anything is forcibly
						separated from the lungs, it is a small, white, round substance, resembling
						a hailstone.<note n="1">See in particular Galen, de loc. affect. iv.;

					<head>CHAPTER XIII. ON THE LIVER. </head>
					<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the formation of the body, the liver and spleen
						are equally balanced; for these viscera are equal in number, the one on the
						right side and the other on the left. They are unequal, however, in power,
						as regards health and diseases. In health, indeed, inasmuch as the liver has
						the power of nutrition, for "the roots of all the veins unite to form the
						liver": but in diseases it has much greater power to restore health and
						occasion death. As far, then, as the liver is superior in health, so much
						the worse is it in diseases, for it experiences more sudden and violent
						inflammations, and has more frequent and more fatal abscesses. In scirrhus,
						too, it proves fatal more quickly and with greater pain than the spleen.
						Those things which relate to inflammations thereof I have described among
						the acute affections.</p>
					<p>If it be converted into pus, a sharp pain possesses the parts as far as the
						clavicle and the tops of the shoulders, for the diaphragm from which the
						liver is suspended is dragged down by the weight, and the diaphragm drags
						the membrane lining the ribs to which it is attached, and this membrane (the
							<hi rend="ital">pleura</hi>) is stretched up to the clavicle and top of
						the shoulders, which also are dragged down. Along with the abscess there is
						acrid heat and rigors; cough dry and very frequent; colour grass-green; and
						if the patients be intensely jaundiced, it is of</p>
					<pb n="320"/>
					<p>the white kind; sleep not quite clear of phantasies; on the main, their
						understanding settled; or if, from any temporary cause, there be delirium,
						it quickly passes off; swelling under the nipples or sides, which deceives
						many, as if it proceeded from the peritoneum. But if there be swelling and
						pain on pressure below the false ribs, the liver is swelled; for it is
						filled by a collection of fluid. But if the collection is not below the
						bone, it is a symptom of the membrane (the peritoneum) being affected, and
						its boundaries are distinctly circumscribed; for the hand applied in
						pressure, after passing the circumference of the liver, sinks down into an
						empty space in the abdomen. But the hardness of the peritoneum is undefined,
						and no process at its extremity is apparent. If the process incline
						inwardly, nature is far superior to the physician; for it is either turned
						upon the bowels or the bladder, and far the least dangerous is the passage
						by the bladder: but if it incline outwards, it is bad not to make an
						incision, for otherwise the liver is corroded by the pus, and death is not
						long deferred. But, if you intend to make an incision, there is danger of
						hemorrhage, from which the patient may die suddenly; for hemorrhage in the
						liver cannot be checked. But if you are reduced to the necessity of making
						an incision, heat a cautery in the fire to a bright heat, and push it down
						to the pus, for it at the same time cuts and burns: and if the patient
						survive, there will run out a white, concocted, smooth, not fetid, very
						thick pus, by which the fever and other bad symptoms are diminished, and
						altogether the health is restored. But if the pus passes into the
						intestines, the belly has watery discharges at first, but afterwards they
						resemble the washings of flesh, and, again, they are like those in dysentery
						proceeding from ulcerations; but sometimes a bloody ichor, or thrombus is
						passed. Bile also is discharged, intensely yellow, or leekgreen, and,
						lastly, before death, black.</p>
					<p>But if the abscess do not suppurate, and the discharges from</p>
					<pb n="321"/>
					<p>the bowels are fetid like putrefaction, the food passes undigested, owing to
						the stomach and intestines having lost their tone; for thus the liver, even
						though now in good condition, does not perform digestion; along with these
						symptoms there is acrid heat, and altogether there is a turn to the worse;
						colliquative wasting of the flesh, pulse small, difficulty of breathing,
						when at no distance of time their life is at an end. In certain cases, the
						dysentery and the ulceration have healed, but the disease changed to dropsy.
						But if all these symptoms abate, if pus that is white, smooth, consistent,
						and inodorous, is discharged, and the stomach digests the food, there may be
						good hopes of the patient. But the best thing is for it to be discharged by
						the urine; for the passage by it is safer and less troublesome than the
						other.</p>
					<p>But if, after the inflammation, the liver does not suppurate, the pain does
						not go off, its swelling, changing to a hard state, settles down into
						scirrhus; in which case, indeed, the pain is not continued, and when present
						is dull; and the heat is slight; there is loss of appetite; delight in
						bitter tastes, and dislike of sweet; they have rigors; are somewhat pale,
						green, swollen about the loins and feet; forehead wrinkled; belly dried up,
						or the discharges frequent. The cap of these bad symptoms is dropsy.</p>
					<p>In the dropsy, provided there is a copious discharge of thick urine, having

					<head>CHAPTER XIV. ON THE SPLEEN. </head>
					<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">CIRRHUS</hi>, a chronic disease, is habitual to the
						spleen (suppuration does not readily occur in it, and yet it does occur
						sometimes), when the pain is not severe, but swelling much greater than the
						pain; for it has been seen swelled on the right side as far as the liver in
						the whole common space between them, hence many have been deceived in
						supposing that it is not an affection of the spleen, but of the membrane,
						for it appears to them that the peritonæum is inflamed. It is hard and
						unyielding as stone. Such the spleen generally becomes in scirrhus, when
						also it is attended with great discomfort.</p>
					<p>But if it suppurate, it is soft to the touch, yielding to pressure at its
						top, when there is a formation of pus; but when it is not suppurated it does
						not yield. Sometimes it hangs entire in the abdomen, being moved about to
						this side and to that, whilst it remains a small body, and has space to
						float in. Nausea, restlessness, especially about the time of breaking.</p>
					<p>The symptoms of distension are, fevers, pains, and rigors (for generally they
						are free of rigors, and of pain when the heat is small, and hence abscess
						about the spleen is sometimes latent); for the viscus is porous and
						insensible even in health: they are swollen, dropsical, of a dark-green
						colour, along</p>
					<pb n="323"/>
					<p>with disquietude, dyspnœa as if from weight of the chest, for the evil is
						well marked. Even to its upper parts the abdomen is filled with a flatus
							(<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>), thick, misty, humid in appearance but not
						in reality; much desire of coughing comes on, and their expectoration is
						small and dry. If there be watery discharges from the bowels, they at first
						bring some slight relief; but if they increase, they waste the patient, and
						yet nevertheless they do good.</p>
					<p>But, if it should break, pure concocted pus is never discharged, but whitish
						and ashy, sometimes feculent, or livid. If the abscess become deeper, the
						fluid is dark, when likewise some of the juice of the melted spleen is
						discharged. In certain cases, entire portions of the spleen have been
						brought up, for the spleen is of a soluble nature. And if the ulcer does not
						heal, but remains for a long time, they lose appetite, become cachectic,
						swollen, unseemly to look at, having many ulcers on all parts of the body,
						especially on the legs, where the sores are round, livid, hollow, foul, and
						difficult to heal. Wasted thereby, they expire.</p>
					<p>In a small tumour, with hardness and resistance, pain is wanting; on this
						account they live a long time. But if overpowered by the affection, dropsy,
						phthisis, and wasting of the body necessarily supervene; and this form of
						death removes them from life.</p>
					<p>Children, then, and young persons are most readily affected, and most readily
						escape from it. Old persons, indeed, do not often suffer, but they cannot
						escape; but certain elderly persons have been cut off by latent disease of
						the spleen; for, even with a small swelling, the scale of death has turned
						with them. A protracted and consumptive disease induces these affections,
						and in young persons inactivity especially, when, after contention and many
						exercises, the body has become inactive. As to localities, the marshy; as to
						waters, the thick, saltish, and fetid. Of the seasons, autumn is pecularly
						malignant.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER XV. ON JAUNDICE, OR ICTERUS. </head>
					<p>If a distribution of bile, either yellow, or like the yolk of an egg, or like
						saffron, or of a dark-green colour, take place from the viscus, over the
						whole system, the affection is called Icterus, a dangerous complaint in
						acute diseases, for not only when it appears before the seventh day does it
						prove fatal, but even after the seventh day it has proved fatal in
						innumerable instances. Rarely the affection has proved a crisis to a fever
						towards the end, but itself is not readily discussed.</p>
					<p>It is formed not only from a cause connected with the liver, as certain
						physicians have supposed, but also from the stomach, the spleen, the
						kidneys, and the colon. From the liver in this manner: if the liver become
						inflamed or contract scirrhus, but remain unchanged with regard to its
						functional office, it produces bile, indeed, in the liver, and the bladder,
						which is in the liver, secretes it; but if the passages which convey the
						bile to the intestine, be obstructed from inflammation or scirrhus, the
						bladder gets over-distended, and the bile regurgitates; it therefore becomes
						mixed with the blood, and the blood, passing over the whole system, carries
						the bile to every part of the body, which acquires the appearance of bile.
						But the hardened fæces are white and clayey, as not being tinged with bile,
						because the bowels are deprived of this secretion. Hence also the belly is
						very much dried up; for it is neither moistened nor stimulated by the bile.
						The colour in this species is whitish-green.</p>
					<p>If jaundice make its appearance in connection with the spleen, it is
						dark-green, for its nutriment is black, because the spleen is the strainer
						of the black blood, the impurities of which it does not receive nor
						elaborate when diseased, but</p>
					<pb n="325"/>
					<p>they are carried all over the body with the blood. Hence patients are
						dark-green from icterus in connection with the spleen; but the colour is
						darker than usual in the customary discharges from the bowels, for the
						superfluity of the nutriment of the spleen becomes recrement from the
						bowels.</p>
					<p>And icterus also is formed in connection with the colon and stomach, provided
						their powers of digestion be vitiated; for digestion takes place even in the
						colon, and from it a supply of nutriment is sent upwards to the liver.
						Provided, then, the liver receive its other food in a cruder state than
						usual, it indeed goes through its own work, but leaves that of the other
						undone; for in distribution it diffuses the blood which carries the marks of
						the inactivity of the colon to all parts of the body. The indigestion in
						this case is connected with the formation of the bile in the colon.</p>
					<p>Thus icterus may be formed in any viscus, not only of those which send
						nutriment to the liver, but also of those which receive it from the liver.
						For nature sends nutriment to all parts, not only by ducts perceptible to
						the senses, but much more so by vapours, which are readily carried from all
						parts to all, nature conducting them even through the solid and dense parts.
						Wherefore these vapours become tinged with bile, and discolour any part of
						the body in which they get lodged. Moreover, in jaundice connected with the
						colon, the evacuations are not white; for the liver is not disordered as
						regards the function of bile, and is not impeded in the transmission of bile
						to the intestines.</p>
					<p>The general system, likewise, is most powerful in producing icterus; for the
						cause is seated in the whole body. It is of this nature: in every part there
						is heat for concoction; in every part for the creation and secretion of
						humours, different in different places, but in each that which is peculiar
						to it: in flesh, indeed, sweat; in the eyes, tears; in the joints and nose,
						mucus; in the ears, wax. If the heat, then, fails in the performance</p>
					<pb n="326"/>
					<p>of each of its operations, it is itself converted into that which is acrid
						and fiery; but all the fluids become bile, for the products of heat are
						bitter, and stained with bile. But if indigestion happens in the blood, the
						blood assumes the appearance of bile, but is distributed as nourishment to
						all parts, wherefore bile appears everywhere. For it is a dire affection,
						the colour being frightful in appearance, and the patients of a golden
						colour; for the same thing is not becoming in a man which is beautiful in a
						stone. It is superfluous in me to tell whence the name is derived, further
						than that it is derived from certain four-footed and terrestrial animals,
						called <foreign xml:lang="grc">I)KTI/DES</foreign>, whose eyes are of this
							colour.<note n="2">A species of ferret; either the <hi rend="ital"
								>Mustela Erminea</hi> or the <hi rend="ital">M.
						Furo.</hi></note></p>
					<p>There are two species of the affection; for the colour of the whitish-green
						species either turns to yellow and saffron, or to livid and black. The cause
						of these is the same as the cause of the two kinds of bile; for, of the
						latter, one species--namely, the light-coloured--is yellow, thin, and
						transparent; but this species is also sometimes tinged so as to resemble
						saffron or the yolk of an egg. The other is of a darker character, like
						leeks, woad, or wholly black. There are innumerable intermediate varieties
						of colour, these being connected with the heat and humours. The viscera,
						also, co-operate in this; for the viscus is either a bright-red, like the
						liver, or dark-red, like the spleen. When, therefore, the icterus is
						connected with any viscus, if from the liver, it bears traces of this
						viscus, and if from the spleen, of it; and so, also, with regard to all the
						others. But if it possesses no appearance of any, it is an affection of the
						general habit. These appear manifest in the white of the eyes especially,
						and in the forehead about the temples; and in those naturally of a white
						complexion, even from a slight attack, the increased colour is visible.</p>
					<p>In cases, therefore, of black icterus, the patients are of a</p>
					<pb n="327"/>
					<p>dark-green colour, are subject to rigors, become faintish, inactive,
						spiritless; emit a fetid smell, have a bitter taste, breathe with
						difficulty, are pinched in the bowels; alvine evacuations like leeks,
						darkish, dry, passed with difficulty; urine deeply tinged with black;
						without digestion, without appetite; restless, spiritless, melancholic.</p>
					<p>In the whiter species, the patients are of a light-green colour, and more
						cheerful in mind; slow in beginning to take food, but eat spiritedly when
						begun; of freer digestion than those of the former species; alvine
						discharges, white, dry, clayey; urine bright-yellow, pale, like saffron.</p>
					<p>In both cases the whole body is itchy; heat at the nostrils, small, indeed,
						but pungent; the bilious particles prickly. The taste of bitter things is
						not bitter; and yet, strange to tell, it is not sweet; but the taste of
						sweet things is bitter. For in the mouth the bile lodged in the tongue,
						prevailing over the articles of food, sophisticates the sensation; for the
						tongue, having imbibed the bile, does not perceive them, while, during the
						season of abstinence from food, the bile remains torpid, neither is the
						tongue unpleasantly affected with that to which it is habituated; but the
						bile, if heated up by the tastes of the articles of food, impresses the
						tongue. When, therefore, the food is bitter, the sensation is of the bitter
						things; but when sweet, of the bilious. For the sensation of the bile
						anticipates the other, and thus deceives those who suppose that bitter
						things appear sweet; for it is not so, but because it is not exacerbated by
						the bitter lodged in it from being habituated to the disease, the phantasy
						of sweet is created; and there is the same condition in sweet and bitter
						tastes; for the bile is the screen of the fallacious tastes.</p>
					<p>When, therefore, it appears without inflammation of any viscus, it is usually
						not dangerous, though protracted; but if prolonged, and the viscus gets
						inflamed, it terminates most commonly in dropsy and cachexia. And many have
						died</p>
					<pb n="328"/>
					<p>emaciated, without dropsy. It is familiar to adolescents and young men, and
						to them it is less dangerous; it is not altogether unusual also with
						children, but in them it is not entirely free from danger.</p>

				<div type="chapter" n="16">
					<head>CHAPTER XVI. ON CACHEXIA, OR BAD HABIT OF BODY. </head>
					<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">ACHEXIA</hi> arises as the conversion of nearly all
						diseases; for almost all diseases are its progenitors. But it likewise is
						formed by itself, separately from all others, as an original affection of
						the noxious kind, by deriving its increase from the administration of many
						and improper medicines. And "a bad habit" for a season is common to all
						complaints, with many symptoms; and of this its name is significant. There
						is emaciation, paleness, swelling, or whatever else happens for the time to
						be prevalent in the body. But cachexia is the form of one great affection,
						and gives its name to the same. For "the good habit of the patient" (<hi
							rend="ital">Euhexia</hi>) in all respects, as regards digestion, the
						formation of blood for distribution, and every natural operation whence
						arise good breathing, good strength, and good colour, constitutes the
						pristine state of good health. But if its nature become changed to the
						weakness of cacochymy, this constitutes cachexia.</p>
					<p>This disease is difficult to cure, and is a very protracted illness; for it
						is engendered during a protracted space of time, and not from one infirmity
						of the body, nor in connection with only one viscus; for it is formed by the
						conversion of all into a vitiated state. Wherefore those diseases which are
						its offspring are incurable, as dropsy, phthisis, or wasting; for, indeed,
						the causes of cachexia are akin to those of wasting.</p>
					<pb n="329"/>
					<p>The disease is a protracted and continuous dysentery, and the relapses of
						diseases in certain cases. Generally there is sufficient appetite, and
						plenty of food is taken; but the distribution thereof takes place in a crude
						and undigested condition, for the operation of digestion is not performed
						upon the food.</p>
					<p>The cause of it also may be the suppression of the hemorrhoidal discharge, or
						the omission of customary vomiting, inactivity as regards exercises, and
						indolence as to great labours. When each of its attendants has ceased to
						return, there is heaviness of the whole body, now and then paleness,
						flatulence of the stomach, eyes hollow, sleep heavy, and inactivity. But
						these symptoms occurring in an erratic form conceal the existence of the
						disease; but if they remain and strike root, nor readily give way, they are
						significant of a mighty illness. When in an erect posture, then they become
						swollen in their feet and legs; but, when reclining, in the parts they lay
						upon; and if they change their position, the swelling changes accordingly,
						and the course of the cold humour is determined by its weight. For when the
						heat evaporates the humidity, if it be not diffused, the humidity again runs
						in a liquid state. They have an appetite for much food, and are very
						voracious; the distribution is more expeditious than the digestion, of
						matters that are crude rather than undigested; but digestion is not at all
						performed, nor is it digested in the whole body by nature. For the weakness
						of the heat in the belly and in the system is the same, neither is good and
						well-coloured blood formed.</p>
					<p>And when the whole body is filled with crudities, and the desire as to food
						is gone, the cachexy having now extended to the stomach, and the affection
						having now attained its summit, they become swollen, inactive, and
						spiritless towards every exertion. The belly is dried up, and, for the most
						part, the alvine discharges are without bile, white, hard, and undigested.
						They are parched in person, without perspiration, troubled with</p>
					<pb n="330"/>
					<p>itchiness; sleep at no time settled, but drowsiness in the reclining
						position; respiration slow; pulse obscure, feeble, frequent, and very
						frequent upon any, even a very small, exertion; respiration in these cases
						asthmatic; veins on the temples elevated, with emaciation of the parts
						around; but at the wrists the veins much larger and tumid; blood of a
						dark-green colour. Along with these, <hi rend="ital">phthisis</hi> or <hi
							rend="ital">tabes</hi> induces anasarca or ascites, and from their
						progeny there is no escape.</p>
					<p>With regard to the ages which induce this disease, in the first place, old
						age, in which there is no recovery; children are readily affected, and more
						readily recover; adults are not very much exposed to the affection, but have
						by no means easy recoveries. No one season produces this disease, nor does
						it terminate in any one; but autumn indeed conceives it, winter nurses it,
						spring brings it to its full growth, and summer despatches it.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER I. ON DROPSY.</head>
					<p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">ROPSY</hi> is indeed an affection unseemly to behold
						and difficult to endure; for very few escape from it, and they more by
						fortune and the gods, than by art; for all the greater ills the gods only
						can remedy. For either the disease lurking in a vital organ has changed the
						whole system to cachexy, or the general system from some plague that has
						gone before has changed the viscera to a Cacochymy, when both co-operate
						with one another to increase the illness, and no part is uninjured from
						which even a slight assistance might be rendered to Nature. It is a cold and
						dense vapour converted into humidity, resembling a mist in the universe; or,
						it is the conversion of a humid and cold cause which changes the patient to
						such a habit. For a fluid rolling about in the lower belly we do not call
						Dropsy, since neither is the affection situated in that place; but when the
						tumour, swelling, colour, and the habit melting down to water, conspire in
						the disease, it both is, and is called Dropsy. For, even should the water at
						any</p>
					<pb n="334"/>
					<p>time burst outwardly, or should one give vent to it, by making an incision in
						the hypochondrium, the dropsical affection will still remain confirmed;
						wherefore the primary cause of it is cachexia.</p>
					<p>There are many varieties, each having different names. For if the watery
						suffusion float in the flanks, and, owing to its fulness, when tapped it
						sound like a drum, the disease is called <hi rend="ital">Tympanites.</hi>
						But if the water be confined in large quantity in the peritonæum, and the
						intestines float in the liquid, it gets the appellation of <hi rend="ital"
							>Ascites.</hi> But if the lower belly contain none of these, but the
						whole body swell, if in connexion with a white, thick, and cold phlegm, the
						disease is called <hi rend="ital">Phlegmatias;</hi> but if the fleshy parts
						are melted down into a sanguineous, watery, or thin humour, then the species
						of dropsy called <hi rend="ital">Anasarca</hi> is formed. The constitution
						of each of them is bad; but the combination of them is much worse. For
						sometimes the variety which forms in the lower belly (<hi rend="ital"
							>Ascites</hi>), is associated with that variety in which the fluid is
						diffused all over the body. But the most dangerous is that form in which
						Tympanites is mixed with Anasarca. For of the dropsies that form in the
						lower belly, Tympanites is particularly worse than Ascites. But of those
						affecting the whole body, Leucophlegmatia is less than Anasarca. It is mild
						then, so to speak of such hopeless diseases, when a smaller affection is
						combined with another smaller one. But it is much worse if one of the
						smaller enters into combination with one of the greater. But if a complete
						mixture of two great affections take place, the product thereof is a greater
						evil.</p>
					<p>The symptoms are very great and very easy to see, to touch, and to hear; in
						Ascites, for example, to see the tumidity of the abdomen, and the swelling
						about the feet; the face, the arms, and other parts are slender, but the
						scrotum and and prepuce swell, and the whole member becomes crooked,</p>
					<pb n="335"/>
					<p>from the inequality of the swelling:--To touch--by strongly applying the hand
						and compressing the lower belly; for the fluid will pass to other parts. But
						when the patient turns to this side or that, the fluid, in the change of
						posture, occasions swelling and fluctuation, the sound of which may be
						heard. But if you press the finger firmly on any part, it becomes hollow,
						and remains so for a considerable time. These are the appearances of
						Ascites.</p>
					<p>Tympanites may be recognised, not only from the sight of the swelling, but
						also by the sound which is heard on percussion. For if you tap with the
						hand, the abdomen sounds; neither does the flatus (<hi rend="ital"
							>pneuma</hi>) shift its place with the changes of posture; for the
						flatus, even although that which contains it should be turned upwards and
						downwards, remains always equally the same; but should the flatus (<hi
							rend="ital">pneuma</hi>) be converted into vapour and water (for Ascites
						may supervene on Tympanites), it shifts its form, indeed, the one half
						running in a fluid state, if the conversion be incomplete.</p>
					<p>In Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia the lower belly is empty, the patients are
						swelled in the face and arms; and likewise, in these cases, whatever parts
						are empty in the others, in them become full. For in Leucophlegmatia there
						is collected a white, cold, and thick phlegm; with it the whole body is
						filled, and the face is swollen, and also the neck and arms; but the abdomen
						is full from the swelling; but the mammæ are raised up into a swelling in
						the case of such youths as are still in the happy period of life. But, in
						Anasarca, there is wasting of the flesh to a fleshy humour, and a bloody
						ichor, such as runs from ulcerations of the bowels, and such as flows from
						bruises produced by the fall of weights, if the outer skin be scarified. But
						the combination of the two has the symptoms of both.</p>
					<p>In all the species there are present paleness, difficulty of breathing,
						occasional cough; they are torpid, with much languor</p>
					<pb n="336"/>
					<p>and loss of appetite; but if they take any food, however small in quantity
						and free from flatulence, they become flatulent, and have distension as if
						from repletion; skin dry, so that it does not become moist even after the
						bath; they are white and effeminate; but in Anasarca they are of a
						dark-green colour, and have dark veins; in Ascites and Tympanites these are
						prominent, both in the face, and in the wrists, and the abdomen. But in
						Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia all the parts are concealed by the swelling;
						sleep heavy; they are torpid, with slight dejection of spirit; concern about
						trifles; fondness of life; endurance not from good spirits and good hopes
						like those in prosperity, but from the nature of the affection. It is not
						possible exactly to state the cause; but this is a mighty wonder, how in
						certain diseases, not altogether dangerous, the patients are spiritless,
						dejected, and wish to die, but in others they have good hopes and are fond
						of life. Diseases produce both these contraries.</p>
					<p>Dropsy sometimes is occasioned suddenly by a copious cold draught, when, on
						account of thirst, much cold water is swallowed, and the fluid is
						transferred to the peritonæum; by which means the innate heat in the
						cavities is congealed, and then the drops which formerly were converted into
						air and dissipated, flow into the cavities. If this, therefore, happen, the
						cure of these cases is easier before any of the viscera or the whole person
						is affected. Moreover flatulent food, indigestion, and the Buprestis<note
							n="1">The <hi rend="ital">Meloe vesicatoria.</hi> See Paulus Ægineta,
							Syd. Soc. edit., t.iii. p. 74; and Dioscorides, ii. 69.</note> have
						sometimes occasioned dropsies.</p>
					<p>It is an illness common to all, men and women, in every period of life, only
						that certain ages are more exposed to certain species of the disease;
						children to Anasarca and Leucophlegmatia; young men until manhood are
						subject to swelling about the lower belly (<hi rend="ital">Ascites?</hi>)
						Old persons are prone to suffer all kinds, as being deficient in heat, for
						old age is cold;</p>
					<pb n="337"/>
					<p>but they are not exposed to collections of humours, and to them, therefore,
						Tympanites is the familiar form.</p>
					<p>All the species, indeed, are unfavourable; for dropsy, in all its forms of
						disease, is bad. But of these, leucophlegmatia is the more mild; for in it
						there are many and various chances of good fortune, such as an evacuation of
						sweat, of urine, or from the bowels, by which the dropsical habit is carried
						off. But tympanites is of a difficult nature, and still more so anasarca;
						for in this affection the physician would require to change the whole
						person, a thing not easy for the gods themselves to accomplish.</p>
					<p>Sometimes the dropsy forms in a small space, such as the head in
						hydrocephalus; or in the lungs alone; or in the liver, or the spleen; or the
						womb in women; and this last is easier to cure than any of the others, for
						provided its mouth relax from its former constriction, if it contains a
						fluid, it discharges the same outwardly, and if a flatus, it is dissipated.
						But if the uterus suffer at all in anasarca, for the most part the whole
						woman becomes dropsical.</p>
					<p>This other form of dropsy is known: small and numerous bladders, full of
						fluid, are contained in the place where ascites is found; but they also
						float in a copious fluid, of which this is a proof; for if you perforate the
						abdomen so as to evacuate the fluid, after a small discharge of the fluid, a
						bladder within will block up the passage; but if you push the instrument
						farther in, the discharge will be renewed. This species, then, is not of a
						mild character; for there is no ready passage by which the bladders might
						escape. It is said, however, that in certain cases such bladders have come
						out by the bowels. I have never seen such a case, and therefore write
						nothing of them; for I am unable to tell whether the discharge be from the
						colon, or the stomach. What is the mode of their formation? For the passage
						whereby all matters may be discharged by the anus is patent; but the
						discharge of the water collected</p>
					<pb n="338"/>
					<p>about the loins by the bowels is incredible. For a wounded intestine is not

					<head>CHAPTER II. ON DIABETES.</head>
					<p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">IABETES</hi> is a wonderful affection, not very
						frequent among men, being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine.
						Its cause is of a cold and humid nature, as in dropsy. The course is the
						common one, namely, the kidneys and bladder; for the patients never stop
						making water, but the flow is incessant, as if from the opening of
						aqueducts. The nature of the disease, then, is chronic, and it takes a long
						period to form; but the patient is short-lived, if the constitution of the
						disease be completely established; for the melting is rapid, the death
						speedy. Moreover, life is disgusting and painful; thirst, unquenchable;
						excessive drinking, which, however, is disproportionate to the large
						quantity of urine, for more urine is passed; and one cannot stop them either
						from drinking or making water. Or if for a time they abstain from drinking,
						their mouth becomes parched and their body dry; the viscera seem as if
						scorched up; they are affected with nausea, restlessness, and a burning
						thirst; and at no distant term they expire. Thirst, as if scorched up with
						fire. But by what method could they be restrained from making water? Or how
						can shame become more potent than pain? And even if they were to restrain
						themselves for a short time, they become swelled in the loins, scrotum, and
						hips; and when they give vent, they discharge the collected urine, and the
						swellings subside, for the overflow passes to the bladder.</p>
					<p>If the disease be fully established, it is strongly marked;</p>
					<pb n="339"/>
					<p>but if it be merely coming on, the patients have the mouth parched, saliva
						white, frothy, as if from thirst (for the thirst is not yet confirmed),
						weight in the hypochondriac region. A sensation of heat or of cold from the
						stomach to the bladder is, as it were, the advent of the approaching
						disease; they now make a little more water than usual, and there is thirst,
						but not yet great.</p>
					<p>But if it increase still more, the heat is small indeed, but pungent, and

						emaciation, when the quantity of urine and the thirst have already
						increased; and when, at the same time, the sensation appears at the

							rend="ital">which signifies a siphon</hi>), because the fluid does not
						remain in the body, but uses the man's body as a ladder (<foreign

					<p>The cause of it may be, that some one of the acute diseases may have
						terminated in this; and during the crisis the diseases may have left some
						malignity lurking in the part. It is not improbable, also, that something
						pernicious, derived from the</p>
					<pb n="340"/>
					<p>other diseases which attack the bladder and kidneys, may sometimes prove the
						cause of this affection. But if any one is bitten by the dipsas,<note n="2"
							>The dipsas was a species of viper. See Paulus Ægineta, ii. p.
							185.</note> the affection induced by the wound is of this nature; for
						the reptile, the dipsas, if it bite one, kindles up an unquenchable thirst.
						For they drink copiously, not as a remedy for the thirst, but so as to
						produce repletion of the bowels by the insatiable desire of drink. But if
						one be pained by the distension of the bowels and feel uncomfortable, and
						abstain from drink for a little, he again drinks copiously from thirst, and
						thus the evils alternate; for the thirst and the drink conspire together.
						Others do not pass urine, nor is there any relief from what is drank.
						Wherefore, what from insatiable thirst, an overflow of liquids, and
						distension of the belly, the patients have suddenly burst.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER III. ON THE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE KIDNEYS.</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> kidneys are of a glandular nature, but redder
						in colour, like the liver, rather than like the mammæ and testicles; for
						they, too, are glands, but of a whiter colour. In shape they resemble the
						testicles, but are broader, and, at the same time, curved. Their cavities
						are small and like sieves, for the percolation of the urine; and these have
						attached to each of them nervous canals, like reeds, which are inserted into
						the shoulders of the bladder on each side; and the passage of the urine from
						each of the kidneys to the bladder is equal.</p>
					<p>About it, the kidneys, and those passages, many and complicated diseases are
						formed, partly acute, proving fatal by hemorrhage, fevers, and inflammation,
						as has been described by me;</p>
					<pb n="341"/>
					<p>but partly chronic, others wearing out the patient by wasting, and although
						not of a fatal character, incurable, and persisting until death. Wherefore,
						the chronic are--abscesses, ulcers, the formation of stones, and
						hemorrhoids. The ulcerations from abscess in man are all very protracted,
						and difficult to cure.</p>
					<p>The formation of stones is a long process, the stoppage of them painful, for
						the passage of them is not easily accomplished; and in addition to these,
						the retention of urine is formidable. But if several small ones stop
						together in the passage, or a large one be impacted; and if these occur to
						both kidneys, so as to occasion retention of urine and distension of the
						parts, the patients die in a few days. Nature, therefore, did well in
						forming the cavity of the kidneys oblong, and of equal size with the
						ureters, and even a little larger, so that if a stone formed above, it might
						have a ready passage to the bladder. On this account, also, the stones have
						an oblong form, because, for the most part, they are consolidated in the
						ureters; and such in that place as are of unequal thickness are slender
						before, owing to the ureters being narrow, but thick behind, because the
						kidneys verge downwards. They are formed in the kidneys only, but when in a
						heated state; for the stones have no fixed place in the ureters, but the
						gravel floats downwards with the urine, and thus is both indicative of the
						affection, and furnishes the <hi rend="ital">materiel</hi> of it. But if an
						unusually large one at any time be detained in the pelvis of the kidney,
						pains of the loins, about the regions of the <hi rend="ital">psoœ</hi>, as
						far as the middle of the ribs, take place, and hence, in many cases, the
						pain leads to mistake, as if it proceeded from pleurisy; heaviness of the
						hips; painful flexion about the spine, so that they stoop forward with
						difficulty; very painful tormina; at the same time, the pains are heavy with
						a sense of twisting, for the intestine is convoluted. But if the urine be
						retained in large quantity, and with distension, the desire of making water
						resembles the pains of labour; they are troubled with flatulence,</p>
					<pb n="342"/>
					<p>which cannot find vent; the fevers are pungent, and of a dry nature. Tongue
						parched; the belly, also, dried up; they are emaciated, and lose appetite;
						or if they take anything, they cannot readily swallow or digest it. But if
						the stone fall down into the ureters, there is shivering, as if from rigor,
						the sensation as if from the passing of a stone with violent exertion. And
						if it fall down into the bladder, there is an abundant evacuation of watery
						urine, flatulent discharges from the bowels, the stomach settled,
						eructations, rest from former illnesses; and sometimes blood is poured out
						along with the urine, from excoriation of the passage. Another painful
						operation is the passage through the member; for if the stone be larger than
						the urethra, it is detained for a long time, the bladder is filled behind,
						and the ischuria is very painful, for along with the bladder the ureters,
						also, are filled. The passage of crooked stones is most difficult, for I
						have seen hooked protuberances on certain of these concretions. But, for the
						most part, they are oblong, being formed according to the shape of the
						passages. In colour, some are white, clayey, as is mostly the case with
						children; others are yellow, and saffron-coloured in old persons, in whom
						the stones usually form in the kidneys, whereas in children it is rather in
						the bladder. The causes of the concretion are two-fold: in old persons, a
						cold body and thick blood. For cold concretes thick fluids more readily than
						heat, the proof of which is seen in the Thermal springs; for when congealed,
						the water gets concreted into a sort of chalk-stones. But in children, the
						copious recrement of the blood, being overheated, gives origin to their
						formation, like fire.</p>
					<p>Such are the affections connected with the formation of stones. Certain
						persons pass bloody urine periodically: this affection resembles that from
						hemorrhoids, and the constitution of the body is alike; they are very pale,
						inert, sluggish, without appetite, without digestion; and if the discharge
						has taken</p>
					<pb n="343"/>
					<p>place, they are languid and relaxed in their limbs, but light and agile in
						their head. But if the periodical evacuation do not take place, they are
						afflicted with headache; their eyes become dull, dim, and rolling: hence
						many become epileptic; others are swollen, misty, dropsical; and others
						again are affected with melancholy and paralysis. These complaints are the
						offspring of the stoppage of a customary discharge of blood. If, then, the
						blood flow pure and unmixed with urine, for the most part the blood of the
						urine flows from the bladder. Sometimes it is discharged in great quantity
						from rupture of the kidneys; sometimes it is coagulated, and a thrombus is
						formed of extravasated blood; sometimes it is coagulated in the bladder,
						when dreadful ischuria comes on.</p>
					<p>After the rupture there succeed ulcers, which are slow and difficult to heal;
						the indication of which is a scab, or red film, like a spider's web, or
						white pus passed in the urine, sometimes pure and unmixed, and sometimes
						mixed up with the urine. And by these symptoms we may also diagnose
						abcesses, if, in addition, fevers and rigors supervene towards evening;
						pains about the loins, pruritus; but if it burst, clots of a purulent and
						fleshy nature, and now a discharge of white pus. But the ulcers are pungent,
						sometimes clear, and sometimes foul. This is indicated by the pus and the
						urine, whether fetid or free of smell.</p>
					<p>Spring, then, induces hemorrhages and abscesses; winter and autumn, stones.
						But if along with the stones ulcers be formed, the diseases indeed are
						incurable, there is speedy emaciation and death.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER IV. ON THOSE IN THE BLADDER.</head>
					<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> the diseases in the bladder no one is mild: the
						acute proving fatal by inflammation, wounds, spasm, and acute fevers; while
						an ulcer, abcess, paralysis, or a large stone, are chronic and incurable.
						For it (<hi rend="ital">a large stone</hi>?) can neither be broken by a
						draught, nor by medicine, nor scraped outwardly, nor cut without danger. For
						the small ones of the bladder are to be cut out, but the other proves fatal
						the same day, or in a few days, the patients dying from spasms and fevers;
						or, if you do not cut him, retention of the urine takes place, and the
						patient is consumed slowly with pains, fevers, and wasting. But if the stone
						is not very large, there is frequent suppression of urine; for by falling
						readily into the neck of the bladder, it prevents the escape of the urine.
						Although it be safer to cut in these cases than for the large stones, still
						the bladder is cut; and although one should escape the risk of death, still
						there is a constant drain of water; and although this may not be dangerous,
						to a freeman the incessant flow of urine is intolerable, whether he walk or
						whether he sleep; but is particularly disagreeable when he walks. The very
						small ones are commonly cut without danger. If the stone adhere to the
						bladder, it may be detected with care; and, moreover, such cases prove
						troublesome from the pain and weight, even when there is no dysuria, but yet
						the patient may have difficulty of making water. You may diagnose all cases
						of stone by the sediments of sand in the urine, and, moreover, they have the
						genital parts enlarged by handling them; for when they make water, and there
						is a stone behind, they are pained, and grasp and drag the genital parts, as
						if with the intention of tearing out the stone along with the bladder. The
						fundament sympathises by becoming itchy, and the anus is protruded with the
						forcing</p>
					<pb n="345"/>
					<p>and straining, from the sensation, as it were, of the passage of the stone.
						For the bladder and anus lie close to one another, and when either suffers,
						the other suffers likewise. Wherefore, in inflammations of the rectum, the
						bladder is affected with ischuria; and in acute pains of the bladder, the
						anus passes nothing, even when the bowels are not much dried up. Such are
						the sufferings connected with calculi.</p>
					<p>Hemorrhage, although it may not prove fatal very speedily, yet in the course
						of time has wasted many patients. But the clots of blood produced by it are
						quickly fatal by inducing ischuria, like as in stones; for even if the blood
						be thin, of a bright colour, and not very coagulable, yet the bladder
						accumulates it for a length of time, and its heating and boiling (as it
						were) coagulates the blood, and thus a thrombus is formed. Ischuria, then,
						is most peculiarly fatal. But on these symptoms there supervene acute pain,
						acrid heat, a dry tongue, and from these they die delirious.</p>
					<p>If pain come on from a wound, the wound itself is dangerous; but the sore,
						even if not fatal at first, becomes incurable from fever or inflammation;
						for the bladder is thin, and of a nervous nature, and such parts do not
						readily incarnate nor cicatrise. Moreover, the urine is bilious, acrid, and
						corrosive. The ordinary condition of the ulcer is this:--when the bladder is
						filled, it is stretched; but when emptied, it contracts: it is in the
						condition, then, of a joint in extension and flexion, and no ulcer in a
						joint is easy of cure.</p>
					<p>The bladder also suppurates from an abscess. The symptoms of an abscess of
						the bladder are the same as in other cases; for the abscess in forming is
						attended with inflammation, fevers, and rigors. The dangers are the same.
						But if it discharges urine which is thick, white, and not fetid, the ulcers
						from them are mild; but if it spread, they pass urine which is feculent,
						mixed with pus, and of a bad smell: of such persons the death is not
						distant. The urine, indeed, is pungent, and the</p>
					<pb n="346"/>
					<p>evacuation thereof painful, and the pain darts to the extremity of the
						member. All things, even those which are opposed to one another, prove
						injurious to them; repletion and inanition, inactivity and exercise, baths
						and abstinence from baths, food and abstinence from food, sweet things and
						acid things; certain articles being serviceable in certain cases, but
						proving injurious in others, not being able to agree in any one.</p>

				<div type="chapter" n="5">
					<head>CHAPTER V. ON GONORRHŒA.</head>
					<p>G<hi rend="smallcaps">ONORRHŒA</hi> is not, indeed, a deadly affection, but
						one that is disagreeable and disgusting even to hear of. For if impotence
						and paralysis possess both the fluids and genital organs, the semen runs as
						if through dead parts, nor can it be stopped even in sleep; for whether
						asleep or awake the discharge is irrestrainable, and there is an unconscious
						flow of semen. Women also have this disease, but their semen is discharged
						with titillation of the parts, and with pleasure, and from immodest desires
						of connection with men. But men have not the same prurient feelings; the
						fluid which runs off being thin, cold, colourless, and unfruitful. For how
						could nature, when congealed, evacuate vivifying semen? And even young
						persons, when they suffer from this affection, necessarily become old in
						constitution, torpid, relaxed, spiritless, timid, stupid, enfeebled,
						shrivelled, inactive, pale, whitish, effeminate, loathe their food, and
						become frigid; they have heaviness of the members, torpidity of the legs,
						are powerless, and incapable of all exertion. In many cases, this disease is
						the way to paralysis; for how could the nervous power not suffer when nature
						has become frigid in regard to the generation of life? For it is the semen,
						when possessed of</p>
					<pb n="347"/>
					<p>vitality, which makes us to be men, hot, well braced in limbs, hairy, well
						voiced, spirited, strong to think and to act, as the characteristics of men
						prove. For when the semen is not possessed of its vitality, persons become
						shrivelled, have a sharp tone of voice, lose their hair and their beard, and
						become effeminate, as the characteristics of eunuchs prove. But if any man
						be continent in the emission of semen, he is bold, daring, and strong as
						wild beasts, as is proved from such of the athletæ as are continent. For
						such as are naturally superior in strength to certain persons, by
						incontinency become inferior to their inferiors; while those by nature much
						their inferiors by continency become superior to their superiors: but an
						animal becomes strong from nothing else than from semen. Vital semen, then,
						contributes much to health, strength, courage, and generation. From
						satyriasis a transition takes place to an attack of gonorrhœa.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> stomach is the president of pleasure and

						the stomach. These things have been described by me in another place. The
						offspring of pleasure are, good digestion, good condition, and good colour
						of the body; of disgust, their contraries, and also sometimes depression of
						spirits, when proper nutrition is wanting; and in melancholic patients,
						loathing of food. If, then, this organ be diseased, there is dislike and
						abomination of articles of food, not only if administered, but even if the
						food is not seen;</p>
					<pb n="348"/>
					<p>nay, the very remembrance of them is attended with nausea, distress,
						water-brash, and heart-ache; and in certain cases there is salivation and
						vomiting. Even when the body wastes, provided their stomach remain empty,
						they bear this pain more easily than that produced by the administration of
						food. But if at any time they are compelled by necessity to take food, the
						pain is worse than hunger; the act of masticating in the mouth occasions
						sufferance, and to drink is a still greater pain. And it is not that they
						suffer thus from suitable food, and bear more unusual food well; owing to a
						change from that which is natural to the opposite, there is a painful
						sensation as to everything, an aversion to, and dislike of, all kinds of
						food. Along with these there is pain between the scapulæ, much greater after
						the administration of food or drink; loathing, distress, sight dull, noises
						of the ears, heaviness of the head, torpidity of the limbs, their joints
						sink under them; palpitation in the hypochondriac region; phantasy, as of
						the spine being moved towards the lower limbs; they seem as if carried
						about, now this way and now that, whether they stand, or lie down, like
						reeds or trees shaken by a gale of wind; they belch out a cold and watery
						phlegm. But if there be bile in bilious persons, they have dimness of sight,
						and no thirst, even when owing to the food they appear thirsty; are
						sleepless, torpid, drowsy, not from true sleep, but like those in comatose
						affections; emaciated, very pale, feeble, relaxed, imbecile, dispirited,
						timid, inactive, quick to passion, very moody; for such persons at times
						have fallen into a state of melancholy.</p>
					<p>These mental emotions necessarily attend the affection when in connection
						with the stomach; but certain people, recognising the parts which
						sympathise, and from which the most dreadful symptoms arise, reckon the
						stomach as the cause. But the contiguity of the heart, which is of all
						organs the first, is a strong confirmation of the truth of what I say;
						for</p>
					<pb n="349"/>
					<p>the heart is placed in the middle of the lungs, and this intermediate space
						comprehends the stomach; and, moreover, both are connected with the spine;
						and from this vicinity to the heart arise the heart-ache, prostration of
						strength, and symptoms of melancholy.</p>
					<p>There are other, and, indeed, innumerable causes of this disease; but the
						principal is, much pus poured forth by the belly through the stomach. It is
						familiar to such persons as from their necessities live on a slender and
						hard diet; and to those who, for the sake of education, are laborious and
						persevering; whose portion is the love of divine science, along with scanty
						food, want of sleep, and the meditation on wise sayings and doings--whose is
						the contempt of a full and multifarious diet; to whom hunger is for food,
						water for drink, and watchfulness in place of rest; to whom in place of a
						soft couch, is a hammock on the ground without bed-clothes, a mean coverlet,
						a porous mantle, and the only cover to whose head is the common air; whose
						wealth consists in the abundant possession and use of divine thought (for
						all these things they account good from love of learning); and, if they take
						any food, it is of the most frugal description, and not to gratify the
						palate, but solely to preserve life; no quaffing of wine to intoxication; no
						recreation; no roving or jaunting about; no bodily exercise nor plumpness of
						flesh; for what is there from which the love of learning will not allure
						one?--from country, parents, brothers, oneself, even unto death. Hence, to
						them, emaciation of the frame; they are ill-complexioned; even in youth they
						appear old, and dotards in understanding; in mind cheerless and inflexible;
						depraved appetite, speedy satiety of the accustomed slender and ordinary
						food, and from want of familiarity with a varied diet, a loathing of all
						savoury viands; for if they take any unusual article of food, they are
						injured thereby, and straightway abominate food of all kinds. It is a
						chronic disease of the stomach. But inflammations,</p>
					<pb n="350"/>
					<p>defluxions, heart-burn, or pain thereof, are not called the Stomachic

					<p>Summer brings on this disease, whence springs the complete loss of digestion,

					<head>CHAPTER VII. ON THE CŒLIAC AFFECTION.</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> stomach being the digestive organ, labours in
						digestion, when diarrhœa seizes the patient. Diarrhœa consists in the
						discharge of undigested food in a fluid state; and if this does not proceed
						from a slight cause of only one or two days' duration; and if, in addition,
						the patient's general system be debilitated by atrophy of the body, the
						Cœliac disease of a chronic nature is formed, from atony of the heat which
						digests, and refrigeration of the stomach, when the food, indeed, is
						dissolved in the heat, but the heat does not digest it, nor convert it into
						its proper chyme, but leaves its work half finished, from inability to
						complete it; the food then being deprived of this operation, is changed to a
						state which is bad in colour, smell, and consistence. For its colour is
						white and without bile; it has an offensive smell, and is flatulent; it is
						liquid, and wants consistence from not being completely elaborated, and from
						no part of the digestive process having been properly done except the
						commencement.</p>
					<p>Wherefore they have flatulence of the stomach, continued eructations, of a
						bad smell; but if these pass downwards, the bowels rumble, evacuations are
						flatulent, thick, fluid, or</p>
					<pb n="351"/>
					<p>clayey, along with the phantasy, as if a fluid were passing through them;
						heavy pain of the stomach now and then, as if from a puncture; the patient
						emaciated and atrophied, pale, feeble, incapable of performing any of his
						accustomed works. But if he attempt to walk, the limbs fail; the veins in
						the temples are prominent, for owing to wasting, the temples are hollow; but
						also over all the body the veins are enlarged, for not only does the disease
						not digest properly, but it does not even distribute that portion in which
						the digestion had commenced for the support of the body; it appears to me,
						therefore, to be an affection, not only of the digestion, but also of the
						distribution.</p>
					<p>But if the disease be on the increase, it carries back the matters from the
						general system to the belly, when there is wasting of the constitution; the
						patients are parched in the mouth, surface dry and devoid of sweat, stomach
						sometimes as if burnt up with a coal, and sometimes as if congealed with
						ice. Sometimes also, along with the last scybala, there flows bright, pure,
						unmixed blood, so as to make it appear that the mouth of a vein has been
						opened; for the acrid discharge corrodes the veins. It is a very protracted
						and intractable illness; for, even when it would seem to have ceased, it
						relapses again without any obvious cause, and comes back upon even a slight
						mistake. Now, therefore, it returns periodically.</p>
					<p>This illness is familiar to old persons, and to women rather than to men.
						Children are subject to continued diarrhœa, from an ephemeral intemperance
						of food; but in their case the disease is not seated in the cavity of the
						stomach. Summer engenders the disease more than any other of the seasons;
						autumn next; and the coldest season, winter, also, if the heat be almost
						extinguished. This affection, dysentery and lientery, sometimes are
						engendered by a chronic disease. But, likewise, a copious draught of cold
						water has sometimes given rise to this disease.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER VIII. ON COLICS.</head>
					<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">ERSONS</hi> in colic are cut off speedily by volvulus
						and tormina. There are very many causes of this affection. The symptoms are,
						heaviness during abstinence from food, particularly in the part most
						affected; much torpor; they are inactive, lose appetite, become emaciated,
						sleepless, swollen in countenance. And if the colon be affected in
						connection with the spleen, they are of a dark-green colour; but of a
						light-green when in connection with the liver, from the sympathy of the
						nearest viscera. And if they take food, even in small quantity, and such as
						is not flatulent, they become very flatulent, and have a desire to pass
						wind, which, however, does not find vent: forced eructations upwards, but
						without effect; or, if any should be forcibly expelled, the flatus is fetid
						and acid which escapes upwards. The kidneys and bladder sympathise, with
						pain and ischuria; but in such cases the symptoms interchange with one
						another. But a greater wonder than these, --an unexpected pain has passed
						down to the testicles and cremasters; and this sympathetic affection has
						escaped the observation of many physicians, who have made an incision into
						the cremasters, as if they were the particular cause of the disease. But in
						these cases also the symptoms interchange with one another.</p>
					<p>From this disease are produced other diseases; abscesses and ulcers, of no
						mild character; dropsies and phthisis, which are incurable. For the disease

					<p>Wherefore ulcers form in all of them; and the varieties of these ulcers

						these are innocuous; but they are far more innocent if the affections be low
						down. Or if the ulcers be yet a little deeper, they are no longer of a mild
						character. But ulcers which are deep and have not stopped spreading, but are
						of a phagedænic, painful, spreading, and gangrenous character, are of a
						fatal nature; for the small veins get corroded in the course of their
						spreading, and there is an oozing of blood in the ulcers. Another larger

						intestines; those from the jejunum are rather more coloured, saffron-like,
						and fetid. Those dejections which contain the food in a dissolved state but
						rough, are sometimes fetid in smell when the ulcers are gangrenous, and
						sometimes have the smell as if from scybala. But in the ulcerations from the
						parts below, the discharges are watery, thin, and devoid of smell. But if
						deeper they are like ichor, reddish, of the colour of dark wine, or like the
						washings of flesh; and these are sometimes by themselves and sometimes with
						the fæces, these being dissolved in the surrounding fluid, devoid of bile
						and of smell; or they are evacuated in a consistent and dry state,
						lubricated with the surrounding fluid. But if the ulcers be larger and
						smoother, in those above they are bilious, and pinch the parts from which
						they come and through which they pass (they even pinch the anus), for the
						bile is acrid, more especially if from an ulcer; and the bile is fatty, like
						grease. In the deeper ulcers below, a thick clot of blood with phlegm, like
						flesh not very fat, or like the scrapings of the bowels: nay, even entire
						portions are mixed up with them; they are discharged white, thick, mucous,
						like chopped tallow, along with the humour in which they float: these
						proceed from the rectum: but sometimes they are merely mucous, prurient,
						small, round, pungent, causing frequent dejections and a desire not without
						a pleasurable sensation, but with very scanty evacuations: this complaint
						gets the appellation of <hi rend="ital">tenesmus.</hi> But from the colon
						there are discharged pieces of flesh, which are red, large, and have a much
						larger circumference. If the ulcers become deep, and the blood thick and
						feculent, these are more fetid than</p>
					<pb n="355"/>
					<p>the former; but if the ulcers spread and are phagedænic, and if nothing will
						stop them, above, in addition to being intensely bilious, the dejections
						become saffron-like, frothy, feculent, blackish, like woad or like leeks,
						thicker than the former, fetid like a mortification; food now undigested, as
						if only masticated by voracious teeth. But if the under parts are also
						corroded, black clots of blood, thick, fleshy, very red, clotted, sometimes,
						indeed, black, but at other times of all various colours, fetid,
						intolerable; involuntary discharges of fluids. And sometimes a substance of
						considerable length, in many respects not to be distinguished from a sound
						piece of intestine, has been discharged, and, to those ignorant of the
						matter, has caused apprehension about the intestine: but the fact is
						this,--the intestines, like the stomach, consist of two coats, which lie
						close to one another in an oblique manner; when, therefore, the connection
						between them is dissolved, the inner coat, being separated to some length,
						protrudes externally, while the outer one remains alone, incarnates, and
						gets cicatrised, and the patients recover and live unharmed. It is the lower
						gut alone which suffers thus, owing to its fleshy nature. And, if blood be
						discharged from any vessel, it runs of a bright red or black colour, pure,
						and unmixed with food or scybala; and if a concretion is spread over it like
						broad spiders' webs, it coagulates when cold, and no longer would be taken
						for a secretion of blood; but being discharged with much flatulence and
						noise, it has the appearance of being much larger than its actual amount.
						Sometimes, also, a purulent abscess forms in the colon, nowise different
						from the other internal ulcers; for the symptoms, the pus, and the mode of
						recovery are the same. But if there be hard secretions of matters resembling
						flesh, as if pounded, and like rough bodies, the abscess is not of a mild
						nature. Sometimes a copious discharge of water takes place from the colon in
						the form of dysentery, which has freed many patients from dropsy. In a word,
						such are</p>
					<pb n="356"/>
					<p>the ulcers in the intestines; and their forms and the secretions from them as
						I have described.</p>
					<p>I will now describe the symptoms accompanying each of these states of
						disease, whether the ulcers be mild or malignant. To speak in general terms,
						then, if the excoriation is superficial, whether it be above or below, the
						patients are free from pain and from fever, and get better without being
						confined to bed, in various ways, by merely some slight changes of diet. But
						if ulceration supervene, in the upper bowels there are tormina, which are
						pungent, acrid, as if from the presence of a small amount of hot bile; and
						occasionally there is suppuration: indeed, for the most part, there is
						suppuration, or digestions imperfectly performed, though there is no want of
						appetite. But if the ulcers form in the lower part of the bowels, they are
						much less dangerous than in those above, for the bowels there are of a much
						more fleshy nature than those above. But if those above become hollow and
						phagedænic, there are acute fevers, of a latent kind, which smoulder in the
						intestines; general coldness, loss of appetite, insomnolency, acid
						eructations, nausea, vomiting of bile, vertigo: but if the discharge become
						copious, and consist of more bilious matters, the tormina become permanent,
						and the other pains increase; sometimes there is prostration of strength,
						feebleness of the knees; they have ardent fever, are thirsty, and anxious;
						black vomiting, tongue dry, pulse small and feeble. Akin to these are the
						fatal symptoms I have stated among those of malignant ulcers; cardiac
						affections even to deliquium animi, from which some never recover, but thus
						expire. These dangerous symptoms are common also to erosions of the lower
						intestines if the ulcers spread, and the discharge be not checked, only that
						the tormina and pains are below the umbilicus where the ulcers are situated.
						The forms of the secretions are such as I have said; but if they be small at
						first, and there be a postponement of their spreading for a long time,
						various changes take</p>
					<pb n="357"/>
					<p>place in the ulcers, some subsiding, and others swelling up, like waves in
						the sea. Such is the course of these ulcers. But if nature stand out, and
						the physician co-operate, the spreading may, indeed, be stopped, and a fatal
						termination is not apprehended, but the intestines remain hard and callous,
						and the recovery of such cases is protracted.</p>
					<p>In hemorrhage from the bowels, if it proceed from a large vein or artery, it
						is sudden death; for neither is it possible to introduce the hand so as to
						reach the ailment, nor to apply any medicine to the sore. And even if the
						hemorrhage were restrained by the medicine, the escape from death would not
						be certain; for, in some cases, the falling off of a large eschar widens the
						mouth of the vein, and when clots form within, and remain there, the disease
						is incurable. It is necessary, then, to cure hemorrhages in their
						commencement. Its approach, also, for the most part is obvious, although not
						in all cases quite apparent: anxiety attends, with restlessness, heaviness
						in the part where the rupture is to take place, ruddiness of the countenance
						if the blood has not yet burst forth. And if the vein has burst lately, for
						the most part the symptoms are alleviated; but if it has been a longer time
						ago, this takes place more slowly, and with more difficulty. Such are the
						ulcers in the intestines.</p>
					<p>They occur in the season of summer; next in autumn; less in spring; least of
						all in winter. Diarrhœa attacks children and adolescents, but dysentery
						adults and young persons. In old age convalescence is difficult, and
						cicatrization protracted. Corroding sores are unusual in old persons, but
						yet hemorrhage is in accordance with old age.</p>

					<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi> many thick and hard cicatrices form after
						dysenteries, and broad and very deep ulcerations of the upper intestines,
						the food passes from them to those below in a fluid state, without
						separation of the nutritious part; for the cicatrix shuts up the pores by
						which the nutriment is carried upwards. The patient, therefore, is seized
						with atrophy, loss of colour and of strength. The affection gets the
						appellation of Lientery, this name being applied to a cicatrix of the
						intestines. And here the affection is from ulcers. But sometimes the
						intestines do not acquire cicatrization, but yet usage and habit reconcile
						the intestines to the discharge. For, the heat in these parts, if congealed,
						neither at times performs digestion, nor is the nutriment distributed
						upwards; but being unchanged, owing to weakness, it fails to undergo any
						part of the process. But if the purging, though of vitiated matters, be
						temporary, and not confirmed, a simple vomit after food will sometimes
						remove the disease. But if the exciting cause be prolonged, and get
						confirmed, it does no good.</p>
					<p>A chronic disease, and cachexia so mild as not to confine the patient to bed,
						will engender this disease. But dropsies sometimes have terminated

					<head>CHAPTER XI. ON AFFECTIONS OF THE WOMB, OR HYSTERICS.</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> uterus in women is beneficial for purgation and
						parturition, but it is the common source of innumerable and bad</p>
					<pb n="359"/>
					<p>diseases; for not only is it subject to ulcers, inflammation, and the fluor,
						but, if the whole organ be suddenly carried upwards, it quickly causes
						death. The fatal diseases of an acute nature connected therewith have been
						described elsewhere: but the chronic affections are, the two species of <hi
							rend="ital">fluor</hi>; hardness; ulcers, part mild, but part malignant;
						prolapsus of the whole, or of part.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="ital">fluor</hi>, then, is either of a red or white colour; its
						appearance indicates this. It is the red if it consist of bright red blood,
						and the varieties thereof; or livid, or black and thin, or thick and
						coagulated, like a thrombus; or white, like water; or a bright ochre colour,
						like bile: in thickness like a thinnish or thin and fetid ichor. The white
						flux (or <hi rend="ital">fluor albus</hi>) is like pus, and the true form
						like white whey; but a clot of blood frequently runs off with the pus. But
						there is an infinite variety of forms of it, as regards more or less
						quantity. Its periods sometimes agree with those of the menstrual purgation,
						but it does not continue the regular time as before; there is not much
						blood, but it flows during many days; the interval is for a few days, but is
						quite free from discharge. Another variety as to the period: the first
						purgation is at the regular time, but it occurs two or three times during
						each month. Another variety: a continual flux; small, indeed, every day, but
						by no means small during the whole month; for the uterus never closes its
						mouth, labouring under relaxation, so as to permit the flow of the fluid:
						but if it neither intermits nor diminishes, they die of hemorrhage. The
						symptoms are, the woman's colour in accordance with those of the discharge;
						sleepless, loathes food, anxious, relaxed, especially in the red flux, and
						subject to pains; the discharge fetid in both varieties, but to a greater
						and less extent at different times; for the white is worse if the
						putrefaction be unusually great; and sometimes the red, if the erosion be
						exacerbated. In a word, the black is the worst of all; the livid next; the
						pale, the</p>
					<pb n="360"/>
					<p>white, and the purulent, are more protracted, indeed, but less dangerous. Of
						these the pale is worse indeed, but much better when mixed with the
						customary discharge. Now the customary discharge is red in all its
						varieties. But, indeed, the red are worse in old women; but the white are
						not at all so to the young; but even to them that which is customary is less
						troublesome. Another white fluor: the menstrual discharge white, acrid, and
						attended with an agreeable pruritus; along with which the discharge of a
						white thick fluid, like semen, is provoked. This species we call female
						gonorrhœa. It is a refrigeration of the womb, which therefore becomes
						incapable of retaining its fluids; hence, also, the blood changes to a white
						colour, for it has not the purple colour of fire. The stomach, also, is
						subject to the affection, and vomits phlegm; and also the bowels are
						similarly affected in diarrhœa.</p>
					<p>Ulcers, too, are formed in the womb; some broad and attended with tingling,
						which, being close together, are, as it were, a superficial excoriation; pus
						thick, without smell, scanty. These ulcers are mild. But there are others
						deeper and worse than these, in which the pains are slight, pus somewhat
						more abundant, much more fetid, and yet, notwithstanding, these also are
						mild. But if they become deeper, and the lips of the sores hard or rough, if
						there is a fetid ichor, and pain stronger than in the former case, the ulcer
						corrodes the uterus; but sometimes a small piece of flesh is cast off and
						discharged, and this sore not coming to cicatrization, either proves fatal
						after a long time, or becomes very chronic. This sore gets the appellation
						of <hi rend="ital">phagedæna.</hi> The sores also are dangerous if in these
						cases the pain gets exacerbated, and the woman becomes uneasy. From the sore
						there is discharged a putrid matter, intolerable even to themselves; it is
						exasperated by touching and by medicines, and irritated by almost any mode
						of treatment. The veins in the uterus are swelled up with distension of the
						surrounding parts. To the skilled, it is not difficult to</p>
					<pb n="361"/>
					<p>recognise by the touch, for it is not otherwise obvious. Febrile heat,
						general restlessness, and hardness is present, as in malignant diseases; the
						ulcers, being of a fatal nature, obtain also the appellation of cancers.
						Another cancer: no ulceration anywhere, swelling hard and untractable, which
						distends the whole uterus; but there are pains also in the other parts which
						it drags to it. Both these carcinomatous sores are chronic and deadly; but
						the ulcerated is worse than the unulcerated, both in smell and pains, in
						life and in death.</p>
					<p>Sometimes the whole uterus has protruded from its seat, and lodged on the
						woman's thighs; an incredible affliction! yet neither has the uterus not
						been thus seen, nor are the causes which produce it such as do not occur.
						For the membranes which are inserted into the flanks, being the nervous (<hi
							rend="ital">ligamentous</hi>?) supporters of the uterus, are relaxed;
						those at the fundus, which are inserted into the loins, are narrow; but
						those at its neck, on each side to the flanks, are particularly nervous and
						broad, like the sails of a ship. All these, then, give way if the uterus
						protrude outwardly, wherefore this <hi rend="ital">procidentia</hi>
						generally proves fatal; for it takes place from abortion, great concussions,
						and laborious parturition. Or if it do not prove fatal, the women live for a
						long time, seeing parts which ought not to be seen, and nursing externally
						and fondling the womb. It would appear that, of the double membrane of the
						womb, the internal lining coat is sometimes torn from the contiguous one,
						for there are two transverse plates of the coat; this, then, is thrown off
						with the flux, and in abortion and laborious parturition, when it adheres to
						the placenta. For if it be forcibly pulled, the coat of the uterus being
						stretched, ..... But if the woman do not die, it is either restored to its
						seat, or but a small part appears externally, for the woman conceals it with
						her thighs. Sometimes the mouth of the womb only, as far as the neck,
						protrudes, and retreats inwardly if the uterus be made to smell to a fetid
						fumigation; and the</p>
					<pb n="362"/>
					<p>woman also attracts it if she smells to fragrant odours. But by the hands of
						the midwife it readily returns inwards when gently pressed, and if anointed
						beforehand with the emollient plasters for the womb.</p>
				</div>
				<div type="chapter" n="12">
					<head>CHAPTER XII. ON ARTHRITIS AND SCHIATICA.</head>
					<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">RTHRITIS</hi> is a general pain of all the joints; that
						of the feet we call Podagra; that of the hip-joint, Schiatica; that of the
						hand, Chiragra. The pain then is either sudden, arising from some temporary
						cause; or the disease lies concealed for a long time, when the pain and the
						disease are kindled up by any slight cause. It is, in short, an affection of
						all the nerves, if the ailment being increased extend to all; the first
						affected are the nerves which are the ligaments of the joints, and such as
						have their origin and insertion in the bones. There is a great wonder in
						regard to them; there is not the slightest pain in them, although you should
						cut or squeeze them; but if pained of themselves, no other pain is stronger
						than this, not iron screws, nor cords, not the wound of a sword, nor burning
						fire, for these are often had recourse to as cures for still greater pains;
						and if one cut them when they are pained, the smaller pain of the incision
						is obscured by the greater; and, if it prevail, they experience pleasure in
						forgetting their former sufferings. The teeth and bones are affected
						thus.</p>
					<p>The true reason of this none but the gods indeed can truly understand, but
						men may know the probable cause. In a word, it is such as this; any part
						which is very compact is insensible to the touch or to a wound, and hence it
						is not</p>
					<pb n="363"/>
					<p>painful to the touch or to a wound. For pain consists in an exasperated
						sense, but what is compact cannot be exasperated, and hence is not
						susceptible of pain. But a spongy part is very sensible, and is exasperated
						by an injury. But since dense parts also live by their innate heat, and
						possess sensibility by this heat, if then the exciting cause be material,
						such as either a sword, or a stone, the material part of the patient is not
						pained, for it is dense by nature. But if an intemperament of the innate
						heat seize it, there arises a change of the sense; the heat therefore is
						pained by itself, being roused within by the impression on the sense. The
						pains then are from nature's being increased, or a redundance thereof.</p>
					<p>Arthritis fixes itself sometimes in one joint and sometimes in another;
						sometimes in the hip-joints; and for the most part in these cases the
						patient remains lame in it; and the other joints it affects little, and
						sometimes does not go to the small joints, as the feet and hands. If it
						seizes the greater members which are able to contain the disease, it does
						not go beyond these organs; but if it begin from a small one, the attack is
						mild and unexpected. The commencement of ischiatic disease is from the thigh
						behind, the ham, or the leg. Sometimes the pain appears in the cotyloid
						cavity, and again extends to the nates or loins, and has the appearance of
						anything rather than an affection of the hip-joint. But the joints begin to
						be affected in this way: pain seizes the great toe; then the forepart of the
						heel on which we lean; next it comes into the hollow of the foot, but the
						ankle swells last; and they blame a wrong cause; some, the friction of a new
						shoe; others, a long walk; another again, a stroke or being trod upon; but
						no one will of his own accord tell the true one; and the true one appears
						incredible to the patients when they hear of it. On this account the disease
						gets to an incurable state, because at the commencement, when it is feeble,
						the physician is not at</p>
					<pb n="364"/>
					<p>hand to contend with it; but if it has acquired strength from time, all
						treatment is useless. In some, then, it remains in the joints of the feet
						until death, but in others it spreads over the compass of the whole body.
						For the most part, it passes from the feet to the hands. For to the disease
						there is no great interval between the hands and the feet, both being of a
						similar nature, slender, devoid of flesh, and very near the external cold,
						but very far from the internal heat; next the elbow and the knee, and after
						these the hip-joint; which is the transition to the muscles of the back and
						chest. It is incredible how far the mischief spreads. The vertebræ of the
						spine and neck are affected with the pain, and it extends to the extremity
						of the os sacrum: there is a general pain of all the parts of the groin, and
						a pain peculiar to each part thereof. But likewise the tendons and muscles
						are intensely pained; the muscles of the jaws and temples; the kidneys, and
						the bladder next in succession. And, what a wonder! at last the nose, the
						ears, and the lips, suffer; for every where there are nerves and muscles. A
						certain person had pains in the sutures of the head, and not knowing why he
						was pained there, he pointed out the shapes of the sutures--the oblique, the
						straight, the transverse--both behind and before, and stated that the pain
						was narrow and fixed in the bones; for the disease spreads over every
						commissure of the bones, in the same manner as in the joints of a foot or of
						a hand. Callosities also form in the joints; at first they resemble
						abscesses, but afterwards they get more condensed, and the humour being
						condensed is difficult to dissolve; at last they are converted into hard,
						white tophi, and over the whole there are small tumours, like vari and
						larger; but the humour is thick, white, and like hailstones. For it is a
						cold disease of the whole (body), like hail; and there appears to be a
						difference in regard to heat and cold; for in certain cases there is delight
						in things otherwise disagreeable. But, I fancy, that the cause is a
						refrigeration</p>
					<pb n="365"/>
					<p>of the innate heat, and that the disease is single; but if it speedily give
						way, and the heat re-appears, there is need of refrigeration and it delights
						in such things; this is called the hot species. But if the pain remain
						internally in the nerves, and the part not becoming heated subside, nor get
						swollen, I would call this variety cold, for which there is need of hot
						medicines to restore the heat, of which those very acrid are most necessary.
						For heat excites the collapsed parts to swelling, and calls forth the
						internal heat, when there is need of refrigerants. In proof of this, the
						same things are not always expedient in the same cases, for what is
						beneficial at one time proves prejudicial in another; in a word, heat is
						required in the beginning, and cold at the conclusion. Wherefore Gout does
						not often become unremitting; but sometimes it intermits a long time, for it
						is slight; hence a person subject to Gout has won the race in the Olympiac
						games during the interval of the disease.</p>
					<p>Men then are more readily affected, but more slightly the women; women more
						rarely than men, but more severely. For what is not usual nor cognate, if
						from necessity it gets the better engenders a more violent ailment. The most
						common age is after thirty-five; but sooner or slower according to the
						temperament and regimen of every one. The pains then are dreadful, and the
						concomitants worse than the pains; fainting even upon touch, inability of
						motion, loss of appetite, thirst, restlessness. But, if they recover partly,
						as if escaped from death, they live dissolutely, are incontinent,
						open-handed, cheerful, munificent, and luxurious in diet; but partly, as if
						they would (not?) again escape from death, they enjoy the present life
						abundantly. In many cases the gout has passed into dropsy, and sometimes
						into asthma; and from this succession there is no escape.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER XIII. ON ELEPHAS, OR ELEPHANTIASIS.</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HERE</hi> are many things in common as to form, colour,
						size, and mode of life between the affection Elephas and the wild beast the
						elephant; but neither does the affection resemble any other affection, nor
						the animal any other animal. The wild beast, the elephant, indeed, is very
						different from all others; in the first place then, he is the greatest and
						the thickest of animals; in size, he is as great as if you were to put one
						animal on another, like a tower; in bulk, he is as large as if you should
						place several other very large animals side by side. But neither in shape is
						he much like unto any other. Then, as to colour, they are all intensely
						black, and that over their whole body. One horse, indeed, is very white,
						like "the Thracian steeds of Rhesus"; others white-footed, like "the
						white-footed horse of Menelaus"; and bay, like "one hundred and fifty";
						others are tawny, as "assuming the shape of a horse having a tawny mane, he
						lay down with her." And so it is with oxen, and dogs, and all other reptiles
						and animals which live on the earth. But elephants are only of a lurid
						colour, "like to night and death." With regard to shape, they have a very
						black head, and unseemly face of no marked form, upon a small neck, so that
						the head appears to rest upon the shoulders, and even then it is not very
						conspicuous. For the ears are large, broad, resembling wings, extending to
						the collar-bone and breast-bone, so as to conceal the neck with the ears,
						like ships with their sails. The elephant has wonderfully white horns on a
						very dark body--others call them teeth--these alone are most white, such as
						is nothing else of even any other white animal; and these are not above the
						forehead and temples, as is the nature of other horned animals, but in the
						mouth and upper jaw, not indeed quite</p>
					<pb n="367"/>
					<p>straight forwards but a little bent upwards, so that it might swallow in a
						straight direction, and lift a load in its flat teeth. Moreover the horns
						are large, the medium length being as much as a fathom, and some much
						larger; that is to say, as long as two fathoms. And the upper jaw from its
						lip has a long, ex-osseous, crooked, and serpent-like protuberance; and
						there are two perforations at the extremity of this protuberance; and these
						by nature are perforated all the way to the lungs, so as to form a double
						tube, so that the animal uses this pipe as a nostril for respiration, and
						likewise as a hand; for it could take a cup if it please with this
						protuberance, and can grasp it round and hold it firmly, and none could it
						take by force from the animal, except another stronger elephant. And with
						this also it seeks herbage for food; for neither does it live by eating
						flesh with its mouth and small teeth. For, its feet being long, raise the
						animal considerably above the ground; but its neck also, as I have said, is
						small, and therefore it cannot browse on the earth with its mouth; and
						moreover the excrescence of the horns in front of the mouth prevents the
						mouth from touching the herbage. Wherefore it raises a great load with its
						protuberance; then as if with a binder having bound the same with it, he can
						convey it to his mouth; whence the ancients properly call it <hi rend="ital"
							>proboscis</hi>, for it collects food in front of the animal. But
						neither is it able to drink from a lake or river with its mouth, for the
						same reason. But, if it is thirsty, it introduces into the water the extreme
						nostril of the proboscis, and then, as if inhaling, it draws in much water,
						instead of air; and when it has filled its nose, as it were a cup, it pours
						the same as a stream of water into its mouth, and then it draws anew and
						discharges again, until it fills its belly, as it were a vessel of burden.
						It has a rough and very thick skin, containing fissures with prominent
						edges, long channels, and other hollow clefts, some transverse, others
						oblique, very deep, like</p>
					<pb n="368"/>
					<p>in all respects to a furrowed field. Other animals have naturally hairs for a
						mane, but in the elephant this is merely down. There are also innumerable
						other differences between it and other animals; for, like man, it bends its
						leg backward at the knee; and like woman, it has its dugs at the arm-pits.
						But there is no necessity for me now to write concerning the animal, except
						in so far as there is any discrepancy between the animal and the disease,
						and in so far as the symptoms of the patient resemble the nature of the
						animal. The disease is also called <hi rend="ital">Leo</hi>, on account of
						the resemblance of the eyebrows, as I shall afterwards explain; and <hi
							rend="ital">Satyriasis</hi>, from the redness of the cheeks, and the
						irresistible and shameless impulse <hi rend="ital">ad coitum.</hi> Moreover
						it is also called the <hi rend="ital">Heracleian</hi> affection, insomuch as
						there is none greater and stronger than it.</p>
					<p>Wherefore the affection is mighty in power, for it is the most powerful of
						all in taking life; and also it is filthy and dreadful to behold, in all
						respects like the wild animal, the elephant. And from the disease there is
						no escape, for it originates in a deadly cause; it is a refrigeration of the
						innate heat, or rather a congelation like a great winter, when the water is
						converted into snow, or hail, or ice, or frost. This is the common cause of
						death, and of the affection.</p>
					<p>But the commencement of the disease gives no great indication of it; neither
						does it appear as if any unusual ailment had come upon the man; nor does it
						display itself upon the surface of the body, so that it might be immediately
						seen, and remedies applied at the commencement; but lurking among the
						bowels, like a concealed fire it smolders there, and having prevailed over
						the internal parts, it afterwards blazes forth on the surface, for the most
						part beginning, like a bad signal-fire, on the face, as it were its
						watch-tower; but in certain cases from the joint of the elbow, the knee, and
						knuckles of the hands and feet. In this way the patient's condition is</p>
					<pb n="369"/>
					<p>hopeless, because the physician, from inattention and ignorance of the
						patient's ailment, does not apply his art to the commencement when the
						disease is very feeble. For, indeed, they are merely torpid, as if from some
						light cause, drowsy, inactive, dry in the bowels, and these symptoms are not
						very unusual even in healthy persons. But upon the increase of the
						affection, the respiration is fetid from the corruption within of the breath
							(<hi rend="ital">pneuma</hi>). The air, or something external, would
						seem to be the cause of this. Urine thick, muddy, like that of cattle; the
						distribution of crude undigested food; and yet of these things there is no
						perception nor regard; for neither are they aware whether or not they
						digest, thus digestion or indigestion is all one to them, since, for
						anything useful and proper to them, digestion is not usual with them. The
						distribution, however, is easy, the disease, as it were, greedily attracting
						the food for its own nourishment; for this reason the lower belly is very
						dry. Tumours prominent, not continuous with one another anywhere, but thick
						and rough, and the intermediate space cracked, like the skin of the
						elephant. Veins enlarged, not from abundance of blood, but from thickness of
						the skin; and for no long time is the situation of them manifest, the whole
						surface being elevated equally in the swelling. The hairs on the whole body
						die prematurely, on the hands, the thighs, the legs, and again on the pubes;
						scanty on the chin, and also the hairs on the head are scarce. And still
						more frequently premature hoariness, and sudden baldness; in a very short
						time the pubes and chin naked of hair, or if a few hairs should remain, they
						are more unseemly than where they are gone. The skin of the head deeply
						cracked; wrinkles frequent, deep, rough; tumours on the face hard, sharp;
						sometimes white at the top, but more green at the base. Pulse small, dull,
						languid, as if moved with difficulty through the mud; veins on the temples
						elevated, and also those under the tongue; bowels bilious; tongue
						roughened</p>
					<pb n="370"/>
					<p>with <hi rend="ital">vari</hi>, resembling hailstones; not unusual for the
						whole frame to be full of such (and thus also in unsound victims, the flesh
						is full of these tubercles resembling hail). But if the affection be much
						raised up from the parts within, and appear upon the extremities, <hi
							rend="ital">lichens</hi> occur on the extremities of the fingers; there
						is pruritus on the knees, and the patients rub the itchy parts with
							pleasure.<note n="1"><p>Our author in this place evidently alludes to
									<hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi>, a malignant disease of the face,
								very prevalent in Rome in his time, that is to say, towards the end
								of the first and the beginning of the second century. The first
								description of it which we possess, is contained in Pliny's <hi
									rend="ital">Nat. Hist.</hi> xxvi., at the beginning, and is to
								the following effect: That it was one of the new diseases of the
								face, which at one time had spread over most parts of Europe, but
								was then mostly confined to Rome: That it had been called by the
								Greeks, <hi rend="ital">lichen</hi>, but that latterly the Latin
								term <hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi> had been applied to it. He
								further asserts, that it was unknown in former times, and made its
								first appearance in Italy during the reign of Tiberius: that the men
								of the middle and lower classes, and more especially women, were
								exempt from it, the ravages of the disease being confined
								principally to the nobility, among whom it was propagated by
								kissing. He adds respecting it, that it was cured by caustics, the
								effects of which often left unseemly scars on the face. That the
								disease had come originally from Egypt, the mother of all such
								distempers.</p>
							<p>Another very interesting account of the disease, under the names of
									<hi rend="ital">lichen</hi> and <hi rend="ital">mentagra</hi>,
								is given by Marcellus, the Empiric, in chap. cxix., wherein
								elephantiasis, lepra, and other inveterate diseases of the skin are
								described. He says that the distemper (vitium) when neglected is apt
								to spread all over the face, and to contaminate many persons. He
								prescribes various caustic and stimulant applications for it. Along
								with it, he gives a very good account of elephantiasis, which, he
								remarks, also generally begins in the face with vari and other
								appearances, similar to those described by our author. He states
								decidedly that the disease is endemical in Egypt, attacking not only
								the lower ranks, but even kings themselves.</p>
							<p>Now it is worthy of remark, that beyond all question this is the
								disease to which frequent allusion is made by the poet Martial as
								prevailing extensively in Rome, and as being propagated by the
								fashionable practice of persons saluting one another, by kissing, in
								the streets. The following passages evidently allude to it--<hi
									rend="ital">Epigr.</hi> xi.,8; xii. 59.</p>
							<p>From all these descriptions, we cannot entertain a doubt, that the
								disease, then so prevalent in Rome, was of a malignant and
								contagious nature, which attacked principally the face, and was
								propagated by kissing ; and, further, that it was a disease of the
								same class as elephantiasis. Taking all these circumstances into
								account, one may venture to decide pretty confidently, that it was a
								disease akin to the <hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi> of Scotland, which
								it strikingly resembles in all its characters as described above.
									<hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi>, in short, is a species or variety
								of syphilis, which is readily communicated both by the mouth, as in
								kissing, and <hi rend="ital">per coitum.</hi> Further, that
								Syphilis, and its congener <hi rend="ital">Sivvens</hi>, are the
								brood of the ancient elephantiasis, no one at all acquainted with
								the history of the latter in ancient, mediæval, and modern times,
								will entertain a doubt. See the note to Paulus Ægineta, t. ii., 14,
								15, 16, and the authorities there referred to: also, the History of
								Syphilis, as given in Sprengel's and in Renouard's History of
								Medicine.</p>
							<p>The importance of this subject, which has never been satisfactorily
								illustrated elsewhere, will be my apology for embracing the present
								opportunity of endeavouring to throw some additional light on
								it.</p></note> And the <hi rend="ital">lichen</hi> sometimes</p>
					<pb n="371"/>
					<p>embraces the chin all round; it reddens the cheeks, but is attended with no
						great swelling; eyes misty, resembling bronze; eye-brows prominent, thick,
						bald, inclining downwards, tumid from contraction of the intermediate space;
						colour livid or black; eye-lid, therefore, much retracted to cover the eyes,
						as in enraged lions; on this account it is named <hi rend="ital"
							>leontium.</hi> Wherefore it is not like to the lions and elephants
						only, but also in the eye-lids "resembles swift night." Nose, with black
						protuberances, rugged; prominence of the lips thickened, but lower part
						livid; nose elongated; teeth not white indeed, but appearing to be so under
						a dark body; ears red, black, contracted, resembling the elephant, so that
						they appear to have a greater size than usual; ulcers upon the base of the
						ears, discharge of ichor, with pruritus; shrivelled all over the body with
						rough wrinkles; but likewise deep fissures, like black furrows on the skin;
						and for this reason the disease has got the name of <hi rend="ital"
							>elephas.</hi> Cracks on the feet and heels, as far as the middle of the
						toes; but if the ailment still further increase, the tumours become
						ulcerated, so that on the cheeks,</p>
					<pb n="372"/>
					<p>chin, fingers, and knees, there are fetid and incurable ulcers, some of which
						are springing up on one part, while others are subsiding on another.
						Sometimes, too, certain of the members of the patient will die, so as to
						drop off, such as the nose, the fingers, the feet, the privy parts, and the
						whole hands; for the ailment does not prove fatal, so as to relieve the
						patient from a foul life and dreadful sufferings, until he has been divided
						limb from limb. For it is long-lived, like the animal, the elephant. But if
						there be a sudden pain of the limbs, it attacks much more grievously,
						spreading sometimes to this part, and sometimes to that. Appetite for food
						not amiss; taste indiscriminate, neither food nor drink affords pleasure;
						aversion to all things from a painful feeling; atrophy; libidinous desires
						of a rabid nature; spontaneous lassitude; the figure of each of the limbs
						heavy, and even the small limbs are oppressive to the patient. Moreover, the
						body is offended with everything, takes delight neither in baths nor
						abstinence from them, neither in food nor in abstinence from it, neither in
						motion nor in rest, for the disease has established itself in all the parts.
						Sleep slight, worse than insomnolency, from its fantasies; strong dyspnœa,
						suffocation as if from strangling. In this way certain patients have passed
						from life, sleeping the sleep which knows no waking, even until death.</p>
					<p>When in such a state, who would not flee;--who would not turn from them, even
						if a father, a son, or a brother? There is danger, also, from the
						communication of the ailment. Many, therefore, have exposed their most
						beloved relatives in the wilderness, and on the mountains, some with the
						intention of administering to their hunger, but others not so, as wishing
						them to die. There is a story that one of those who had come to the
						wilderness, having seen a viper creep out of the earth, compelled by hunger,
						or wearied out with the affection, as if to exchange one evil for another,
						ate the viper alive, and did not die until all his members had become putrid
						and dropped</p>
					<pb n="373"/>
					<p>off: and that another person saw a viper creep into a cask of new wine, and
						after drinking of the same to satiety, vomit it up, and discharge a great
						deal of its venom along with the new wine; but when the viper was smothered
						in the new wine, that the man drank of it largely and greedily, seeking thus
						to obtain a rescue from life and the disease; but when he had carried the
						drinking to satiety and intoxication, he lay down on the ground, at first as
						if about to die; but when he awoke from his sleep and intoxication, first of
						all his hair fell off, next the fingers and nails, and all the parts melted
						away in succession. But as the power was still in the semen, nature formed
						the man again, as if from the act of generation: it made other hairs to
						grow, and made new nails and clean flesh, and put off the old skin, like the
						slough of a reptile; and he was called back, like another new man, to a
						growth of life. Thus goes the fable; not very probable, indeed, nor yet
						entirely incredible; for that one ill should be overcome by another is
						credible. And that from the existing spark nature should renew the man, is
						not so incredible as to be held to be a prodigy.</p>
