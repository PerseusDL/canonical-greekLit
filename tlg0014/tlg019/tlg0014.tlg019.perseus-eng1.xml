                    <p>Citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I do not
                        doubt that you are all pretty well aware that this trial has been the center
                        of keen partisanship and active canvassing, for you saw the people who were
                        accosting and annoying you just now at the casting of lots.<note
                            anchored="true" resp="Loeb">For the selection of jurors.</note> But I
                        have to make a request which ought to be granted without asking, that you
                        will all give less weight to private entreaty or personal influence than to
                        the spirit of justice and to the oath which you severally swore when you
                        entered that box. You will reflect that justice and the oath concern
                        yourselves and the commonwealth, whereas the importunity and party spirit of
                        advocates serve the end of those private ambitions which you are convened by
                        the laws to thwart, not to encourage for the advantage of evil-doers. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="2">
                    <p>Now I observe that men who enter public life with honest intentions, even
                        after they have submitted to scrutiny, do still acknowledge a perpetual
                        responsibility. But Aeschines, the defendant, reverses this practice. Before
                        coming into court to justify his proceedings, he has put out of the way one
                        of the men who called him to account, and the others he is constantly
                        threatening. So he is trying to introduce into politics a most dangerous and
                        deplorable practice; for if a man who has undertaken and administered any
                        public function can get rid of accusers not by his honesty but by the fear
                        he inspires, the people will soon lose all control of public affairs. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="3">
                    <p>While I have entire confidence that I shall prove that this man is guilty of
                        serious delinquencies, and that he deserves the most severe punishment, yet,
                        in spite of that assurance, I have a misgiving, which I will explain to you
                        quite frankly. It appears to me, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>, that the trials which come before you are affected
                        quite as much by the conditions of the hour as by the facts; and I am afraid
                        that the long lapse of time since the embassy has inclined you to forget or
                        to acquiesce in these iniquities. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="4">
                    <p>I will, then, suggest a method by which you may nevertheless reach a just
                        conclusion and give a righteous verdict today. By consideration among
                        yourselves, gentlemen, you should form a true conception of what should be
                        included in the vindication which the state requires of any ambassador. He
                        is responsible then, in the first place, for the reports he has made;
                        secondly, for the advice he has offered; thirdly, for his observance of your
                        instructions; then there is the question of times and opportunities; and, to
                        crown all, whether he has done his business corruptly or with integrity.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="5">
                    <p>Why are these the topics of inquiry? Your conclusions are derived from the
                        ambassador's reports: you reach a right decision if they are true, a wrong
                        decision if they are false. The advice of ambassadors you regard as the more
                        trustworthy because it is given by men who presumably understand their own
                        mission. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="6">
                    <p>No ambassador, then, ought ever to be convicted of defective or mischievous
                        counsels. Thirdly, when he has been expressly instructed what to say and
                        what to do by resolution of the Assembly, it is his duty to conduct his
                        business according to such instructions. Very well; but how does the
                        question of time arise? Because, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>, in important transactions opportunities are often
                        short-lived: once willfully surrendered and betrayed to the enemy, they
                        cannot be recovered, do what you will. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="7">
                    <p>Next, as for the question of bribery or no bribery, of course you are agreed
                        that it is a scandalous and abominable offence to accept money for acts
                        injurious to the commonwealth. The author of the statute, however, made no
                        such distinction; he forbade the acceptance of rewards absolutely, holding,
                        as I suppose, that the man who takes them and is thereby corrupted can no
                        longer be trusted by the state as a judge of sound policy. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="8">
                    <p>If, then, I can establish by clear proofs that the reports of the defendant,
                        Aeschines, were entirely untruthful, and that he prevented the Assembly from
                        hearing the truth from me; that his counsels were totally opposed to your
                        true interests; that he disobeyed all your instructions when on embassy;
                        that by his waste of time many important opportunities were lost to the
                        city; and finally that for all these delinquencies he, as well as
                        Philocrates, accepted presents and rewards; pronounce him guilty and exact a
                        penalty adequate to his crimes. But if I fail to prove all these five
                        charges, or any one of them, then call me an impostor, and acquit him. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="9">
                    <p>I have many further charges to add, such as must excite universal abhorrence;
                        but, by way of preface, I will first remind you of what doubtless most of
                        you remember,—of the party with which Aeschines at first ranged himself in
                        politics, and of the speeches which he thought fit to make in opposition to
                        Philip. In this way I hope to satisfy you that his early acts and speeches
                        supply abundant proof of his present corruption. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="10">
                    <p>Aeschines, then, was the first man in <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>, as he claimed at the time in a speech, to perceive
                        that Philip had designs against <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                            >Greece</placeName>, and was corrupting some of the magnates of
                            <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. It was he who, with
                        Ischander, son of Neoptolemus, as his understudy, addressed the Council, and
                        addressed the Assembly, on this subject, and persuaded them to send
                        ambassadors to all the Greek states to convene a conference at <placeName
                            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for the consideration of war
                        with Philip. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="11">
                    <p>It was he who afterwards, on his return from <placeName key="tgn,7002735"
                            >Arcadia</placeName>, gave a report of the fine long orations which he
                        said he had delivered as your spokesman before the Ten Thousand at
                            <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> in reply to
                        Philip's champion Hieronymus, and he made a long story of the enormous harm
                        which corrupt statesmen in the pay of Philip were doing not only to their
                        own countries but to the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                            >Greece</placeName>. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="12">
                    <p>So on the strength of his policy at that time, and of the sample he had
                        exhibited of his conduct, he was actually appointed as one of the
                        ambassadors when you were induced by Aristodemus, Neoptolemus, <placeName
                            key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> and others, who had brought
                        entirely misleading reports from <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                            >Macedonia</placeName>, to send an embassy to negotiate peace with
                        Philip. He was chosen, not as one who would make traffic of your interests,
                        not as one who had any confidence in Philip, but as one of the party that
                        was to keep an eye on the rest, for in view of his early speeches, and of
                        his known hostility to Philip, it was natural that you should all have such
                        an opinion of the man. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="13">
                    <p>Then he came to me and proposed that we should act together on the embassy,
                        being especially urgent that we should jointly keep watch upon that infamous
                        scoundrel Philocrates. And until after our return from the first embassy I
                        at least, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, had no
                        suspicion that he was corrupt and had already sold himself. For apart from
                        the speeches which, as I said, he had made on former occasions, he rose at
                        the first of the two assemblies at which you discussed terms of peace, and
                        began with an exordium which I believe I can repeat to you in the very words
                        he used: </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="14">
                    <p>“If Philocrates, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                        had given many days to studying how best he could thwart the peace, I do not
                        think he could have found a better way than the present proposal. Such a
                        peace as this I for one will never advise the city to make, so long as a
                        single Athenian remains alive; yet I do say that we ought to make peace.” In
                        such terms he spoke, concisely and with moderation. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="15">
                    <p>And then on the next day, when the peace was to be ratified, when I supported
                        the resolutions of our allies, and did what I could to secure fair and
                        equitable terms, and when the people sympathized with my purpose and refused
                        to hear a word from the contemptible Philocrates, up jumped the very man who
                        had made the speech I have quoted in the head of all of you only the day
                        before, and addressed you in support of Philocrates, </p>

                        times over. He told you that you ought to forget the achievements of your
                        forefathers; that you should not tolerate all that talk about old trophies
                        and sea-fights; and that he would draft and enact a law forbidding aid to
                        any Greeks who had not previously brought aid to you. This speech the
                        shameless reprobate found courage to make while the ambassadors, whom you
                        summoned from the Greek cities at his own suggestion, before he had sold
                        himself, were standing at his elbow and listening to what he said.</p>

                <div type="section" n="17">
                    <p>Well, you appointed him a second time, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>, as an envoy to receive the oath of ratification;
                        and I shall shortly have to tell you how he again wasted time, mishandled
                        all the affairs of the commonwealth, and repeatedly fell out with me in
                        regard to them when I tried to stand in his way. However, by reason of the
                        persistent misconduct of these men, and their disobedience to instructions,
                        we came back from the embassy for the oaths—that is the embassy which is the
                        subject of the present scrutiny—without having realized any single one,
                        great or small, of the advantages which were promised or expected when you
                        approved the peace,—with nothing but deception and disappointment. Then we
                        repaired to the Council. There are many eye-witnesses of what I am about to
                        relate, for the Council-house was thronged with spectators. </p>

                <div type="section" n="18">
                    <p>I came forward and reported the whole truth to the Council. I denounced these
                        men, and told the whole story, point by point, beginning with those earlier
                        hopes created by the reports of <placeName key="tgn,6001610"
                            >Ctesiphon</placeName> and Aristodemus, going on to the more recent
                        orations of Aeschines at the approval of the peace, and showing to what
                        straits they had reduced the city. There remained the question of the
                        Phocians and <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>,
                        and we must not—such was my advice—we must not repeat our experience, and
                        throw them overboard, and so, in reliance upon a succession of idle hopes
                        and assurances, allow ourselves to fall into the last extremity of disaster.
                        I convinced the Council; </p>

                        Aeschines took the first turn of all of us. And here I most earnestly
                        entreat you to verify my account by your own recollections; for I am now
                        relating transactions which ultimately brought your affairs to complete and
                        final ruin. He utterly ignored the duty of giving a report of the doings of
                        the embassy. He never mentioned the speeches made to the Council, or told
                        you whether he disputed the truth of my statement. But he made such a fine
                        speech, so full of big promises, that he carried you all away with him. </p>

                    <p>For he declared that he had completely converted Philip to the interests of

                        Amphictyonic question and of everything else. He went through a long
                        diatribe against the Thebans, which he said he had addressed to Philip
                        himself, recapitulating the main points. He offered you a calculation that,

                        instructed Philip that those who contrived the project were quite as
                        sacrilegious as the men by whose hands it was executed; and therefore the
                        Thebans had set a price on his head! </p>

                        concluded peace with Philip, and we are aware that you have given up
                            <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> to him, and
                        that he has agreed to hand over <placeName key="tgn,7002677"
                            >Euboea</placeName> to you.” He had also, he said, settled another
                        matter, but he thought it better not to mention it just yet—some of his
                        colleagues were already so jealous of him. This was a veiled allusion to
                        Oropus. </p>

                <div type="section" n="23">

                        as a grand speaker and a marvellous man, he descended from the tribune in
                        his most majestic manner. Then I rose, and said that the whole story was
                        news to me. I attempted to repeat the statement I had made to the Council;
                        but Aeschines and Philocrates posted themselves one on either side of
                        me—shouting, interrupting, and finally jeering. You were all laughing; you
                        would not listen to me, and you did not want to believe anything except what
                        Aeschines had reported. </p>

                        filled with anticipation of those wonderful benefits, be patient of a
                        speaker who told you that you would never get them, and even denounced the
                        conduct of the benefactors? At the moment, I imagine, everything else was
                        thrown into the shade by the hopes and expectations that were suggested to
                        you; contradiction seemed to be mere annoyance and malice; and these great
                        achievements were thought amazingly fine and most beneficial to the

                        that seems to you atrocious and incredible, no one may ask in surprise:
                        “Then why did you not speak out and give us this information instantly?”

                        stopped others from getting your attention, and that magnificent promise of
                        Aeschines, you may realize that you have to thank him for this crowning
                        injury,—that you were precluded from learning the truth promptly and at the
                        proper time, being cheated by hopes and impostures and vain assurances. </p>

                        yourselves of that policy of precaution and distrust of Philip which this
                        man deliberately chose when he was still unbribed, and to compare the
                        confidence and friendship that afterwards sprang up so suddenly; </p>

                <div type="section" n="28">
                    <p>and then, if the fair reports he laid before you have really proved true, and
                        if all the results have been fortunate, to admit the view that that
                        friendship was formed for truth's sake and in the best interests of the
                        city; but, if the sequel has given the lie to all his predictions, if it has
                        involved the city in much dishonor and in grievous perils, then be assured
                        that his own sordid greed has prompted this change of front, because he has
                        sold the truth for a bribe. </p>

                <div type="section" n="29">
                    <p>Having allowed myself to refer to those old speeches, I wish to relate first
                        of all how these men took the business of the Phocians out of your hands.
                        Gentlemen of the jury, I hope that none of you will regard my charges and
                        accusations as too big for the calibre of the defendant, measuring him
                        against the magnitude of the transactions. Reflect rather that, if any man
                        soever, placed by you in the position he filled, and trusted to deal with
                        the occasions that arose, had taken hire, and had sought to deceive and
                        mislead you as Aeschines did, he would have brought about exactly the same
                        disaster as Aeschines. </p>

                <div type="section" n="30">
                    <p>For though you often employ insignificant men for public business, it does
                        not follow that those affairs are insignificant for which the rest of the
                        world acknowledges our competence. Assuredly not. Again, it was Philip, of
                        course, who really destroyed the Phocians; but these men co-operated. The
                        question on which you are to fix your minds is whether they purposely wasted
                        and threw away any chances that came to the embassy of saving the Phocians.
                        I do not suggest that Aeschines destroyed the Phocians all by himself. How
                        could he? </p>

                    <p>Give me the resolution which the Council adopted on my report, and the
                        evidence of the member who moved it on that occasion. These documents will
                        satisfy you that I did not hold my peace then, to run away from my actions
                        now,—for I was laying my complaint, and trying to forecast results, at the
                        first opportunity; and also that the Council, not being debarred from
                        hearing the truth from me, did not give these men either a vote of thanks,
                        or an invitation to the public dinner in the Town Hall. We are told that
                        these compliments had never before been withheld from any ambassadors since
                        the foundation of Athens—not even from Timagoras,<note anchored="true"

                    <p>Here is no commendation, no invitation from the Council to the ambassadors to
                        dine in the Town Hall. If Aeschines says that such a thing exists, let him
                        produce and exhibit it, and I will sit down. But no; there is none. Now, if
                        all the envoys acted alike, the Council was right in thanking nobody,—for we
                        had all in very truth behaved scandalously indeed. But if some acted rightly
                        and others wrongly, the well-conducted, it would seem, must submit to a
                        discourtesy provoked by those who had played the rogue. </p>

                <div type="section" n="33">
                    <p>How then can you find an easy answer to the question, Who was the rogue?
                        Consult your own recollections, and mark who denounced the transactions at
                        the outset. For it is clear that, if the evil-doer could hold his peace,
                        escape immediate detection, and never afterwards allow himself to be called
                        to account, that was good enough for him; whereas the man with a good
                        conscience bethought himself that it would be very hard if by keeping
                        silence he should become a reputed accomplice in scandalous and wicked
                        actions. Well then, it was I who denounced these men from the outset, and
                        none of them denounced me. </p>

                    <p>Well, the Council adopted this resolution. When the Assembly met, Philip was
                        already at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. For
                        that is the beginning of their misdeeds; they had surrendered control to
                        Philip and then,—although the right course for you was, first to hear the
                        facts, next to decide, and finally to carry out your decision,—you heard
                        nothing until he was already on the spot, and it was no easy matter to
                        advise you what to do. </p>

                <div type="section" n="35">
                    <p>Further, no one read the resolution to the Assembly, and the people never
                        heard it. However, Aeschines rose and delivered that oration which I have
                        already described, about the wonderful advantages he had induced Philip to
                        grant to you, and the price set on his head by the Thebans in consequence;
                        and so, although you were at first alarmed at Philip's approach, and
                        indignant that the ambassadors had given you no warning, you became as mild
                        as lambs, expecting to get all that you desired, and refused to hear a word
                        from me or anyone else. </p>

                <div type="section" n="36">
                    <p>Then the letter from Philip was read. It had been composed by Aeschines
                        without our knowledge, and was in fact a downright, explicit written defence
                        of the errors these men had committed. For it alleges that Philip stopped
                        them when they wanted to visit the towns and receive the oaths, and that he
                        detained them in order that they might help him to reconcile the Halians
                        with the Pharsalians; Philip takes on his own shoulders the burden of all
                        their delinquencies: </p>

                        mere accident. For derelictions of duty, for which they ought to have been
                        brought to justice, and for their failure to do their work according to your
                        instructions, Philip takes all the blame. He tells you it was his fault,—and

                        you might never have it in your power to incriminate Philip or throw any
                        blame on him, as the assertions were not to be found in the letter or in any
                        other direct communication of his. Read to the jury the letter written by
                        Aeschines and dispatched by Philip. You will observe that it agrees exactly

                            >Athens</placeName>,—such a nice, courteous letter! But about the
                        Phocians, about the Thebans, about everything that Aeschines reported—not a
                        scrape of the pen! There is nothing in it that is honest, as you shall see
                        at once. For he tells you that he detained them that they might help him to
                        reconcile the Halians. Well, the reconciliation of the Halians consisted in
                        their being cast out of their homes, and their country devastated. As for
                        the prisoners, this man, who wanted to know what he could do to oblige you,
                        declares that the idea of getting them liberated never entered his head.

                        Aeschines persuaded Philip to write these words. Now for the most important
                        point. The man who, in the first letter, which we brought home, wrote these
                        words: “I would write more explicitly of the benefits I intend to confer on
                        you, if I were certain that the alliance will be made,”—this man, now that
                        the alliance has been made, says that he does not know how he can gratify
                        you. Not know the very thing he promised! Why, he must have known it, unless
                        he was hoodwinking us throughout. To prove, however, that he did so write at
                        that time, please take and read the actual passage from the first
                        letter,—beginning here. Read.<quote n="Excerpt from the letter">

                        But now that both peace and alliance are concluded, he says that he does not
                        know what he can do to oblige you, but that, if you will tell him, he will
                        do anything “that is consistent with his own honor and reputation”—taking
                        refuge in this saving clause, and leaving himself a loophole in case you
                        make any proposal or are induced to ask any favor. </p>

                    <p>All this chicanery, and much besides, might have been instantly detected, and
                        you might have been informed and spared the sacrifice of your interests, if
                        you had not been cheated out of the truth by that story of <placeName

                        the Thebans. Yet if Philip's promises were merely for show, and if the city
                        was to be deluded, it was right to mention them; if, on the other hand, they
                        were really to be fulfilled, it was best to say nothing about them. For if
                        the project was so far matured that the Thebans could gain nothing by
                        hearing of it, why has it not been executed? But if it has been thwarted
                        because they had news of it in time, who let the secret out? </p>

                    <p>Aeschines? Oh no; it was never meant to come off, and he neither wanted it
                        nor expected it; let him be quit of the imputation of blabbing! The truth is
                        that his purpose required that you should be hoodwinked by that talk; that
                        you should refuse to hear the truth from me and should stay at home; and
                        that they should triumphantly carry a decree ensuring the destruction of the
                        Phocians. That is why this tissue of lies was woven; that is why it was made
                        the theme of a popular harangue. </p>

                    <p>Now when I heard him making all these fine promises, and knew to a certainty
                        that he was lying,—but let me tell you why I knew. First, because, when
                        Philip was on the point of swearing the oath of ratification, the Phocians
                        were expressly excluded from the treaty by these men and that exclusion
                        should have been passed over in silence, if the Phocians were to be
                            delivered;<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The clause excluding the
                            Phocians from the benefit of the peace had been rescinded by the
                            Assembly (See <bibl n="Dem. 19.159">Dem. 19.159</bibl>). Aeschines and
                            his friends were therefore acting ultra vires in restoring the clause,
                            when they administered the oath. Had they been really convinced that
                            Philip intended to spare the Phocians, they would have retained the more
                            general phrase,“the Athenians and their allies.” It is more probable
                            that Philip himself insisted on excluding the Phocians, and the
                            ambassadors were as powerless as the Roman senators before
                            Alaric.</note> and secondly because none of the ambassadors from Philip,
                        nor Philip's own letter, but only Aeschines, mentioned the promises. </p>

                <div type="section" n="45">
                    <p>So drawing my conclusions, I rose and presented myself, and made an attempt
                        to reply. When you refused me a hearing, I held my peace, except that I
                        protested—and I entreat that you will recall this—that I had no knowledge of
                        the promises, nothing to do with them, and, I added, no faith in them. At
                        the words “no faith in them,” you became exasperated; and I proceeded: “If
                        any of these promises come true, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>, be sure you give thanks and honors and decorations
                        to these gentlemen; but not to me. If, however, things turn out otherwise,
                        see that it is on them that you vent your wrath. I stand aside.” </p>

                <div type="section" n="46">
                    <p>“Not now,” said Aeschines, interrupting me, “do not stand aside now; only do
                        not put in your claim then.” “Agreed;” said I, “if I do, I shall be in the
                        wrong.” Then Philocrates rose, and said, in a very supercilious manner: “No
                        wonder Demosthenes and I disagree, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>. He drinks water; I drink wine.” And then you all

                    <p>Now look at the decree, which Philocrates afterwards drafted and handed to
                        the clerk. It sounds well enough to the ear; but if you will take into
                        account the occasion on which it was proposed, and the promises which
                        Aeschines was making at the time, it will be clear that they were simply
                        handing over the Phocians to Philip and the Thebans—I might almost say, with
                        shackles on their wrists. Read the decree.<quote n="Decree">

                        posterity; and that thanks are given to Philip for his promise of just

                    <p>It was Aeschines who was Philip's spokesman and gave undertakings. Then

                        inserts in the decree a clause providing that, if the Phocians should not do
                        what was right and give up the temple to the Amphictyonic Council, the

                        were on the spot except the Thessalians and the Thebans, he really has
                        proposed, with the utmost civility, to hand the temple over to them. The
                        wording is, “to the Amphictyons;” but what Amphictyons? There were none
                        there except Thessalians and Thebans. He makes no such proposal as that the
                        Amphictyonic Council should be convened, or that operations should be
                        suspended until it meets, or that Proxenus should march against the

                        would not have destroyed your opportunity of going out before he summoned

                        object was that you, in the belief that he would do all that you wanted,
                        should make no decree prejudicial to him, and the Phocians might not stand
                        their ground and hold out in reliance upon hopes afforded by you, but might
                        make unconditional surrender to him in sheer desperation. Read Philip's

                        march to the aid of Philip. Their actual policy was very different.
                        Naturally; for they did not apply their minds to the phrasing of the letter;
                        they were in the secret of the intention with which it was written, and with

                        times over, he would never have dared to deceive Athenians and envoys of the
                        Athenian people, that the report of Aeschines was true, and that destruction

                        would turn against them. A third party supposed that you regretted your

                        nineteenth of Elaphebolion, and we were abroad receiving the oaths for three
                        entire months. During the whole of that time the Phocians were safe. </p>

                <div type="section" n="58">
                    <p>We returned from the oath-taking embassy on the thirteenth of Scirophorion,
                        when Philip was already at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                            >Thermopylae</placeName> and making promises to the Phocians which they
                        were not disposed to believe. The proof of that is that otherwise they would
                        not have resorted to you. Then the Assembly, at which these men brought the
                        whole business to ruin with their lies and cajolery, was held on the
                        sixteenth of Scirophorion. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="59">
                    <p>Now I calculate that the news from <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName> reached the Phocians on the fourth day after that
                        date, for there were Phocian envoys in the city, and they were interested in
                        knowing what report these men would submit and what decree you would adopt.
                        Therefore the twentieth was the day on which we reckon that the Phocians
                        received the news, that is, the fourth day after the sixteenth. Then
                        followed the twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third; and on the
                        twenty-third the convention was made, and the fortunes of <placeName
                            key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> perished and came to an end. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" n="60">
                    <p>How, then, is this date proved? On the twenty-seventh, when you were holding
                        an assembly at Peiraeus to discuss dockyard business, Dercylus arrived from
                            <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> with the
                        intelligence that Philip had put the whole affair into the hands of the
                        Thebans, and he computed that it was then the fourth day after the
                        convention. Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,
                        twenty-seven: that makes it the fourth day. Therefore these dates, together
                        with their own reports and decrees, all convict these men of having
                        co-operated with Philip, and they share with him the guilt of the
                        destruction of the Phocians. </p>

                <div type="section" n="61">
                    <p>Again, the consideration that not a city of the Phocians was taken forcibly,
                        whether by blockade or assault, and yet that they were all brought to utter
                        ruin under the convention, is a convincing proof that they perished because
                        they had been persuaded through these men that Philip would deliver them;
                        for about his character they had no illusions. Now give me our treaty with
                        the Phocians, and the Amphictyonic decrees, under which they dismantled
                        their defences. These documents will show you on what footing you stood with

                        any other of the nationalities then present. Again, it says that the
                        Phocians are to surrender their cities to Philip, not to the Thebans, or the
                        Thessalians, or any other people. </p>

                        Lacedaemonians in old time, and those accursed Euboeans lately, and many
                        other peoples, not because they were virtuous, but because their safety
                        profited <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as that of the
                        Phocians would today. What transgression did the Phocians or the
                        Lacedaemonians or you or anyone else commit after Aeschines' speech, that
                        the promises made by him to you then should not be fulfilled? </p>

                <div type="section" n="76">
                    <p>Ask him that question. He can point to none. For he made his lying report,
                        you believed it, the Phocians heard of it, surrendered, and perished, all
                        within a period of five days only. Hence it is clearly evident that the ruin
                        of the Phocians was nothing but a concoction of deceit and artifice. For
                        during the time when Philip was unable to march by reason of the peace, but
                        was already laying his plans, he sent for the Lacedaemonians, promising to
                        do everything for them, so that the Phocians might not, through your agency,
                        secure their help. </p>

                        snare, had withdrawn, he sent Aeschines as his agent in advance for your
                        deception, lest, when you discovered that he was acting in the interest of
                        the Thebans, he should be involved once more in delays and fighting and
                        waste of time with the Phocians resisting him, and you helping them. In this
                        way he hoped to obtain complete mastery without a struggle. And so it fell
                        out. Aeschines, then, must not escape punishment for deceiving you, merely
                        because Philip deceived the Lacedaemonians and the Phocians. That would be
                        unjust indeed. </p>

                        done you by his embassy, you must not suffer him by his defence also to
                        fasten upon the city the reproach that, while stealthily securing some of
                        your own possessions, you made sacrifice of the safety of your allies. You
                        did no such thing. Peace was concluded; the <placeName key="tgn,7010345"
                            >Chersonese</placeName> was secure; and then for the four ensuing months

                        it have been easier to punish Philip for wrongful aggression upon that
                        country—before he forestalled us at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"
                            >Thermopylae</placeName>, or today? Surely far easier then! What, then,

                            >Chersonese</placeName>, if the man, who would have invaded it if he

                        the matter stands. The best and most respectable of the expatriated
                        Phocians, being exiled and in distress, are living peaceably, and none of
                        them would be willing to incur private animosity on account of the
                        misfortunes of the nation, while those who might have done anything for a
                        fee find that there is no one to pay it them. </p>

                    <p>For I would never pay a man a farthing to stand here by my side and make an
                        outcry about his sufferings, since truth and fact cry out loudly enough. Nay
                        more, the commonalty of the Phocians are in such an evil and pitiable plight
                        that there is no question with them of prosecuting at an Athenian
                        scrutiny—only of living like slaves in mortal terror of Thebans and of
                        Philip's mercenaries, who are billeted on them after they have been disarmed
                        and distributed among villages. </p>

                    <p>Do not allow this plea. No, Aeschines must prove either that the Phocians are
                        not ruined, or that he did not promise that Philip would protect them. These
                        are the questions for a scrutiny of an embassy: What has been accomplished?
                        What did you report? If the truth,—go in peace; if falsehood,—take your
                        punishment. What matter if the Phocians are not in court? You have played
                        your part in reducing them to such straits that they can neither help their
                        friends nor repel their enemies. </p>

                        perils. You all know that the prowess of the Phocians, and their control of

                        gave us security against the Thebans, and ensured that neither Philip nor

                        security was fortified by arms and an unbroken front, by strongholds of our
                        allies and a broad territory; and you have acquiesced in its devastation.

                        and of you all. Philip was resolved from the first to do for the Thebans all
                        that he has done, but Aeschines by the perversions of his report revealed
                        your repugnance, and so intensified both your hostility and Philip's
                        friendliness towards the Thebans. How could the man have treated you more
                        arrogantly? </p>

                <div type="section" n="86">
                    <p>Now take and read the decrees of Diophantus and of Callisthenes. They will
                        show you how, when you did your duty, you made it an occasion of services of
                        praise and thanksgiving, both at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName> and abroad; but when you had been led astray by

                    <p>That is the decree you then made; and you owe it to these men. It was not
                        with such expectations that you either made the first draft of the peace and
                        alliance, or subsequently consented to add the words, and to his posterity,
                        but in the hope of marvellous benefits through their agency. Yes, and since
                        then you all remember how many times you have been agitated by news of
                        Philip's army and auxiliaries at Porthmus or at <placeName

                        in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>; but you must not look
                        only at that and abate your vigilance,—you must bear in mind that, thanks to
                        these men, he has it in his power to do so whenever he chooses. You must
                        keep that danger before your eyes, and abhor and punish the author and
                        purveyor of that power. </p>

                    <p>No doubt Aeschines will eschew a direct reply to the charges alleged, and in
                        his desire to lead you as far as possible away from the facts, he will
                        dilate on the great blessings that peace brings to the world and set against
                        them the evils of war. He will eulogize peace in general terms, and that
                        will be his defence. But all those considerations tell against him. For, if
                        peace, which brings blessings to others, has brought so much vexation and
                        bewilderment to you, what are we to say except that these men with their
                        bribe-taking have perverted to evil a thing in itself excellent? What next?

                    <p>Perhaps he will ask: “Do you not retain, and shall you not retain through the

                    <p>In reply to that, you have to reflect that Philip also has greatly
                        strengthened his position owing to the peace, as regards his material
                        resources in arms, in territory, in revenues, which last have increased
                        largely. </p>

                        policy and of alliance,—and it is by them that all nations hold advantages
                        for themselves or for stronger states—in our case, bartered away by these
                        men, they have perished, or at least deteriorated: his are now formidable
                        and far greater. It is surely unfair that, while Philip, thanks to these
                        men, enjoys extended alliances and increased revenues, the advantages that
                        we should in any case have gained from the peace should be reckoned by them
                        as a set-off against those that they have sold. For our gains are not a
                        compensation for our losses; far from it! No; what we now have would equally
                        have been ours, and what we have not would have been added to us, but for
                        these men. </p>

                        have befallen the city, if Aeschines had no hand in them, they ought not to
                        be visited upon him. On the other hand, if the right policy has been taken
                        by others, it is not fair that their success should save him. Take into
                        account everything to which he contributed; requite him with gratitude, if
                        he deserves it, with resentment, if his conduct provokes resentment. </p>

                        blessings of peace; but consider one thing at a time. For example, we were
                        at war with Philip. True. Does anyone blame Aeschines for that? Does anyone
                        wish to arraign him for the events of the war? Not a single man. Then so far
                        he is acquitted; he need not say a word. A defendant should adduce witnesses
                        and submit proofs on the issues in dispute, not mislead the jury by
                        addressing his defence to points of agreement. You are not to say anything
                        about the war, Aeschines. No one blames you for that. </p>

                <div type="section" n="93">
                    <p>Afterwards certain persons advised us to make peace; we took their advice; we

                        one blames Aeschines. Does anyone allege that he broached the question of
                        peace? Or that he acted wrongly when he brought the delegates here? Not a
                        single man. Then about the mere fact that the city made peace he need not
                        say a word; for that he is not chargeable. </p>

                        deliberating, not whether peace should or should not be made—that question
                        was already decided—but what sort of peace. Then he contradicted men who
                        spoke honestly, and he supported the mover of a venal resolution, being
                        himself bribed. Afterwards, when appointed to receive the oaths of
                        ratification, he disobeyed every one of your instructions; he brought to

                        human mendacity before or since. At the outset, until Philip got a hearing

                        defendant, who took it over, and completed the enterprise of destruction.

                            the Council and Assembly. This was an official of some dignity; he was

                        his own acts nothing that is good, nothing that is not criminal, while a

                        like men who borrow money at a high rate of interest. For these men have
                        betrayed the security and guarantee of the peace—the Phocians and <placeName

                        quite true. If any man is really pleased with the peace, let him be grateful
                        to those generals whom everyone denounces. For, had they fought to your
                        satisfaction, you would have scorned the very name of peace. </p>

                <div type="section" n="97">
                    <p>Peace, then, we owe to the generals; a perilous, insecure, and precarious
                        peace to these men and their venality. Put a stop, then, to his eloquence
                        about the peace. Make him address himself to his own performances. Aeschines
                        is not on trial for the peace; the peace is discredited through Aeschines.
                        That is easily proved. Suppose that the peace had been concluded, and that
                        you had not thereafter been deluded, and none of your allies destroyed—what
                        human being would the peace have aggrieved? I mean, apart from the
                        consideration that it was not a glorious peace. For that fault Aeschines is
                        indeed partly to blame, as he supported Philocrates. However, in the case
                        supposed, no incurable mischief would have been done. As the case stands, he
                        is answerable for a great deal. </p>

                        the jury, I am so reluctant to play the informer in these matters, or to ask
                        you to do so, that, if we are dealing with blunders due to stupidity or
                        simplicity or any other sort of ignorance, I acquit Aeschines, and invite

                        Either he had taken an explicit promise from Philip that he would do and
                        perform certain acts, or else, being spellbound and deluded by Philip's
                        habitual courtesy, he honestly expected him to do them. There is no third

                        danger and ignominy. He has deceived you; his reputation is shattered; he is
                        on his trial. If he had been treated as he deserves, he would have been

                        Philip he has been a trusty and well-beloved hireling; to you a treacherous

                        ask you to vote for Philip's admission to the Amphictyonic Council. Who
                        ought to have been the very first to oppose them? Aeschines. Why ? Because

                        stop to the aggressions of the Thebans; but Philip has made the Thebans
                        dangerously strong, he has exterminated the Phocians, and, instead of
                        fortifying <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and <placeName

                        made a single objection. That was bad—but not bad enough for him. He did
                        what no other man in all <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
                        did—he spoke in support of the envoys. Even that miscreant Philocrates durst

                        before your eyes, dealing in wheat, building houses, boasting that he would

                        Philocrates, I rose and said that I was dissatisfied with the impeachment in
                        one respect: it implied that all these grave misdemeanors had been committed
                        by Philocrates alone, and not by any of the other nine ambassadors. That, I
                        remarked, was impossible; for by himself Philocrates would have counted for
                        nothing, if he had none of his colleagues to act with him. </p>

                        any man who chooses stand up and come forward, and declare that he had no
                        part in Philocrates' doings, and does not approve them. Every man who does
                        this,” I added, “I acquit.” No doubt you remember the incident. Well, no one
                        came forward or presented himself. The rest had various excuses: </p>

                        Aeschines had no such excuse. The truth is, he has sold himself once for
                        all. Not only has he taken hire for past actions, but it is evident that, if
                        he escapes now, he will henceforward, as against you, be Philip's man; and
                        so, for fear of uttering a single word injurious to Philip, even when you
                        acquit him he does not accept acquittal. He prefers disrepute, prosecution,
                        any punishment this court may inflict rather than to do anything
                        disagreeable to Philip. </p>

                        You cannot find fault with facts, and say that they are what they are in
                        deference to somebody, or to oblige somebody. They are what your treachery
                        and perversion have made them, and such they appear on examination. But I
                        have another witness besides the facts. You shall this very moment give
                        evidence against yourself. Come here: stand up and answer me!—Nothing to
                        say? You cannot plead inexperience. You, who take up a new prosecution as
                        easily as you study a new play, and convict your man without witnesses and
                        under a time-limit, you must be an uncommonly clever speaker!<note

                        that prayer Aeschines joined. He invoked a curse on his own fatherland. It
                        is for you to make that curse recoil upon his own head. </p>

                        again placed in subjection to you the city of <placeName

                        same time that we were there from you. He offered them money—a very large
                        sum, by their own account. The Theban ambassadors declined the overture, and
                        would not take the bribe. Afterwards, at a sacrificial banquet, when Philip
                        was drinking with them, and showing them much civility, he kept offering
                        them presents, beginning with captives and the like, and ending with gold
                        and silver goblets. All these gifts they rejected, and would on no account
                        give themselves away. </p>

                <div type="section" n="140">
                    <p>At last Philo, one of the ambassadors, made a speech that deserved to have

                            >Athens</placeName>, instead of by the spokesman of <placeName

                        and gratified to find Philip so courteously and generously inclined towards
                        them; that they were already his friends and guests, without those gifts;
                        would he be good enough to direct his benevolence to the public business on
                        which he was engaged, and do something creditable both to himself and to the
                        Thebans? If so, they could promise him the friendship of all <placeName

                        the light of actual truth, see what a fine thing it is to refuse to sell
                        your country! The Thebans have gained, in the first place, peace, when they
                        were in trouble, hard pressed by the war, and in danger of defeat; and
                        secondly, the complete overthrow of their enemies, the Phocians, and the
                        utter destruction of their strongholds and cities. Is that all? No, indeed;
                        they have also gained <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>,

                        satisfaction of having achieved these results for their country. Ah, but
                        that is worth having, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"

                        would restore to you your own as an enemy and an adversary, and the man who

                        Aeschines forced an adjournment to the following day, and then persuaded you
                        to adopt Philocrates' resolution, which included all these proposals and

                        brought, to the city sending ambassadors, the destruction of allies,
                        dispossession of property, ignominy in exchange for honor, and to the
                        ambassadors themselves who intrigued against the city, revenues, property,

                    <p>Here is another point for your consideration, gentlemen of the jury. Who
                        gained the greater advantage in the operations, the Phocians over the
                        Thebans, or Philip over you? I reply, the Phocians over the Thebans. They
                        held <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>, and <placeName
                            key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>, and Tilphosaeum; they had kept
                        within the walls the Theban garrison at Neon; they had slain two hundred and
                        seventy Thebans at Hedyleum, and a trophy had been set up; they were
                        superior in cavalry, and so an Iliad of woes encompassed the Thebans. </p>

                    <p>No such disaster ever befell, nor, I hope, ever will befall, you. The worst
                        misfortune of your war with Philip was that you could not do him as much
                        harm as you wished; against defeat you were absolutely secure. Then why did
                        the same peace mean, for the Thebans, who were so badly worsted in the war,
                        the recovery of their own possessions and the acquisition of possessions of
                        their adversaries, and, for the Athenians, the loss in time of peace of
                        advantages which were maintained in the war? The reason is that their
                        ambassadors did not sell them, but these men have sold you. That my account
                        is true, you will find further proof as we proceed. </p>

                    <p>When the peace of Philocrates, which Aeschines supported in a speech, had
                        been concluded, Philip's ambassadors accepted the oaths, and departed. So
                        far no fatal mischief had been done. The peace was, indeed, discreditable
                        and unworthy of Athens—but then we were going to get those wonderful
                        advantages in exchange. I at once called upon you, and told the envoys, to
                        sail for the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> as speedily
                        as possible, and not to abandon, or allow Philip to seize and hold, any of
                        the positions there in the meantime; </p>

                <div type="section" n="151">
                    <p>for well I knew that indolent people lose for ever anything that they let
                        slip in the transition from war to peace. No one, who has been induced by
                        general considerations to sheathe the sword, is ever inclined to begin war
                        over again for the recovery of his losses; and so the appropriator retains
                        possession. Apart from these considerations, I conceived that, if we sailed
                        at once, the city would gain one of two advantages. For when we were on the
                        spot and had accepted his oath according to the decree, either he would
                        restore the places he had taken from <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName> and keep his hands off the rest, </p>

                        observing his grasping spirit and perfidy in those distant and comparatively
                        unimportant places, would no longer be negligent of the more important
                        concerns that lay nearer home—I mean the Phocians and <placeName
                            key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. If he had not seized
                        the positions, and if there had been no deception of you, all your interests
                        were safe enough, and you would get fair treatment from him without
                        compulsion. </p>

                <div type="section" n="153">
                    <p>This was a reasonable expectation; for so long as the Phocians were safe, as
                        they were at the time, and in possession of <placeName
                            key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, there was no menace
                        which Philip could have brandished in your face to make you disregard any of
                        your just claims. He could not reach <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
                            >Attica</placeName> either by a march across country or by getting
                        command of the seas. If he refused justice, you could forthwith close his
                        ports, stop his supply of money, and otherwise reduce him to a state of
                        blockade; and so he, and not you, would be wholly dependent on the

                        proposed a decree as a member of the Council, to which the Assembly had
                        given authority, directing the envoys to sail immediately, and the general
                        Proxenus to convey them to any place in which he should ascertain that
                        Philip was to be found. I drafted it, as I now read it, in those express

                        discharging some other part of their duty. Not at all; though they were on
                        their travels for three whole months, and received from you a thousand
                        drachmas for journey-money, they did not get the oaths from any single city
                        either on their outward journey or on their way home. The oaths were
                        administered at the hostelry in front of the Temple of the Twins,—any of you

                        with a clause excepting the Halians and the Phocians, and Philocrates had
                        been compelled by you to erase those words and write expressly, “the
                        Athenians and the Allies of the Athenians,” to the treaty so drawn Philip
                        did not wish any of his allies to have sworn; for then they would have
                        refused to join in his forcible occupation of those possessions of yours
                        which he now holds, and the oath would have been their excuse. </p>

                        Therefore he disapproved of these men going anywhere, lest the facts that I
                        am stating should become generally known; and they were ready to gratify him

                        interest of Philip. When we were setting out on the former embassy for
                        peace, you sent forward a herald to arrange our safe-conduct. On that
                        occasion, as soon as they reached Oreus, they wasted no time there waiting
                        for the herald. Although Halus was beleaguered, they crossed the sea
                        thither; then left the town and went to Parmenio, who was conducting the
                        siege; set off through the enemies' positions for <placeName

                        they met the herald at <placeName key="perseus,Larissa">Larissa</placeName>.
                        Such was the energy and goodwill with which they travelled then; </p>

                        your injunctions of haste, it never occurred to them to hasten their journey
                        by land or to travel by sea. Why so? Because then it was to Philip's
                        advantage that peace should be concluded with all speed, but now that as
                        much time as possible should be wasted before the administration of the
                        oaths. </p>

                        of Philip? It was the same journey: they loitered when they should have
                        bestirred themselves in your service; they hurried when they ought not to
                        have moved a step until the arrival of the herald. </p>

                        for ourselves. Mine was to seek out and rescue the captives, spending money
                        of my own, and asking Philip to apply to their ransom the money he was
                        spending on hospitable gifts for us. But what Aeschines constantly tried to
                        effect, you shall hear in a moment. What then was it? It was that Philip
                        should give us a lump sum as a collective present. </p>

                    <p>You must know that Philip was already sounding us all in this way: he sent

                            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, of a really large sum in gold.
                        Having failed in some case or other,—in what case let the result disclose;
                        it is not for me to name myself,—he conceived that a collective present
                        might be accepted by all of us without misgiving; and that there would be
                        security for those who had individually sold themselves, if we all shared
                        even to a trifling extent in the general acceptance. Accordingly it was

                        with decency either inform against them by replying, “It is in so-and-so's
                        pockets,” or escape the outlay; so he made me the promise, but evaded
                        performance by saying that he would send the men home in time for the
                        Panathenaic Festival. Read the deposition of Apollophanes, and then those of

                        Philip's arrival, some of the prisoners,—all in fact who were out on

                        induce Philip to move, told me that they were willing to provide for their
                        own ransom without putting themselves under obligation to Philip, and
                        offered to borrow their ransom-money, three minas, five minas, or as the

                <div type="section" n="170">
                    <p>So when Philip agreed to get the release of the rest, I called together these
                        men, to whom I had lent the money as a friendly loan, reminded them of the
                        transaction, and made them a free gift of their ransom-money, lest they
                        should seem to have been put into a worse position by their impetuosity, or
                        to have been ransomed, though poor men, at their own expense, while the rest
                        were expecting deliverance from Philip. To prove the truth of my statement,

                        remember that I had promised the prisoners whom I delivered that I would

                        I proved that by twice excusing myself when you twice appointed me to the
                        third embassy, and also by my constant opposition to them on this journey.

                        everything went to ruin. Indeed, if my advice had been taken, all our
                        transactions might have had an equally fortunate issue; for I was not so
                        foolish and stupid as to lose money, while others were making money, out of
                        sheer public spirit, and then object to a course of action that would have
                        cost no expense, and that offered far greater advantages to the whole
                        commonwealth. Yes, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, the issue might have been fortunate indeed; only these

                        in comparison with mine; for the contrast will help to expose them. First,
                        in violation both of the decree and of assurances given to you, they
                        excluded the Halians, the Phocians, and Cersobleptes, from the benefits of
                        the treaty. Then they attempted to tamper with and repeal the decree from
                        which our own authority was derived. Next they entered the Cardians as
                        allies of Philip, and refused by a definite vote to send a dispatch written
                        by me, but themselves composed and sent one that did not contain an honest
                        word. </p>

                <div type="section" n="175">
                    <p>Then, because I objected to their acts, not only thinking them dishonorable
                        but fearing that I might share the ruin they were bringing on themselves,
                        our chivalrous friend accused me of promising to Philip that I would
                        overthrow the Athenian democracy, while all the time he was himself
                        constantly holding private communications with Philip. I need only mention
                        that not I but Dercylus, with the help of this servant of mine, watched him
                        by night at Pherae, caught him emerging from Philip's tent, and told the
                        servant to let me know, and not to forget it himself; and that in the end
                        this impudent blackguard stayed with Philip for a day and a night on our
                        departure. </p>

                    <p>You have seen how I was harassed by troubles and annoyance throughout the
                        expedition. You can imagine how they behaved there, with their paymaster
                        next door, when their conduct here, under the eyes of the people, who hold
                        the power to reward and to chastise, is what we know it to be. </p>

                        proved, not by words but by the testimony of facts, that there was no word
                        of truth in the report of Aeschines, but that he successfully deceived you.

                        captivated as you then were by his promises and assurances; that his
                        counsels were exactly opposed to right policy; that he spoke against the
                        terms of peace proposed by our allies, and in favor of the proposals of
                        Philocrates; that he purposely wasted your time to debar you from going to
                        the aid of the Phocians if you should so desire; that throughout his journey
                        abroad his sins were many and grievous; that he has betrayed everything,
                        sold everything, taken bribes, and stopped short of no iniquity. That, then,

                        to the decrees of the people and of the Council of Five Hundred; the conduct
                        of the defendant when holding the office of ambassador has manifestly
                        violated those laws, those decrees, and the principles of justice; therefore
                        he must be convicted by an intelligent jury. If he had committed no other
                        crime, two only of his transgressions are sufficient to put him to death,
                        for he has betrayed <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> as well

                        for such betrayals have been sentenced to death or mulcted in large sums of
                        money in this court,—Ergophilus, Cephisodotus, Timomachus, and, in old

                        disturb you or cause immediate annoyance. And then you come here and pass
                        random resolutions,—that Philip shall swear fidelity to Cersobleptes,—that

                        terms of peace. Yet all your resolutions would have been unnecessary, if
                        only the defendant had chosen to travel by sea and to do his duty. What
                        might have been saved by sailing, he has lost by insisting on travel by
                        land; and what might have been saved by telling the truth, he has lost by

                        might reasonably be brought to justice; but there is one point on which I do
                        insist. If Aeschines talked like an idiot and made blunders as an unofficial
                        person, do not be hypercritical, leave him alone, make allowances. But if he
                        has purposely deceived you for money while holding office as ambassador, do
                        not let him off, do not listen to the suggestion that he is not to be put on
                        his trial for mere words. </p>

                        Ambassadors have control, not over war-ships, and military positions, and
                        troops, and citadels,—these are never entrusted to them,—but over words and
                        opportunities. If an ambassador has not wasted the opportunities of the
                        state, he is no wrongdoer; if he has wasted them, he has done wrong. If the
                        words of his reports are true and profitable words, let him be acquitted; if
                        they are false, venal, and noxious, let him be convicted. </p>

                        administered if the speeches are false? If he actually takes bribes and
                        speaks in the interest of our enemies, will not you be imperilled? Again, to
                        filch your opportunities is not an offence equivalent to filching those of

                        convene an Assembly, but only on a statutory date. Then the most honest
                        debaters have to make good their advantage and argue down an ignorant or

                        approval that Philip was strongly moved, and granted the boon. And yet

                        freeborn and, as the event proved, a modest girl. </p>

                    <p>At first, I believe, they only tried to make her drink quietly and eat
                        dessert; so Iatrocles told me the following day. But as the carouse went on,
                        and they became heated, they ordered her to sit down and give them a song.
                        The poor girl was bewildered, for she did not wish, and she did not know
                        how, to sing. Then Aeschines and Phryno declared that it was intolerable
                        impertinence for a captive,—and one of those ungodly, pernicious Olynthians
                        too,—to give herself such airs. “Call a servant,” they cried; “bring a whip,
                        somebody.” In came a flunkey with a horsewhip, and—I suppose they were
                        tipsy, and it did not take much to irritate them,when she said something and
                        began to cry, he tore off her dress and gave her a number of lashes on the
                        back. </p>

                        perished, the victim of a drunken orgy, for the drunkenness of this
                        blackguard is something terrible. The story of this girl was told even in

                        insanity,—though, perhaps, a man devoid of any honest plea cannot help

                        an honest defence. Now it is an honest and straightforward defence to prove

                        they were for the advantage of the state. But he cannot make good either of

                        paralyses their audacity; conscience cripples their tongues, closes their

                    <p>You remember the most recent occasion, at Peiraeus only the other day, when
                        you refused to appoint Aeschines to an embassy, how he bellowed at me: “I

                        threat of impeachment involves endless speeches and litigation; but here are
                        just two or three simple words that a slave bought yesterday could deliver:
                        “Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, here is a
                        strange thing! This man accuses me of offences in which he himself took
                        part. He says that I have taken bribes, when he took them, or shared them,
                        himself.” </p>

                <div type="section" n="210">

                        he only vented idle menaces. The reason is that he was conscious of guilt;
                        he cowered like a slave before those words; his thoughts did not approach
                        them but recoiled from them, arrested by his evil conscience. Mere vague
                        invective and abuse there was no one to stop. </p>

                    <p>And now comes the strongest possible point—not a matter of assertion but of
                        fact. I wished to do the honest thing, and to give an account of myself
                        twice, because I had been appointed ambassador twice; but Aeschines
                        approached the Court of Scrutiny, taking with him a crowd of witnesses, and
                        forbade them to summon me, on the ground that I had already submitted to
                        scrutiny, and was no longer liable. What was the real meaning of this
                        ludicrous proceeding? Having himself rendered his account of the earlier
                        embassy, with which nobody found fault, he did not wish to come into court
                        in respect of the embassy for which he is now under examination; and that is
                        the embassy that includes all his misdeeds. </p>

                        therefore he would not let me be summoned. Yet that act, men of <placeName

                        that Aeschines has pronounced his own condemnation, and therefore you cannot

                        truthful word to say about me, otherwise he would have spoken out and
                        denounced me then, instead of trying to block my summons. </p>

                        a way of escape;” for that, I hear, is one of his suggestions. But, by your
                        own account, Aeschines, there is no crime, and therefore no jeopardy. If he
                        repeats the insinuation, do you, gentlemen, consider this: in a case where
                        I, who did no wrong whatever, was yet afraid lest these men's conduct should

                        he gave them,—and so to make friends both with him and with them,—for indeed
                        I might have had their friendship if I had been their accomplice, and even
                        now there is no vendetta between us, only that I had no part in their
                        malpractices, or to levy blackmail on their takings, and so incur Philip's
                        enmity and theirs; to spend all my money on the ransom of captives, and then

                            >Athens</placeName> to see Philip, and their names were Philocrates,
                        Aeschines, Phryno, and Demosthenes. One of them not only made no gain from
                        his mission, but delivered captives at his own expense; but another went
                        about buying harlots and fish with the money for which he had sold his

                        was unworthy of his country or himself. Though he was still paying for a

                        of his countrymen to suffer distress through poverty. But another, instead
                        of delivering any of the Athenians who were already in captivity, helped to
                        bring a whole district, and ten thousand of the infantry and about a

                        forgotten those all-important topics! When I was drafting the provisional
                        resolution of the Council respecting the earlier embassy, and again in
                        addressing the people at the Assemblies that were held to discuss the terms
                        of peace, I followed the usual custom, and included a vote of thanks and an
                        invitation to the public mess-table; for at that time no wrongful word or
                        act of theirs had been disclosed. </p>

                    <p>It is also true that I entertained Philip's ambassadors, and did the thing
                        very handsomely; for, having observed in their own country that they take
                        pride in such hospitality as evidence of wealth and splendor, I thought it
                        my duty to outdo them with a more striking display of munificence. On the
                        strength of these incidents, Aeschines will tell you: “Demosthenes thanked
                        us, and entertained the ambassadors himself”—without marking the distinction
                        of time. </p>

                        return of the envoys, when the people had still to hear their report, and
                        when it was not yet known that Aeschines would support Philocrates, or that
                        Philocrates would move such a resolution. If he mentions the incidents, bear
                        in mind that the dates were earlier than their offences, and that I have

                        on our gratitude, but we should have a large claim on yours; for we passed
                        over many much more worthy claimants, and glorified you. But if in the
                        actual enjoyment of those dignities one of you has committed a crime, and
                        such a crime as this, do you not all deserve abhorrence much more than
                        deliverance? That is my view. However, they will storm and bluster,—for they
                        have very loud voices and very little modesty,—and will remind you that “it

                        your business to think of the laws, of the whole commonwealth, and above all
                        of the oath in virtue of which you sit in that box. If they have besought
                        any of you to deliver him, ask yourselves whether they mean in case he is
                        not, or in case he is, guilty of a crime against the common weal. If they

                        him in any case, they have entreated you to perjure yourselves. For though
                        the vote is secret, it will not escape the eye of Heaven. The legislator

                        evidence, Aeschines, can I adduce for the many crimes of your embassy than
                        the evidence you have given against yourself? You, who thought it necessary
                        to implicate in so grievous a calamity one who purposed to bring a part of
                        your misconduct to light, must surely have expected a terrible retribution

                        now valid against himself. For surely the principles which you, Aeschines,
                        laid down when you prosecuted Timarchus ought to have equal weight for

                        embassy) with Philocrates, of him I ask not, for I know him well—to have

                        Theodorus or Aristodemus, for whom Aeschines commonly took the inferior
                        parts; Molon however produced it, and perhaps some other players of the old
                        school. But Sophocles' Antigone was frequently acted by Theodorus, and also
                        by Aristodemus; and in that play there are some iambic lines, admirably and
                        most instructively composed. That passage Aeschines omitted to quote, though
                        he has often spoken the lines, and knows them by heart; </p>

                        the self-restraint of the popular orators of that generation. People who

                        that this statue was erected less than fifty years ago. Now from the age of
                        Solon to the present day about two hundred and forty years have elapsed, so
                        that the sculptor who designed that disposition of drapery had not lived in

                        risk of death, composed and recited an elegiac poem, and so retrieved that

                    <p>Gentlemen of the jury, by the universal judgement of Greeks and barbarians
                        alike, you acted well and righteously in passing this vote of censure upon
                        traitors and reprobates. Therefore, inasmuch as bribe-taking is the
                        forerunner of such treasons, and for the sake of bribes men commit them,
                        whenever, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you see
                        any man taking bribes, you may be sure that he is also a traitor. If one man
                        betrays opportunities, another negotiations, another soldiery, each one is
                        making havoc of the business he controls, and all alike deserve your
                        reprobation. </p>

                        commonwealth and does credit to his ancestry, or, by a wrong decision,
                        impairs that condition and dishonors that ancestry. What, then, was their
                        judgement in such a case?—Clerk, take this and read it.—For I would have you
                        know that you are treating with indifference offences such as your

                        between the Chelidonian islands and the Blue Rocks. At the inquiry into his
                        conduct they came near to putting him to death, and mulcted him in fifty

                        Look at the decree: “Whereas the said ambassadors have disobeyed their
                        instructions.” That is the first charge alleged. And did not these men
                        disobey their instructions? Did not the decree say, “for the Athenians and
                        the Allies of the Athenians,” and did not they declare the Phocians to be
                        excluded? Did it not instruct them to swear in the magistrates in the
                        several cities, and did they not swear in only such persons as Philip sent
                        to them? Did not the decree say that they were not to meet Philip alone in
                        any place whatsoever, and did they not continually have private dealings
                        with Philip? </p>

                    <p>“Whereas,” says the old decree, “certain of them are convicted of making
                        untruthful reports to the Council.” Why, these men are convicted of making
                        untruthful reports even to the Assembly. On what evidence?—you remember that
                        brilliant quibble. On the evidence of facts: the report was exactly
                        contradicted by the event. It goes on: “and of sending untruthful
                        dispatches.” So did they. “And of bearing false witness against allies, and
                        of taking bribes.” For “bearing false witness” read “utterly destroying”—a
                        vastly greater injury. But as to their having taken bribes, we should still,
                        if they denied it, have to make the charge good; but since they admit it,
                        surely there should have been a summary arrest and punishment.<note

                        man of blood. He told you that the Arcadians were delighted to hear that

                        and attending to business. He related an incident which, he said, had filled
                        him with deep indignation. On his journey home he had met Atrestidas
                        travelling from Philip's court with some thirty women and children in his
                        train. He was astonished, and inquired of one of the travellers who the man
                        and his throng of followers were; </p>

                    <p>and when he was told that they were Olynthian captives whom Atrestidas was
                        bringing away with him as a present from Philip, he thought it a terrible
                        business, and burst into tears. <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
                            >Greece</placeName>, he sorrowfully reflected, is in evil plight indeed,
                        if she permits such cruelties to pass unchecked. He counselled you to send
                        envoys to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> to denounce the
                        persons who were intriguing for Philip; for, he said, he had been informed
                        that, if only <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> would give
                        attention to the matter and send ambassadors, the intriguers would promptly
                        be brought to justice. </p>

                <div type="section" n="307">
                    <p>Such was his speech on that occasion; a noble speech, worthy of our Athenian
                        traditions. But after he had visited <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
                            >Macedonia</placeName>, and beheld his own enemy and the enemy of all
                            <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, did his language bear
                        the slightest resemblance to those utterances? Not in the least: he bade you
                        not to remember your forefathers, not to talk about trophies, not to carry
                        succor to anybody. As for the people who recommended you to consult the
                        Greeks on the terms of peace with Philip, he was amazed at the suggestion
                        that it was necessary that any foreigner should be convinced when the
                        questions were purely domestic. </p>

                        and even to call him a barbarian! </p>

                    <p>Is it, then, conceivable that the man who made the earlier of those speeches
                        should also have made the later unless he had been corrupted? Is it possible
                        that the same man who was then inflamed with abhorrence of Atrestidas on
                        account of those Olynthian women and children, should now be content to
                        cooperate with Philocrates, who brought free-born Olynthian ladies to this
                        city for their dishonor? Philocrates is now so notorious for the infamous
                        life he has lived that I need not apply to him any degrading or offensive
                        epithet. When I merely mention that he did bring the ladies, there is not a
                        man in this court, whether on the jury or among the onlookers, who does not
                        know the sequel, and who does not, I am sure, feel compassion for those
                        miserable and unfortunate beings. Yet Aeschines had no compassion for them.
                        He did not shed tears over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>
                        on their account, indignant that they should suffer outrage in an allied
                        country at the hands of Athenian ambassadors. </p>

                        likely he will bring his children into court and put them in a conspicuous
                        position. But do you, gentlemen of the jury, as you look at those children
                        of his, reflect how many children of your own friends and allies are
                        wanderers, roaming the world in beggary, suffering hardships which they owe
                        to this man; and that they deserve your compassion infinitely more than the

                    <p>Now I wish by a brief recapitulation to remind you of the manner in which
                        Philip discomfited your policy with these scoundrels as his confederates. It
                        is well worth while to examine and contemplate the whole imposition. At the
                        outset he was really desirous of peace, for his whole country was overrun by
                        banditti, and his ports were blockaded, so that he got no advantage from all
                        his wealth. Accordingly he sent those envoys who addressed you in his name
                        with so much courtesy—Neoptolemus, Aristodemus, and <placeName

                <div type="section" n="316">
                    <p>But as soon as he was visited by us ambassadors, he promptly took Aeschines
                        into his pay, that he might support and co-operate with the infamous
                        Philocrates, and overpower those of us whose intentions were honest. He then
                        composed a letter to you, as the best means of obtaining the peace he
                        desired. </p>

                <div type="section" n="317">
                    <p>Even then it was still out of his power to achieve any important result to
                        your disadvantage, unless he should destroy the Phocians. That was no easy
                        task, for, as luck would have it, his affairs had reached a crisis of such a
                        nature that either he could not realize any of his purposes, or else he was
                        obliged to commit falsehood and perjury, with the whole world, both Greek
                        and barbarian, to witness his wickedness. </p>

                <div type="section" n="318">
                    <p>For if he should accept the Phocians as allies, and with your help take the
                        oath of friendship to them, he must at once violate the oaths he had already
                        sworn to the Thessalians and the Thebans, with the latter of whom he had
                        covenanted to help them in the subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,7002683"

                        Amphictyonic Council. If, on the other hand, he was loth to accept them—and
                        in fact the prospect did not please him—he expected that you would send
                        troops to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> to
                        stop his passage, as indeed you would have done if you had not been

                        himself a sufficient witness, for, after his first defeat of the Phocians
                        and the overthrow of their leader and commander Onomarchus, although no one
                        in the whole world, Greek or barbarian, sent aid to them save you alone, so
                        far from getting through <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"

                <div type="section" n="320">
                    <p>I take it he was perfectly well aware that now, with <placeName

                        getting the worst of the war, defeated in an engagement, and a trophy
                        erected at their expense, he would be unable to force the passage if you
                        sent troops to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>,
                        and that he could not even make the attempt without serious loss unless he
                        should also resort to some trickery. “How, then,” he thought, “shall I
                        escape open falsehood, and attain all my objects without incurring the
                        charge of perjury? Only if I can find Athenians to hood-wink the Athenian

                    <p>Accordingly his envoys warned you that he would not accept the Phocian

                        the people that, although for the sake of the Thebans and the Thessalians
                        Philip could not with decency accept the alliance, yet if he should become
                        master of the situation, and get his peace, he would thereafter do exactly

                <div type="section" n="322">

                        reinforcement of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae"

                        unexpected crisis, so that you might lose the power, if not the will, of
                        sending the expedition. That, then, was clearly what these men undertook. As
                        you have often heard, I was unable to get away in time; I had chartered a
                        ship, but was prevented from sailing. </p>

                        and no unfriendly resolution come to hand from you. “Very well,” thought
                        Philip, “a report shall be made by the Athenian ambassadors that the
                        Phocians are to be protected; and so, though they persist in mistrusting me,
                        they will deliver themselves into my hands through confidence in the
                        Athenians. We will enlist the sympathy of the Athenian people in the hope
                        that, supposing themselves to have got everything they want, they will pass
                        no obstructive resolution. These men shall carry from us such flattering
                        reports and assurances that, whatsoever may befall, they will make no

                        ambassadors whom Philip sent? Or would you give to them free maintenance in
                        the Town Hall, or any of the other privileges with which you reward your

                        gratitude or justice or kindness. It is, you will say—and it is a fair and
                        honest reply—because they did everything for Philip and nothing for us. </p>

                    <p>Then do you suppose that Philip acts on an entirely different principle from
                        yours, and gives all those handsome presents to Aeschines and his friends
                        because they conducted their mission duly and honestly in your interest?
                        That is not so. You have observed the reception he gave to the envoy

                        thing. Aeschines, he said, had prepared himself to denounce the general
                            Chares,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Chares: for thirty years an

                        that, whenever Chares has been brought to trial, he has been found to have
                        acted faithfully and loyally, so far as in him lay, in your interests,
                        though he has often failed of success by the fault of the people who do
                        mischief for money. I will go so far as to grant for argument's sake that
                        every word Aeschines will utter against him is true. But even on that
                        assumption it is absolutely ridiculous that a man in Chares' position should

                        he supported Philocrates, and did not support speakers whose proposals were
                        patriotic; that he took bribes; that thereafter, on the later embassy, he
                        deliberately squandered his opportunities; that he deceived the city, and
                        confounded its policy, by suggesting the hope that Philip would satisfy all
                        our desires; and that subsequently, when others warned you to beware of the

                        consent in the terms of peace. We owe them all to these men and to their
                        venality. If, then, Aeschines shirks the issue, if he tries to lead you

                            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> from men ready to go
                        to all lengths in his service. For if the fear that they would be called to
                        account did not deter them, what conduct can you expect from them if you
                        should give them a licence to do what they please? Will they not outvie
                        Euthycrates, Lasthenes, and all the traitors of history? </p>

                    <p>Every other man will be a worse citizen, when he sees that men who have made
                        traffic of the common interests emerge with wealth and reputation, and with
                        all the advantages of Philip's friendship, while the lot of those who
                        approved themselves honest men and spent their money in your service is
                        vexation and ill-will, and the enmity of those whom I need not name. Let it
                        not be so! For the sake of your honor, of your religion, of your security,
                        of everything you value, you must not acquit this man. Visit him with
                        exemplary punishment, and let his fate be a warning not to our own citizens
                        alone but to every man who lives in the Hellenic world.</p>
