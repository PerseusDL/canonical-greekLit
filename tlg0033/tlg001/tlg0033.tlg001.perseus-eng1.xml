                        he wanders far from the joy of festivity. <milestone unit="strophe"

                    <l n="13"> Lady Aglaia, and Euphrosyne, lover of dance and song, daughters of
                        the strongest god, </l>
                    <l n="15"> listen now; and you, Thalia, passionate for dance and song, having
                        looked with favor on this victory procession, stepping lightly in honor of
                        gracious fortune. For I have come to sing of Asopichus in Lydian melodies
                        and chosen phrases, because the Minyan land is victorious at <placeName
                            key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> , </l>
                    <l n="20"> thanks to you. Now go, Echo, to the dark-walled home of Persephone
                        and bring the glorious message to his father; when you see Cleodamus, tell
                        him that his son, by the famous valley of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa"
                            >Pisa</placeName> , has wreathed his youthful hair with the wings of the
                        renowned games. </l>
