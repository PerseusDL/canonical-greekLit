<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg009.perseus-eng2:2" n="2"> <p>it is therefore most necessary first to decide within oneself, neither hastily nor carelessly, in which of the things that belong to us the good life consists, and what are the indispensable conditions for men’s possessing it. For there is a distinction between health and the things that are indispensable conditions of health,</p> </div>
 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg009.perseus-eng2:2" n="3"> <p>and this is similarly the case with many other things; consequently also to live finely is not the same as the things without which living finely is impossible.</p> </div>

And these facts must not be overlooked,<note resp="Rackham">In the Mss. this clause comes before the preceding one, <q rend="single">for instance, eating meat . . . mentioned.</q> </note></p></div>

We ought to examine only the opinions of the wise<note resp="Rackham">The words translated <q rend="single">happiness</q> and <q rend="single">the opinions of the wise</q> are conjectural insertions in the Greek.</note>; for it is out of place to apply reasoning to those who do not need reasoning at all, but experience.</p> </div>
 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg009.perseus-eng2:3" n="3"> <p>But since every subject has special difficulties related to it, it is clear that there are such in regard to the highest life and the best mode of existence; it is then well to examine the opinions putting these difficulties, since the refutations advanced by those who challenge them are demonstrations of the theories that are opposed to them.</p></div>
 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg009.perseus-eng2:3" n="4"><p rend="align(indent)">Moreover to notice such matters is especially advantageous with a view to the subjects to which all inquiry ought to be directed—the question what are the means that make it possible to participate in living well and finely (if <q rend="single">blissfully</q> is too invidious an expression)—and with a view to the hope that we may have of the things that are good in the various departments.</p> </div>
 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg009.perseus-eng2:3" n="5"> <p>For if living finely depends on things that come by fortune or by nature, it would be beyond the hopes of many men, for then its attainment is not to be secured by effort, and does not rest with men themselves and is not a matter of their own conduct;</p> </div>
