						also in<bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1099a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1099a 27</bibl>.</note>
					who at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> set forth in the
					precinct of the god his own opinion composed an inscription for the
					forecourt of the temple of Leto in which he distinguished goodness,
					beauty and pleasantness as not all being properties of the same thing.
					His verses are: <cit>
						<quote type="verse">
							<l met="elegiac">Justice<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or 'Righteousness'; the term
								includes more than justice.</note> is fairest,
								and Health is best,</l>
							<l>But to win one's desire is the pleasantest.</l>
						</quote>
						<bibl n="Thgn. 255">Theog. 255f.</bibl><!-- tlg0002.tlg001 -->
					</cit> But for our part let us not allow that he is right; for
					Happiness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or 'Well-being';
						the Greek word is entirely noncommittal and does not necessarily
						denote a state of feeling, consciousness of welfare.</note> is
					at once the pleasantest and the fairest and best of all things
					whatever.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About every thing and every natural species
					there are many views that involve difficulty and require examination;
					of these some relate only to our knowledge of the thing, others deal
					also with modes of acquiring it and of acting in relation to it.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.3"/> As to all those
					views therefore that involve only speculative philosophy, we must say
					whatever may be proper to the inquiry when the suitable occasion
					occurs. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.4"/> But we must
					consider first what the good life consists in and how it is to be
					obtained—whether all of those who receive the designation
					'happy' acquire happiness by nature, as is the case with tallness and
					shortness of stature and differences of complexion, or by study, which
					would imply that there is a science of happiness, or by some form of
					training,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for there
					are many human attributes that are not bestowed by nature nor acquired
					by study but gained by habituation—bad attributes by those
					trained in bad habits and good attributes by those trained in good
					ones. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.5"/> Or does happiness
					come in none of these ways, but either by a sort of elevation of mind
					inspired by some divine power, as in the case of persons possessed by
					a nymph or a god, or, alternatively, by fortune? for many people
					identify happiness with good fortune.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it is pretty
					clear that the presence of happiness is bestowed upon men by all of
					these things, or by some or one of them; for almost all the modes in
					which it is produced fall under these principles, inasmuch as all the
					acts that spring from thought may be included with those that spring
					from knowledge. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.7"/> But to be
					happy and to five blissfully and finely may consist chiefly in three
					things deemed to be most desirable: some people say that Wisdom<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek term here still retains
						the general sense that it has in
						Plato. In the <title>Nicomachean
							Ethics</title> it is limited to Practical Wisdom, prudentia,
						'prudence,' as distinct from <foreign lang="greek">QEWRI/A</foreign>, sapientia, 'speculative wisdom.'</note> is
					the greatest good, others Goodness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It must always be remembered that the Greek term is less
						limited in meaning than 'virtue,' and may denote excellence in
						any department, not only moral goodness.</note> and others
					Pleasure. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.8"/> And certain
					persons debate about their importance in relation to happiness,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1214b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>declaring that one contributes more to it
					than another—some holding that Wisdom is a greater good than
					Goodness, others the reverse, and others that Pleasure is a greater
					good than either of them; and some think that the happy life comes
					from them all, others from two of them, others that it consists in
					some one of them.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having then in regard to this
					subject established that everybody able to live according to his own
					purposive choice should set before him some object for noble living to
					aim at<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot.       Nic. Eth. 1094a.20">Aristot.
						Nic. Eth. 1094a 22, 1095a
						22-26.</bibl></note>—either honor or else glory or wealth or
					culture—on which he will keep his eyes fixed in all his
					conduct (since clearly it is a mark of much folly not to have one's
					life regulated with regard to some End), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.2"/> it is therefore most necessary first to decide
					within oneself, neither hastily nor carelessly, in which of the things
					that belong to us the good life consists, and what are the
					indispensable conditions for men's possessing it. For there is a
					distinction between health and the things that are indispensable
					conditions of health, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.3"/> and
					this is similarly the case with many other things; consequently also
					to live finely is not the same as the things without which living
					finely is impossible. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.4"/> And
					in the latter class of things some that are indispensable conditions
					of health and life are not peculiar to special people but common to
					practically all men—both some states and some
					actions—for instance, without breathing or being awake or
					participating in movement we could not possess any good or any evil at
					all; whereas others are more peculiar to special types of natural
					constitution—<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for instance, eating meat and taking walking exercise after dinner
					are not closely related to health in the same way as the conditions
					mentioned. And these facts must not be overlooked,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the Mss. this clause comes before the
						preceding one, 'for instance, eating meat . . .
						mentioned.'</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.5"/>
					for these are the causes of the disputes about the real nature of
					happiness and about the means of procuring it; for some people regard
					the things that are indispensable conditions of being happy as actual
					parts of happiness.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now to examine all the opinions
					that any people hold about happiness is a superfluous task<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1095a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1095a
						28-30, b 19ff.</bibl></note> For children and the sick and
					insane have many opinions which no sensible man would discuss, for
					these persons need not argument but the former time in which to grow
					up and alter and the latter medical or official chastisement
					(treatment with drugs being chastisement just as much as flogging is).
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.2"/> And similarly it is
					also superfluous to examine the opinions of the multitude<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth.        1095b">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
						1095b 19</bibl>.</note> either; <milestone unit="section" n="1215a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for they
					talk at random about almost everything, and especially about
					happiness. We ought to examine only the opinions of the wise<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words translated 'happiness'
						and 'the opinions of the wise' are conjectural insertions in the
						Greek.</note>; for it is out of place to apply reasoning to
					those who do not need reasoning at all, but experience. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.3"/> But since every subject has
					special difficulties related to it, it is clear that there are such in
					regard to the highest life and the best mode of existence; it is then
					well to examine the opinions putting these difficulties, since the
					refutations advanced by those who challenge them are demonstrations of
					the theories that are opposed to them.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moreover to
					notice such matters is especially advantageous with a view to the
					subjects to which all inquiry ought to be directed—the
					question what are the means that make it possible to participate in
					living well and finely (if 'blissfully' is too invidious an
					expression)—and with a view to the hope that we may have of
					the things that are good in the various departments. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.5"/> For if living finely depends
					on things that come by fortune or by nature, it would be beyond the
					hopes of many men, for then its attainment is not to be secured by
					effort, and does not rest with men themselves and is not a matter of
					their own conduct; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.6"/> but if
					it consists in oneself and one's own actions having a particular
					quality, the good would be more common and more divine—more
					common because it would be possible for more people to share it, and
					more divine because happiness would then be in store for those who
					made themselves and their actions of a particular quality.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.1"/> Most of the points debated and the difficulties
					raised will be clear if it be satisfactorily determined what the
					proper conception of happiness is—does it consist merely in
					a person's possessing some particular quality of spirit,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word <foreign lang="greek">YUXH/</foreign>, usually rendered 'soul,' has no term
						exactly corresponding to it in English, as it denotes the whole
						vitality of a living creature, with the unconscious factors of
						nutrition and growth as well as conscious feelings or emotions
						and thoughts.</note> as some of the sages and the older thinkers
					held, or although a particular personal character is indeed an
					indispensable condition, is a particular quality of conduct even more
					necessary?<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are various different modes of life,
					and some do not lay any claim to well-being of the kind under
					consideration, but are pursued merely for the sake of things
					necessary—for instance the lives devoted to the vulgar and
					mechanic arts and those dealing with business (by vulgar arts I mean
					those pursued only for reputation, by mechanic the sedentary and
					wage-earning pursuits, and by arts of business those concerned with
					market purchase and retail selling); but on the other hand, the things
					related to the happy conduct of life being three, the things already
					mentioned<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1214a.30">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1214a 30-b 5</bibl>.</note> as the
					greatest possible goods for men—goodness, wisdom and
					pleasure, we see that there are also three ways of life in which those
					to whom fortune gives opportunity<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be emended to give 'those who happen
						to be in power.'</note> invariably choose to live, the life of
					politics,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. active
						citizenship: 'statesmanship' is too lofty a term.</note> the
					life of philosophy, and the life of enjoyment. <milestone unit="section" n="1215b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.3"/>Of these the
					philosophic life denotes being concerned with the contemplation of
					truth, the political life means being occupied with honorable
					activities (and these are the activities that spring from goodness),
					and the life of enjoyment is concerned with the pleasures of the body.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.4"/> Owing to this,
					different people give the name of happy to different persons, as was
					said before too; and Anaxagoras<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						physical philosopher, <dateRange from="-500" to="-428">500</dateRange>-428 B.C., born at Clazomenae in <placeName key="tgn,1002503">Ionia</placeName>, taught at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> of Clazomenae
					when asked 'Who is the happiest man?' said 'None of those whom you
					think, but he would seem to you an odd sort of person.' But Anaxagoras
					answered in that way because he saw that the man who put the question
					supposed it to be impossible to receive the appellation 'happy'
					without being great and beautiful or rich, whereas he himself perhaps
					thought that the person who humanly speaking enjoys bliss is he that
					lives by the standard of justice without pain and in purity, or
					participates in some form of divine contemplation.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the man who displays the virtues of
						Temperance, Justice and Wisdom (the fourth cardinal virtue,
						Courage, is omitted), enhanced by pleasure or freedom from pain.
						This passage illustrates how Aristotle prepared the way for the
						hedonism of Epicurus.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While there are many
					different things as to which it is not easy to make a right judgement,
					this is especially the case with one about which everybody thinks that
					it is very easy to judge and that anybody can decide—the
					question which of the things contained in being alive is preferable,
					and which when attained would fully satisfy a man's desire. For many
					of life's events are such that they cause men to throw life
					away,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for instance,
					diseases, excessive pains, storms; so that it is clear that on account
					of these things any way it would actually be preferable, if someone
					offered us the choice, not to be born at all.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Soph. OC 1225">Soph. O.C. 1225</bibl><foreign lang="greek">MH\ FU=NAI TO\N A(/PANTA NIKA=|
						LO/GON</foreign>.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.2"/> And in addition, the kind of life that people live
					while still children is not desirable—in fact no sensible
					person could endure to go back to it again. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.3"/> And further, many of the
					experiences that contain no pleasure nor pain, and also of those that
					do contain pleasure but pleasure of an ignoble kind, are such that
					non-existence would be better than being alive. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.4"/> And generally, if one
					collected together the whole of the things that the whole of mankind
					do and experience yet do and experience unwillingly, because not for
					the sake of the things themselves, and if one added an infinite extent
					of time, these things would not cause a man to choose to be alive
					rather than not alive. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.5"/>
					But moreover, also the pleasure of food or of sex alone, with the
					other pleasures abstracted that knowledge or sight or any other of the
					senses provides for human beings, would not induce anybody to value
					life higher if he were not utterly slavish, for it is clear that to
					one making this choice there would be no difference between being born
					a beast or a man; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.6"/> at all
					events, the ox in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1216a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>which they reverence as Apis, has a greater
					abundance of such indulgences than many monarchs. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.7"/> Nor likewise would anyone
					desire life for the pleasure of sleep either; for what is the
					difference between slumbering without being awakened from the first
					day till the last of a thousand or any number of years, and living a
					vegetable existence? any way plants seem to participate in life of
					that kind; and so do children too, inasmuch as at their first
					procreation in the mother, although alive, they stay asleep all the
					time. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.8"/> So that it is clear
					from considerations of this sort that the precise nature of well-being
					and of the good in life escapes our investigation.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it is said that when somebody persisted in putting various
					difficulties of this sort to Anaxagoras<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1215b.6">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1215b 6</bibl>
						n.</note> and went on asking for what object one should choose
					to come into existence rather than not, he replied by saying, 'For the
					sake of contemplating the heavens and the whole order of the
					universe.' Anaxagoras therefore thought that the alternative of being
					alive was valuable for the sake of some kind of knowledge; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.10"/> but those who ascribe bliss
					to Sardanapallus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A mythical king of
						Assyria, proverbial for luxury, cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic.        Eth. 1295b.22">Aristot. Nic.
							Eth. 1295b 22</bibl>.</note> or Smindyrides of <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris">Sybaris</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Greek colony in S. Italy. For Smindyrides, who
								travelled with 1000 slaves in attendance, see <bibl n="Hdt.           6.127">Hdt.
									6.127</bibl>, <bibl n="Ath. 5.273">Athenaeus 5 p.
										273</bibl>.</note> or some of the others living the life of enjoyment,
					all appear for their part to place happiness in delight;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.11"/> while a different set would not choose either
					wisdom of any kind or the bodily pleasures in preference to the
					actions that spring from goodness: at all events, some people choose
					those actions not only for the sake of reputation but even when they
					are not going to get any credit. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.12"/> But the majority of those engaged in politics are not
					correctly designated 'politicians,' for they are not truly political,
					since the political man is one who purposely chooses noble actions for
					their own sake, whereas the majority embrace that mode of life for the
					sake of money and gain.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What has been said, therefore,
					demonstrates that all men ascribe happiness to three modes of
					life—the political, the philosophic, and the life of
					enjoyment.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek word is
						specially associated with sensual pleasures.</note> Among these,
					the nature and quality of the pleasure connected with the body and
					with enjoyment, and the means that procure it, are not hard to see; so
					that it is not necessary for us to inquire what these pleasures are,
					but whether they conduce at all to happiness or not, and how they so
					conduce, and, if it be the case that the noble life ought to have some
					pleasures attached to it, whether these are the pleasures that ought
					to be attached, or whether these must be enjoyed in some other way,
					whereas the pleasures which people reasonably believe to make the
					happy man's life pleasant and not merely painless are different
					ones.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But these matters must be examined
					later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The promised
						discussion does not occur, but see <bibl n="Aristot. Nic.        Eth. 1153b">Aristot. Nic.
							Eth. 1153b 7-25</bibl>.</note> Let us first consider
					Goodness and Wisdom<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1214a.33">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1214a 33</bibl>n.; but practical
						wisdom is specially implied here.</note>—what the
					nature of each is, and also whether they themselves or the actions
					that spring from them are parts of the good life, <milestone unit="section" n="1216b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>since that they are connected with happiness is asserted,
					if not by everybody, at all events by all of mankind who are worthy of
					consideration.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly Socrates the
					senior<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A younger Socrates was
						a pupil of Plato.</note> thought that the End is to get to know
					virtue, and he pursued an inquiry into the nature of justice and
					courage and each of the divisions of virtue. And this was a reasonable
					procedure, since he thought that all the virtues are forms of
					knowledge, so that knowing justice and being just must go together,
					for as soon as we have learnt geometry and architecture, we are
					architects and geometricians; owing to which he used to inquire what
					virtue is, but not how and from what sources it is produced.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.16"/> But although this
					does happen in the case of the theoretical sciences, inasmuch as
					astronomy and natural science<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						Greek term primarily denotes biology, rather than physics in the
						modern sense (with which contrast the modern limitation of the
						term 'physiology,' and of 'physic' in the sense of medicine);
						accordingly it does not here include astronomy.</note> and
					geometry have no other End except to get to know and to contemplate
					the nature of the things that are the subjects of the sciences
					(although it is true that they may quite possibly be useful to us
					accidentally for many of our necessary requirements), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.17"/> yet the End of the productive
					sciences is something different from science and knowledge, for
					example the End of medicine is health and that of political science
					ordered government, or something of that sort, different from mere
					knowledge of the science. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.18"/> Although, therefore, it is fine even to attain a knowledge of the
					various fine things,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>all the
					same nevertheless in the case of goodness it is not the knowledge of
					its essential nature that is most valuable but the ascertainment of
					the sources that produce it. For our aim is not to know what courage
					is but to be courageous, not to know what justice is but to be just,
					in the same way as we want to be healthy rather than to ascertain what
					health is, and to be in good condition of body rather than to
					ascertain what good bodily condition is.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And about all
					these matters the endeavor must be made to seek to convince by means
					of rational arguments, using observed facts as evidences and examples.
					For the best thing would be if all mankind were seen to be in
					agreement with the views that will be stated, but failing that, at any
					rate that all should agree in some way. And this they will do if led
					to change their ground,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps
						'led on step by step.'</note> for everyone has something
					relative to contribute to the truth, and we must start from this to
					give a sort of proof about our views; for from statements that are
					true but not clearly expressed, as we advance, clearness will also be
					attained, if at every stage we adopt more scientific positions in
					exchange for the customary confused statements. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.2"/> And in every investigation
					arguments stated in philosophical form are different from those that
					are non-philosophical; hence we must not think that theoretical study
					of such a sort as to make manifest not only the nature of a thing but
					also its cause is superfluous even for the political student, since
					that is the philosophic procedure in every field of inquiry.
					Nevertheless this requires much caution. <milestone unit="section" n="1217a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.3"/>For because to say nothing at
					random but use reasoned argument seems to mark a philosopher, some
					people often without being detected advance arguments that are not
					germane to the subject under treatment and that have nothing in them
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.4"/> (and they do this

					And this befalls them owing to lack of education—for in
					respect of each subject inability to distinguish arguments germane to
					the subject from those foreign to it is lack of education. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.6"/> And it is also well to judge
					separately the statement of the cause and the demonstrated fact, both
					for the reason stated just now,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1

					attend to theoretical arguments, but often rather to the facts of
					observation (whereas now when men are unable to refute an argument
					they are forced to believe what has been said), and also because
					often, although the result that seems to have been proved by the
					arguments is true, it is not true because of the cause asserted in the
					argument. For it is possible to prove truth by falsehood, as is clear

					</note> are not clearly expressed,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>afterwards seeking to discover clearly the essential
					nature of happiness. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.2"/> Now
					it is agreed that happiness is the greatest and best of human goods
					(and we say 'human' because there might very likely also be a
					happiness belonging to some higher being, for instance a god);
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.3"/> since none of the
					other animals, which are inferior in nature to men, share in the
					designation 'happy,' for a horse is not happy, nor is a bird nor a
					fish nor any other existing thing whose designation does not indicate
					that it possesses in its nature a share of something divine, but it is
					by some other mode of participating in things good that one of them
					has a better life and another a worse.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the fact that
					this is so must be considered later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not kept.</note> At the present
					let us say that among things good some are within the range of action
					for a human being and others are not. And we make this distinction for
					the reason that some existing things do not participate in change at
					all, and therefore some good things do not, and these are perhaps in
					their nature the best things; and some things, though practicable, are
					only practicable for beings superior to us. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.5"/> And inasmuch as 'practicable'
					has two meanings (for both the Ends for which we act and the actions
					that we do as means to those Ends have to do with action—for
					example we class among things practicable both health and wealth and
					the pursuits that are followed for the sake of health and wealth,
					healthy exercise and lucrative business), it is clear that happiness
					must be set down as the best of the things practicable for a human
					being. <milestone unit="section" n="1217b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must consider, therefore,
					what the best is, and in how many senses the term is used. The answer
					seems to be principally contained in three views. For it is said that
					the best of all things is the Absolute Good, and that the Absolute
					Good is that which has the attributes of being the first of goods and
					of being by its presence the cause to the other goods of their being
					good; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.2"/> and both of these
					attributes, it is said, belong to the Form<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">*)IDE/A</foreign> is here
						used in its Platonic sense, as a synonym for <foreign lang="greek">EI)=DOS</foreign>, class-form, to denote the
						permanent immaterial reality that underlies any group of things

						<foreign lang="greek">I)DE/A</foreign> is perceptible only
						by the mind, but the word does not denote the content of a
						mental perception, as does the derivative 'idea' in ordinary
						English.</note> of good (I mean both being the first of goods
					and being by its presence the cause to the other goods of their being
					good), since it is of that Form that goodness is most truly predicated
					(inasmuch as the other goods are good by participation in and
					resemblance to the Form of good) and also it is the first of goods,
					for the destruction of that which is participated in involves the
					destruction of the things participating in the Form (which get their
					designation by participating in it), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.3"/> and that is the relation existing between what
					is primary and what is subsequent; so that the Form of good is the
					Absolute Good, inasmuch as the Form of good is separable from the
					things that participate in it, as are the other Forms also.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now a thorough examination of this opinion belongs to another course
					of study, and one that for the most part necessarily lies more in the
					field of Logic, for that is the only science dealing with arguments
					that are at the same time destructive and general. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.5"/> But if we are to speak about
					it concisely,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>we say that in
					the first place to assert the existence of a Form not only of good but
					of anything else is an expression of logic and a mere abstraction (but
					this has been considered in various ways both in extraneous
					discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The use of this
						phrase by Aristotle elsewhere seems to show that it denotes
						doctrines, recorded in books or familiar in debate, that were
						not peculiar to the Peripatetic school.</note> and in those on
					philosophical lines); <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.6"/>
					next, even granting that Forms and the Form of good exist in the
					fullest sense, surely this is of no practical value for the good life
					or for conduct.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For 'good' has many senses, in fact as many
					as 'being.' For the term 'is,' as it has been analyzed in other works,
					signifies now substance, now quality, now quantity, now time, and in
					addition to these meanings it consists now in undergoing change and
					now in causing it; and the good is found in each of these cases<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. categories. The last two
						specified are elsewhere designated <foreign lang="greek">KINEI=N</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">KINEI=SQAI</foreign>, Action and Passion.</note>—in
					essence, as mind and God, in quality justice, in quantity moderation,
					in time opportunity, and as instances of change, the teacher and the
					taught. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.8"/> Therefore, just
					as being is not some one thing in respect of the categories mentioned,
					so neither is the good, and there is no one science either of the real
					or of the good. But also even the goods predicated in the same
					category, for example opportunity or moderation, do not fall within
					the province of a single science to study, but different sorts of
					opportunity and of moderation are studied by different sciences, for
					instance opportunity and moderation in respect of food are studied by
					medicine and gymnastics, in respect of military operations by
					strategics, and similarly in respect of another pursuit by another
					science; so that it can hardly be the case that the Absolute Good is
					the subject of only one science. <milestone unit="section" n="1218a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, wherever there is a sequence of factors, a prior and a
					subsequent, there is not some common element beside these factors and
					that element separable; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.10"/>
					for then there would be something prior to the first in the series,
					for the common and separable term would be prior because when the
					common element was destroyed the first factor would be destroyed. For
					example, if double is the first of the multiples, the multiplicity
					predicated of them in common cannot exist as a separable thing, for
					then it will be prior to double, if it is the case that the common
					element is the Form, as it would be if one were to make the common
					element separable: for if justice is a good, and courage, there is
					then, they say, a Good-in-itself, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.11"/> so the term 'in itself' is added to the common
					definition. But what could this denote except that the good is eternal
					and separable? Yet a thing that is white for days is no more white
					than a thing that is white for one day, so that the good is no more
					good by being eternal<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words
						rendered 'the good is . . . eternal' are a conjectural
						insertion.</note>; nor yet therefore is the common good the same
					as the Form, for it is the common property of all the goods.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Also the proper method of proving the Absolute Good is the contrary
					of the method now adopted. At present it is from things not admitted
					to possess goodness that they prove the things admitted to be good,
					for instance, they prove from numbers that justice and health are
					good, because they are arrangements and numbers—<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>on the assumption that goodness
					is a property of numbers and monads because the Absolute Good is
					unity. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.13"/> But the proper
					method is to start from things admitted to be good, for instance
					health, strength, sobriety of mind, and prove that beauty is present
					even more in the unchanging; for all these admitted goods consist in
					order and rest, and therefore, if that is so, the things unchanging
					are good in an even greater degree, for they possess order and rest in
					a greater degree.—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.14"/> And it is a hazardous way of proving that the
					Absolute Good is unity to say that numbers aim at unity; for it is not
					clearly stated how they aim at it, but the expression is used in too
					unqualified a manner; and how can one suppose that things not
					possessing life can have appetition? <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.15"/> One ought to study this matter carefully, and
					not make an unreasoned assumption about something as to which it is
					not easy to attain certainty even with the aid of
					reason.—And the statement that all existing things desire
					some one good is not true; each thing seeks its own particular good,
					the eye sight, the body health, and similarly another thing another
					good.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such then are the difficulties indicating
					that the Absolute Good does not exist,—and that it is of no
					use for political science, but that this has a special good of its
					own, as have the other sciences also—for instance the good
					of gymnastics is good bodily condition.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence reads like a mere

					there is also what has been written in the discourse: either the

					practicable.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And similarly the good as
					universal also is not an Absolute Good <milestone unit="section" n="1218b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>(for
					universality might be an attribute of even a small good), and also it
					is not practicable; for medical science does not study how to procure
					an attribute that belongs to anything, but how to procure health, and
					similarly also each of the other practical sciences. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.19"/> But 'good' has many meanings,
					and there is a part of it that is beautiful, and one form of it is
					practicable but another is not. The sort of good that is practicable
					is that which is an object aimed at, but the good in things
					unchangeable is not practicable. It is manifest, therefore, that the
					Absolute Good we are looking for is not the Form of good, nor yet the
					good as universal, for the Form is unchangeable and impracticable, and
					the universal good though changeable is not practicable. But the
					object aimed at as End is the chief good, and is the cause of the
					subordinate goods and first of all; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.20"/> so that the Absolute Good would be this—the
					End of the goods practicable for man. And this is the good that comes
					under the supreme of all the practical sciences, which is Politics and
					Economics and Wisdom; for these states of character differ from the
					others in the fact that they are supreme (whether they differ at all
					from one another must be discussed later on<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1141b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1141b 21-1142a

					health is so-and-so, what contributes to health must necessarily be
					so-and-so;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the
					wholesome is the efficient cause of health, though only the cause of

					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.22"/> Furthermore nobody

						23</bibl>.</note> For Wisdom and Goodness and Pleasure are
					in the spirit, and either some or all of these are thought by
					everybody to be an End. And the contents of the spirit are in two
					groups, one states or faculties, the other activities and
					processes.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let these assumptions, then, be made, and
					let it be assumed as to Goodness that it is the best disposition or
					state or faculty of each class of things that have some use or work.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1219a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>This is clear from induction, for we posit
					this in all cases: for instance, there is a goodness that belongs to a
					coat, for a coat has a particular function and use, and the best state
					of a coat is its goodness; and similarly with a ship and a house and
					the rest. So that the same is true also of the spirit, for it has a
					work of its own. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.3"/> And
					therefore let us assume that the better the state is the better is the
					work of that state, and that as states stand in relation to one
					another so do the works that result from them. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.4"/> And the work of each thing is
					its End; from this, therefore, it is plain that the work is a greater
					good than the state, for the End is the best as being an End, since
					the greatest good is assumed as an End and as the ultimate object for
					the sake of which all the other things exist. It is clear, therefore,
					that the work is a greater good than the state and disposition.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.5"/> But the term 'work'
					has two meanings; for some things have a work that is something
					different from the employment of them, for instance the work of
					architecture is a house, not the act of building, that of medicine
					health, not the process of healing or curing, whereas with other
					things their work is the process of using them, for instance the work
					of sight is the act of seeing, that of mathematical science the
					contemplation of mathematical truths. So it follows that with the
					things whose work is the employment of them, the act of employing them
					must be of more value than the state of possessing them.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And these points having been decided in this way,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>we say that the same work
					belongs to a thing and to its goodness (although not in the same way):
					for example, a shoe is the work of the art of shoemaking and of the
					act of shoemaking; so if there is such a thing as shoemaking goodness
					and a good shoemaker, their work is a good shoe; and in the same way
					in the case of the other arts also.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, let us grant that
					the work of the spirit is to cause life, and that being alive is
					employment and being awake (for sleep is a kind of inactivity and
					rest); with the consequence that since the work of the spirit and that
					of its goodness are necessarily one and the same, the work of goodness
					would be good life. Therefore this is the perfect good, which as we
					saw is happiness. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.8"/> And it
					is clear from the assumptions laid down (for we said that happiness is
					the greatest good and that the Ends or the greatest of goods are in
					the spirit, but things in the spirit are either a state or an
					activity) that, since an activity is a better thing than a disposition
					and the best activity than the best state, and since goodness is the
					best state, the activity of goodness is the spirit's greatest good.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.9"/> But also we saw
					that the greatest good is happiness. Therefore happiness is the
					activity of a good spirit. And since we saw<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1218b.7">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1218b
						7-12</bibl>.</note> that happiness is something perfect, and
					life is either perfect or imperfect, and the same with goodness (for
					some goodness is a whole and some a part), but the activity of
					imperfect things is imperfect, it would follow that happiness is an
					activity of perfect life in accordance with perfect
					goodness.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And that our classification and definition
					of it are correct is evidenced by opinions that we all hold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1219b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>For we think that to do well and live well
					are the same as to be happy; but each of these, both life and action,
					is employment and activity, inasmuch as active life involves employing
					things—the coppersmith makes a bridle, but the horseman uses
					it. There is also the evidence of the opinion that a person is not
					happy for one day only,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A single
						happy day does not make one a happy (i.e. fortunate) man.</note>
					and that a child is not happy, nor any period of life<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is a mistake to say that youth
						(or maturity, or old age) is the happy time of
						life.</note>(hence also Solon's advice holds good, not to call a man
					happy while he is alive, but only when he has reached the end), for
					nothing incomplete is happy, since it is not a whole. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.11"/> And again, there are the
					praises given to goodness on account of its deeds, and panegyrics
					describing deeds (and it is the victorious who are given wreaths, not
					those who are capable of winning but do not win); and there is the
					fact that we judge a man's character from his actions. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.12"/> Also why is happiness not
					praised? It is because it is on account of it that the other things
					are praised, either by being placed in relation to it or as being
					parts of it. Hence felicitation, praise and panegyric are different
					things: panegyric is a recital of a particular exploit, praise a
					statement of a man's general distinction, felicitation is bestowed on
					an end achieved. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.13"/> From
					these considerations light is also thrown on the question sometimes
					raised—what is the precise reason why the virtuous are for
					half their lives no better than the base, since all men are alike when
					asleep?<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>The reason is
					that sleep is inaction of the spirit, not an activity. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.14"/> Hence the goodness of any
					other part of the spirit, for instance the nutritive, is not a portion
					of goodness as a whole, just as also goodness of the body is not; for
					the nutritive part functions more actively in sleep, where as the
					sensory and appetitive parts are ineffective in sleep. But even the
					imaginations of the virtuous, so far as the imaginative faculty
					participates in any mode of motion, are better than those of the base,
					provided they are not perverted by disease or mutilation.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next we must study the spirit; for goodness is a property of the
					spirit, it is not accidental. And since it is human goodness that we
					are investigating, let us begin by positing that the spirit has two
					parts that partake of reason, but that they do not both partake of
					reason in the same manner, but one of them by having by nature the
					capacity to give orders, and the other to obey and listen (let us
					leave out any part that is irrational in another way<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the part 'connected with
						nutrition and growth,' man's animal life, which is irrational
						absolutely, and not merely in the sense of not possessing reason
						but being capable of obedience to it.</note>). <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.16"/> And it makes no difference
					whether the spirit is divisible or is undivided yet possessed of
					different capacities, namely those mentioned, just as the concave and
					convex sides in a curve are inseparable, and the straightness and
					whiteness in a straight white line, although a straight thing is not
					white except accidentally and not by its own essence. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.17"/> And we have also abstracted
					any other part of the spirit that there may be, for instance the
					factor of growth; for the parts that we have mentioned are the special
					properties of the human spirit, and hence the excellences of the part
					dealing with nutrition and growth are not the special property of a
					man, for necessarily, if considered as a man, he must possess a
					reasoning faculty for a principle and with a view to conduct,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1220a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and the reasoning faculty is a principle
					controlling not reasoning but appetite and passions; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.18"/> therefore he must necessarily
					possess those parts. And just as a good constitution consists of the
					separate excellences of the parts of the body, so also the goodness of
					the spirit, as being an End, is composed of the separate
					virtues.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And goodness has two forms, moral virtue and
					intellectual excellence; for we praise not only the just but also the
					intelligent and the wise. For we assumed<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1218a.37">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1218a
						37ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1219b.8">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1219b 8ff.,
							15ff.</bibl></note> that what is praiseworthy is either goodness
					or its work, and these are not activities but possess activities.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.20"/> And since the
					intellectual excellences involve reason, these forms of goodness
					belong to the rational part, which as having reason is in command of
					the spirit; whereas the moral virtues belong to the part that is
					irrational but by nature capable of following the
					rational—for in stating a man's moral qualities we do not
					say that he is wise or clever but that he is gentle or rash.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this we must first consider Moral Goodness—its
					essence and the nature of its divisions (for that is the subject now
					arrived at), and the means by which it is produced. Our method of
					inquiry then must be that employed by all people in other matters when
					they have something in hand to start with—we must endeavor
					by means of statements that are true but not clearly expressed to
					arrive at a result that is both true and clear. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.22"/> For our present state is as
					if we knew that health is the best disposition of the body and that
					Coriscus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1240b.25">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1240b 25</bibl> n.</note> is the
					darkest man in the market-place;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for that is not to know what health is and who Coriscus
					is, but nevertheless to be in that state is a help towards knowing
					each of these things.—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.23"/> Then let it first be taken as granted that the best
					disposition is produced by the best means, and that the best actions
					in each department of conduct result from the excellences belonging to
					each department—for example, it is the best exercises and
					food that produce a good condition of body, and a good condition of
					body enables men to do the best work; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.24"/> further, that every disposition is both
					produced and destroyed by the same things applied in a certain manner,
					for example health by food and exercises and climate; these points are
					clear from induction. Therefore goodness too is the sort of
					disposition that is created by the best movements in the spirit and is
					also the source of the production of the spirit's best actions and
					emotions; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.25"/> and it is in
					one way produced and in another way destroyed by the same things, and
					its employment of the things that cause both its increase and its
					destruction is directed towards the things towards which it creates
					the best disposition. And this is indicated by the fact that both
					goodness and badness have to do with things pleasant and painful; for
					punishments, which are medicines, and which as is the case with other
					cures<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g. fever, which is
						caused by heat, is cured by cold (the contrary doctrine to
						homoeopathy, similia similibus curantur).</note> operate by
					means of opposites, operate by means of pleasures and pains.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is clear, therefore, that Moral Goodness has to do with pleasures
					and pains. And since moral character is, <milestone unit="section" n="1220b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as even its
					name implies that it has its growth from habit,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">H)=QOS</foreign> derived
						from <foreign lang="greek">E)/QOS</foreign> by lengthening of
						<foreign lang="greek">E</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">H</foreign>: cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1104b">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
							2.3.4</bibl> This clause and the one following interrupt the

					a certain way a habit not innate in us is finally trained to be
					operative in that way (which we do not observe in inanimate objects,
					for not even if you throw a stone upwards ten thousand times will it
					ever rise upward unless under the operation of force)—let
					moral character then be defined as a quality of the spirit in
					accordance with governing reason that is capable of following the
					reason. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.2"/> We have then to
					say what is the part of the spirit in respect of which our moral
					characters are of a certain quality. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.3"/> And it will be in respect of our faculties for
					emotions according to which people are termed liable to some emotion,
					and also of the states of character according to which people receive
					certain designations in respect of the emotions, because of their
					experiencing or being exempt from some form of emotion.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this comes the classification, made in previous
					discussions,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps a
						reference to <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1105b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1105b 20</bibl>,
						inserted in the belief that the <title>Eudemian Ethics</title>
						is the later work.</note> of the modes of emotion, the faculties
					and the states of character. By emotions I mean such things as anger,
					fear, shame, desire, and generally those experiences that are in
					themselves usually accompanied by sensory pleasure or pain. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.5"/> And to these there is no
					quality corresponding [but they are passive].<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This interpolation was made by an editor who
						derived <foreign lang="greek">POIO/THS</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">POIEI=N</foreign>.</note> But quality
					corresponds to the faculties: by faculties I mean the properties
					acting by which persons are designated by the names of the various
					emotions, for instance choleric, insensitive, erotic, bashful,
					shameless. States of character are the states that cause the emotions
					to be present either rationally or the opposite:<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for example courage, sobriety of mind,
					cowardice, profligacy.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These distinctions having been
					established, it must be grasped that in every continuum that is
					divisible there is excess and deficiency and a mean, and these either
					in relation to one another or in relation to us, for instance in
					gymnastics or medicine or architecture or navigation, and in any
					practical pursuit of whatever sort, both scientific and unscientific,
					both technical and untechnical; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.2"/> for motion is a continuum, and conduct is a motion.
					And in all things the mean in relation to us is the best, for that is
					as knowledge and reason bid. And everywhere this also produces the
					best state. This is proved by induction and reason: contraries are
					mutually destructive, and extremes are contrary both to each other and
					to the mean, as the mean is either extreme in relation to the
					other—for example the equal is greater than the less and
					less than the greater. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.3"/>
					Hence moral goodness must be concerned with certain means and must be
					a middle state. We must, therefore, ascertain what sort of middle
					state is goodness and with what sort of means it is concerned.

					difficult-tempered in respect of jealousy.—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.13"/> It is superfluous to state in
					the definition that the specified relation to each thing must not be

					addition to the definition either in discourse or in practice, but
					this addition is aimed against the logical quibbling of the sciences.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.14"/> Let us then accept
					these simple definitions, and let us make them more precise when we
					are speaking about the opposite dispositions.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In Book 3.</note> But these modes of emotion
					themselves are divided into species designated according to their
					difference in respect of time or intensity or in regard to one of the
					objects that cause the emotions. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.15"/> I mean for instance that a man is called
					quick-tempered from feeling the emotion of anger sooner than he ought,
					harsh and passionate from feeling it more than he ought, bitter from
					having a tendency to cherish his anger, violent and abusive owing to
					the acts of retaliation to which his anger gives rise. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.16"/> Men are called gourmands or
					gluttons and drunkards from having an irrational liability to
					indulgence in one or the other sort of nutriment.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it must not be ignored that some of the vices mentioned cannot
					be classed under the heading of manner, if manner is taken to be
					feeling the emotion to excess.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For example, a man is not an adulterer because he
					exceeds in intercourse with married women, for 'excess' does not apply
					here, but adultery merely in itself is a vice, since the term denoting
					the passion implicitly denotes that the man is vicious<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">TOIO/NDE</foreign>= <foreign lang="greek">MOXQHRO/N</foreign></note>; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.18"/> and similarly with outrage. Hence men dispute the
					charge, and admit intercourse but deny adultery on the ground of
					having acted in ignorance or under compulsion, or admit striking a
					blow but deny committing an outrage; and similarly in meeting the
					other charges of the same kind.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These points having been
					taken, we must next say that since the spirit has two parts, and the
					virtues are divided between them, one set being those of the rational
					part, intellectual virtues, whose work is truth, whether about the
					nature of a thing or about its mode of production, while the other set
					belongs to the part that is irrational but possesses appetition
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.2"/> (for if the spirit
					is divided into parts, not any and every part possesses appetition),
					it therefore follows that the moral character is vicious or virtuous
					by reason of pursuing or avoiding certain pleasures and pains. This is
					clear from the classification<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						1220b 7-20.</note> of the emotions, faculties and states of
					character. For the faculties and the states are concerned with the
					modes of emotion, and the emotions are distinguished by pain and
					pleasure; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.3"/> so that it
					follows from these considerations as well as from the positions
					already laid down that all moral goodness is concerned with pleasures
					and pains. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.4"/> For our state
					of character is related to and concerned with such things as have the
					property of making every person's spirit worse and better. <milestone unit="section" n="1222a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>But we say that men are wicked owing to pleasures and
					pains, through pursuing and avoiding the wrong ones or in the wrong
					way. Hence all men readily define the virtues as insensitiveness or
					tranquillity in regard to pleasures and pains, and the vices by the
					opposite qualities.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since it has been
					assumed<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1218b 37
						ff.</note> that goodness is a state of character of a sort that causes
					men to be capable of doing the best actions and gives them the best
					disposition in regard to the greatest good, and the best and greatest
					good is that which is in accordance with right principle, and this is
					the mean between excess and deficiency relative to ourselves, it would
					necessarily follow that moral goodness corresponds with each
					particular middle state and is concerned with certain mean points in
					pleasures and pains and pleasant and painful things. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.2"/> And this middle state will
					sometimes be in pleasures (for even in these there is excess and
					deficiency), sometimes in pains, sometimes in both. For he that
					exceeds in feeling delight exceeds in the pleasant, and he that
					exceeds in feeling pain exceeds in the opposite—and this
					whether his feelings are excessive absolutely or excessive in relation
					to some standard, for instance are felt more than ordinary men feel
					them; whereas the good man feels in the proper
					way.—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.3"/> And
					since there is a certain state of character which results in its
					possessor's being in one instance such as to accept an excess and in
					another such as to accept a deficiency of the same thing,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>it follows that as these actions
					are contrary to each other and to the mean, so also the states of
					character that cause them are contrary to each other and to
					virtue.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It comes about, however, that sometimes all
					the oppositions are more evident, sometimes those on the side of
					excess, in some cases those on the side of deficiency. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.5"/> The cause of this contrariety
					is that the resemblance does not always reach the same point of
					inequality in regard to the middle, but sometimes it may pass over
					more quickly from the excess, sometimes from the deficiency, to the
					middle state, the person farther removed from which seems to be more
					contrary: for instance, with regard to the body excess is more healthy
					and nearer the middle than deficiency in the case of exercises but
					deficiency than excess in the case of food. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.6"/> Consequently the states of
					will favorable to athletic training will be variously favorable to
					health according to the two different fields of choice—in
					the one case<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In respect of amount
						of exercise.</note> the over-energetic men &lt;will be
					nearer the mean than the slack ones&gt;, in the other<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In respect of amount of
						food.</note> the too hardy &lt;will be nearer the mean than the
					self-indulgent ones&gt;; and also the character contrary to the
					moderate and rational will be in the one case the slack and not both
					the slack and the over-energetic, and in the other case the
					self-indulgent and not the man who goes hungry. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.7"/> And this comes about because
					from the start our nature does not diverge from the mean in the same
					way as regards everything, but in energy we are deficient and in
					self-indulgence excessive, and this is also the same with regard the
					spirit. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.8"/> And we class as
					contrary to the mean the disposition to which we, and most men, are
					more liable to err; whereas the other passes unnoticed as if
					non-existent, because its rarity makes it not observed. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.9"/> For instance we count anger
					the contrary of gentleness and the passionate man the contrary of the
					gentle; <milestone unit="section" n="1222b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>yet there is also excess in the direction of
					being gentle and placable and not being angry when struck, but men of
					that sort are few, and everyone is more prone to the other extreme; on
					which account moreover a passionate temper is not a characteristic of
					a toady.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable alteration of
						the Greek gives 'is not ready to make up a
						quarrel.'</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since we have dealt with
					the scheme of states of character in respect of the various emotions
					in which there are excesses and deficiencies, and of the opposite
					states in accordance with which men are disposed in accordance with
					right principle (though the question what is the right principle and
					what rule is to guide us in defining the mean must be considered
					later<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1249a 21
						ff.</note>), it is evident that all the forms of moral goodness and
					badness have to do with excesses and deficiencies of pleasures and
					pains, and that pleasures and pains result from the states of
					character and modes of emotion mentioned. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.11"/> But then the best state in relation to each
					class of thing is the middle state. It is clear, therefore, that the
					virtues will be either all or some of these middle states.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let us, therefore, take another starting-point for the ensuing
					inquiry.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer proceeds
						to distinguish the strict sense <foreign lang="greek">A)RXH/</foreign>, 'origin or cause of change' (which applies to
						man as capable of volition and action) from its secondary sense,
						'cause or explanation of an unchanging state of things' (which
						applies to the 'first principles' of mathematics).</note> Now
					all essences are by nature first principles of a certain kind, owing
					to which each is able to generate many things of the same sort as
					itself, for example a man engenders men, and in general an animal
					animals, and a plant plants. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.2"/> And in addition to this, obviously man alone among
					animals initiates certain conduct—<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for we should not ascribe conduct to any of
					the others. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.3"/> And the first
					principles of that sort, which are the first source of motions, are
					called first principles in the strict sense, and most rightly those
					that have necessary results; doubtless God is a ruling principle that
					acts in this way. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.4"/> But the
					strict sense of 'first principle' is not found in first principles
					incapable of movement, for example those of mathematics, although the
					term is indeed used of them by analogy, for in mathematics if the
					first principle were changed virtually all the things proved from it
					would change, though they do not change owing to themselves, one being
					destroyed by the other, except by destroying the assumption and
					thereby establishing a proof.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g.
						if <foreign lang="greek">A)RXH/</foreign> A led to B and C, of
						which C was absurd, then C by refuting A would refute the other
						consequence B (Solomon).</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.5"/> But man is a first principle of a certain
					motion, for action is motion. And since as in other matters the first
					principle is a cause of the things that exist or come into existence
					because of it, we must think as we do in the case of demonstrations.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.6"/> For example, if as
					the angles of a triangle are together equal to two right angles the
					angles of a quadrilateral are necessarily equal to four right angles,
					that the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is clearly
					the cause of that fact; and supposing a triangle were to change, a
					quadrilateral would necessarily change too—for example if
					the angles of a triangle became equal to three right angles, the
					angles of a quadrilateral would become equal to six right angles, or
					if four, eight; also if a triangle does not change but is as
					described, a quadrilateral too must of necessity be as
					described.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The necessity of what we are arguing is
					clear from <title>Analytics</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.1">Aristot. Anal. Post.
						1.1</bibl></note>; at present we cannot either deny or affirm anything
					definitely except just this. Supposing there were no further cause of
					the triangle's having the property stated, then the triangle would be
					a sort of first principle or cause of the later stages. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.8"/> Hence if in fact there are
					among existing things some that admit of the opposite state, their
					first principles also must necessarily have the same quality;
					<milestone unit="section" n="1223a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for of things that are of necessity the
					result is necessary, albeit the subsequent stages may possibly happen
					in the opposite way. And the things that depend on men themselves in
					many cases belong to this class of variables, and men are themselves
					the first principle of things of this sort. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.9"/> Hence it is clear that all the
					actions of which a man is the first principle and controller may
					either happen or not happen, and that it depends on himself for them
					to happen or not, as he controls their existence or non-existence. But
					of things which it depends on him to do or not to do he is himself the
					cause, and what he is the cause of depends on himself. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.10"/> And since goodness and
					badness and the actions that spring from them are in some cases
					praiseworthy and in other cases blameworthy (for praise and blame are
					not given to things that we possess from necessity or fortune or
					nature but to things of which we ourselves are the cause, since for
					things of which another person is the cause, that person has the blame
					and the praise), it is clear that both goodness and badness have to do
					with things where a man is himself the cause and origin of his
					actions. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.11"/> We must, then,
					ascertain what is the kind of actions of which a man is himself the
					cause and origin. Now we all agree that each man is the cause of all
					those acts that are voluntary and purposive for him individually, and
					that he is not himself the cause of those that are involuntary. And
					clearly he commits voluntarily all the acts that he commits purposely.
					It is clear, then,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that both
					goodness and badness will be in the class of things
					voluntary.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must, therefore, ascertain what voluntary
					and involuntary mean, and what is purposive choice, since they enter
					into the definition of goodness and badness. And first we must
					consider the meaning of voluntary and involuntary. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.2"/> Now they would seem to refer
					to one of three things—conformity with appetition, or with
					purposive choice, or with thought: voluntary is what conforms with one
					of these and involuntary is what contravenes one of them. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.3"/> But moreover there are three
					subdivisions of appetition—wish, passion and desire; so that
					we have to distinguish these. And first we must consider conformity
					with desire.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It would seem that everything that conforms
					with desire is voluntary. For everything involuntary seems to be
					forced, and what is forced and everything that people do or suffer
					under necessity is painful, as indeed Evenus says:
					<quote type="verse">

					it is forced and if a thing is forced it is painful; but everything
					contrary to desire is painful (for desire is for what is pleasant), so
					that it is forced and involuntary. Therefore what conforms with desire
					is voluntary, for things contrary to and things in conformity with
					desire are opposite to one another. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.6"/> Again, all wickedness makes a man more unrighteous,
					and lack of self-control seems to be wickedness; and the uncontrolled
					man is the sort of man to act in conformity with desire contrary to
					calculation, and he shows his lack of control when his conduct is
					guided by desire; <milestone unit="section" n="1223b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>so that the uncontrolled man will
					act unrighteously by acting in conformity with desire. But unrighteous
					action is voluntary.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the Mss.
						this sentence precedes the one before.</note> Therefore he will
					be acting voluntarily, and action guided by desire is voluntary.
					Indeed it would be strange if those who become uncontrolled will be
					more righteous.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence would
						come in better above, after 'acting in conformity with
						desire.'</note>—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.7"/> From these considerations, then, it would appear that
					what is in conformity with desire is voluntary; and from this the
					opposite<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. that what is
						against desire is involuntary.</note> follows, for all that a
					man does voluntarily he wishes to do, and what he wishes to do he does
					voluntarily, but nobody wishes what he thinks to be bad. But yet the
					uncontrolled man does not do what he wishes, for being uncontrolled
					means acting against what one thinks to be best owing to desire; hence
					it will come about that the same person is acting voluntarily and
					involuntarily at the same time. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.8"/> But this is impossible. And further, the
					self-controlled man will act righteously, or more righteously than
					lack of control will; for self-control is goodness, and goodness makes
					men more righteous. And a man exercises self-control when he acts
					against his desire in conformity with rational calculation. So that if
					righteous action is voluntary, as also unrighteous action (for both of
					these seem to be voluntary, and if one of them is voluntary it follows
					of necessity that the other is also), whereas what is contrary to
					desire is involuntary, it therefore follows that the same person will
					do the same action voluntarily and involuntarily at the same
					time.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same argument applies also in the case
					of passion;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for there appear
					to be control and lack of control of passion as well as of desire and
					what is contrary to passion is painful and restraint is a matter of
					force, so that if what is forced is involuntary, what is in accordance
					with passion will always be voluntary. Even Heracleitus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The natural philosopher of
						<placeName key="perseus,Ephesos">Ephesus</placeName>, fl. c.

					in view the strength of passion when he remarks that the checking of
					passion is painful; for 'It is difficult (he says) to do battle with
					passion, for it buys its wish at the price of life.' <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.10"/> And if it is impossible to do
					the same act voluntarily and involuntarily at the same time and in
					respect of the same part of the act, action guided by one's wish is
					more voluntary than action guided by desire or passion. And a proof of
					this is that we do many things voluntarily without anger or
					desire.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It remains, therefore, to consider whether
					acting as we wish and acting voluntarily are the same. This also seems
					impossible. For it is a fundamental assumption with us, and a general
					opinion, that wickedness makes men more unrighteous; and lack of
					self-control seems to be a sort of wickedness. But from the hypothesis
					that acting as we wish and acting voluntarily are the same the
					opposite will result; for nobody wishes things that he thinks to be
					bad, yet he does them when he has become uncontrolled, so if to do
					injustice is voluntary and the voluntary is what is in accordance with
					one's wish, then when a man has become uncontrolled he will no longer
					be acting unjustly but will be more just than he was before he lost
					control of himself. But this is impossible. Therefore it is clear that
					acting voluntarily does not mean acting in accordance with appetition
					nor acting involuntarily acting in opposition to appetition.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Also it is clear from the following considerations that voluntary
					action does not mean acting in accordance with purposive choice. It
					was proved<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, altering the text,
						'It was proved not that acting in accordance with one's wishes
						is the same thing as acting voluntarily, but rather that all one
						wishes is also voluntary although it is possible to act

						proved; but many things that we wish—'</note> that
					acting in accordance with one's wish is not acting involuntarily,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1224a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but rather everything that one wishes is also
					voluntary—it has only been proved that it is possible to do
					a thing voluntarily without wishing; but many things that we wish we
					do suddenly, whereas nobody makes a purposive choice
					suddenly.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But if as we said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1223a.23">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1223a
						23ff.</bibl></note> the voluntary must necessarily be one of
					three things—what is in conformity with appetition, or with
					purposive choice, or with thought—, and if it is not the two
					former, it remains that voluntariness consists in acting with some
					kind of thought. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.3"/>
					Moreover, let us put a conclusion to our delimitation of the voluntary
					and involuntary by carrying the thought argument a little further.
					Acting under compulsion and not under compulsion seem to be terms akin
					to the ones mentioned; for we say that everything forced is
					involuntary and everything involuntary is forced. So we must first
					consider the exact meaning of 'forced,' and how what is forced is
					related to the voluntary and involuntary. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.4"/> It seems, then, that in the sphere of conduct
					'forced' or 'necessary,' and force or necessity, are the opposite of
					'voluntary,' and of persuasion. And we employ the terms force and
					necessity in a general sense even in the case of inanimate objects: we
					say that a stone travels upwards and fire downwards by force and under
					necessity, whereas when they travel according to their natural and
					intrinsic impulse we say that they do not move under
					force—although nevertheless they are not spoken of as moving
					voluntarily:<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the state
					opposite to forced motion has no name, but when they travel contrary
					to their natural impulse we say that they move by force. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.5"/> Similarly also in the case of
					living things and of animals, we see many being acted on by force, and
					also acting under force when something moves them from outside,
					contrary to the impulse within the thing itself. In inanimate things
					the moving principle is simple, but in living things it is multiple,
					for appetition and rational principle are not always in harmony.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.6"/> Hence whereas in
					the case of the other animals the factor of force is simple, as it is
					in the case of inanimate objects, for animals do not possess rational
					principle and appetition in opposition to it, but live by their
					appetition, in man both forms of force are present—that is,
					at a certain age, the age to which we attribute action<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or 'conduct.'</note> in the proper
					sense; for we do not speak of a child as acting, any more than a wild
					animal, but only a person who has attained to acting by rational
					calculation. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.7"/> So what is
					forced always seems to be painful, and no one acting under force acts
					gladly. Consequently there is a great deal of dispute about the
					self-controlled man and the uncontrolled. For each of them acts under
					a conflict of impulses within him, so that the self-controlled man,
					they say, acts under force in dragging himself away from the pleasures
					that he covets (for he feels pain in dragging himself away against the
					resistance of appetition), while the uncontrolled man acts under force
					in going contrary to his rational faculty. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.8"/> But he seems to feel less pain, because desire
					is for what is pleasant, and he follows his desire; so that the
					uncontrolled man rather acts voluntarily and not under force, because
					not painfully. On the other hand persuasion is thought to be the
					opposite of force and necessity; and the self-controlled man is led
					towards things that he has been persuaded to pursue, and proceeds not
					under force but voluntarily; <milestone unit="section" n="1224b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>whereas desire leads
					a man on without employing persuasion, since it possesses no element
					of rational principle. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.9"/> It
					has, then, been stated that these men only seem to act under force and
					involuntarily; and we have shown the reason—it is because
					their action has a certain resemblance to forced action, just as we
					speak of forced action even in the case of inanimate objects too.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.10"/> Yet nevertheless
					if one added there also the addition made in our definition, the
					statement is refuted. For we speak of a thing as being forced to act
					when something external moves it or brings it to rest, acting against
					the impulse within the thing itself—when there is no
					external motive, we do not say that it acts under force; and in the
					uncontrolled man and the self-controlled it is the impulse present in
					the man himself that drives him (for he has both impulses), so that as
					far as these considerations go neither of them would be acting under
					force, but voluntarily; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.11"/>
					nor yet are they acting of necessity, for by necessity we mean an
					external principle that either checks or moves a man in opposition to
					his impulse—as if A were to take hold of B's hand and with
					it strike C, B's will and desire both resisting; whereas when the
					source of action is from within, we do not speak of the act as done
					under force. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.12"/> Again, both
					pleasure and pain are present in both cases; for a man exercising
					self-control both feels pain when he finally acts in opposition to his
					desire and enjoys the pleasure of hoping that he will be benefited
					later on, or is even being benefited already, by being in good
					health;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and the
					uncontrolled man enjoys getting what he desires owing to his lack of
					self-control, but feels prospective pain because he thinks he is doing
					a bad thing. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.13"/> Hence it is
					reasonable to say that each does what he does under compulsion, and
					that each is at one point acting involuntarily, from motives both of
					appetition and of rational calculation—for calculation and
					appetition are things quite separate, and each is pushed aside by the
					other. Hence men transfer this to the spirit as a whole, because they
					see something of this sort in the experiences of the spirit.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.14"/> Now it is
					admissible to say this in the case of the parts, but the spirit as a
					whole both in the uncontrolled and in the self-controlled man acts
					voluntarily, and in neither case does the man act under compulsion,
					but one of the parts in them so acts—for we possess by
					nature both parts; since rational principle is a natural property,
					because it will be present in us if our growth is allowed and not
					stunted, and also desire is natural, because it accompanies and is
					present in us from birth; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.15"/> and these are pretty nearly the two things by which we define the
					natural—it is what accompanies everybody as soon as he is
					born, or else what comes to us if development is allowed to go on
					regularly, for example grey hair, old age, etc. Therefore each of the
					two persons in a way acts not in accordance with nature, but
					absolutely each does act according to nature, though not according to
					the same nature. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.16"/> The
					difficulties, then, raised about the uncontrolled and the
					self-controlled man are these: do both, or does one of them, act under
					compulsion, so that they either act not voluntarily or else
					voluntarily and under compulsion at the same time—and if
					what is done under compulsion is involuntary, act voluntarily and
					involuntarily at the same time? And it is fairly clear from what has
					been said how these difficulties are to be met. <milestone unit="section" n="1225a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But there is another way in which people are
					said to act under compulsion and of necessity without disagreement
					between rational principle and appetition, when they do something that
					they consider actually painful and bad but they are faced by flogging
					or imprisonment or execution if they do not do it; for in these cases
					they say that they are acting under necessity. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.18"/> Possibly, however, this is
					not the case, but they all do the actual deeds willingly, since it is
					open to them not to do them but to endure the penalty threatened.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.19"/> Moreover, perhaps
					someone might say that in some cases these actions are done of
					necessity and in others not. For in cases where the presence or
					absence of such circumstances depends on the agent himself,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or 'for in those of such acts
						which it rests with himself to do or not.'</note> even the
					actions that he does without wishing to do them he does willingly and
					not under compulsion; but where in such cases the circumstances do not
					rest with himself, he acts under compulsion in a sense, though not
					indeed under compulsion absolutely, because he does not definitely
					choose the actual thing that he does but the object for which he does
					it; since even in the objects of action there is a certain difference.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.20"/> For if someone
					were to kill a man to prevent his catching him by groping for
					him,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in
						blind-man's-bluff, <foreign lang="greek">MUI/+NDA</foreign> or
						<foreign lang="greek">XALKH= MUI=A</foreign>.</note> it
					would be ridiculous for him to say that he had done it under
					compulsion and of necessity—there must be some greater and
					more painful evil that he will suffer if he does not do it. It is when
					a man does something evil for the sake of something good, or for
					deliverance from another evil, that he will be acting under necessity
					and by compulsion, or at all events not by nature; and then he will
					really be acting unwillingly, for these actions do not rest with
					himself.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.21"/> On this account many reckon
					even love as involuntary, and some forms of anger, and natural
					impulses, because their power is even beyond nature; and we pardon
					them as naturally capable of constraining nature. And it would be
					thought that a man is acting more under compulsion and involuntarily
					when his object is to avoid violent pain than when it is to avoid mild
					pain, and in general more when his object is the avoidance of pain
					than when it is to gain enjoyment. For what rests with
					himself—and it wholly turns on this—means what his
					nature is able to bear; what his nature is not able to bear and what
					is not a matter of his own natural appetition or calculation does not
					rest with himself. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.22"/> On
					this account also in the case of persons who are inspired and utter
					prophecies, although they perform an act of thought, nevertheless we
					do not say that saying what they said and doing what they did rested
					with themselves. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.23"/> Nor yet
					do we say that what men do because of desire rests with themselves; so
					that some thoughts and emotions, or the actions that are guided by
					such thoughts and calculations, do not rest with ourselves, but it is
					as Philolaus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Pythagorean
						philosopher contemporary with Socrates.</note>
					said—'some arguments are too strong for us.' Hence if it was
					necessary to consider the voluntary and involuntary with reference
					also to acting under compulsion, let this be our decision of the
					matter (for those who cause most hindrance . . . the voluntary . .
					.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some words seem to have
						been lost here (<foreign lang="greek">A)LLA/</foreign> suggests
						that they contained a negative).</note> as acting under
					compulsion, but voluntarily).<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that this is
					concluded, and as the voluntary has been found not to be defined by
					appetition, nor yet by purposive choice, it therefore remains to
					define it as that which is in accordance with thought. <milestone unit="section" n="1225b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.2"/> Now the
					voluntary seems to be the opposite of the involuntary; and acting with
					knowledge of either the person acted on or the instrument or the
					result (for sometimes the agent knows that it is his father but does
					not intend to kill him but to save him—as the Peliads<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The daughters of Pelias, King of
						Iolchus, cut him up and boiled him, having been told by Medea
						(who wanted Jason to leave his throne) that this would restore
						his youth.</note> did—or knows that what he is
					offering is a drink but offers it as a love-charm or wine, when really
					it is hemlock) seems to be the opposite of acting without knowing the
					person acted on, the instrument and the nature of the act, through
					ignorance and not by accident. But to act through ignorance of the
					act, the means and the person acted on is involuntary action.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.3"/> Therefore the
					opposite is voluntary. It follows then that all the things that a man
					does not in ignorance, and through his own agency, when it is in his
					power not to do them, are voluntary acts, and it is in this that the
					voluntary consists; and all the things that he does in ignorance, and
					through being in ignorance, he does involuntarily. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.4"/> But since to understand or
					know has two meanings, one being to have the knowledge and the other
					to use it, a man who has knowledge but is not using it would in one
					case be justly described as acting in ignorance but in another case
					unjustly— namely, if his non-employment of the knowledge
					were due to carelessness. And similarly one would be blamed for not
					having the knowledge, if it were something that was easy or necessary
					and his not having it is due to carelessness or pleasure or pain.
					These points therefore must be added to our definition. Let this,
					then, be our mode of definition<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give 'Let this be our
						decision.'</note> about the voluntary and involuntary.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next let us speak about purposive choice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term denotes not the deliberate choice of an
							object but the selection of means to attain an object: see
							7.</note> first raising various difficulties about it.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For one might doubt to which
					class it naturally belongs and in what class it ought to be put, and
					whether the voluntary and the purposely chosen are different things or
					the same thing. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.2"/> And a
					view specially put forward from some quarters, which on inquiry may
					seem correct, is that purposive choice is one of two things, either
					opinion or appetition; for both are seen to accompany it. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.3"/> Now it is evident that it is
					not appetition; for in that case it would be either wish or desire or
					passion, since nobody wants to get a thing without having experienced
					one of those feelings. Now even animals possess passion and desire,
					but they do not have purposive choice. And again, beings that possess
					both of these often make choices even without passion and desire; and
					while they are experiencing these feelings do not make a choice but
					hold out. Again, desire and passion are always accompanied by pain,
					but we often make a choice even without pain. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.4"/> But moreover purposive choice
					is not the same as wish either; for men wish for some things that they
					know to be impossible, for instance to be king of all mankind and to
					be immortal, but nobody purposively chooses a thing knowing it to be
					impossible, nor in general a thing that, though possible, he does not
					think in his own power to do or not to do. So that this much is
					clear—a thing purposively chosen must necessarily be
					something that rests with oneself. <milestone unit="section" n="1226a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.5"/> And similarly it is manifest
					that purposive choice is not opinion either, nor something that one
					simply thinks; for we saw<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="P">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1223a 16-19</bibl>.</note> that a
					thing chosen is something in one's own power, but we have opinions as
					to many things that do not depend on us, for instance that the
					diagonal of a square is incommensurable<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Mss. give 'commensurable,' but there is no
						point in specifying an untrue opinion. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot.        Nic. Eth. 1112a.20">Aristot.
							Nic. Eth. 1112a 22</bibl><foreign lang="greek">PERI\ DH\

								A)SU/MMETROI</foreign> (where Kb has <foreign lang="greek">SU/MMETROI</foreign>).</note> with the side; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.6"/> and again, choice is not true
					or false. Nor yet is purposive choice an opinion about practicable
					things within one's own power that makes us think that we ought to do
					or not to do something; but this characteristic is common to opinion
					and to wish. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.7"/> For no one
					purposively chooses any End, but the means to his End—I mean
					for instance no one chooses to be healthy, but to take a walk or sit
					down for the sake of being healthy, no one chooses to be well off, but
					to go into business or to speculate for the sake of being well off;
					and generally, one who makes a choice always makes it clear both what
					his choice is and what its object is, 'object' meaning that for the
					sake of which he chooses something else and 'choice' meaning that
					which he chooses for the sake of something else. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.8"/> Whereas clearly it is
					specially an End that a man wishes, and the feeling that he ought to
					be healthy and prosperous is an opinion. So these considerations make
					it clear that purposive choice is different from both opinion and
					wish. Forming wishes and forming opinions apply specially to one's
					End; purposive choice is not of Ends.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is clear,
					then, that purposive choice is not either wish or opinion or judgement
					simply; but in what does it differ from them? and how is it related to
					the voluntary?<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>To answer
					these questions will make it clear what purposive choice is.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.10"/> Now of things
					that can both be and not be, some are such that it is possible to
					deliberate about them, but about others it is not possible. Some
					things can either be or not be but their coming into being does not
					rest with us, but in some cases is due to the operation of nature and
					in others to other causes; and about these things nobody would
					deliberate unless in ignorance of the facts. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.11"/> But with some things not
					only their existence or non-existence is possible, but also for human
					beings to deliberate about them; and these are all the things that it
					rests with us to do or not to do. Hence we do not deliberate about
					affairs in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, or about
					how to square the circle; for affairs in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> do not rest with us, whereas the objects of
					choice and things practicable are among things resting with us, and
					squaring the circle is entirely impracticable (and thus it is clear
					that purposive choice is not simply opinion either). <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.12"/> But purposive choice does
					not deal with all the practicable things resting with us either.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.13"/> Hence one might
					also raise the question, why is it exactly that, whereas doctors
					deliberate about things in their field of science, scholars do not?
					The reason is that since error occurs in two ways (for we err either
					in reasoning, or in perception when actually doing the thing), in
					medicine it is possible to err in both ways, but in grammar error only
					occurs in our perception and action, <milestone unit="section" n="1226b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>to
					investigate which would be an endless undertaking.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since then purposive choice is not either opinion nor wish
					separately, nor yet both (for no one makes a deliberate choice
					suddenly, but men do suddenly think they ought to act and wish to
					act), therefore it arises as from both, for both of them are present
					with a person choosing. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.15"/>
					But how purposive choice arises out of opinion and wish must be
					considered. And indeed in a manner the actual term 'choice' makes this
					clear. 'Choice' is 'taking,' but not taking simply—it is
					taking one thing in preference to another; but this cannot be done
					without consideration and deliberation; hence purposive choice arises
					out of deliberative opinion.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now nobody deliberates
					about his End—this everybody has fixed; but men deliberate
					about the means leading to their End—does this contribute to
					it, or does this ? or when a means has been decided on, how will that
					be procured? and this deliberation as to means we all pursue until we
					have carried the starting-point in the process of producing the End
					back to ourselves. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.17"/> If,
					then, nobody chooses without first preparing, and deliberating as to
					the comparative merits of the alternatives, and a man deliberates as
					to those among the means to the End capable of existing or not
					existing that are within our power, it is clear that purposive choice
					is deliberative appetition of things within one's power. For we
					deliberate about everything that we choose, although of course we do
					not choose everything that we deliberate about. I call appetition
					deliberative when its origin or cause is deliberation,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and when a man desires because
					of having deliberated. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.18"/>
					Therefore the faculty of purposive choice is not present in the other
					animals, nor in man at every age nor in every condition, for no more
					is the act of deliberation, nor yet the concept of cause: it is quite
					possible that many men may possess the faculty of forming an opinion
					whether to do or not to do a thing without also having the power of
					forming this opinion by process of reasoning. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.19"/> For the deliberative faculty
					is the spirit's power of contemplating a kind of cause—for
					one sort of cause is the final cause, as although cause means anything
					because of which a thing comes about, it is the object of a thing's
					existence or production that we specially designate as its cause: for
					instance, if a man walks in order to fetch things, fetching things is
					the cause of his walking. Consequently people who have no fixed aim
					are not given to deliberation. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.20"/> Hence inasmuch as if a man of his own accord and not
					through ignorance does or refrains from doing something resting with
					himself either to do or not to do, he acts or refrains from acting
					voluntarily, but yet we do many such things without deliberation or
					previous thought, it necessarily follows that, although all that has
					been purposively chosen is voluntary, 'voluntary' is not the same as
					'chosen,' and, although all things done by purposive choice are
					voluntary, not all things voluntary are done by purposive choice.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.21"/> And at the same
					time it is clear from these considerations that the classification of
					offences made by legislators as in voluntary, voluntary and
					premeditated is a good one; <milestone unit="section" n="1227a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for even if it is
					not precisely accurate, yet at all events it approximates to the truth
					in a way. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.22"/> But we will
					speak about this in our examination of justice.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not in Eud. Eth., but cf. <bibl n="Aristot.        Nic. Eth. 1135a">Aristot.
						Nic. Eth. 1135a 16ff.</bibl></note> As to purposive
					choice, it is clear that it is not absolutely identical with wish nor
					with opinion, but is opinion plus appetition when these follow as a
					conclusion from deliberation.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since
					one who deliberates always deliberates for the sake of some object,
					and a man deliberating always has some aim in view with reference to
					which he considers what is expedient, nobody deliberates about his
					End, but this is a starting-point or assumption, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.23"/> like the postulates in the
					theoretic sciences (we have spoken about this briefly at the beginning
					of this discourse, and in detail in <title>Analytics</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1214b.6">Aristot. Eud. Eth.
						1214b 6ff.</bibl>, and <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 72a.20">Aristot. Anal. Post.
							72a 20</bibl> and context.</note>); whereas with all men
					deliberation whether technical or untechnical is about the means that
					lead to their End, e.g. when they deliberate about whether to go to
					war or not to go to war with a given person. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.24"/> And the question of means
					will depend rather on a prior question, that is, the question of
					object, for instance wealth or pleasure or something else of that kind
					which happens to be our object. For one who deliberates deliberates if
					he has considered, from the standpoint of the End, either what tends
					to enable him to bring the End to himself or how he can himself go to
					the End.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. he works back in
						thought from his intended End to some means to its attainment
						that is already within his power.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.25"/> And by nature the End is
					always a good and a thing about which men deliberate step by
					step<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>(for example a
					doctor may deliberate whether he shall give a drug, and a general
					where he shall pitch his camp) when their End is the good that is the
					absolute best; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.26"/> but in
					contravention of nature and by perversion not the good but the
					apparent good is the End. The reason is that there are some things
					that cannot be employed for something other than their natural
					objects, for instance sight—it is not possible to see a
					thing that is not visible, or to hear a thing that is not audible; but
					a science does enable us to do a thing that is not the object of the
					science. For health and disease are not the objects of the same
					science in the same way: health is its object in accordance with
					nature, and disease in contravention of nature. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.27"/> And similarly, by nature
					good is the object of wish, but evil is also its object in
					contravention of nature; by nature one wishes good, against nature and
					by perversion one even wishes evil.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But
					moreover with everything its corruption and perversion are not in any
					chance direction, but leads to the contrary and intermediate states.
					For it is not possible to go outside these, since even error does not
					lead to any chance thing, but, in the case of things that have
					contraries, to the contraries, and to those contraries that are
					contrary according to their science.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This division of contraries is unusual: elsewhere
						(e.g. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 11.1061a.18">Aristot. Met. 1061a 18</bibl>) Aristotle
						merely states that contraries are the objects of the same
						science.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.28"/> It
					therefore necessarily follows that both error and purposive choice
					take place from the middle point to the contraries (the contraries of
					the middle being the more and the less).—And the cause is
					pleasure and pain; for things are so constituted that the pleasant
					appears to the spirit good and the more pleasant better, the painful
					bad and the more painful worse. <milestone unit="section" n="1227b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.29"/>So from these things also it
					is clear that goodness and badness have to do with pleasures and
					pains; for they occur in connection with the objects of purposive
					choice, and this has to do with good and bad and what appears to be
					good and bad, and pleasure and pain are by nature things of that
					kind.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It therefore follows that since moral
					goodness is itself a middle state and is entirely concerned with
					pleasures and pains, and badness consists in excess and defect and is
					concerned with the same things as goodness, moral goodness or virtue
					is a state of purposively choosing the mean in relation to ourselves
					in all those pleasant and painful things in regard to which according
					as a person feels pleasure or pain he is described as having some
					particular moral quality<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						connection of pleasure and pain with virtue is here clearer than
						in <title>Nic. Eth.</title>, and forms part of the definition
						(Stocks).</note>(for a person is not said to have a particular
					moral character merely for being fond of sweets or
					savories).<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These things having been
					settled, let us say whether goodness makes the purposive choice
					correct and the End right in the sense of making the agent choose for
					the sake of the proper End, or whether (as some hold) it makes the
					rational principle right. But what does this is
					self-control—for that saves the rational principle from
					being corrupted; and goodness and self-control are different.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.2"/> But we must speak
					about this later, since all who do hold that goodness makes the
					rational principle right think so on the ground that that is the
					nature of self-control and self-control is a praiseworthy thing.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.3"/> Having raised this
					preliminary question let us continue.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>It is possible to have one's aim right but
					to be entirely wrong in one's means to the end aimed at; and it is
					possible for the aim to have been wrongly chosen but the means
					conducing to it to be right; and for neither to be right. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.4"/> But does goodness decide the
					aim<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, altering the text,
						'makes the aim right.'</note> or the means to it? Well, our
					position is that it decides the aim, because this is not a matter of
					logical inference or rational principle, but in fact this must be
					assumed as a starting-point. For a doctor does not consider whether
					his patient ought to be healthy or not, but whether he ought to take
					walking exercise or not, and the gymnastic trainer does not consider
					whether his pupil ought to be in good condition or not, but whether he
					ought to go in for wrestling or not; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.5"/> and similarly no other science either
					deliberates about its End. For as in the theoretic sciences the
					assumptions are first principles, so in the productive sciences the
					End is a starting-point and assumption: since it is required that
					so-and-so is to be in good health, if that is to be secured it is
					necessary for such-and-such a thing to be provided—just as
					in mathematics, if the angles of a triangle are together equal to two
					right angles, such and such a consequence necessarily follows.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.6"/> Therefore the End
					is the starting-point of the process of thought, but the conclusion of
					the process of thought is the starting-point of action. If, then, of
					all rightness either rational principle or goodness is the cause, if
					rational principle is not the cause of the rightness of the End, then
					the End (though not the means to the End) will be right owing to
					goodness. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.7"/> But the End is
					the object for which one acts; for every purposive choice is a choice
					of something and for some object. The End is therefore the object for
					which the thing chosen is the mean, of which End goodness is the
					cause<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Virtue by choosing the
						right means to achieve the End causes the End to be
						realized.</note> by its act of choice—though the choice is
					not of the End but of the means adopted for the sake of the End.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.8"/> Therefore though
					it belongs to another faculty to hit on the things that must be done
					for the sake of the End, <milestone unit="section" n="1228a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>goodness is the
					cause of the End aimed at by choice being right. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.9"/> And owing to this it is by a
					man's purposive choice that we judge his character—that is,
					not by what he does but what he does it for. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.10"/> Similarly also badness
					causes purposive choice to be made from the opposite motives. If
					therefore, when a man has it in his power to do what is honorable and
					refrain from doing what is base, he does the opposite, it is clear
					that this man is not virtuous. Hence it necessarily follows that both
					badness and goodness are voluntary; for there is no necessity to do
					wicked things. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.11"/> For this
					reason badness is a blameworthy thing and goodness praiseworthy; for
					involuntary baseness and evil are not blamed nor involuntary good
					things praised, but voluntary ones are. Moreover we praise and blame
					all men with regard to their purpose rather than with regard to their
					actions (although activity is a more desirable thing than goodness),
					because men may do bad acts under compulsion, but no one is compelled
					to choose to do them. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.12"/>
					Moreover because it is not easy to see the quality of a man's purpose
					we are forced to judge his character from his actions; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.13"/> therefore activity is more
					desirable, but purpose more praiseworthy. And this not only follows
					from our assumptions but also is admitted by reason of observed
					facts.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, emending the text,
						'agrees with observation.'</note></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1228a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="23"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It has then been stated in
					general terms that there are middle states in the virtues and that
					these are purposive, and also that the opposite dispositions are vices
					and what these are. But let us take them separately and discuss them
					seriatim. And first let us speak about Courage.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now almost everybody holds that the brave man is concerned with
					fears, and that courage is one of the virtues. And in our
					schedule<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1220b.39">Aristot.
						Eud. Eth. 1220b 39</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1221a.17">Aristot. Eud. Eth.
							1221a 17-19</bibl>.</note> previously we distinguished
					daring and fear as contraries, for they are indeed in a manner opposed
					to one another. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.3"/> It is
					clear, therefore, that the persons named after these states of
					character will also be similarly opposed to each other—that
					is, the coward (for that is the term that denotes being more afraid
					than is proper and less daring than is proper) and the daring man (for
					that denotes the characteristic of being less afraid than is proper
					and more daring than is proper—and from this the name is
					derived, as the word 'daring' is cognate with the word 'dare').
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.4"/> So that since
					courage is the best state of character in relation to feelings of fear
					and daring, and the proper character is neither that of the daring
					(for they fall short in one respect and exceed in another) nor that of
					the cowardly (for they also do the same, only not as regards the same
					things but inversely— <milestone unit="section" n="1228b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>they fall short in
					daring and exceed in being afraid), it is clear that the middle state
					of character between daring and cowardice is courage, for this is the
					best state.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And it seems that the brave man is in
					general fearless, and the coward liable to fear; and that the latter
					fears things when they are few in number and small in size as well as
					when numerous and great, and fears violently, and gets frightened
					quickly, whereas the former on the contrary either never feels fear at
					all or only slightly and reluctantly and seldom, and in regard to
					things of magnitude; and he endures things that are extremely
					formidable, whereas the other does not endure even those that are
					slightly formidable. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.6"/> What
					sort of things, then, does the brave man endure? First, is it the
					things that are formidable to himself or formidable to somebody else?
					If the things formidable to somebody else, one would not indeed call
					it anything remarkable; but if it is those that are formidable to
					himself, what is formidable to him must be things of great magnitude
					and number. But formidable things are productive of fear<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, emending the text, 'of
						corresponding fear.'</note> in the particular person to whom
					they are formidable—that is, if they are very formidable,
					the fear they produce will be violent, if slightly formidable, it will
					be weak; so it follows that the brave man's fears are great and many.
					Yet on the contrary it appeared that courage makes a man fearless, and
					that fearlessness consists in fearing nothing, or else few things, and
					those slightly and reluctantly. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.7"/> But perhaps 'formidable' is an ambiguous term, like
					'pleasant' and 'good.' Some things are pleasant and good
					absolutely,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>whereas
					others are so to a particular person but absolutely are not so, but on
					the contrary are bad and unpleasant—all the things that are
					beneficial for the base, and all those that are pleasant to children
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> children. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.8"/> And similarly some things are formidable
					absolutely and others to a particular person: thus the things that the
					coward <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> coward fears are some of them not
					formidable to anybody and others only slightly formidable, but things
					that are formidable to most men, and all that are formidable to human
					nature, we pronounce to be formidable absolutely. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.9"/> But the brave man is fearless
					in regard to them, and endures formidable things of this sort, which
					are formidable to him in one way but in another way are
					not—they are formidable to him <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					human being, but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> brave not formidable
					except slightly, or not at all. Yet such things really are formidable,
					for they are formidable to most men. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.10"/> Owing to this the brave man's state of
					character is praised, because it resembles that of the strong and the
					healthy. These have those characters not because no labor in the one
					case or extreme of temperature in the other can crush them, but
					because they are not affected at all, or only affected slightly, by
					the things that affect the many or the majority. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.11"/> Therefore whereas the sickly
					and weak and cowardly are affected also by the afflictions commonly
					felt, only more quickly and to a greater extent than the mass of men,
					the healthy, strong and brave, although affected by the very great
					afflictions, are affected by them more slowly and less than the mass
					of men,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words 'the healthy,
						strong and brave . . . mass of men' are a conjectural addition
						to the Ms. text.</note> and moreover they are entirely
					unaffected or only slightly affected by things that affect the
					mass.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the question is raised whether to the
					brave man nothing is formidable, and whether he would be insensible to
					fear. <milestone unit="section" n="1229a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Or is it not possible that he may feel fear
					in the way described? For courage is following reason, and reason bids
					us choose what is fine. Hence he who endures formidable things not on
					account of reason is either out of his mind or daring, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.13"/> but only he who does so from
					motives of honor is fearless and brave. The coward, therefore, fears
					even things that he ought not to fear, and the daring man is bold even
					about things about which he ought not to be bold, but the brave man
					alone does both as he ought, and is intermediate in this respect, for
					he feels both confidence and fear about what ever things reason bids;
					but reason does not bid him endure things that are extremely painful
					and destructive, unless they are fine. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.14"/> The daring man, therefore, faces such things
					with confidence even if reason does not bid him face them, and the
					coward does not face them even if it does, but only the brave man
					faces them if reason bids.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are five kinds of courage
					so called by analogy, because brave men of these kinds endure the same
					things as the really courageous but not for the same reasons. One is
					civic courage; this is courage due to a sense of shame. Second is
					military courage; this is due to experience and to knowledge, not of
					what is formidable, as Socrates said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Prot. 360d">Plat. Prot. 360d</bibl>.</note> but
					of ways of encountering what is formidable. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.16"/> Third is the courage due to
					inexperience and ignorance, that makes children and madmen face things
					rushing on them, or grasp snakes. Another is the courage caused by
					hope, which often makes those who have had a stroke of luck endure
					dangers,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and those who
					are intoxicated—for wine makes men sanguine. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.17"/> Another is due to some
					irrational emotion, for example love or passion. For if a man is in
					love he is more daring than cowardly, and endures many dangers, like
					the man<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Unknown.</note> who
					murdered the tyrant at Metapontium and the person in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> in the story<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Unknown</note>; and similarly if a
					man is under the influence of anger and passion, for passion is a
					thing that makes him beside himself. Hence wild boars are thought to
					be brave, though they are not really, for they are so when they are
					beside themselves, but otherwise they are variable, like daring men.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.18"/> But nevertheless
					the courage of passion is in the highest degree natural; passion is a
					thing that does not know defeat, owing to which the young are the best
					fighters. Civic courage is due to law. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.19"/> But none of these is truly courage, though
					they are all useful for encouragement in dangers.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Up to this point we have spoken about things formidable in general
					terms, but it will be better to define them more precisely. As a
					general term the formidable denotes what causes fear, and that is of a
					property of things that appear capable of causing pain of a
					destructive kind: for persons expecting some other pain might perhaps
					experience a different sort of pain and a different feeling, but will
					not have fear—for example if a man foresaw that he was going
					to feel the pain felt by the jealous, or the sort of pain felt by the
					envious or by those who are ashamed. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.21"/> But fear only occurs in the case of pains that
					seem likely to be of the kind whose nature it is to destroy life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1229b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Hence some people who are even very soft
					about certain things are brave, and some who are hard and enduring are
					also cowardly. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.22"/> Moreover
					it is thought to be almost a special property of courage to be of a
					certain disposition in regard to death and the pain of death; for if a
					man were such as to be capable of rational endurance in respect of
					heat and cold and pains of that sort that are not dangerous, but at
					the same time soft and excessively timid about death, not because of
					any other feeling but just because it brings destruction, while
					another man was soft in regard to those pains but impassive as regards
					death, the former would be thought a coward and the latter brave.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.23"/> For we speak of
					danger only in the case of such formidable things as bring near to us
					what causes destruction of that sort, and when this appears near it
					appears to be danger.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The formidable
					things, therefore, in relation to which we speak of a man as brave
					are, we have said, those that appear likely to cause pain of the
					destructive kind—provided that these appear close at hand
					and not far off, and are or appear to be of a magnitude proportionate
					to a human being; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.24"/> for
					some things must necessarily appear fearful to every human being and
					throw everybody into alarm, since it is quite possible that,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>just as heat and cold and some
					of the other forces are above us and above the conditions of the human
					body, so also are some mental sufferings.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore whereas the cowardly and the daring are mistaken owing to
					their characters, since the coward thinks things not formidable
					formidable and things slightly formidable extremely formidable, and
					the daring man on the contrary thinks formidable things perfectly safe
					and extremely formidable things only slightly formidable, to the brave
					man on the other hand things seem exactly what they are. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.25"/> Hence a man is not brave if
					he endures formidable things through ignorance (for instance, if owing
					to madness he were to endure a flight of thunderbolts), nor if he does
					so owing to passion when knowing the greatness of the danger, as the
					Celts 'take arms and march against the waves'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This appears to be loosely quoted from a verse
						passage: cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1115b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1115b 25</bibl>. An
						echo of the story survives in Shakespeare's metaphor, 'to take
						arms against a sea of troubles.'</note>; and in general, the
					courage of barbarians has an element of passion. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.26"/> And some men endure terrors
					for the sake of other pleasures also—for even passion
					contains pleasure of a sort, since it is combined with hope of
					revenge. But nevertheless neither if a man endures death for the sake
					of this pleasure nor for another, nor for the sake of avoiding greater
					pains, would any of these persons justly be termed brave. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.27"/> For if dying were pleasant,
					profligates would be dying constantly, owing to lack of self-control,
					just as even as it is, when, although death itself is not pleasant,
					things that cause it are, many men through lack of self control
					knowingly encounter it; none of whom would be thought brave, even
					though he were thought to die quite readily. Nor yet are any of those
					brave who, as many men do, commit suicide to escape from trouble, as
					Agathon<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Athenian tragic poet,
						friend of Plato.</note> says: <milestone unit="section" n="1230a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><cit>

							transferred his immortality to Prometheus.</note> in the
					legendary story of the poets, because of the pain from his wound
					prayed that though immortal he might die. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.28"/> And in like manner to these, all who face
					dangers because of experience are not brave; this is how perhaps most
					of the military class face dangers. For the fact is the exact opposite
					of the view of Socrates, who thought that bravery was knowledge:
					sailors who know how to go aloft are not daring through knowing what
					things are formidable, but because they know how to protect themselves
					against the dangers; also courage is not merely what makes men more
					daring fighters, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.29"/> for in
					that case strength and wealth would be courage—as Theognis
					puts it:<cit>

						<bibl n="Thgn. 177">Theog. 177</bibl>
					</cit><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Theognis
						177.</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But manifestly some
					men do face emergencies in spite of being cowards, owing to
					experience, and they do so because they do not think that there is any
					danger, as they know how to protect themselves. A proof of this is
					that when they think that they have no protection and that the cause
					of alarm is now close at hand, they turn tail. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.30"/> But among all such causes, it
					is when shame makes men face what is alarming that they would appear

					is neither this nor any of the others, though it resembles them, as
					does the courage of wild animals, which are led by passion to rush to
					meet the blow. For it is not from fear that he will incur disgrace
					that a man ought to stand his ground, nor from motives of anger, nor
					because he does not think that he will be killed or because he has
					forces to protect him, for in that case he will not think that there
					is really anything to be afraid of. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.32"/> But, since indeed all goodness involves purposive
					choice (it has been said before what we mean by
					this—goodness makes a man choose everything for the sake of
					some object, and that object is what is fine), it is clear that
					courage being a form of goodness will make a man face formidable
					things for some object, so that he does not do it through ignorance
					(for it rather makes him judge correctly), nor yet for pleasure, but
					because it is fine, since in a case where it is not fine but insane he
					will not face them, for then it would be base to do so.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have now given an account that is fairly adequate for our present

					and what is the power that formidable things exercise.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must next attempt to decide about Temperance and Profligacy. The
					term 'profligate' (unchaste) has a variety of meanings. It means the
					man who has not been (as it were) 'chastised' or cured, just as
					'undivided' means one that has not been divided; and these terms
					include both one capable of the process and one not capable of it:
					<milestone unit="section" n="1230b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>'undivided' means both that which cannot be
					divided and that which though it can be has not been; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.2"/> and similarly with
					'unchaste'—it denotes both that which is by nature incapable
					of chastening and that which, though capable, has not actually been
					chastened in respect of the errors as regards which the temperate man
					acts rightly, as is the case with children; for of them it is in this
					sense that the term 'unchaste'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">A)KO/LASTOS</foreign>(lit.
						'incorrigible') often means no more than 'naughty'
						(Solomon).</note> is used, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.3"/> whereas another use of it again refers to persons hard to cure or
					entirely incurable by chastisement. But though 'profligacy' has more
					than one sense, it is clear that the profligate are concerned with
					certain pleasures and pains and that they differ from one another and
					from the other vicious characters in being disposed in a certain
					manner towards these; and we described previously the way in which we
					apply the term 'profligacy' by analogy.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to refer to words which must have been
						lost at <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1221a.20">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1221a 20</bibl>
						(Solomon).</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.4"/>
					Persons on the other hand who owing to insensitiveness are
					uninfluenced by these pleasures are called by some people
					'insensitive' and by others are designated by other names of the same
					sort; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.5"/> but the state is
					not a very familiar one nor of common occurrence, because all men err
					more in the other direction, and susceptibility and sensitiveness to
					pleasures of this sort are natural to everybody. It specially attaches
					to persons like the boors who are a stock character in
					comedy—<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>people who steer clear of pleasures even in moderate and necessary
					indulgences.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since the temperate
					character is shown in connection with pleasures, it follows that it is
					also related to certain desires. We must, therefore, ascertain what
					these are. For the temperate man is not temperate about all pleasures
					nor about everything pleasant, but apparently about the objects of two
					of the senses, taste and touch, and in reality about the objects of
					touch. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.7"/> For the temperate
					man is not concerned with the pleasure of beautiful things (apart from
					sexual desire) or pain caused by ugly things, the medium of which is
					sight, nor with the pleasure of harmonious sounds or pain of discords
					conveyed through the medium of hearing, nor yet with the pleasures and
					pains of smell, derived from good and bad scents; for neither is
					anyone termed profligate because of being sensitive or not sensitive
					to sensations of that sort—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.8"/> for example, a man would not be considered
					profligate if when looking at a beautiful statue or horse or person,
					or listening to someone singing, he did not wish for food or drink or
					sexual indulgence but only wished to look at the beautiful objects or
					listen to the music,—any more than the persons held
					spell-bound in the abode of the Sirens. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.9"/> Temperance and profligacy have to do with those
					two sorts of sensory objects in relation to which alone the lower
					animals also happen to be sensitive and to feel pleasure and
					pain—the objects of taste and of touch, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.10"/> whereas about virtually all
					the pleasures of the other senses alike animals are clearly so
					constituted as to be insensitive— <milestone unit="section" n="1231a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>e.g.
					harmonious sound, or beauty; for clearly they are not affected in any
					degree worth speaking of by the mere sight of beautiful objects or by
					listening to musical sounds, except possibly in the case of some
					miraculous occurrences. Nor yet are they sensitive to good or bad
					smells, although it is true that all their senses are keener than
					man's; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.11"/> but even the
					smells they enjoy are those that have agreeable associations, and are
					not intrinsically agreeable. By smells not intrinsically agreeable I
					mean those that we enjoy because of either anticipation or
					recollection, for example the smell of things to eat or drink, for we
					enjoy these scents on account of a different pleasure, that of eating
					or drinking; by intrinsically agreeable I mean scents such as those of
					flowers (this is the reason of Stratonicus's<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A contemporary musician, a number of whose smart
						sayings are recorded by <bibl n="Ath. 8.347">Athenaeus
							8.347f-352d</bibl>.</note> neat remark that the scent of
					flowers is beautiful but that of things to eat and drink sweet).
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.12"/> For even the
					pleasures of taste are not all attractive to animals, nor are those
					perceived with the tip of the tongue, but those perceived by the
					throat, the sensation of which seems more like touch than taste; so
					that gourmands do not pray that they may have a long tongue but a
					crane's gullet, like Philoxenus son of Eryxis.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Mr. Hospitable, son of Mistress
						Belch—presumably a character in
						comedy.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.13"/> It
					follows that broadly speaking profligacy must be considered to be
					related to the objects of touch, and likewise it is with pleasures of
					that sort that the profligate is concerned;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for tippling and gluttony and lechery and
					gormandizing and the like all have to do with the sensations
					specified, and these are the departments into which profligacy is
					divided. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.14"/> But nobody is
					called profligate if he exceeds in regard to the pleasures of sight or
					hearing or smell; those errors we criticize without severe rebuke, and
					generally all the things included under the term 'lack of
					self-control': the uncontrolled are not profligate, yet they are not
					temperate.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore the person of such a
					character as to be deficient in all the enjoyments which practically
					everybody must share and must enjoy, is insensitive (or whatever the
					proper term is), and he that exceeds in them is profligate. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.16"/> For all people by nature
					enjoy these things, and conceive desires for them, without being or
					being called profligate, for they do not exceed by feeling more joy
					than they ought when they get them nor more pain than they ought when
					they do not get them; nor yet are they unfeeling,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">A)NA/LGHTOI</foreign> is
						thrown in as a possible synonym for <foreign lang="greek">A)NAI/SQHTOI</foreign>, see 15.</note> for they do not
					fall short in feeling joy or pain, but rather exceed.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since there are excess and deficiency in regard to these things,
					it is clear that there is also a middle state, and that this state of
					character is the best one, and is the opposite of both the others.
					Hence if temperance is the best state of character in relation to the
					things with which the profligate is concerned, the middle state in
					regard to the pleasant objects of sense mentioned will be Temperance,
					being a middle state between profligacy and insensitiveness: the
					excess will be Profligacy, <milestone unit="section" n="1231b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and the deficiency
					will either be nameless or will be denoted by the terms
					mentioned.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps in a

					We shall have to define the class of pleasures concerned more exactly
					in our discussion of Self-control and Lack of Control later
					on.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And also the nature of Gentleness and
					Harshness must be ascertained in the same way. For we see that the
					term 'gentle' is concerned with the pain that arises from
					passion—a man is gentle by being disposed in a certain way
					towards that pain. And in our diagram<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1220b.38">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1220b
						38</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1221b.12">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1221b
							12-15</bibl>.</note> we opposed to the irascible and harsh and fierce
					man (for all such traits belong to the same disposition) the slavish
					and spiritless<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Mss. give
						'slavish and senseless.'</note> man; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.2"/> for these are perhaps the most usual words to
					denote those whose passion is not aroused even at all the things at
					which it ought to be, but who undergo insulting treatment readily and
					meet slights with humility; since as opposed to feeling the pain that
					we call passion quickly, extremely or for a long time there is feeling
					it slowly, slightly, or for a short time. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.3"/> And since, as we said in the other cases, so
					here also there is excess and deficiency (for the harsh man is the
					sort of man that feels this emotion too quickly, too long, at the
					wrong time, with the wrong kind of people, and with many
					people,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>while the
					slavish man is the opposite), it is clear that there is also some body
					who is at the middle point in the inequality.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. half-way between excess and
						defect.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.4"/>
					Since, therefore, both those states of character are wrong, it is
					clear that the state midway between them is right, for it is neither
					too hasty nor too slow-tempered, nor does it get angry with the people
					with whom it ought not nor fail to get angry with those with whom it
					ought. So that since the best state of character in regard to those
					feelings is gentleness, Gentleness also would be a middle state, and
					the gentle man would be midway between the harsh man and the slavish
					man.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Greatness of Spirit and Magnificence and
					Liberality are also middle states. Liberality is the mean in regard to
					the acquisition and expenditure of wealth. The man who is more pleased
					than he ought to be by all acquisition and more pained than he ought
					to be by all expenditure is mean, he that feels both feelings less
					than he ought is prodigal, and he that feels both as he ought is
					liberal (what I mean by 'as he ought,' both in this and in the other
					cases, is 'as right principle directs'). <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.2"/> And since the two former characters consist in
					excess and deficiency, and where there are extremes there is also a
					mean, and that mean is best, there being a single best for each kind
					of action, a single thing, it necessarily follows that liberality is a
					middle state between prodigality and meanness as regards getting and
					parting with wealth. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.3"/> But
					the terms 'wealth' and 'art of wealth' we use in two senses, since one
					way of using an article of property, <milestone unit="section" n="1232a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for example
					a shoe or a cloak, is proper to the article itself,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1.1257a.14">Aristot. Pol.

					not as using a shoe for a weight would be an accidental use of it, but
					for example selling it or letting it on hire, for these uses do employ
					it as a shoe. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.4"/> The
					covetous man is the party whose interest centers on money, and money
					is a thing of ownership instead of accidental use. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.5"/> But the mean man might be even
					prodigal in regard to the accidental mode of getting wealth, inasmuch
					as it is in the natural acquisition of wealth that he pursues
					increase. The prodigal man lacks necessities, but the liberal man
					gives his superfluity. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.6"/>
					And of these classes themselves there are species designated as
					exceeding or deficient in respect of parts of the matter concerned:
					for example, the stingy man, the skinflint and the profiteer are
					mean—the stingy in not parting with money, the profiteer in
					accepting anything, the skinflint is he who is very excited about
					small sums; also the man who offends by way of meanness is a false
					reckoner and a cheat. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.7"/>
					Similarly 'prodigal' includes the spendthrift who is prodigal in
					unregulated spending and the reckless man who is prodigal in not being
					able to endure the pain of calculation.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the subject of
					Greatness of Spirit we must define its characteristic from the
					attributes of the great-spirited man.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For just as in the other cases of things
					that, owing to their affinity and similarity up to a point, are not
					noticed to differ when they advance further, the same has happened
					about greatness of spirit. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.2"/> Hence sometimes the opposite characters claim the same quality, for
					instance the extravagant man claims to be the same as the liberal, the
					self-willed as the proud, the daring as the brave; for they are
					concerned with the same things, and also are neighbors up to a point,
					as the brave man can endure dangers and so can the daring man, but the
					former in one way and the latter in another, and that makes a very
					great difference. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.3"/> And we
					use the term 'great-spirited' according to the designation of the
					word, as consisting in a certain greatness or power of spirit. So that
					the great-spirited man seems to resemble both the proud man and the
					magnificent, because greatness of spirit seems to go with all the
					virtues also. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.4"/> For it is
					praiseworthy to judge great and small goods rightly; and those goods
					seem great which a man pursues who possesses the best state of
					character in relation to such pleasures, and greatness of spirit is
					the best. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.5"/> And the virtue
					concerned with each thing judges rightly the greater and the smaller
					good, just as the wise man and virtue would bid, so that all the
					virtues go with it, or it goes with all the virtues.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, it is thought characteristic of the great-spirited man to be
					disdainful. Each virtue makes men disdainful of things irrationally
					deemed great: <milestone unit="section" n="1232b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for example, courage makes a man
					disdainful of dangers, for he thinks that to consider danger a great
					matter is a disgraceful thing, and that numbers are not always
					formidable; and the sober-minded man disdains great and numerous
					pleasures, and the liberal man wealth. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.7"/> But the reason why this is thought
					characteristic of the great-spirited man is because of his caring
					about few things and those great ones, and not about whatever somebody
					else thinks. And a great-spirited man would consider more what one
					virtuous man thinks than what many ordinary people think, as Antiphon
					after his condemnation said to Agathon when he praised his speech for
					his defence.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A variant reading
						gives 'as A. said to A. when he insincerely praised his
						defence.' For Antiphon's indictment as a leader in the
						revolution of the Four Hundred at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> see <bibl n="Thuc. 8.68">Thuc. 8.68</bibl>. Agathon is presumably the tragic poet,
						see Plato's <title>Symposium</title>. The anecdote is not
						recorded elsewhere.</note> And a feeling thought to be specially
					characteristic of the great-spirited man is disdain. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.8"/> On the other hand, as to the
					accepted objects of human interest, honor, life, wealth, he is thought
					to care nothing about any of them except honor; it would grieve him to
					be dishonored and ruled by someone unworthy, and his greatest joy is
					to obtain honor.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he might therefore be thought
					inconsistent, on the ground that to be specially concerned about honor
					and to be disdainful of the multitude and of reputation do not go
					together. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.10"/> But in saying
					this we must distinguish. Honor is small or great in two ways: it
					differs in being conferred either by many ordinary people or by
					persons of consideration, and again it differs in what it is conferred
					for,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>since its
					greatness does not depend only on the number or the quality of those
					who confer it, but also on its being honorable; and in reality those
					offices and other good things are honorable and worthy of serious
					pursuit that are truly great, so that there is no goodness without
					greatness; owing to which each of the virtues seems to make men
					great-spirited in regard to the things with which that virtue is
					concerned, as we said.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						39.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.11"/> But
					nevertheless there is a single virtue of greatness of spirit side by
					side with the other virtues, so that the possessor of this virtue must
					be termed great-spirited in a special sense. And since there are
					certain goods which are in some cases honorable and in others not,
					according to the distinction made before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. ll. 17 ff.</note> and of goods of this sort
					some are truly great and others small, and some men deserve and claim
					the former, it is among these men that the great-spirited man must be
					looked for. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.12"/> And there
					are necessarily four varieties of claim: it is possible to deserve
					great things and to claim them as one's desert; and there are small
					things and a man may deserve and claim things of that size; and as
					regards each of these two classes of things the reverse is
					possible—one man may be of such a character that although
					deserving small things he claims great ones—the goods held
					in high honor, and another man though deserving great things may claim
					small ones. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.13"/> Now the man
					worthy of small things but claiming great ones is blameworthy, for it
					is foolish and not fine to obtain what does not correspond to one's
					deserts. And he also is blameworthy who though worthy of such things
					does not deem himself worthy to partake of them although they are
					available for him. <milestone unit="section" n="1233a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.14"/> But there is left here the man who is the
					opposite of both of these, who being worthy of great things claims
					them as his desert,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek
						phrase combines the senses of rating one's deserts high and
						asserting one's claims.</note> and is of such a character as to
					deem himself worthy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, emending
						the text, 'and is as worthy as he claims to be.'</note>: he is
					praiseworthy, and he is in the middle between the two. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.15"/> Since, therefore, greatness
					of spirit is the best disposition in relation to the choice and the
					employment of honor and of the other good things that are esteemed,
					and not in relation to useful things, and since we assign this to the
					great-spirited man, and since also at the same time the middle state
					is most praiseworthy, it is clear that even greatness of spirit must
					be a middle state. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.16"/> And
					of the opposites as shown in our diagram, the one in the direction of
					deeming oneself worthy of great goods when one is not worthy is vanity
					(for the sort of men that fancy themselves worthy of great things
					though they are not we call vain), and the one that is concerned with
					not deeming oneself worthy of great things when one is worthy of them
					is smallness of spirit (for if a man does not think himself worthy of
					anything great although he possesses qualities which would justly make
					him considered worthy of it, he is thought small-spirited); so that it
					follows that greatness of spirit is a middle state between vanity and
					smallness of spirit. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.17"/> But
					the fourth of the persons in our classification is neither entirely
					reprehensible nor is he great spirited, as he is concerned with
					nothing possessing greatness, for he neither is nor thinks himself
					worthy of great things; owing to which he is not the opposite of the
					man of great spirit.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>Yet
					thinking oneself worthy of small things when one is worthy of small
					things might be thought the opposite of thinking oneself worthy of
					great ones when one is worthy of great ones; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.18"/> but he is not opposite to the
					great-spirited man because he is not blameworthy either, for his
					character is as reason bids, and in nature he is the same as the
					great-spirited man, for both claim as their desert the things that
					they are worthy of. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.19"/> And
					he might become great-spirited, for he will claim the things that he
					is worthy of; whereas the small-spirited man, who when great goods
					corresponding to his worth are available does not think himself worthy
					of them—what would he have done if his deserts were small?
					For either he would have conceitedly thought himself worthy of great
					things, or of still less.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Ms.
						reading hardly gives a sense. An emendation gives 'for if he
						conceitedly thought himself worthy of great things when
						unworthy,' and supposes a gap in the text before the following
						words.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.20"/> Hence
					nobody would call a man small-spirited for not claiming to hold office
					and submitting to authority if he is a resident alien, but one would
					do so if he were of noble birth and attached great importance to
					office.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Magnificent Man also (except in a case
					when we are using the term metaphorically) is not concerned with any

					but consists in going beyond the merely necessary. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.2"/> Therefore the magnificent man
					is the man who purposively chooses the appropriate greatness in great
					expenditure, and who even on the occasion of a pleasure<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable emendation substitutes
						'expenditure' for 'pleasure.'</note> of this nature aims at this
					sort of moderation. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.3"/> There

					and blameworthy states of character also are excesses or deficiencies
					or middle states, but in respect of an emotion: for instance, the
					envious man and the malicious. For—to take the states of
					character after which they are named—<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>Envy means being pained at people who are
					deservedly prosperous, while the emotion of the malicious man is
					itself nameless, but the possessor of it is shown by his feeling joy
					at undeserved adversities; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.2"/> and midway between them is the righteously indignant man, and what
					the ancients called Righteous Indignation—feeling pain at
					undeserved adversities and prosperities and pleasure at those that are
					deserved; hence the idea that Nemesis is a deity.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Modesty is a middle state between Shamelessness and Bashfulness: the
					man who pays regard to nobody's opinion is shameless, he who regards
					everybody's is bashful, he who regards the opinion of those who appear
					good is modest.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Friendliness is a middle state between
					Animosity and Flattery; the man who accommodates himself readily to
					his associates' desires in everything is a flatterer, he who runs
					counter to them all shows animosity, he who neither falls in with nor
					resists every pleasure, but falls in with what seems to be the best,
					is friendly.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dignity is a middle state between Self-will
					and Obsequiousness. A man who in his conduct pays no regard at all to
					another but is contemptuous is self-willed; he who regards another in
					everything and is inferior to everybody is obsequious; he who regards
					another in some things but not in others, and is regardful of persons
					worthy of regard, is dignified.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The truthful and sincere
					man, called 'downright,'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The man
						who calls each thing itself, i.e. what it really is, calls a
						spade a spade.</note> is midway between the dissembler and the
					charlatan. He that wittingly makes a false statement against himself
					that is depreciatory is a dissembler, <milestone unit="section" n="1234a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>he that
					exaggerates his merits is a charlatan, he that speaks of himself as he
					is is truthful and in Homer's phrase 'sagacious'; and in general the
					one is a lover of truth and the others lovers of falsehood.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.7"/>Wittiness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term <foreign lang="greek">EU)TRA/PELOS</foreign> means literally 'able to turn easily,'
						versatile; it denotes both 'witty' and 'easy-going.'</note> also
					is a middle state, and the witty man is midway between the boorish or
					stiff man and the buffoon. For just as in the matter of food the
					squeamish man differs from the omnivorous in that the former takes
					nothing or little, and that reluctantly, and the latter accepts
					everything readily, so the boor stands in relation to the vulgar man
					or buffoon—the former takes no joke except with difficulty,
					the latter accepts everything easily and with pleasure. Neither course
					is right: one should allow some things and not others, and on
					principle,—that constitutes the witty man. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.8"/> The proof of the formula is
					the same as in the other cases: wittiness of this kind (not the
					quality<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. <foreign lang="greek">BWMOLOXI/A</foreign>, 'buffoonery,' <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1128b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1128a 15</bibl>.</note> to which
					we apply the term in a transferred sense) is a very becoming sort of
					character, and also a middle state is praiseworthy, whereas extremes
					are blameworthy. But as there are two kinds of wit (one consisting in
					liking a joke, even one that tells against oneself if it is funny, for
					instance a jeer, the other in the ability to produce things of this
					sort), these kinds of wit differ from one another, but both are middle
					states;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.9"/> for a man who can produce
					jokes of a sort that will give pleasure to a person of good judgement
					even though the laugh is against himself will be midway between the
					vulgar man and the frigid. This is a better definition than that the
					thing said must not be painful to the victim whatever sort of man he
					may be—rather, it must give pleasure to the man in the
					middle position, since his judgement is good.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All these middle states, though praiseworthy, are not virtues, nor
					are the opposite states vices, for they do not involve purposive
					choice; they are all in the classification of the emotions, for each
					of them is an emotion. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.11"/>
					But because they are natural they contribute to the natural virtues;
					for, as will be said in what follows,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not in Eud. Eth, but cf. <bibl n="Aristot.        Nic. Eth. 1144b.1">Aristot.
						Nic. Eth. 1144b 1-17</bibl>.</note> each virtue exists
					both naturally and otherwise, that is, in conjunction with thought.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.12"/> Therefore envy
					contributes to injustice (for the actions that spring from it affect
					another person), and righteous indignation to justice, and modesty to
					temperance (owing to which people even define temperance as a species
					of emotion), and the sincere and false are respectively wise and
					foolish.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Truthfulness and

					opposed to the extremes than the extremes are to one another,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1234b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>because the mean does not occur in
					combination with either extreme, whereas the extremes often do occur
					in combination with one another, and sometimes the same men are
					venturesome cowards, or extravagant in some things and illiberal in
					others, and in general not uniform in a bad way—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.14"/> for when men lack uniformity
					in a good way, this results in men of the middle characters, since the
					mean contains both extremes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
					opposition existing between the mean and the extremes does not seem to
					be the same in the case of both the extremes, but sometimes the
					greater opposition is by way of excess, sometimes by way of
					deficiency. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.15"/> The causes
					of this are partly the two first mentioned,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1222a.22">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1222a 22-b

					insensitive to pleasant things) and the fact that the error to which
					we are more prone seems more opposite to the mean, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.16"/> and thirdly the fact that the
					extreme that more resembles the mean seems less opposite to it, as is
					the case with daring in relation to boldness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, 'confidence'; but perhaps the Greek should be

						do not really correspond with the facts.</note>; but there are
					others that are closer together and more akin to the facts of

					be friends, but only for the good. Others think it strange that
					mothers should not love their own children <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.13"/> (and maternal affection we see existing even
					among animals—at least, animals choose to die for their
					young). <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.14"/> Others hold that
					only what is useful is a friend, the proof being that all men actually
					do pursue the useful, and discard what is useless even in their own
					persons (as the old Socrates<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1.1216b.3">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1216b 3</bibl>.</note> used

						utility (Solomon).</note> seem to be somewhat opposed to one
					another. For like is of no use to like and opposition is farthest
					removed from likeness, and at the same time opposite is most useless
					to opposite, since opposite is destructive of opposite. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.16"/> Moreover some think that to
					gain a friend is easy, but others that it is the rarest thing to
					recognize a friend, and not possible without misfortune, as everybody
					wants to be thought a friend of the prosperous; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.17"/> and others maintain that we
					must not trust even those who stay with us in our misfortunes, because
					they are deceiving us and pretending, in order that by associating
					with us when unfortunate they may gain our friendship when we are
					again prosperous.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly a line of argument
					must be taken that will best explain to us the views held on these
					matters and at the same time solve the difficulties and
					contradictions. And this will be secured if the contradictory views
					are shown to be held with some reason. For such a line of argument
					will be most in agreement with the observed facts: and in the upshot,
					if what is said is true in one sense but not true in another, both the
					contradictory views stand good.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also a question
					as to whether what is dear to us is the pleasant or the
					good.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>If we hold dear
					what we desire (and that is specially characteristic of love, for
					"None is a lover that holds not dear for aye"<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Tro. 1051">Eur. Tro. 1051</bibl>.</note>), and
					desire is for what is pleasant, on this showing it is the pleasant
					that is dear; whereas if we hold dear what we wish, it is the good;
					but the pleasant and the good are different things.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must therefore attempt to decide about these matters and others
					akin to them, taking as a starting point the following. The thing
					desired and wished is either the good or the apparent good. Therefore
					also the pleasant is desired, for it is an apparent good, since some
					people think it good, and to others it appears good even though they
					do not think it so (as appearance and opinion are not in the same part
					of the spirit).<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. are different
						psychological experiences.</note> Yet it is clear that both the
					good and the pleasant are dear.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This being decided, we
					must make another assumption. Things good are some of them absolutely
					good, others good for someone but not good absolutely; and the same
					things are absolutely good and absolutely pleasant. For things
					advantageous for a healthy body we pronounce good for the body
					absolutely, but things good for a sick body not—for example
					doses of medicine and surgical operations; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.5"/> and likewise also the things pleasant for a
					healthy and perfect body are pleasant for the body absolutely, for
					example to live in the light and not in the dark, although the reverse
					is the case for a man with ophthalmia. And the pleasanter wine is not
					the wine pleasant to a man whose palate has been corrupted by
					tippling, since sometimes they pour in a dash of vinegar, but to the
					uncorrupted taste. <milestone unit="section" n="1236a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.6"/>And similarly also in the case of the spirit,
					the really pleasant things are not those pleasant to children and
					animals, but those pleasant to the adult; at least it is these that we
					prefer when we remember both. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.7"/> And as a child or animal stands to an adult human
					being, so the bad and foolish man stands to the good and wise man; and
					these take pleasure in things that correspond to their characters, and
					these are things good and fine.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since therefore good is
					a term of more than one meaning (for we call one thing good because
					that is its essential nature, but another because it is serviceable
					and useful), and furthermore pleasant includes both what is absolutely
					pleasant and absolutely good and what is pleasant for somebody and
					apparently good—, as in the case of inanimate objects we may
					choose a thing and love it for each of these reasons, so also in the
					case of a human being, one man we love because of his character, and
					for goodness, another because he is serviceable and useful, another
					because he is pleasant, and for pleasure. And a man becomes a friend
					when while receiving affection he returns it, and when he and the
					other are in some way aware of this.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It follows, therefore,
					that there are three sorts of friendship, and that they are not all so
					termed in respect of one thing or as species of one genus, nor yet
					have they the same name entirely by accident. For all these uses of
					the term are related to one particular sort of friendship which is
					primary, like the term 'surgical'—and we speak of a surgical
					mind and a surgical hand and a surgical instrument and a surgical
					operation,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>but we
					apply the term properly to that which is primarily so called.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.10"/> The primary is
					that of which the definition is implicit in the definition of all, for
					example a surgical instrument is an instrument that a surgeon would
					use, whereas the definition of the instrument is not implicit in that
					of surgeon. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.11"/> Therefore in
					every case people seek the primary, and because the universal is
					primary they assume that also the primary is universal; but this is
					untrue. Hence in the case of friendship, they cannot take account of
					all the observed facts. For as one definition does not fit, they think
					that the other kinds of friendship are not friendships at all; but
					really they are, although not in the same way, <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.12"/> but when they find that the
					primary friendship does not fit, assuming that it would be universal
					if it really were primary, they say that the others are not
					friendships at all. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.13"/> But
					in reality there are many kinds of friendships: this was among the
					things said already,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">ll.
						7-17.</note> as we have distinguished three senses of the term
					friendship—one sort has been defined as based on goodness,
					another on utility, another on pleasure.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of these the one
					based on utility is assuredly the friendship of most people; for they
					love one another because they are useful, and in so far as they are
					and so, as says the proverb—“Glaucus, an ally is a
					friend, as long as he our battle fights,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A friend in need is a friend indeed.</note> and <cit>
						<quote type="verse">
							<l met="elegiac"><placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> no longer knows <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.</l>
						</quote>
						<bibl n="Eleg. Alex. Adesp. 6">Fr. Eleg. Adespota 6 (Bergk)</bibl>
					</cit><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.15"/> On the other hand
					friendship based on pleasure is the friendship of the young, for they
					have a sense of what is pleasant; hence young people's friendship
					easily changes, for since their characters change as they grow up,
					their taste in pleasure also changes. But the friendship in conformity
					with goodness is the friendship of the best men. <milestone unit="section" n="1236b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is clear from this that the primary
					friendship, that of the good, is mutual reciprocity of affection and
					purpose. For the object of affection is dear to the giver of it, but
					also the giver of affection is himself dear to the object. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.17"/> This friendship, therefore,
					only occurs in man, for he alone perceives purpose; but the other
					forms occur also in the lower animals. Indeed mutual utility
					manifestly exists to some small extent between the domestic animals
					and man, and between animals themselves, for instance Herodotus's
					account of the friendship between the crocodile and the
					sandpiper,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hdt. 2.68">Hdt.
						2.68</bibl>, says that the trochilus picks leeches out of
						the crocodile's throat, <bibl n="Aristot. HA 9.6.6">Aristot. Hist. An.
							9.6.6</bibl>, that it picks the crocodile's teeth. In reality it
						picks gnats from the crocodile's open mouth.</note> and the
					perching together and separating of birds of which soothsayers speak.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.18"/> The bad may be
					each other's friends from motives both of utility and of pleasure;
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.19"/> though some say
					that they are not really friends, because the primary kind of
					friendship does not belong to them, since obviously a bad man will
					injure a bad man, and those who suffer injury from one another do not
					feel affection for one another. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.20"/> But as a matter of fact bad men do feel affection for
					one another, though not according to the primary form of
					friendship—because clearly nothing hinders their being
					friends under the other forms, since for the sake of pleasure they put
					up with one another although they are being harmed, so long as they
					are lacking in self-restraint. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.21"/> The view is also held, when people look into the
					matter closely, that those who feel affection for each other on
					account of pleasure are not friends, because it is not the primary
					friendship, since that is reliable but this is unreliable.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>But as a matter of fact it is
					friendship, as has been said, though not that sort of friendship but
					one derived from it. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.22"/>
					Therefore to confine the use of the term friend to that form of
					friendship alone is to do violence to observed facts, and compels one
					to talk paradoxes; though it is not possible to bring all friendship
					under one definition. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.23"/>
					The only remaining alternative, therefore, is, that in a sense the
					primary sort of friendship alone is friendship, but in a sense all
					sorts are, not as having a common name by accident and standing in a
					merely chance relationship to one another, nor yet as falling under
					one species, but rather as related to one thing.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since the same thing is absolutely good and absolutely pleasant
					at the same time if nothing interferes, and the true friend and friend
					absolutely is the primary friend, and such is a friend chosen in and
					for himself (and he must necessarily be such, for he for whom one
					wishes good for his own sake must necessarily be desirable for his own
					sake), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.25"/> a true friend is
					also absolutely pleasant; owing to which it is thought that a friend
					of any sort is pleasant. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.26"/>
					But we must define this still further, for it is debatable whether
					what is good merely for oneself is dear or what is absolutely good,
					and whether the actual exercise of affection is accompanied by
					pleasure, so that an object of affection is also pleasant, or not.
					Both questions must be brought to the same issue; for things not
					absolutely good but possibly evil are to be avoided, and also a thing
					not good for oneself is no concern of oneself, but what is sought for
					is that things absolutely good shall be good for oneself. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.27"/> For the absolutely good is
					absolutely desirable, but what is good for oneself is desirable for
					oneself; <milestone unit="section" n="1237a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and the two ought to come into agreement.
					This is effected by goodness; and the purpose of political science is
					to bring it about in cases where it does not yet exist. And one who is
					a human being is well adapted to this and on the way to it (for by
					nature things that are absolutely good are good to him), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.28"/> and similarly a man rather
					than a woman and a gifted man rather than a dull one; but the road is
					through pleasure—it is necessary that fine things shall be
					pleasant. When there is discord between them, a man is not yet
					perfectly good; for it is possible for unrestraint to be engendered in
					him, as unrestraint is caused by discord between the good and the
					pleasant in the emotions.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore since the primary
					sort of friendship is in accordance with goodness, friends of this
					sort will be absolutely good in themselves also, and this not because
					of being useful, but in another manner. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.30"/> For good for a given person and good
					absolutely are twofold; and the same is the case with states of
					character as with profitableness—what is profitable
					absolutely and what is profitable for given persons are different
					things (just as taking exercise is a different thing from taking
					drugs). So the state of character called human goodness is of two
					kinds—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.31"/>
					for let us assume that man is one of the things that are excellent by
					nature: consequently the goodness of a thing excellent by nature is
					good absolutely, but that of a thing not excellent by nature is only
					good for that thing.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The case of the pleasant also,
					therefore, is similar. For here we must pause and consider whether
					there is any friendship without pleasure,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and how such a friendship differs from other
					friendship, and on which exactly of the two things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Goodness and pleasantness.</note> the affection
					depends—do we love a man because he is good even if he is
					not pleasant, but not because he is pleasant?<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give 'or
						not, but because he is pleasant.'</note> Then, affection having
					two meanings,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Potential and actual
						(Solomon).</note> does actual affection seem to involve pleasure
					because activity is good? <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.33"/> It is clear that as in science recent studies and acquirements are
					most fully apprehended, because of their pleasantness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						Ross marks this clause as corrupted.</note> so with
					the recognition of familiar things, and the principle is the same in
					both cases. By nature at all events the absolutely good is absolutely
					pleasant, and the relatively good is pleasant to those for whom it is
					good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc. (<foreign lang="greek">TO\ TOISDI\ A)GAQO/N</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">OI(=S A)GAQO/N, TOU/TOIS
						H(DU/</foreign>.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.34"/> Hence ipso facto like takes pleasure in like, and man
					is the thing most pleasant to man; so that as this is so even with
					imperfect things, it is clearly so with things when perfected, and a
					good man is a perfect man. And if active affection is the reciprocal
					choice, accompanied by pleasure, of one another's acquaintance, it is
					clear that friendship of the primary kind is in general the reciprocal
					choice of things absolutely good and pleasant because they are good
					and pleasant; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.35"/> and
					friendship itself is a state from which such choice arises. For its
					function is an activity, but this not external but within the lover
					himself; whereas the function of every faculty is external, for it is
					either in another or in oneself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.36"/> Hence to love is
					to feel pleasure but to be loved is not; for being loved is not an
					activity of the thing loved, whereas loving is an
					activity—the activity of friendship; and loving occurs only
					in an animate thing, whereas being loved occurs with an inanimate
					thing also, for even inanimate things are loved. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.37"/> And since to love actively is
					to treat the loved object <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> loved, <milestone unit="section" n="1237b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and the friend is an object of love to the friend <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> dear to him but not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> musician or medical man, the pleasure of friendship is the
					pleasure derived from the person himself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					himself; for the friend loves him as himself, not because he is
					something else. Consequently if he does not take pleasure in him <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> good, it is not the primary friendship.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.38"/> Nor ought any
					accidental quality to cause more hindrance than the friend's goodness
					causes delight; for surely, if a person is very evil-smelling, people
					cut him—he must be content with our goodwill, he must not
					expect our society!<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This then is the
					primary friendship, which all people recognize. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.39"/> It is on account of it that
					the other sorts are considered to be friendship, and also that their
					claim is disputed—for friendship seems to be some thing
					stable, and only this friendship is stable; for a formed judgement is
					stable, and not doing things quickly or easily makes the judgement
					right. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.40"/> And there is no
					stable friendship without confidence, and confidence only comes with
					time; for it is necessary to make trial, as Theognis says: <cit>
						<quote type="verse">
							<l met="elegiac">You cannot know the mind of man nor woman</l>
							<l>Before have you tried them as you try cattle.</l>
						</quote>
						<bibl n="Thgn. 125">Theog. 125f.</bibl>
					</cit>Those who become friends without the test of time are not real
					friends but only wish to be friends; and such a character very readily
					passes for friendship,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.41"/> because when
					eager to be friends they think that by rendering each other all
					friendly services they do not merely wish to be friends but actually
					are friends. But as a matter of fact it happens in friendship as in
					everything else; people are not healthy merely if they wish to be
					healthy, so that even if people wish to be friends they are not
					actually friends already. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.42"/> A proof of this is that people who have come into this position
					without first testing one another are easily set at variance; for
					though men are not set at variance easily about things in which they
					have allowed each other to test them, in cases where they have not,
					whenever those who are attempting to set then, at variance produce
					evidence they may be convinced. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.43"/> At the same time it is manifest that this friendship
					does not occur between base people either; for the base and
					evil-natured man is distrustful towards everybody, because he measures
					other people by himself. Hence good men are more easily cheated,
					unless as a result of trial they are distrustful. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.44"/> But the base prefer the goods
					of nature to a friend, and none of them love people more than things;
					and so they are not friends, for the proverbial 'common property as
					between friends' is not realized in this way—the friend is
					made an appendage of the things, not the things of the
					friends.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore the first kind of friendship does
					not occur between many men, because it is difficult to test
					many—one would have to go and live with each of them. Nor
					indeed should one exercise choice in the case of a friend in the same
					way as about a coat; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.46"/>
					although in all matters it seems the mark of a sensible man to choose
					the better of two things, and if he had been wearing his worse coat
					for a long time and had not yet worn his better one, the better one
					ought to be chosen—but you ought not in place of an old
					friend to choose one whom you do not know to be a better man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1238a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>For a friend is not to be had without trial
					and is not a matter of a single day, but time is needed; hence the
					peck of salt' has come to be proverbial. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.47"/> At the same time if a friend is really to be
					your friend he must be not only good absolutely but also good to you;
					for a man is good absolutely by being good, but he is a friend by
					being good to another, and he is both good absolutely and a friend
					when both these attributes harmonize together, so that what is good
					absolutely is also good for another person; or also he may be not good
					absolutely yet good to another because useful. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.48"/> But being a friend of many
					people at once is prevented even by the factor of affection, for it is
					not possible for affection to be active in relation to many at
					once.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.49"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These things, therefore, show the
					correctness of the saying that friendship is a thing to be relied on,
					just as happiness is a thing that is self-sufficing. And it has been
					rightly said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. El.       941">Eur. El.
						941</bibl>.</note>: "Nature is permanent, but wealth is
					not—" although it would be much finer to say 'Friendship'
					than 'Nature.'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, emending the
						text, 'that friendship is goodness of nature.'</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.50"/> And it is proverbial that
					time shows a friend, and also misfortunes more than good fortune. For
					then the truth of the saying 'friends' possessions are common
					property' is clear for only friends, instead of the natural goods and
					natural evils on which good and bad fortune turn, choose a human being
					rather than the presence of the former and the absence of the
					latter;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.51"/> and misfortune shows those
					who are not friends really but only because of some casual utility.
					And both are shown by time; for even the useful friend is not shown
					quickly, but rather the pleasant one—except that one who is
					absolutely pleasant is also not quick to show himself. For men are
					like wines and foods; the sweetness of those is quickly evident, but
					when lasting longer it is unpleasant and not sweet, and similarly in
					the case of men. For absolute pleasantness is a thing to be defined by
					the End it effects and the time it lasts. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.52"/> And even the multitude would agree, not in
					consequence of results only, but in the same way as in the case of a
					drink they call it sweeter—for a drink fails to be pleasant
					not because of its result, but because its pleasantness is not
					continuous, although at first it quite takes one in.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.53"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The primary form of friendship therefore, and the one that causes
					the name to be given to the others, is friendship based on goodness
					and due to the pleasure of goodness, as has been said before. The
					other friendships occur even among children and animals and wicked
					people: whence the sayings— "Two of an age each other
					gladden" and "Pleasure welds the bad man to the bad."<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Fr. 298">Eur.
						Bellerophontes Fr. 298 (Nauck)</bibl>.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.54"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And also the bad may be pleasant to each other not as being bad or
					neutral,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. neither good
						nor bad.</note> but if for instance both are musicians or one
					fond of music and the other a musician, and in the way in which all
					men have some good in them and so fit in with one another. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.55"/> Further they might be
					mutually useful and beneficial (not absolutely but for their purpose)
					not as being bad or neutral. <milestone unit="section" n="1238b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.56"/>It is also possible for a bad
					man to be friends with a good man, for the bad man may be useful to
					the good man for his purpose at the time-and the good man to the
					uncontrolled man for his purpose at the time and to the bad man for
					the purpose natural to him; and he will wish his friend what is
					good—wish absolutely things absolutely good, and under a
					given condition things good for him, as poverty or disease may be
					beneficial: things good for him he will wish for the sake of the
					absolute goods, in the way in which he wishes his friend to drink
					medicine—he does not wish the action in itself but wishes it
					for the given purpose. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.57"/>
					Moreover a bad man may also be friends with a good one in the ways in
					which men not good may be friends with one another: he may be pleasant
					to him not as being bad but as sharing some common characteristic, for
					instance if he is musical. Again they may be friends in the way in
					which there is some good in everybody (owing to which some men are
					sociable<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. ready to
						associate with all and sundry, regardless of moral inferiority.
						But perhaps the Greek should be altered to give 'some (bad men)
						might be worthy to associate with, even in the judgement of a
						good man,' or 'some might be worthy to associate with even
						though not good.'</note> even though good), or in the way in
					which they suit each particular person, for all men have something of
					good.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These then are three kinds of friendship;
					and in all of these the term friendship in a manner indicates
					equality, for even with those who are friends on the ground of
					goodness the friendship is in a manner based on equality of
					goodness.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But another variety of these kinds is
					friendship on a basis of superiority, as in that of a god for a
					man,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for that is a
					different kind of friendship, and generally of a ruler and subject;
					just as the principle of justice between them is also different, being
					one of equality proportionally but not of equality numerically.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Between two unequal persons
						justice divides benefits in proportion to their deserts, so that
						the two shares are not equal to each other but each equal to its
						recipient's merit. The word <foreign lang="greek">I)/SON</foreign> itself connotes 'fair,' just,
						reasonable.</note> The friendship of father for son is in this class,
					and that of benefactor for beneficiary. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.3"/> And of these sorts of friendship themselves
					there are varieties: the friendship of father for son is different
					from that of husband for wife—the former is friendship as
					between ruler and subject, the latter that of benefactor for
					beneficiary. And in these varieties either there is no return of
					affection or it is not returned in a similar way. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.4"/> For it would be ludicrous if
					one were to accuse God because he does not return love in the same way
					as he is loved, or for a subject to make this accusation against a
					ruler; for it is the part of a ruler to be loved, not to love, or else
					to love in another way. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.5"/>
					And the pleasure differs; the pleasure that a man of established
					position has in his own property or son and that which one who lacks
					them feels in an estate or a child coming to him are not one and the
					same. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.6"/> And in the same way
					also in the case of those who are friends for utility or for
					pleasure—some are on a footing of equality, others one of
					superiority. Owing to this those who think they are on the former
					footing complain if they are not useful and beneficial in a similar
					manner; and also in the case of pleasure.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. they complain if the pleasure or benefit
						they get from their friend is not equal (absolutely, not merely
						in proportion to a supposed difference of merit) to that which
						they give to him.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.7"/> This is clear in cases of passionate affection, for
					this is often a cause of combat between the lover and his beloved: the
					lover does not see that they have not the same reason for their
					affection. Hence Aenicus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A
						dramatist of the Old Comedy.</note> has said: "A loved one so
					would speak, but not a lover." But they think that the reason is the
					same. <milestone unit="section" n="1239a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.1"/>There being then, as has been said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1236a.7">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1236a 7-1237b
						15</bibl>.</note> three kinds of friendship, based on
					goodness, utility and pleasantness, these are again divided in two,
					one set being on a footing of equality and the other on one of
					superiority. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.2"/> Though both
					sets, therefore, are friendships, only when they are on an equality
					are the parties friends; for it would be absurd for a man to be a
					friend of a child, though he does feel affection for him and receive
					it from him. In some cases, while the superior partner ought to
					receive affection, if he gives it he is reproached as loving an
					unworthy object; for affection is measured by the worth of the friends
					and by one sort of equality.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
						proportional equality: see note on <bibl n="Aristot. Eud.        Eth. 7.1238b.21">Aristot. Eud.
							Eth. 1238b 21</bibl>.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.3"/> So in some cases there is properly a
					dissimilarity of affection because of inferiority of age, in others on
					the ground of goodness or birth or some other such superiority; it is
					right for the superior to claim to feel<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or 'one ought to expect the superior to feel . .
						.'</note> either less affection or none, alike in a friendship
					of utility and in one of pleasure and one based on goodness.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.4"/> So in cases of
					small degrees of superiority disputes naturally occur (for a small
					amount is not of importance in some matters, as in weighing timber,
					though in gold plate it is; but people judge smallness of amount
					badly, since one's own good because of its nearness appears big and
					that of others because of its remoteness small); <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.5"/> but when there is an excessive
					amount of difference, then even the parties themselves do not demand
					that they ought to be loved in return, or not loved
					alike—for example, if one were claiming a return of love
					from God.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.6"/> It is manifest, therefore,
					that men are friends when they are on an equality, but that a return
					of affection is possible without their being friends. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.7"/> And it is clear why men seek
					friendship on a basis of superiority more than that on one of
					equality; for in the former case they score both affection and a sense
					of superiority at the same time. Hence with some men the flatterer is
					more esteemed than the friend, for he makes the person flattered
					appear to score both advantages. And this most of all characterizes
					men ambitious of honors, since to be admired implies superiority.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.8"/> Some persons grow
					up by nature affectionate and others ambitious; one who enjoys loving
					more than being loved is affectionate, whereas the other enjoys being
					loved more. So the man who enjoys being admired and loved is a lover
					of superiority, whereas the other, the affectionate man, loves the
					pleasure of loving. For this he necessarily possesses by the mere
					activity of loving; for being loved is an accident, as one can be
					loved without knowing it, but one cannot love without knowing it.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.9"/> Loving depends,
					more than being loved, on the actual feeling, whereas being loved
					corresponds with the nature of the object. A sign of this is that a
					friend, if both things were not possible, would choose to know the
					other person rather than to be known by him, as for example women do
					when they allow others to adopt their children, and Andromache in the
					tragedy of Antiphon.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This poet
						lived at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>
						at the court of Dionysus the elder (who came into power <date value="-406">406</date> B.C.). He is said to have written
						tragedies in collaboration with the tyrant; and he was sentenced
						by him to death by flogging (<bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1384a.9">Aristot. Rhet. 1384a
							9</bibl>).</note> Indeed the wish to be known seems to be
					selfish, and its motive a desire to receive and not to confer some
					benefit, whereas to wish to know a person is for the sake of
					conferring benefit and bestowing affection. <milestone unit="section" n="1239b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="4.10"/>For this reason we praise
					those who remain constant in affection towards the dead; for they
					know, but are not known. It has, then, been stated that there are
					several modes of friendship, and how many modes there are, namely
					three, and that receiving affection and having one's affection
					returned, and friends on an equality and those on a footing of
					superiority, are different.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as the term 'friend' is
					used in a more universal sense as well, as was also said at the
					beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1235a.4">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1235a 4 ff.</bibl>
					</note> by those who take in wider considerations (some saying that
					what is like is dear, others what is opposite), we must also speak
					about these forms of friendship and their relation to the kinds that
					have been discussed. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.2"/> As
					for likeness, it connects with pleasantness and also with goodness.
					For the good is simple, whereas the bad is multiform; and also the
					good man is always alike and does not change in character, whereas the
					wicked and the foolish are quite different in the evening from what
					they were in the morning. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.3"/>
					Hence if wicked men do not hit it off together, they are not friends
					with one another but they separate; yet an insecure friendship is not
					friendship at all. So the like is dear to us in this way, because the
					good is like. But in a way it is also dear on the score of
					pleasantness; for to those who are alike the same things are pleasant,
					and also everything is by nature pleasant to itself.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.4"/> Owing to this relations find one another's
					voices and characters and society pleasantest, and so with the lower
					animals; and in this way it is possible even for bad men to feel
					affection for each other: "But pleasure welds the bad man to the
					bad."<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1238a.34">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1238a 34</bibl> note.</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.5"/> But opposite is dear to
					opposite on the score of utility. For the like is useless to itself,
					and therefore master needs slave and slave master, man and wife need
					one another; and the opposite is pleasant and desirable as useful, not
					as contained in the End but as a means to the End—for when a
					thing has got what it desires it has arrived at its End, and does not
					strive to get its opposite, for example the hot the cold and the wet
					the dry.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But in a way love of the opposite is also
					love of the good. For opposites strive to reach one another through
					the middle point, for they strive after each other as tallies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The two halves of a bone or coin
						broken in half by two contracting parties and one kept by each,
						to serve as a token of identification when found to fit
						together.</note> because in that way one middle thing results
					from the two. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.7"/> Hence
					accidentally love of the good is love of the opposite, but essentially
					it is love of the middle, for opposites do not strive to reach one
					another but the middle. If when people have got too cold they are
					subjected to heat, and when they have got too hot to cold, they reach
					a mean temperature, and similarly in other matters; but without such
					treatment they are always in a state of desire, because they are not
					at the middle points. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.8"/> But
					a man in the middle enjoys without passionate desire things by nature
					pleasant, whereas the others enjoy everything that takes them outside
					their natural state. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.9"/> This
					kind of relationship, then, exists even between inanimate things; but
					when it occurs in the case of living things it becomes affection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1240a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Hence sometimes people take delight in
					persons unlike themselves, the stiff for instance in the witty and the
					active in the lazy, for they are brought by one another into the
					middle state. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="5.10"/> Hence
					accidentally, as was said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="P">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1239b 32</bibl>.</note> opposites
					are dear to opposites also on account of the good.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It has, then, been said how many kinds of
					friendship there are, and what are the different senses in which
					people are termed friends, and also givers and objects of affection,
					both in a manner that makes them actually friends and without being
					friends.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The question whether one is one's own friend
					or not involves much consideration. Some think that every man is his
					own best friend, and they use this friendship as a standard by which
					to judge his friendship for his other friends. On theoretical grounds,
					and in view of the accepted attributes of friends, self-love and love
					of others are in some respects opposed but in others manifestly
					similar. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.2"/> For in a way
					self-love is friendship by analogy, but not absolutely. For being
					loved and loving involve two separate factors; owing to which a man is
					his own friend rather in the way in which, in the case of the
					unrestrained and the self-restrained man, we have said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1223a.36">Aristot. Eud. Eth.
						1223a 36-b 17</bibl>. Self-restraint (or the lack of it)
						indicates that a man's personality has in a sense two parts, one
						of which may control the other; and similarly self-love implies
						that one part of the personality can have a certain feeling in
						regard to another part.</note> how one has those qualities
					voluntarily or involuntarily—namely by the parts of one's
					spirit being related to each other in a certain way; and all such
					matters are a similar thing,whether a man can be his own friend or
					foe, and whether a man can treat himself unjustly.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For all these relations involve
					two separate factors; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.3"/> in
					so far then as the spirit is in a manner two, these relations do in a
					manner belong to it, but in so far as the two are not separate, they
					do not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From the state of friendship for
					oneself are determined the remaining modes of friendship under which
					we usually study it in our discourses.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1244a.20">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1244a
						20</bibl>. Perhaps a reference to Aristotle's lectures
						(Stock).</note> For a man is thought to be a friend who wishes for
					somebody things that are good, or that he believes to be good, not on
					his own account but for the other's sake; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.4"/> and in another way when a man wishes another's
					existence—even though not bestowing goods on him, let alone
					existence—for that other's sake and not for his own, he
					would be thought to be in a high degree the friend of that other;
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.5"/> and in another way
					a man is a friend of one whose society he desires merely for the sake
					of his company and not for something else, as fathers desire their
					children's existence, though they associate with other people. All
					these cases conflict with one another; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.6"/> some men do not think they are loved unless the
					friend wishes them this or that particular good, others unless their
					existence is desired, others unless their society. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.7"/> Again we shall reckon it
					affection to grieve with one who grieves not for some ulterior
					motive—as for instance slaves in relation to their masters
					share their grief because when in grief they are harsh, and not for
					their masters' own sake, as mothers grieve with their children, and
					birds that share each other's pain. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.8"/> For a friend wishes most of all that he might not only
					feel pain when his friend is in pain but feel actually the same
					pain—for example when he is thirsty, share his
					thirst—if this were possible, and if not, as nearly the same
					as may be. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.9"/> The same
					principle applies also in the case of joy; it is characteristic of a
					friend to rejoice for no other reason than because the other is
					rejoicing. <milestone unit="section" n="1240b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Again there are sayings about friendship such
					as 'Amity is equality' and 'True friends have one spirit.' <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.10"/> All these sayings refer back
					to the single individual; for that is the way in which the individual
					wishes good to himself, as nobody benefits himself for some ulterior
					motive, nor speaks well of himself for such and such a consideration,
					because he acted as an individual; for one who displays his affection
					wishes not to be but to be thought affectionate. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.11"/> And wishing for the other to
					exist, and associating together, and sharing joy and grief, and 'being
					one spirit'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1. 3: <foreign lang="greek">DH/</foreign> marks a quotation.</note> and
					being unable even to live without one another but dying
					together—for this is the case with the single individual,
					and he associates with himself in this way,—all these
					characteristics then belong to the man in relation to himself.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.12"/> In a wicked man on
					the other hand, for instance in one who lacks self-control, there is
					discord, and because of this it is thought to be possible for a man
					actually to be his own enemy; but as being one and indivisible he is
					desirable to himself. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.13"/>
					This is the case with a good man and one whose friendship is based on
					goodness, because assuredly an evil man is not a single individual but
					many, and a different person in the same day, and full of caprice.
					Hence a man's affection for himself carries back to love of the
					good;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for because in a
					way a man is like himself and a single person and good to himself, in
					this way he is dear and desirable to himself. And a man is like that
					by nature, but a wicked man is contrary to nature. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.14"/> But a good man does not
					rebuke himself either at the time, like the uncontrolled, nor yet his
					former self his later, like the penitent, nor his later self his
					former, like the liar—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.15"/> (and generally, if it is necessary to distinguish as
					the sophists do, he is related to himself as 'John Styles' is related
					to 'good John Styles'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. SE 175b.15">Sophistici Elenchi 175b
						15ff.</bibl> 'Coriscus' is used for any imaginary person, cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1220a.19">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1220a 19 f.</bibl></note>;
					for it is clear that the same amount of 'John Styles' is good as of
					'good John Styles')—because when men blame themselves they
					are murdering their own personalities, whereas everybody seems to
					himself good. And he who is absolutely good seeks to be dear even to
					himself, as has been said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">ll.
						13-21.</note> because he has two factors within him which by
					nature desire to be friendly and which it is impossible to draw
					asunder. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.16"/> Therefore in
					the case of man each individual seems dear to himself, although in the
					case of other animals it is not so, for example a horse to itself . .
					.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some words seem to have
						been lost here.</note> so it is not dear to itself. But neither
					are children, but only when they have come to possess purposive
					choice; for when that point is reached the mind is at variance with
					the appetite. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="6.17"/> And
					affection for oneself resembles the affection of relationship: neither
					connection is in people's own power to dissolve, but even if the
					parties quarrel, nevertheless relatives are still relatives and the
					individual is still one as long as he lives. From what has been said,
					then, it is clear how many meanings there are of the term 'affection,'
					and that all the forms of friendship carry back to the first one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1241a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.1"/>It is relative to our inquiry to consider also the subject of
					agreement of feeling and kindly feeling<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These are Solomon's versions of the terms usually
						rendered 'concord and goodwill.'</note>; for some people think
					that they are the same thing, and others that they cannot exist apart.
					Kindly feeling is neither entirely distinct from friendship nor yet
					identical with it. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.2"/> If
					friendship is divided into three modes, kindly feeling is not found in
					the friendship of utility nor in friendship for pleasure. If A wishes
					B prosperity because he is useful, the motive of his wish would be not
					B's interest but his own, whereas it is thought that kindly feeling
					like . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps 'virtuous
						friendship' should be supplied.</note> is not for the sake of
					the person who feels it himself but for the sake of him for whom he
					feels kindly; and if kindly feeling were found in friendship for the
					pleasant, men would feel kindly even towards inanimate objects. So
					that it is clear that kindly feeling has to do with the friendship
					that is based on character. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.3"/> But it is the mark of one who feels kindly only to wish good,
					whereas it is the mark of the friend also to do the good that he
					wishes; for kindly feeling is the beginning of friendship, as every
					friend feels kindly, but not everyone who feels kindly is a friend,
					since the kindly man is only as it were making a beginning. Therefore
					kindly feeling is the beginning of friendship, but it is not
					friendship.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For it is thought that
					friends agree in feeling, and that those who agree in feeling are
					friends. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.4"/> But the
					agreement of friendship is not in regard to everything, but to things
					practicable for the parties, and the good to all that contributes to
					their association. Nor is it only agreement in thought or in
					appetition, for it is possible to think and to desire opposite
					things,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>as in the man
					lacking self-control this discord occurs; if a man agrees with another
					in purposive choice he does not necessarily agree with him in desire
					also. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.5"/> Agreement occurs in
					the case of good men—at all events when bad men purpose and
					desire the same things they harm one another. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.6"/> And it appears that agreement,
					like friendship, is not a term of single meaning, but whereas the
					primary and natural form of it is good, so that it is not possible for
					bad men to agree in this way, there is another sort of agreement shown
					even by bad men when their purpose and desire are for the same
					objects. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.7"/> But it is only
					proper for them to aim at the same objects in cases when it is
					possible for both to have the things aimed at, since if they aim at a
					thing of a kind that it is not possible for both to have, they will
					quarrel; but those who agree in mind do not quarrel.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="7.8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore agreement exists when there is the same purposive choice
					as to ruling and being ruled—not each choosing himself to
					rule but both the same one. Agreement is civic friendship. So much for
					the subject of agreement in feeling and kindly feeling.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The question is raised, why those who have conferred a benefit feel
					more affection for those who have received it than those who have
					received it feel for those who have conferred it; whereas justice
					seems to require the opposite. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.2"/> One might conceive that it occurs for reasons of
					utility and personal benefit; for benefit is owing to one party and it
					is the other party's duty to repay it. But really it is not this
					alone; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.3"/> it is also a law
					of nature—activity is a more desirable thing, <milestone unit="section" n="1241b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and there is the same relation between effect and
					activity as between the parties here: the person benefited is as it
					were the product of the benefactor. This is why even animals have the
					philoprogenitive instinct, which urges them to produce offspring and
					also to protect the offspring produced. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.4"/> And in fact fathers love their children more
					than they are loved by them (mothers more so than fathers)<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause is probably an
						interpolation in the Greek.</note> and these in their turn love
					their children more than their parents, because activity is the
					greatest good. And mothers love their children more than fathers,
					because they think that the children are more their work; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="8.5"/> for people estimate work by
					its difficulty, and in the production of a child the mother has more
					pain.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such may be our decision on
					the subject of friendship for oneself and of friendship among more
					than one.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is thought that what is just is something
					that is equal, and also that friendship is based on equality, if there
					is truth in the saying 'Amity is equality.' And all constitutions are
					some species of justice; for they are partnerships, and every
					partnership is founded on justice, so that there are as many species
					of justice and of partnership as there are of friendship, and all
					these species border on each other and have their differentia closely
					related. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.2"/> But since the
					relations of soul and body, craftsman and tool, and master and slave
					are similar,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. to one another.
						Perhaps the Greek should be amended to give 'not similar' (to
						those just mentioned).</note> between the two terms of each of
					these pairs there is no partnership;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for they are not two, but the former is one and the
					latter a part of that one, not one itself; nor is the good divisible
					between them, but that of both belongs to the one for whose sake they
					exist. For the body is the soul's tool born with it, a slave is as it
					were a member or tool of his master, a tool is a sort of inanimate
					slave.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The other partnerships are a constituent
					part of the partnerships of the state—for example that of
					the members of a brotherhood or a priesthood, or with business
					partnerships. All forms of constitution exist together in the
					household, both the correct forms and the deviations (for the same
					thing is found in constitutions as in the case of musical modes)<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 8.1342a.24">Aristot. Pol.

					relationship of man and wife aristocratic, that of brothers a
					republic, while the deviation-forms of these are tyranny, oligarchy
					and democracy; and there are therefore as many varieties of
					justice.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since there are two sorts of equality,
					numerical and proportional, there will also be various species of
					justice and of partnership and friendship. The partnership of
					democracy is based on numerical equality, and so is the friendship of
					comrades, as it is measured by the same standard; whereas the
					aristocratic partnership (which is the best) and the royal are
					proportional, for it is just for superior and inferior to have not the
					same share but proportional shares; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="9.6"/> and similarly also the friendship of father and son,
					and the same way in partnerships. <milestone unit="section" n="1242a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Specified sorts of friendship are therefore the friendship of
					relatives, that of comrades, that of partners and what is termed civic
					friendship. Really friendship of relatives has more than one species,
					one as between brothers, another as of father and son<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These two clauses look like an
						interpolation.</note>: it may be proportional, for example
					paternal friendship, or based on number, for example the friendship of
					brothers—for this is near the friendship of comrades, as in
					this also they claim privileges of seniority. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.2"/> Civic friendship on the other
					hand is constituted in the fullest degree on the principle of utility,
					for it seems to be the individual's lack of self-sufficiency that
					makes these unions permanent—since they would have been
					formed in any case merely for the sake of society. Only civic
					friendship and the deviation from it are not merely friendships but
					also partnerships on a friendly footing; the others are on a basis of
					superiority. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.3"/> The justice
					that underlies a friendship of utility is in the highest degree just,
					because this is the civic principle of justice. The coming together of
					a saw with the craft that uses it is on different lines—it
					is not for the sake of some common object, for saw and craft are like
					instrument and spirit, but for the sake of the man who employs them.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.4"/> It does indeed
					come about that even the tool itself receives attention which it
					deserves with a view to its work, since it exists for the sake of its
					work, and the essential nature of a gimlet is twofold, the more
					important half being its activity, boring.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not its <foreign lang="greek">E(/CIS</foreign>,
						its shape, hardness, etc.</note> And the body and the slave are
					in the class of tool, as has been said before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1241b.17">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1241b

					<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.5"/> Therefore to seek the proper way of
					associating with a friend is to seek for a particular kind of justice.
					In fact the whole of justice in general is in relation to a friend,
					for what is just is just for certain persons; and persons who are
					partners, and a friend is a partner, either in one's family<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. 'friend' in the sense of
						'relation.'</note> or in one's life. For man is not only a
					political but also a house-holding animal, and does not, like the
					other animals, couple occasionally and with any chance female or male,
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.6"/> but man is in a
					special way not a solitary but a gregarious animal, associating with
					the persons with whom he has a natural kinship; accordingly there
					would be partnership; and justice of a sort, even if there were no
					state. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.7"/> And a household
					is a sort of friendship—or rather the relationships of
					master and slave is that of craft and tools, and of spirit and body,
					and such relationships are not friendships or forms of justice but
					something analogous, just as health<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text is corrupt.</note> is not justice but
					analogous to it. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.8"/> But the
					friendship of man and wife is one of utility, a partnership; that of
					father and son is the same as that between god and man and between
					benefactor and beneficiary, and generally between natural ruler and
					natural subject. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.9"/> That
					between brothers is principally the friendship of comrades, as being
					on a footing of equality—<quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">For never did he make me out a bastard,</l>
						<l>But the same Zeus, my lord, was called the sire</l>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1242b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Hence in the household are first found the
					origins and springs of friendship, of political organization and of
					justice.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since there are three sorts of
					friendship, based on goodness, on utility and on pleasure, and two
					varieties of each sort (for each of them is either on a basis of
					superiority or of equality), and what is just in relation to them is
					clear from our discussions, in the variety based on superiority the
					proportionate claims are not on the same lines, but the superior party
					claims by inverse proportion—the contribution of the
					inferior to stand in the same ratio to his own as he himself stands in
					to the inferior, his attitude being that of ruler to subject;
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.11"/> or if not that,
					at all events he claims a numerically equal share (for in fact it
					happens in this way in other associations too—sometimes the
					shares are numerically equal, sometimes proportionally: if the parties
					contributed a numerically equal sum of money, they also take a share
					equal by numerical equality, if an unequal sum, a share proportionally
					equal). The inferior party on the contrary inverts the proportion, and
					makes a diagonal conjunction<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						inferior party p claims to draw a larger share of benefit B and
						to leave the smaller share b to the superior party P, the result
						of which would be p+B and P+b. The superior party P also invokes
						the principle of inverse proportion (line 7), but applies it to
						their contributions to the common cause, not to the benefits
						drawn from it: he claims to make a smaller contribution c, while
						the inferior party makes a larger one C, the result of which
						would be P-c and p-C. The proposed conjunctions are in fact both
						of them diagonal, connecting the larger person with the smaller
						thing and vice versa.</note>; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.12"/> but it would seem that in this way the superior
					comes off worse, and the friendship or partnership is a charitable
					service.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek
						should be altered to give 'friendship is a charity and not a

					proportion secured by some other means; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.13"/> and this means is honor,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>which belongs by nature to a
					ruler and god in relation to a subject. But the profit<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the advantage in the shape of
						protection, guidance, etc., that the inferior party derives from
						the friendship.</note> must be made equal to the
					honor.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Friendship on a footing of equality is civic
					friendship. Civic friendship is, it is true, based on utility, and

					Nevertheless there is present here a ruling factor and a
					ruled—not a natural ruler or a royal one, but one that rules
					in his turn, and not for the purpose of conferring benefit, as God
					rules, but in order that he may have an equal share of the benefit and
					of the burden. Therefore civic friendship aims at being on a footing
					of equality. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.16"/> But useful
					friendship is of two kinds, the merely legal and the moral. Civic

					legal friendship; but when they trust each other for repayment, it
					tends to be moral friendship, that of comrades. Hence this is the kind
					of friendship in which recriminations most occur, the reason being
					that it is contrary to nature; for friendship based on utility and
					friendship based on goodness are different, but these people wish to
					have it both ways at once—they associate together for the
					sake of utility but make it out to be a moral friendship as between
					good men, <milestone unit="section" n="1243a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and so represent it as not merely legal,
					pretending that it is a matter of trust.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For in general,
					of the three kinds of friendship, it is in useful friendship that most
					recriminations occur (for goodness is not given to recrimination, and
					pleasant friends having got and given their share break it off, but
					useful friends do not dissolve the association at once, if their
					intercourse is on comradely and not merely legal lines); <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.19"/> nevertheless the legal sort
					of useful friendship is not given to recrimination. The legal method
					of discharging the obligation is a matter of money, for that serves as
					a measure of equality; but the moral method is voluntary. Hence in
					some places there is a law prohibiting friendly associates of this
					sort from actions as to their voluntary contracts—rightly,

					in need, or saying something else of the sort as to how much it was
					worth in relation to the benefit given to the recipient and not what
					it was to himself, while the other party on the contrary speaks of how
					much it was to the donor and not bow much it was to himself.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.23"/> And at other
					times the position is reversed: the one says how little he got out of
					it, the other how much the service was worth to him—for
					instance, if by taking a risk he did the other a shilling's worth of
					benefit, the one talks about the amount of the risk and the other
					about the amount of the cash; just as in the repayment of a money
					loan, for there too the dispute turns on this—one claims to
					be repaid the value that the money had when lent,the other claims to
					repay it at the present value, unless they have put a proviso in the
					contract.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Civic friendship, then, looks
					at the agreement and to the thing, but moral friendship at the
					intention; hence the latter is more just—it is friendly
					justice. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.25"/> The cause of
					conflict is that moral friendship is nobler but friendship of utility
					more necessary; and men begin as being moral friends and friends on
					grounds of goodness, but when some private interest comes into
					collision it becomes clear that really they were different. For most
					men pursue what is fine only when they have a good margin in hand, and
					so with the finer sort of friendship too. <milestone unit="section" n="1243b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.26"/>Hence it is clear how these
					cases must be decided. If they are moral friends, we must consider if
					their intentions are equal, and nothing else must be claimed by either
					from the other; and if they are friends on the ground of utility or
					civic friends, we must consider what form of agreement would have been
					profitable for them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, altering
						the Greek, 'they agree for as long as it profits them.'</note>
					But if one says they are friends on one footing and the other on
					another, it is not honorable, when an active return is due, merely to
					make fine speeches, and similarly also in the other case<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in a moral friendship it is
						not honorable to insist on a return on a business
						footing.</note>;—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.27"/> but since they did not provide for this in the
					contract, on the ground that it was a moral friendship, somebody must
					judge, and neither party must cheat by pretending; so that each must
					be content with his luck. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.28"/> But it is clear that moral friendship is a matter of intention,
					since even if a man after having received great benefits owing to
					inability did not repay them, but only repaid as much as he was able,
					he acts honorably; for even God is content with getting sacrifices in
					accordance with our ability. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.29"/> But a seller will not be satisfied if a man says he

					partnership is measured. For how is a shoemaker to be partner with a
					farmer unless their products are equalized by proportion? <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.34"/> Therefore the measure for
					partnerships not directly reciprocal is proportion—for
					example if one party complains that he has given wisdom and the other
					says he has given the former money, what is the ratio of wisdom to
					being rich? and then, what is the amount given for each? for if one
					party has given half of the smaller amount but the other not even a
					small fraction of the larger, it is clear that the latter is cheating.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="10.35"/> But here too
					there is a dispute at the outset, if one says that they came together
					on grounds of utility and the other denies it and says it was on the
					basis of some other kind of friendship. <milestone unit="section" n="1244a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About the good friend and the friend on the basis of goodness, we
					must consider whether one ought to render useful services and
					assistance to him or to the friend who is able to make an equal
					return. This is the same problem as whether it is more one's duty to
					benefit a friend or a virtuous man. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.2"/> If a man is a friend and virtuous, perhaps<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, altering the punctuation with
						Fritsche, 'is a friend and virtuous equally.'</note> it is not
					over-difficult, provided one does not exaggerate the one factor and
					underrate the other, benefiting him greatly as friend but only
					slightly as good. But in other cases many problems arise, for
					instance, if A was a friend but is going not to be and B is going to
					be but is not now, or if A became one but is not one now and B is one
					now but was not and is going not to be. But the former problem<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See the first sentence of the
						chapter.</note> is more difficult. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.3"/> For possibly there is something in the lines
					of Euripides<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Fr. 882">Eur. Fr.

					particular ones. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.4"/>
					Perhaps, therefore, there are some services that ought to be rendered
					to the useful friend and others to the good friend: for instance, if a
					friend gives you food and necessaries you are not therefore bound to
					give him your society, and accordingly also you are not bound to
					render to the friend to whom you give your society the things that you
					do not get from him but from the useful friend; but those who by so
					doing wrongly give everything to one whom they love are
					good-for-nothing people.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>And
					the defining marks of friendship stated in the discourses all belong
					to friendship in some sense, but not to the same kind of friendship.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.5"/> It is a mark of
					the useful friend that one wishes the things good for him, and so of
					the benefactor, and in fact a friend of any sort (for this definition
					of friendship is not distinctive); of another friend, that one wishes
					his existence, of another that one wishes his society; of the friend
					on the ground of pleasure, that one shares his grief and his joy.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="11.6"/> All these defining
					marks are predicated in the case of some friendship, but none of them
					with reference to friendship as a single thing. Hence there are many
					of them, and each is thought to belong to friendship as one, though it
					does not: for instance, the desire for the friend's
					existence—for the superior friend and benefactor wishes
					existence to belong to his own work<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the beneficiary.</note>—and to him who gave one
					existence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This also means the
						beneficiary, who is the cause of the benefactor's being a
						benefactor; so the benefactor ought to repay him in kind by
						wishing his existence (as he does also for the reason that he is

					because they love things more, not the possessor of them, and are

					for he is more useful.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc. on
						account of his possessions.</note> Hence naturally he is
					annoyed, just as if they had preferred his possessions to himself as
					being inferior; and they complain, for now they look to find in him
					the good man, having previously looked for the pleasant or the useful
					man. <milestone unit="section" n="1244b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must also consider
					self-sufficiency and friendship, and the interrelationship of their
					potentialities. For one may raise the question whether if a person be
					self-sufficing in every respect he will have a friend, or whether on
					the contrary a friend is sought for in need, and the good man will be
					most self-sufficing. If the life that is combined with goodness is
					happy, what need would there be of a friend? For it does not belong to
					the self-sufficing man to need either useful friends or friends to
					amuse him and society, for he is sufficient society for himself.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.2"/> This is most
					manifest in the case of God; for it is clear that as he needs nothing
					more he will not need a friend, and that supposing he has no need of
					one he will not have one. Consequently the happiest human being also
					will very little need a friend, except in so far as to be
					self-sufficing is impossible. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.3"/> Of necessity, therefore, he who lives the best life
					will have fewest friends, and they will constantly become fewer, and
					he will not be eager to have friends but will think lightly not only
					of useful friends but also of those desirable for society. But
					assuredly even his case would seem to show that a friend is not for
					the sake of utility or benefit but that one loved on account of
					goodness is the only real friend. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.4"/> For when we are not in need of something, then we all
					seek people to share our enjoyments, and beneficiaries rather than
					benefactors;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and we
					can judge them better when we are self-sufficing than when in need,
					and we most need friends who are worthy of our society.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But about this question we must consider whether perhaps, although
					the view stated is partly sound, in part the truth escapes us because
					of the comparison.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. of man with
						God, l. 8 above; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1245b.13">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1245b
							13</bibl>.</note> The matter is clear if we ascertain what life
					in the active sense and as an End is. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.6"/> It is manifest that life is perception and
					knowledge, and that consequently social life is perception and
					knowledge in common. But perception and knowledge themselves are the
					thing most desirable for each individually (and it is owing to this
					that the appetition for life is implanted by nature in all, for living
					must be deemed a mode of knowing). <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.7"/> If therefore one were to abstract and posit absolute
					knowledge and its negation (though this, it is true, is obscure in the
					argument as we have written it, but it may be observed in experience),
					there would be no difference between absolute knowledge and another
					person's knowing instead of oneself; but that is like another person's
					living instead of oneself, whereas perceiving and knowing oneself is
					reasonably more desirable. For two things must be taken into
					consideration together, that life is desirable and that good is
					desirable, and as a consequence that it is desirable for ourselves to
					possess a nature of that quality.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">TOIAU/THN</foreign>= <foreign lang="greek">A)GAQH/N</foreign>.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1245a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.8"/>If, therefore, of the pair of corresponding series<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g. the Pythagorean pair of
						series, One, Good, etc. opposed to Many, Bad, etc. (Solomon).
						'The Determined' (opposed to 'the Indeterminate') belonged to
						the 'desirable' series.</note> of this kind one is always in the
					class of the desirable, and the known and the perceived are generally
					speaking constituted by their participation in the 'determined'
					nature, so that to wish to perceive oneself is to wish oneself to be
					of a certain character,—since, then, we are not each of
					these things in ourselves but only by participating in these faculties
					in the process of perceiving or knowing (for when perceiving one
					becomes perceived by means of what one previously perceives,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. perception of something
						outside oneself causes consciousness of self.</note> in the
					manner and in the respect in which one perceives it, and when knowing
					one becomes known)—hence owing to this one wishes always to
					live because one wishes always to know; and this is because one wishes
					to be oneself the object known. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.9"/> To choose to live in the society of others might,
					therefore, from a certain point of view seem foolish (first in the
					case of the things common to the other animals also, for instance
					eating together or drinking together, for what difference does it make
					whether these things take place when we are near together or apart, if
					you take away speech? but even to share in speech that is merely
					casual is a thing indifferent, and also neither to impart nor to
					receive information is possible for friends who are self-sufficing,
					since receiving information implies a deficiency in oneself and
					imparting it a deficiency in one's friend, and likeness is
					friendship)—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.10"/> but nevertheless it surely seems that we all find it
					pleasanter to share good things with our friends,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>as far as these fall to each,
					and the best that each can—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.11"/> but among these, it falls to one to share
					bodily pleasure, to another artistic study, to another
					philosophy—; and so it is pleasanter to be with one's friend
					(whence the saying 'Distant friends a burden are'<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This proverb looks like a quotation, being half a
						line of verse.</note>), so that they must not be separated when
					this is taking place. Hence also love seems to resemble friendship,
					for the lover is eager to share the life of the loved one, although
					not in the most proper way but in a sensuous manner.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Therefore the argument in raising the question asserts the former
					position,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1244b.2">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1244b 2ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1245a.27">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1245a 27</bibl>.</note> but the facts
					of experience are obviously on the latter lines, so that it is clear
					that the raiser of the question in a way misleads us. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.13"/> We must therefore examine
					the truth from the following consideration: 'friend' really denotes,
					in the language of the proverb,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Quoted elsewhere in the same connection, but one may conjecture
						that the phrase originally meant 'as strong as
						Hercules.'</note>'another Hercules'—another self; but the
					characteristics are scattered, and it is difficult for all to be
					realized in the case of one person; though by nature a friend is what
					is most akin, yet one resembles his friend in body and another in
					spirit, and one in one part of the body or spirit, another in another.
					But still none the less a friend really means as it were a separate
					self. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.14"/> To perceive and
					to know a friend, therefore, is necessarily in a manner to perceive
					and in a manner to know oneself. Consequently to share even vulgar
					pleasures and ordinary life with a friend is naturally pleasant (for
					it always involves our simultaneously perceiving the friend), but more
					so to share the more divine pleasures; the reason of which is that it
					is always more pleasant to behold oneself enjoying the superior good,
					<milestone unit="section" n="1245b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and this is sometimes a passive, sometimes an
					active experience, sometimes something else. But if it is pleasant to
					live well oneself and for one's friend also to live well, and if
					living together involves working together, surely their partnership
					will be pre-eminently in things included in the End. Hence we should
					study together, and feast together—not on the pleasures of
					food and the necessary pleasures (for such partnerships do not seem to
					be real social intercourse but mere enjoyment), <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.15"/> but each really wishes to
					share with his friends the End that he is capable of attaining, or
					failing this, men choose most of all to benefit their friends and to
					be benefited by them. It is therefore manifest that to live together
					is actually a duty, and that all people wish it very much, and that
					this is most the case with the man that is the happiest and best. But
					that the contrary appeared to be the conclusion of the argument<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1244b.2">Aristot. Eud. Eth.
						1244b 2ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1245a.27">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1245a.27</bibl>.</note> was also reasonable, the statement being true.
					For the solution is on the line of the comparison,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. of man with God, <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1244b.7">Aristot. Eud.
						Eth. 1244b 7</bibl>.</note> the correspondence being true;
					for the fact that God is not of such a nature as to need a friend
					postulates that man, who is like God, also does not need one.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.16"/> Yet according to
					this argument the virtuous man will not think of anything; for God's
					perfection does not permit of this, but he is too perfect to think of
					anything else beside himself. And the reason is that for us well-being
					has reference to something other than ourselves, but in his case he is
					himself his own well-being.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.17"/> As to seeking
					for ourselves and praying for many friends, and at the same time
					saying that one who has many friends has no friend, both statements
					are correct. For if it is possible to live with and share the
					perceptions of many at once, it is most desirable for them to be the
					largest possible number; but as that is very difficult, active
					community of perception must of necessity be in a smaller circle,
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.18"/> so that it is not
					only difficult to acquire many friends (for probation is needed), but
					also to use them when one has got them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>One for whom we feel affection we sometimes wish to prosper in
					absence from us, but sometimes to share the same experiences. And to
					wish to be together is a mark of friendship, for if it is possible to
					be together and to prosper all choose this; but if it is not possible
					to prosper together, then we choose as the mother of Heracles perhaps
					would have chosen for her son, to be a god rather than to be with her
					but in service to Eurystheus. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.19"/> For men would say things like the jest which the
					Spartan made when somebody told him to invoke the Dioscuri in a
					storm.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">He doubtless said that
						being in trouble himself he did not wish to involve the Dioscuri
						in it (Solomon).</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It seems
					to be characteristic of one who feels affection for another to debar
					him from sharing his troubles, and of the person for whom affection is
					felt to wish to share them. Both these things happen reasonably; for
					to a friend nothing ought to give so much pain as his friend gives
					pleasure, yet it is felt that he ought not to choose his own interest.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.20"/> Hence people
					hinder their friends from sharing their sorrows; they are content to
					be in trouble by themselves, <milestone unit="section" n="1246a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>in order that they
					may not appear from selfish considerations actually to choose the joy
					of their friend's grief and furthermore to find it a relief not to
					bear their misfortunes alone. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.21"/> And as both well-being and companionship are
					desirable, it is clear that companionship combined with even a lesser
					good is in a way more desirable than separation with a greater good.
					But as it is not clear how much value companionship has, at this point
					men differ, and some think it is friendly to share everything in
					company, and say, for instance, that it is pleasanter to dine with
					company though having the same food; others wish to share only in
					well-being, because, they say, if one supposes extreme cases, people
					experiencing great adversity in company or great prosperity separately
					are on a par. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.22"/> And it is
					much the same as this in regard to misfortunes also; sometimes we wish
					our friends to be absent, and do not want to give them pain when their
					presence is not going to do any good, but at other times for them to
					be present is most pleasant. And the reason of this contrariety is
					very easily explained; it comes about because of the things stated
					before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1245b.26">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1245b 26-1246a 2</bibl>.</note> and
					because to behold a friend in pain or in a bad state is a thing we
					absolutely shun, as we shun it in our own case, but to see a friend is
					as pleasant as anything can be, for the reason stated,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1245a.26">Aristot. Eud. Eth.
						1245a 26-b 9</bibl>.</note> and indeed to see him ill if
					one is ill oneself; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="12.23"/> so
					that whichever of these is more pleasant, it sways the balance of
					wishing him to be present or not.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>And it fits in that the former occurs in the case of
					inferior people, and for the same reason; they are most eager for
					their friends not to prosper and not to be absent if they themselves
					have to suffer adversity. Hence sometimes suicides kill those whom
					they love with themselves, as they think that they feel their own
					misfortune more if their loved ones are to survive<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the Greek this clause is left to be
						understood.</note>; just as, if a man in trouble had the memory

					one makes ignorant mistakes from knowledge; but if this is impossible,
					it is clear that the virtues cannot be branches of knowledge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="1246b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And also if it is not possible from knowledge
					to be ignorant, but only to make mistakes and do the same things as
					one does from ignorance, a man will assuredly never act from justice
					in the same way as he will act from injustice. But since wisdom is
					knowledge and a form of truth, wisdom also will produce the same
					effect as knowledge, that is, it would be possible from wisdom to act
					unwisely and to make the same mistakes as the unwise man does; but if
					the use of anything <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> itself were
					single,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As in 1 above it was
						shown not to be.</note> when so acting men would be acting
					wisely. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.4"/> In the case of
					the other forms of knowledge, therefore, another higher form causes
					their diversion; but what knowledge causes the diversion of the
					actually highest of all? Obviously there is no longer any knowledge or
					any mind to do it. But moreover goodness does not cause it either; for
					wisdom makes use of goodness, since the goodness of the ruling part
					uses that of the ruled. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.5"/>
					Who then is there in whom this occurs? or is it in the same way as the
					vice of the irrational part of the spirit is termed lack of control,
					and the uncontrolled man is in a manner
					profligate—possessing reason, but ultimately if his appetite
					is powerful it will turn him round, and he will draw the opposite
					inference? Or is it manifest that also if there is goodness in the
					irrational part but folly in the reason, goodness and folly are
					transformed in another way? so that it will be possible to use justice
					unjustly and badly, and wisdom unwisely; and therefore the opposite
					uses also will be possible.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For it is strange if whereas when wickedness at any time arises in
					the irrational part it will pervert the goodness in the rational and
					cause it to be ignorant, yet goodness in the irrational part when
					there is folly in the rational should not convert the folly and make
					it form wise and proper judgements, and again wisdom in the rational
					part should not make profligacy in the irrational act
					temperately—which seems to be what self-control essentially
					is. So that there will actually be wise action arising from folly.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.6"/> But these
					consequences are absurd, especially that of using wisdom wisely as a
					result of folly; for that is a thing which we certainly do not see in
					other cases—for instance profligacy perverts one's medical
					knowledge or scholarship, but it does not pervert one's ignorance if
					it be opposed to it, because it does not contain superiority, but
					rather it is goodness in general that stands in this relation to
					badness; for example, the just man is capable of all that the unjust
					man is, and in general inability is contained in ability. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="1.7"/> So that it is clear that men
					are wise and good simultaneously, and that the states of character
					above described belong to a different person, and the Socratic dictum
					'Nothing is mightier than wisdom,' is right. But in that by 'wisdom'
					he meant 'knowledge,' he was wrong; for wisdom is a form of goodness,
					and is not scientific knowledge but another kind of
					cognition.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But wisdom is not the only thing which
					acting in accordance with goodness causes welfare, <milestone unit="section" n="1247a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but we also speak of the fortunate as faring well, which
					implies that good fortune also engenders welfare in the same way as
					knowledge does; we must therefore consider whether one man is
					fortunate and another unfortunate by nature or not, and how it stands
					with these matters. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.2"/> For
					that some men are fortunate we see, since many though foolish succeed
					in things in which luck is paramount, and some even in things which
					involve skill although also containing a large element of
					luck—for example strategy and navigation. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.3"/> Are, then, these men fortunate
					as a result of a certain state of character, or are they enabled to
					achieve fortunate results not by reason of a certain quality in
					themselves? As it is, people think the latter, holding that some men
					are successful by natural causes; but nature makes men of a certain
					quality, and the fortunate and unfortunate are different even from
					birth, in the same way as some men are blue-eyed and others black-eyed
					because a particular part of them is of a particular quality.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.4"/> For it is clear
					that they do not succeed by means of wisdom, because wisdom is not
					irrational but can give reason why it acts as it does, whereas they
					could not say why they succeed—for that would be science;
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.5"/> and moreover it is
					manifest that they succeed in spite of being unwise—not
					unwise about other matters (for that would not be anything strange,
					for example Hippocrates<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A
						Pythagorean philosopher of <placeName key="perseus,Chios City">Chios</placeName>, fl. <date value="-460">460</date>
						B.C.</note> was skilled in geometry but was thought to be stupid and
					unwise in other matters, and it is said that on a voyage owing to
					foolishness he lost a great deal of money,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>taken from him by the collectors of the
					two-per-cent duty at <placeName key="tgn,7002473">Byzantium</placeName>), but even though they are unwise about the
					matters in which they are fortunate. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.6"/> For in navigation it is not the cleverest who
					are fortunate, but (just as in throwing dice one man throws a blank
					and another a six) a man is fortunate according as things were
					arranged by nature.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, with
						Jackson's
						emendations, 'another a six according as nature determines, so
						here a man is lucky because his nature is such.'</note> Or is it
					because he is loved by God, as the phrase goes, and because success is
					something from outside? as for instance a badly built ship often gets
					through a voyage better, though not owing to itself, but because it
					has a good man at the helm. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.7"/> But on this showing the fortunate man has the deity as steersman.
					But it is strange that a god or deity should love a man of this sort,
					and not the best and most prudent. If, then, the success of the lucky
					must necessarily be due to either nature or intellect or some
					guardianship, and of these three causes two are ruled out, those who
					are fortunate will be so by nature. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.8"/> But again, nature of course is the cause of a thing
					that happens either always or generally in the same way, whereas
					fortune is the opposite. If, then, unexpected achievement seems a
					matter of fortune, but, if a man is fortunate owing to fortune, it
					would seem that the cause is not of such a sort as to produce the same
					result always or generally—<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.9"/> further, if a man's succeeding or not
					succeeding is due to his being of a certain sort, as a man does not
					see clearly because he has blue eyes, not fortune but nature is the
					cause; therefore he is not a man who has good fortune but one who has
					as it were a good nature. Hence we should have to say that the people
					we call fortunate are so not by reason of fortune; therefore they are
					not fortunate, <milestone unit="section" n="1247b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for the fortunate are those for
					whom good fortune is a cause of good things.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But if so, shall we say that there is no such thing as
					fortune at all, or that it does exist but is not a cause? No, it must
					both exist and be a cause. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.10"/> Consequently it will furthermore be a cause of goods or evils to
					certain persons; whereas if fortune is to be eliminated altogether,
					then nothing must be said to come about from fortune, in spite of the
					fact that, although there is another cause, because we do not see it
					we say that fortune is a cause—owing to which people give it
					as a definition of fortune that it is a cause incalculable to human
					reasoning, implying that it is a real natural principle. This, then,
					would be a matter for another inquiry. But since we see that some
					people have good fortune on one occasion, why should they not succeed
					a second time too owing to the same cause? and a third time? and a
					fourth? for the same cause produces the same effect. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.11"/> Therefore this will not be a
					matter of fortune; but when the same result follows from indeterminate
					and in definite antecedents, it will be good or bad for somebody, but
					there will not be the knowledge of it that comes by experience, since,
					if there were, some fortunate persons would learn it, or indeed all
					branches of knowledge would, as Socrates said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 279d">Plat. Euthyd. 279d</bibl>.</note> be
					forms of good fortune. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.12"/>
					What, then, prevents such things from happening to somebody a number
					of times running not because he has a certain character, but in the
					way in which for instance it would be possible to make the highest
					throw at dice every time? And what then? are there not some impulses
					in the spirit that arise from reasoning and others from irrational
					appetition? and are not the latter prior?<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>because if the impulse caused by desire for
					what is pleasant exists by nature, appetition also would merely by
					nature proceed towards what is good in every case. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.13"/> If, therefore, some men have
					good natures—just as musical people though they have not
					learnt to sing<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, with
						Jackson's additions, 'just
						as untaught musical geniuses, without professional knowledge of
						singing.'</note> have a natural aptitude for it—and
					without the aid of reason have an impulse in the direction of the
					natural order of things and desire the right thing in the right way at
					the right time, these men will succeed even although they are in fact
					foolish and irrational, just as the others will sing well although
					unable to teach singing. And men of this sort obviously are
					fortunate—men who without the aid of reason are usually
					successful. Hence it will follow that the fortunate are so by
					nature.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Or has the term 'good fortune' more than one
					meaning? For some things are done from impulse and as a result of the
					agents' purposive choice, other things not so but on the contrary; and
					if in the former cases when the agents succeed they seem to have
					reasoned badly, we say that in fact they have had good fortune; and
					again in the latter cases, if they wished for a different good or less
					good than they have got. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.15"/>
					The former persons then may possibly owe their good fortune to nature,
					for their impulse and appetition, being for the right object,
					succeeded, but their reasoning was foolish; and in their case, when it
					happens that their reasoning seems to be incorrect but that impulse is
					the cause of it, this impulse being right has saved them; although
					sometimes on the contrary owing to appetite they have reasoned in this
					way and come to misfortune. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.16"/> But in the case of the others,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 8.1247b.30">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1247b
						30</bibl><foreign lang="greek">TA\ D'
							OU)/</foreign>(
						Solomon).</note> then, how will good fortune be due
					to natural goodness of appetition and desire? <milestone unit="section" n="1248a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>The fact is that the good fortune here and that in the
					other case are the same. Or is good fortune of more than one kind, and
					is fortune twofold? <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.17"/> But
					since we see some people being fortunate contrary to all the teachings
					of science and correct calculation, it is clear that the cause of good
					fortune must be something different. But is it or is it not good
					fortune whereby a man formed a desire for the right thing and at the
					right time when in his case human reasoning could not make this
					calculation? For a thing the desire for which is natural is not
					altogether uncalculated, but the reasoning is perverted by something.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.18"/> So no doubt he
					seems fortunate, because fortune is the cause of things contrary to
					reason, and this is contrary to reason, for it is contrary to
					knowledge and to general principle. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.19"/> But probably it does not really come from fortune,
					but seems to do so from the above cause. So that this argument does
					not prove that good fortune comes by nature, but that not all those
					who seem fortunate succeed because of fortune, but because of nature;
					nor does it prove that there is no such thing as fortune, nor that
					fortune is not the cause of anything, but that it is not the cause of
					all the things of which it seems to be the cause.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yet someone may raise the question whether fortune is the cause of
					precisely this—forming a desire for the right thing at the
					right time. Or, on that showing, will not fortune be the cause of
					everything—even of thought and deliberation? since it is not
					the case, that one only deliberates when one has deliberated even
					previously to that deliberation,<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>nor does one only think when one has previously thought
					before thinking, and so on to infinity, but there is some
					starting-point; therefore thought is not the starting-point of
					thinking, nor deliberation of deliberating. Then what else is, save
					fortune? It will follow that everything originates from fortune. Or
					shall we say that there is a certain starting-point outside which
					there is no other, and that this, merely owing to its being of such
					and such a nature, can produce a result of such and such a nature?
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.21"/> But this is what
					we are investigating—what is the starting-point of motion in
					the spirit? The answer then is clear: as in the universe, so there,
					everything is moved by God; for in a manner the divine element in us
					is the cause of all our motions. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.22"/> And the starting-point of reason is not reason but
					something superior to reason. What, then, could be superior even to
					knowledge and to intellect, except God? Not goodness, for goodness is
					an instrument of the mind; and owing to this, as I was saying some
					time ago,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot.       Eud. Eth. 8.1247b.26">Aristot.
						Eud. Eth. 1247b 26</bibl>.</note> those are called
					fortunate who although irrational succeed in whatever they start on.
					And it does not pay them to deliberate, for they have within them a
					principle of a kind that is better than mind and deliberation
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.23"/> (whereas the
					others have reason but have not this): they have inspiration, but they
					cannot deliberate. For although irrational they attain even what
					belongs to the prudent and wise—swiftness of divination:
					only the divination that is based on reason we must not specify, but
					some of them attain it by experience and others by practice in the use
					of observation; and these men use the divine.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Ms. reading gives 'and experience and habit
						use God.'</note> For this quality discerns aright the future as
					well as the present, and these are the men whose reason is
					disengaged.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, with
						Jackson's text,
						'But some of them by experience and others by habituation have
						this capacity of consulting God in examining things, and of
						discerning aright both the future and the present; and those
						also have it whose reason is disengaged in the manner
						described.'</note> This is why the melancholic even have dreams
					that are true; for it seems that when the reason is disengaged
					principle has more strength— <milestone unit="section" n="1248b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>just as the
					blind remember better, being released from having their faculty of
					memory engaged with objects of sight.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Jackson
						(with some hints from the Latin version) emends to give 'just as
						blind men, who are released from attention to visibles, remember
						better than others, because the faculty of memory is thus more
						earnestly addressed to what has been said.'</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="2.24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is clear, then, that there are two kinds of good
					fortune—one divine, owing to which the fortunate man's
					success is thought to be due to the aid of God, and this is the man
					who is successful in accordance with his impulse, while the other is
					he who succeeds against his impulse. Both persons are irrational. The
					former kind is more continuous good fortune, the latter is not
					continuous.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have, then, previously
					spoken about each virtue in particular; and as we have distinguished
					their meaning separately, we must also describe in detail the virtue
					constituted from them, to which we now give the name<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Ms. reading gives, 'we were
						already giving the name,' but if that is correct, the passage
						referred to has been lost.</note> of nobility.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">*KALOKA)GAQI/A</foreign>, like 'nobility', connotes both
							social status and moral excellence; so <foreign lang="greek">KALOKA)GAQO/S</foreign> may be rendered
							'gentleman.'</note><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.2"/>
					Now it is manifest that one who is to obtain this appellation truly
					must possess the particular virtues; for it is impossible for it to be
					otherwise in the case of any other matter either—for
					instance, no one is healthy in his whole body but not in any part of
					it, but all the parts, or most of them and the most important, must
					necessarily be in the same condition as the whole. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.3"/> Now being good and being noble
					are really different not only in their names but also in themselves.
					For all goods have Ends that are desirable in and for
					themselves.<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.4"/> Of these, all those are fine
					which are laudable as existing for their own sakes, for these are the
					Ends which are both the motives of laudable actions and laudable
					themselves—justice itself and its actions, and temperate
					actions, for temperance also is laudable; but health is not laudable,
					for its effect is not, nor is vigorous action laudable, for strength
					is not—these things are good but they are not laudable.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.5"/> And similarly
					induction makes this clear in the other cases also. Therefore a man is
					good for whom the things good by nature are good. For the things men
					fight about and think the greatest, honor and wealth and bodily
					excellences and pieces of good fortune and powers, are good by nature
					but may possibly be harmful to some men owing to their characters. If
					a man is foolish or unjust or profligate he would gain no profit by
					employing them, any more than an invalid would benefit from using the
					diet of a man in good health, or a weakling and cripple from the
					equipment of a healthy man and of a sound one. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.6"/> A man is noble because he
					possesses those good things that are fine for their own sake and
					because he is a doer of fine deeds even for their own sake; and the
					fine things are the virtues and the actions that arise from
					virtue.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But there is also a state of character that
					is the 'civic' character, such as the Spartans have or others like
					them may have; and this character is of the following sort. There are
					those who think that one ought, it is true, to possess goodness, but
					for the sake of the things that are naturally good; <milestone unit="section" n="1249a"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>hence though they are good men (for the things naturally
					good are good for them), yet they have not nobility, for it is not the
					case with them that they possess fine things for their own sake and
					that they purpose fine actions, and not only this, but also that
					things not fine by nature but good by nature are fine for them.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.8"/> For things are fine
					when that for which men do them and choose them is fine. Therefore to
					the noble man the things good by nature are fine; for what is just is
					fine, and what is according to worth is just, and he is worthy of
					these things; <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.9"/> and what is
					befitting is fine, and these things befit him—wealth, birth,
					power. Hence for the noble man the same things are both advantageous
					and fine; but for the multitude these things do not coincide, for
					things absolutely good are not also good for them, whereas they are
					good for the good man; and to the noble man they are also fine, for he
					performs many fine actions because of them. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.10"/> But he who thinks that one
					ought to possess the virtues for the sake of external goods does fine
					things only by accident. Nobility then is perfect goodness.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have also spoken about the nature of pleasure and the manner in
					which it is a good, and have said that things pleasant absolutely are
					also fine and that things good absolutely are also pleasant. Pleasure
					does not occur except in action;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>on this account the truly happy man will also live most
					pleasantly, and it is not without reason that people demand
					this.<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But since a doctor has a certain standard by
					referring to which he judges the healthy body and the goods unhealthy,
					and in relation to which each thing up to a certain point ought to be
					done and is wholesome, but if less is done, or more, it ceases to be
					wholesome, so in regard to actions and choices of things good by
					nature but not laudable a virtuous man ought to have a certain
					standard both of character and of choice and avoidance; <milestone unit="section" n="1249b"/><milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and also in regard to large and small amount of property
					and of good fortune. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.13"/> Now
					in what preceded<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1222a.6">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1222a 6-10, b 7, 1232a
							32f.</bibl>
					</note> we stated the standard 'as reason directs'; but this is as if
					in matters of diet one were to say 'as medical science and its
					principles direct,' and this though true is not clear. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.14"/> It is proper, therefore, here
					as in other matters to live with reference to the ruling factor, and
					to the state and the activity of the ruling factor, as for example
					slave must live with reference to the rule of master, and each person
					with reference to the rule appropriate to each. <milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.15"/> And since man consists by
					nature of a ruling part and a subject part, and each would properly
					live with reference to the ruling principle within him (and this is
					twofold, for medical science is a ruling principle in one way and
					health is in another, and the former is a means to the latter), this
					is therefore the case in regard to the faculty of contemplation. For
					God is not a ruler in the sense of issuing commands, but is the End as
					a means to which wisdom gives commands (and the term 'End' has two
					meanings, but these have been distinguished elsewhere<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">End or 'final cause' (<foreign lang="greek">OU(= E(/NEKA</foreign>) denotes (1) the
						person or thing for whose good something is done, (2) the
						purpose for which it is done. God is the Final Cause in the
						latter sense: cf <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 194a.32">Aristot. Phys. 194a 32-36</bibl>,
						<bibl n="Aristot. de An. 415b.2">Aristot. De anima 415b
							2</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1072b.2">Aristot. Met. 1072b 2</bibl>
						(Solomon).</note>); since clearly God is in need of nothing.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.16"/> Therefore whatever
					mode of choosing and of acquiring things good by
					nature—whether goods of body or wealth or friends or the
					other goods—will best promote the contemplation of God, that
					is the best mode, and that standard is the finest;<milestone unit="line" ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and any mode of choice and
					acquisition that either through deficiency or excess hinders us from
					serving and from contemplating God—that is a bad one.
					<milestone unit="Loeb chap" ed="P" n="3.17"/> This is how it is
					for the spirit, and this is the best spiritual standard—to
					be as far as possible unconscious of the irrational part of the
					spirit, as such.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let this, then, be our
					statement of what is the standard of nobility and what is the aim of
					things absolutely good.</p>
