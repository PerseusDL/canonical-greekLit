<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="1">
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone n="980a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="21" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>All men naturally desire knowledge. An indication of this is our esteem for the senses; for apart from their use we esteem them for their own sake, and most of all the sense of sight. Not only with a view to action, but even when no action is contemplated, we prefer sight, generally speaking, to all the other senses.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="2">
<p>The reason of this is that of all the senses sight best helps us to know things, and reveals many distinctions.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now animals are by nature born with the power of sensation, and from this some acquire the faculty of memory, whereas others do not. <milestone n="980b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="21" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>Accordingly the former are more intelligent and capable of learning than those which cannot remember.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="3">
<p>Such as cannot hear sounds (as the bee, and any other similar type of creature) are intelligent, but cannot learn; those only are capable of learning which possess this sense in addition to the faculty of memory.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Thus the other animals live by impressions and memories, and have but a small share of experience; but the human race lives also by art and reasoning.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="4">
<p>It is from memory that men acquire experience, because the numerous memories of the same thing eventually produce the effect of a single experience. <milestone n="981a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>Experience seems very similar to science and art, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="5">
<p>but actually it is through experience that men acquire science and art; for as Polus rightly says, <q rend="double">experience produces art, but inexperience chance.</q> <note resp="Tredennick"><bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 448c">Plat. Gorgias 448c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">Plat. Gorg. 462b-c</bibl>.</note> Art is produced when from many notions of experience a single universal judgement is formed with regard to like objects.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="6">
<p>To have a judgement that when Callias was suffering from this or that disease this or that benefited him, and similarly with Socrates and various other individuals, is a matter of experience; but to judge that it benefits all persons of a certain type, considered as a class, who suffer from this or that disease (e.g. the phlegmatic or bilious when suffering from burning fever) is a matter of art.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="7">
<p rend="align(indent)">It would seem that for practical purposes experience is in no way inferior to art; indeed we see men of experience succeeding more than those who have theory without experience.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="8">
<p>The reason of this is a that experience is knowledge of particulars, but art of universals; and actions and the effects produced are all concerned with the particular. For it is not man that the physician cures, except incidentally, but Callias or Socrates or some other person similarly named, who is incidentally a man as well.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="9">
<p><milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>So if a man has theory without experience, and knows the universal, but does not know the particular contained in it, he will often fail in his treatment; for it is the particular that must be treated.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="10">
<p>Nevertheless we consider that knowledge and proficiency belong to art rather than to experience, and we assume that artists are wiser than men of mere experience (which implies that in all cases wisdom depends rather upon knowledge); </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="11">
<p>and this is because the former know the cause, whereas the latter do not. For the experienced know the fact, but not the wherefore; but the artists know the wherefore and the cause. For the same reason we consider that the master craftsmen in every profession are more estimable and know more and are wiser than the artisans, <milestone n="981b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they know the reasons of the things which are done; but we think that the artisans, like certain inanimate objects, do things, but without knowing what they are doing (as, for instance, fire burns); </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="12">
<p>only whereas inanimate objects perform all their actions in virtue of a certain natural quality, artisans perform theirs through habit. Thus the master craftsmen are superior in wisdom, not because they can do things, but because they possess a theory and know the causes.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In general the sign of knowledge or ignorance is the ability to teach, and for this reason we hold that art rather than experience is scientific knowledge; for the artists can teach, but the others cannot.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="13">
<p>Further, we do not consider any of the senses to be Wisdom. They are indeed our chief sources of knowledge about particulars, but they do not tell us the reason for anything, as for example why fire is hot, but only that it <emph>is</emph> hot.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="14">
<p rend="align(indent)">It is therefore probable that at first the inventor of any art which went further than the ordinary sensations was admired by his fellow-men, not merely because some of his inventions were useful, but as being a wise and superior person.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="15">
<p>And as more and more arts were discovered, some relating to the necessities and some to the pastimes of life, the inventors of the latter were always considered wiser than those of the former, <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="16">
<p>Hence when all the discoveries of this kind were fully developed, the sciences which relate neither to pleasure nor yet to the necessities of life were invented, and first in those places where men had leisure. Thus the mathematical sciences originated in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, because there the priestly class was allowed leisure.<note resp="Tredennick">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 274">Plat. Phaedrus 274</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 2.109">Hdt. 2.109</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="17">
<p rend="align(indent)">The difference between art and science and the other kindred mental activities has been stated in the<title>Ethics</title><note resp="Tredennick"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1139b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 6.1139b 14-1141b 8</bibl>.</note>; the reason for our present discussion is that it is generally assumed that what is called Wisdom<note resp="Tredennick">i.e. Metaphysics.</note> is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive. <milestone n="982a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus it is clear that Wisdom is knowledge of certain principles and causes.</p></div></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="1">
<p rend="align(indent)">Since we are investigating this kind of knowledge, we must consider what these causes and principles are whose knowledge is Wisdom. Perhaps it will be clearer if we take the opinions which we hold about the wise man.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="2">
<p>We consider first, then, that the wise man knows all things, so far as it is possible, without having knowledge of every one of them individually; next, that the wise man is he who can comprehend difficult things, such as are not easy for human comprehension (for sense-perception, being common to all, is easy, and has nothing to do with Wisdom); and further that in every branch of knowledge a man is wiser in proportion as he is more accurately informed and better able to expound the causes.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="3">
<p>Again among the sciences we consider that that science which is desirable in itself and for the sake of knowledge is more nearly Wisdom than that which is desirable for its results, and that the superior is more nearly Wisdom than the subsidiary; for the wise man should give orders, not receive them; nor should he obey others, but the less wise should obey him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="4">
<p rend="align(indent)">Such in kind <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in number are the opinions which we hold with regard to Wisdom and the wise. Of the qualities there described the knowledge of everything must necessarily belong to him who in the highest degree possesses knowledge of the universal, because he knows in a sense all the particulars which it comprises. These things, viz. the most universal, are perhaps the hardest for man to grasp, because they are furthest removed from the senses.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="5">
<p>Again, the most exact of the sciences are those which are most concerned with the first principles; for those which are based on fewer principles are more exact than those which include additional principles; e.g., arithmetic is more exact than geometry.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="6">
<p>Moreover, the science which investigates causes is more instructive than one which does not, for it is those who tell us the causes of any particular thing who instruct us. Moreover, knowledge and understanding which are desirable for their own sake are most attainable in the knowledge of that which is most knowable. For the man who desires knowledge for its own sake will most desire the most perfect knowledge, <milestone n="982b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this is the knowledge of the most knowable, and the things which are most knowable are first principles and causes; for it is through these and from these that other things come to be known, and not these through the particulars which fall under them.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="7">
<p>And that science is supreme, and superior to the subsidiary, which knows for what end each action is to be done; i.e. the Good in each particular case, and in general the highest Good in the whole of nature.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="8">
<p rend="align(indent)">Thus as a result of all the above considerations the term which we are investigating falls under the same science, which must speculate about first principles and causes; for the Good, i.e. the <emph>end</emph> , is one of the causes.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">That it is not a productive science is clear from a consideration of the first philosophers.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="9">
<p>It is through wonder that men now begin and originally began to philosophize; wondering in the first place at obvious perplexities, and then by gradual progression raising questions about the greater matters too, e.g. about the changes of the moon and of the sun, about the stars and about the origin of the universe.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="10">
<p>Now he who wonders and is perplexed feels that he is ignorant (thus the myth-lover is in a sense a philosopher, since myths are composed of wonders); <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>therefore if it was to escape ignorance that men studied philosophy, it is obvious that they pursued science for the sake of knowledge, and not for any practical utility.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="11">
<p>The actual course of events bears witness to this; for speculation of this kind began with a view to recreation and pastime, at a time when practically all the necessities of life were already supplied. Clearly then it is for no extrinsic advantage that we seek this knowledge; for just as we call a man independent who exists for himself and not for another, so we call this the only independent science, since it alone exists for itself.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="12">
<p rend="align(indent)">For this reason its acquisition might justly be supposed to be beyond human power, since in many respects human nature is servile; in which case, as Simonides<note resp="Tredennick"><bibl n="Sim. Fr. 3">Simon. Fr. 3 (Hiller)</bibl>.</note> says, <q rend="double">God alone can have this privilege,</q> and man should only seek the knowledge which is within his reach.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="13">
<p>Indeed if the poets are right and the Deity is by nature jealous, <milestone n="983a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is probable that in this case He would be particularly jealous, and all those who excel in knowledge unfortunate. But it is impossible for the Deity to be jealous (indeed, as the proverb<note resp="Tredennick">Cf. <bibl n="Sol. Fr. 26">Solon, Fr. 26 (Hiller)</bibl>; Leutsch and Schneidwin, <title>Paroemiographi</title>, 1.371.</note> says, <q rend="double">poets tell many a lie</q>), nor must we suppose that any other form of knowledge is more precious than this; for what is most divine is most precious.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="14">
<p>Now there are two ways only in which it can be divine. A science is divine if it is peculiarly the possession of God, or if it is concerned with divine matters. And this science alone fulfils both these conditions; for (a) all believe that God is one of the causes and a kind of principle, and (b) God is the sole or chief possessor of this sort of knowledge. Accordingly, although all other sciences are more necessary than this, none is more excellent.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="15">
<p rend="align(indent)">The acquisition of this knowledge, however, must in a sense result in something which is the reverse of the outlook with which we first approached the inquiry. All begin, as we have said, by wondering that things should be as they are, e.g. with regard to marionettes, or the solstices, or the incommensurability<note resp="Tredennick">i.e. the fact that the diagonal of a square cannot be rationally expressed in terms of the side.</note> of the diagonal of a square; because it seems wonderful to everyone who has not yet perceived the cause that a thing should not be measurable by the smallest unit.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="16">
<p>But we must end with the contrary and (according to the proverb)<note resp="Tredennick" >i.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δευτέρον ἀμεινόνων</foreign>(<q rend="double">second thoughts are better</q>). Leutsch and Schneidwin 1.62.</note> the better view, as men do even in these cases when they understand them; <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>for a geometrician would wonder at nothing so much as if the diagonal were to become measurable.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Thus we have stated what is the nature of the science which we are seeking, and what is the object which our search and our whole investigation must attain.</p> </div></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="1">
<p rend="align(indent)">It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the primary causes, because it is when we think that we understand its primary cause that we claim to know each particular thing. Now there are four recognized kinds of cause. Of these we hold that one is the essence or essential nature of the thing (since the <q rend="double">reason why</q> of a thing is ultimately reducible to its formula, and the ultimate <q rend="double">reason why</q> is a cause and principle); another is the matter or substrate; the third is the source of motion; and the fourth is the cause which is opposite to this, namely the purpose or <q rend="double">good</q>; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="2">
<p>for this is the end of every generative or motive process. We have investigated these sufficiently in the <title>Physics</title><note resp="Tredennick"><bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 194b.16">Phys. 2.3</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 198a.14">Phys. 2.7</bibl></note>; <milestone n="983b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>however, let us avail ourselves of the evidence of those who have before us approached the investigation of reality and philosophized about Truth. For clearly they too recognize certain principles and causes, and so it will be of some assistance to our present inquiry if we study their teaching; because we shall either discover some other kind of cause, or have more confidence in those which we have just described.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg025.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="3">
<p rend="align(indent)">Most of the earliest philosophers conceived only of material principles as underlying all things. That of which all things consist, from which they first come and into which on their destruction they are ultimately resolved, of which the essence persists although modified by its affections—this, they say, is an element and principle of existing things. Hence they believe that nothing is either generated or destroyed, since this kind of primary entity always persists. Similarly we do not say that Socrates comes into being <emph>absolutely</emph> when he becomes handsome or cultured, nor that he is destroyed when he loses these qualities; because the substrate, Socrates himself, persists.</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">But since in the other categories too there are compounds with substance (because there is a substrate for each category, e.g. quality, quantity, time, place and motion), we must inquire whether there is a formula of the essence of each one of them; whether these compounds, e.g. <q rend="double">white man,</q> also have an essence.</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">First, the substance of an individual is the substance which is peculiar to it and belongs to nothing else; whereas the universal is common; for by universal we mean that which by nature appertains to several things.</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Again, substance means that which is not predicated of a subject, whereas the universal is always predicated of some subject.</p>

<p rend="align(indent)">Every rational potency admits equally of contrary results, but irrational potencies admit of one result only.

<p>Therefore such sciences must treat of contraries—essentially of the one, and non-essentially of the other; for the rational account also applies essentially to the one, but to the other in a kind of accidental way, since it is by negation and removal that it throws light on the contrary.

<p>And since contrary attributes cannot be induced in the same subject, and science is a potency which depends upon the possession of a rational formula, and the soul contains a principle of motion, it follows that whereas <q rend="double">the salutary</q> can only produce health, and <q rend="double">the calefactory</q> only heat, and <q rend="double">the frigorific</q> only cold, <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>the scientific man can produce both contrary results.</p></div>

In this sense its actualization is conterminous with the process of building, and is incomplete (sect.11), and should not be described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντελέχεια</foreign> or <q rend="double">complete reality.</q> But Aristotle often uses this term as synonymous with the vaguer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>.</note> motion.</p></div>
