					<milestone n="980a" unit="section"/><milestone n="21" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All men naturally desire
					knowledge. An indication of this is our esteem for the senses; for apart from their use we
					esteem them for their own sake, and most of all the sense of sight. Not only with a view
					to action, but even when no action is contemplated, we prefer sight, generally speaking,
					to all the other senses. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason of this is
					that of all the senses sight best helps us to know things, and reveals many
						distinctions. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now animals are by nature born with the
					power of sensation, and from this some acquire the faculty of memory, whereas others do
					not. <milestone n="980b" unit="section"/><milestone n="21" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>Accordingly the former are more intelligent and capable of learning than those which
					cannot remember. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such as cannot hear sounds (as
					the bee, and any other similar type of creature) are intelligent, but cannot learn; those
					only are capable of learning which possess this sense in addition to the faculty of
						memory. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus the other animals live by impressions and
					memories, and have but a small share of experience; but the human race lives also by art
					and reasoning. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is from memory that men
					acquire experience, because the numerous memories of the same thing eventually produce the
					effect of a single experience. <milestone n="981a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Experience seems very similar to science and art, <milestone
						n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but actually it is through experience that men acquire
					science and art; for as Polus rightly says, "experience produces art, but inexperience
						chance."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 448c">Plat. Gorgias
							448c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">Plat. Gorg. 462b-c</bibl>.</note> Art is
					produced when from many notions of experience a single universal judgement is formed with
					regard to like objects. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To have a judgement
					that when Callias was suffering from this or that disease this or that benefited him, and
					similarly with Socrates and various other individuals, is a matter of experience; but to
					judge that it benefits all persons of a certain type, considered as a class, who suffer
					from this or that disease (e.g. the phlegmatic or bilious when suffering from burning
					fever) is a matter of art. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It would seem that for practical purposes experience is in no way
					inferior to art; indeed we see men of experience succeeding more than those who have
					theory without experience. <milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason of this
					is a that experience is knowledge of particulars, but art of universals; and actions and
					the effects produced are all concerned with the particular. For it is not man that the
					physician cures, except incidentally, but Callias or Socrates or some other person
					similarly named, who is incidentally a man as well. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/><milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So if a man has theory without
					experience, and knows the universal, but does not know the particular contained in it, he
					will often fail in his treatment; for it is the particular that must be treated. <milestone
						n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nevertheless we consider that knowledge and
					proficiency belong to art rather than to experience, and we assume that artists are wiser
					than men of mere experience (which implies that in all cases wisdom depends rather upon
						knowledge); <milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and this is because the former
					know the cause, whereas the latter do not. For the experienced know the fact, but not the
					wherefore; but the artists know the wherefore and the cause. For the same reason we
					consider that the master craftsmen in every profession are more estimable and know more
					and are wiser than the artisans, <milestone n="981b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they know the reasons of the things which are done; but
					we think that the artisans, like certain inanimate objects, do things, but without knowing
					what they are doing (as, for instance, fire burns); <milestone n="1.12" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>only whereas inanimate objects perform all their actions in virtue of
					a certain natural quality, artisans perform theirs through habit. Thus the master
					craftsmen are superior in wisdom, not because they can do things, but because they possess
					a theory and know the causes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In general the sign of
					knowledge or ignorance is the ability to teach, and for this reason we hold that art
					rather than experience is scientific knowledge; for the artists can teach, but the others
						cannot. <milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, we do not consider any of
					the senses to be Wisdom. They are indeed our chief sources of knowledge about particulars,
					but they do not tell us the reason for anything, as for example why fire is hot, but only
					that it <emph>is</emph> hot. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.14" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is therefore probable that at first the inventor of any art which
					went further than the ordinary sensations was admired by his fellow-men, not merely
					because some of his inventions were useful, but as being a wise and superior
						person. <milestone n="1.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And as more and more arts were
					discovered, some relating to the necessities and some to the pastimes of life, the
					inventors of the latter were always considered wiser than those of the former, <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because their branches of knowledge did not aim at
						utility. <milestone n="1.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence when all the discoveries of
					this kind were fully developed, the sciences which relate neither to pleasure nor yet to
					the necessities of life were invented, and first in those places where men had leisure.
					Thus the mathematical sciences originated in the neighborhood of <placeName
						key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, because there the priestly class was allowed
						leisure.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 274">Plat.
							Phaedrus 274</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 2.109">Hdt. 2.109</bibl>.</note> <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="1.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The difference between art and
					science and the other kindred mental activities has been stated in
						the<title>Ethics</title><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Aristot. Nic. Eth.        1139b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 6.1139b 14-1141b
						8</bibl>.</note>; the reason for our present discussion is that it is generally assumed
					that what is called Wisdom<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. Metaphysics.</note>
					is concerned with the primary causes and principles, so that, as has been already stated,
					the man of experience is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of
					sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman than the artisan;
					and the speculative sciences to be more learned than the productive. <milestone n="982a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus it is clear that Wisdom
					is knowledge of certain principles and causes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone
						n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since we are investigating this kind of knowledge, we
					must consider what these causes and principles are whose knowledge is Wisdom. Perhaps it
					will be clearer if we take the opinions which we hold about the wise man. <milestone
						n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We consider first, then, that the wise man knows all
					things, so far as it is possible, without having knowledge of every one of them
					individually; next, that the wise man is he who can comprehend difficult things, such as
					are not easy for human comprehension (for sense-perception, being common to all, is easy,
					and has nothing to do with Wisdom); and further that in every branch of knowledge a man is
					wiser in proportion as he is more accurately informed and better able to expound the
						causes. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again among the sciences we consider
					that that science which is desirable in itself and for the sake of knowledge is more
					nearly Wisdom than that which is desirable for its results, and that the superior is more
					nearly Wisdom than the subsidiary; for the wise man should give orders, not receive them;
					nor should he obey others, but the less wise should obey him. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such in kind <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>and in number are the opinions which we hold with regard to Wisdom and the
					wise. Of the qualities there described the knowledge of everything must necessarily belong
					to him who in the highest degree possesses knowledge of the universal, because he knows in
					a sense all the particulars which it comprises. These things, viz. the most universal, are
					perhaps the hardest for man to grasp, because they are furthest removed from the
						senses. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the most exact of the sciences
					are those which are most concerned with the first principles; for those which are based on
					fewer principles are more exact than those which include additional principles; e.g.,
					arithmetic is more exact than geometry. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Moreover, the science which investigates causes is more instructive than one which does
					not, for it is those who tell us the causes of any particular thing who instruct us.
					Moreover, knowledge and understanding which are desirable for their own sake are most
					attainable in the knowledge of that which is most knowable. For the man who desires
					knowledge for its own sake will most desire the most perfect knowledge, <milestone
						n="982b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this is the
					knowledge of the most knowable, and the things which are most knowable are first
					principles and causes; for it is through these and from these that other things come to be
					known, and not these through the particulars which fall under them. <milestone n="2.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And that science is supreme, and superior to the subsidiary,
					which knows for what end each action is to be done; i.e. the Good in each particular case,
					and in general the highest Good in the whole of nature. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus as a result of all the above
					considerations the term which we are investigating falls under the same science, which
					must speculate about first principles and causes; for the Good, i.e. the <emph>end</emph>
					, is one of the causes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That it is not a productive science
					is clear from a consideration of the first philosophers. <milestone n="2.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is through wonder that men now begin and originally began to
					philosophize; wondering in the first place at obvious perplexities, and then by gradual
					progression raising questions about the greater matters too, e.g. about the changes of the
					moon and of the sun, about the stars and about the origin of the universe. <milestone
						n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now he who wonders and is perplexed feels that he is
					ignorant (thus the myth-lover is in a sense a philosopher, since myths are composed of
						wonders); <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>therefore if it was to escape
					ignorance that men studied philosophy, it is obvious that they pursued science for the
					sake of knowledge, and not for any practical utility. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The actual course of events bears witness to this; for speculation of
					this kind began with a view to recreation and pastime, at a time when practically all the
					necessities of life were already supplied. Clearly then it is for no extrinsic advantage
					that we seek this knowledge; for just as we call a man independent who exists for himself
					and not for another, so we call this the only independent science, since it alone exists
					for itself. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					this reason its acquisition might justly be supposed to be beyond human power, since in
					many respects human nature is servile; in which case, as Simonides<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><bibl n="Sim. Fr. 3">Simon. Fr. 3 (Hiller)</bibl>.</note> says, "God
					alone can have this privilege," and man should only seek the knowledge which is within his
						reach. <milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed if the poets are right and the
					Deity is by nature jealous, <milestone n="983a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is probable that in this case He would be particularly
					jealous, and all those who excel in knowledge unfortunate. But it is impossible for the
					Deity to be jealous (indeed, as the proverb<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
							<bibl n="Sol. Fr. 26">Solon, Fr. 26 (Hiller)</bibl>; Leutsch and Schneidwin,
							<title>Paroemiographi</title>, 1.371.</note> says, "poets tell many a lie"), nor must
					we suppose that any other form of knowledge is more precious than this; for what is most
					divine is most precious. <milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now there are two
					ways only in which it can be divine. A science is divine if it is peculiarly the
					possession of God, or if it is concerned with divine matters. And this science alone
					fulfils both these conditions; for (a) all believe that God is one of the causes and a
					kind of principle, and (b) God is the sole or chief possessor of this sort of knowledge.
					Accordingly, although all other sciences are more necessary than this, none is more
						excellent. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>The acquisition of this knowledge, however, must in a sense result in something which is
					the reverse of the outlook with which we first approached the inquiry. All begin, as we
					have said, by wondering that things should be as they are, e.g. with regard to
					marionettes, or the solstices, or the incommensurability<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">i.e. the fact that the diagonal of a square cannot be rationally
						expressed in terms of the side.</note> of the diagonal of a square; because it seems
					wonderful to everyone who has not yet perceived the cause that a thing should not be
					measurable by the smallest unit. <milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we must
					end with the contrary and (according to the proverb)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>i.e. <foreign lang="greek">deute/ron a)meino/nwn</foreign>("second thoughts are
						better"). Leutsch and Schneidwin 1.62.</note> the better view, as men do even in these
					cases when they understand them; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for a
					geometrician would wonder at nothing so much as if the diagonal were to become
						measurable. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus we have stated what is the nature of the
					science which we are seeking, and what is the object which our search and our whole
					investigation must attain. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the primary causes,
					because it is when we think that we understand its primary cause that we claim to know
					each particular thing. Now there are four recognized kinds of cause. Of these we hold that
					one is the essence or essential nature of the thing (since the "reason why" of a thing is
					ultimately reducible to its formula, and the ultimate "reason why" is a cause and
					principle); another is the matter or substrate; the third is the source of motion; and the
					fourth is the cause which is opposite to this, namely the purpose or "good"; <milestone
						n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for this is the end of every generative or motive
					process. We have investigated these sufficiently in the <title>Physics</title><note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 194b.16">Phys. 2.3</bibl>, <bibl
							n="Aristot. Ph. 198a.14">Phys. 2.7</bibl></note>; <milestone n="983b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>however, let us avail ourselves of the
					evidence of those who have before us approached the investigation of reality and
					philosophized about Truth. For clearly they too recognize certain principles and causes,
					and so it will be of some assistance to our present inquiry if we study their teaching;
					because we shall either discover some other kind of cause, or have more confidence in
					those which we have just described. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Most of the earliest philosophers conceived only of material
					principles as underlying all things. That of which all things consist, from which they
					first come and into which on their destruction they are ultimately resolved, of which the
					essence persists although modified by its affections—this, they say, is an element
					and principle of existing things. Hence they believe that nothing is either generated or
					destroyed, since this kind of primary entity always persists. Similarly we do not say that
					Socrates comes into being <emph>absolutely</emph> when he becomes handsome or cultured,
					nor that he is destroyed when he loses these qualities; because the substrate, Socrates
					himself, persists. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same way nothing else
					is generated or destroyed; for there is some one entity (or more than one) which always
					persists and from which all other things are generated. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>All are not agreed, however, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>as to the number and character of these principles. Thales,<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Thales of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, fl. <date
							value="-585">585</date> B.C.</note> the founder of this school of philosophy,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">That of the Ionian monists, who sought a single
						material principle of everything.</note> says the permanent entity is water (which is
					why he also propounded that the earth floats on water). Presumably he derived this
					assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything is moist, and that heat itself is
					generated from moisture and depends upon it for its existence (and that from which a thing
					is generated is always its first principle). He derived his assumption, then, from this;
					and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist nature, whereas water is
					the first principle of the nature of moist things. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are some<note resp="Tredennick"

					men of very ancient times, long before the present era, who first speculated about the
					gods, also held this same opinion about the primary entity. For they<note

						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="3.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Whether this view of the primary entity is really ancient and
					time-honored may perhaps be considered uncertain; however, it is said that this was
					Thales' opinion concerning the first cause. (I say nothing of Hippo,<note

					matter, as do some physicists, but give a different explanation; for the physicists assume
					motion also, at any rate when explaining the generation of the universe; but these
					thinkers hold that it is immovable. Nevertheless thus much is pertinent to our present
						inquiry. <milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It appears that Parmenides

					with rather more insight. For holding as he does that Not-being, as contrasted with Being,
					is nothing, he necessarily supposes that Being is one and that there is nothing else (we

					them assume one and others more than one corporeal principle, but both parties agree in

						unit="Loeb chap"/>In treating the One as a substance instead of a predicate of some

						<emph>source of motion</emph> (for they hold that they are rather the cause of

					tend they do in a way treat as a cause, but not in this sense, i.e. not in the sense in
					which it is naturally a cause. Those who speak of Mind or Love assume these causes as
					being something good; but nevertheless they do not profess that anything exists or is

					those who hold that Unity or Being is an entity of this kind state that it is the cause of

					that in a sense they both assert and deny that the Good is a cause; for they treat it as
					such not absolutely, but incidentally. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It
					appears, then, that all these thinkers too (being unable to arrive at any other cause)
					testify that we have classified the causes rightly, as regards both number and nature.
					Further, it is clear that all the principles must be sought either along these lines or in
					some similar way. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>Let us next examine the possible difficulties arising out of the statements of each of
					these thinkers, and out of his attitude to the first principles. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All those who regard the
					universe as a unity, and assume as its matter some one nature, and that corporeal and
					extended, are clearly mistaken in many respects. They only assume elements of corporeal
					things, and not of incorporeal ones, which also exist. They attempt to state the causes of
					generation and destruction, and investigate the nature of everything; and at the same time
					do away with the cause of motion. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then there is
					their failure to regard the <emph>essence</emph> or formula as a cause of anything; and
					further their readiness to call any one of the simple bodies—except earth—a
					first principle, without inquiring how their reciprocal generation is effected. I refer to
					fire, water, earth and air. Of these some are generated from each other by combination and
					others by differentiation; <milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and this difference
					is of the greatest importance in deciding their relative priority. In one way it might
					seem that the most elementary body is that from which first other bodies are produced by
					combination; <milestone n="989a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>and this will be that body which is rarest and composed of the finest
						particles. <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all who posit Fire as first
					principle will be in the closest agreement with this theory. However, even among the other
					thinkers everyone agrees that the primary corporeal element is of this kind. At any rate
					none of the Monists thought earth likely to be an element—obviously on account of
					the size of its particles— <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but each of
					the other three has had an advocate; for some name fire as the primary element, others
					water, and others air.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 1.983b">Aristot. Met. 3.5, 8</bibl>.</note> And yet why do they not
					suggest earth too, as common opinion does? for people say "Everything is earth." <milestone
						n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And Hesiod too says<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.984b">Aristot. Met. 4.1</bibl>.</note> that
					earth was generated first of corporeal things—so ancient and popular is the
					conception found to be. Thus according to this theory anyone who suggests any of these
					bodies other than fire, or who assumes something "denser than air but rarer than
						water,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.988a"
							>Aristot. Met. 7.3 n.</bibl></note> will be wrong. <milestone n="8.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand if what is posterior in generation is prior in
					nature, and that which is developed and combined is posterior in generation, then the
					reverse will be the case; water will be prior to air, and earth to water. So much for
					those who posit <emph>one</emph> cause such as we have described. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The same will apply too if
					anyone posits more than one, as e.g. Empedocles says that matter consists of four
						bodies; <milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>objections must occur in his case
					also, some the same as before, and some peculiar to him. First, we can see things being
					generated from each other in a way which shows that fire and earth do not persist as the
					same corporeal entity. (This subject has been treated in my works on Natural Science.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Cael. 3.7">Aristot. De Caelo,
							3.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. GC 2.6">Aristot. De Gen. et Corr. 2.6</bibl>.</note>)
					Again with regard to the cause of motion in things, whether one or two should be assumed,
					it must not be thought that his account is entirely correct or even reasonable.<note

					hold such views as these must of necessity do away with qualitative alteration; for on
					such a theory cold will not come from hot nor hot from cold, because to effect this there
					must be something which actually takes on these contrary qualities: some single element
					which becomes both fire and water—which Empedocles denies. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If one were to infer that
					Anaxagoras recognized two<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Mind, and the "mixture" of
						homoeomerous particles.</note> elements, the inference would accord closely with a view
					which, although he did not articulate it himself, he must have accepted as developed by
						others. <milestone n="8.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To say that originally everything
					was a mixture is absurd for various reasons, <milestone n="989b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but especially since (a) it follows that
					things must have existed previously in an unmixed state; (b) it is contrary to nature for
						<emph>anything</emph> to mix with <emph>anything</emph> ; (c) moreover affections and
					attributes would then be separable from their substances (because what is mixed can also
					be separated). At the same time, if one were to follow his doctrine carefully and
					interpret its meaning, perhaps it would be seen to be more up-to-date; <milestone n="8.12"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>because when nothing was yet differentiated, obviously nothing
					could be truly predicated of that substance—e.g. that it was white or black or buff
					or any other color. It must necessarily have been colorless, since otherwise it would have
					had one of these colors. <milestone n="8.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly by the same
					argument it had no taste or any other such attribute; for it cannot have had any quality
					or magnitude or individuality. Otherwise some particular form would have belonged to it;
					but this is impossible on the assumption that everything was mixed together, for then the
					form would have been already differentiated, whereas he says that everything was mixed
					together except Mind, which alone was pure and unmixed.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><bibl n="Anaxag. Fr. 12">Anaxagoras. Fr. 12
						(Diels)</bibl>.</note> <milestone n="8.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It follows from this
					that he recognizes as principles the One (which is simple and unmixed) and the Other,
					which is such as we suppose the Indeterminate to be before it is determined and partakes
					of some form. Thus his account is neither correct nor clear, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>but his meaning approximates to more recent theories and what is now more
					obviously true. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>However, these thinkers are really concerned only with the theories of generation and
					destruction and motion (for in general it is only with reference to this aspect of reality
					that they look for their principles and causes). <milestone n="8.16" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Those, however, who make their study cover the whole of reality, and
					who distinguish between sensible and non-sensible objects, clearly give their attention to
					both kinds; hence in their case we may consider at greater length what contributions,
					valuable or otherwise, they make to the inquiry which is now before us. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="8.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The so-called Pythagoreans
					employ abstruser principles and elements than the physicists. The reason is that they did
					not draw them from the sensible world; for mathematical objects, apart from those which
					are connected with astronomy, are devoid of motion. <milestone n="8.18" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Nevertheless all their discussions and investigations are concerned
					with the physical world. They account for the generation of the sensible universe,
						<milestone n="990a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					observe what happens in respect of its parts and affections and activities, and they use
					up their principles and causes in this connection, as though they agreed with the
					others—the physicists—that reality is just so much as is sensible and is
					contained in the so-called "heavens." <milestone n="8.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All the
					same, as we have said,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 1.989b">Aristot. Met. 1.8.17</bibl>.</note> the causes and principles
					which they describe are capable of application to the remoter class of realities as well,
					and indeed are better fitted to these than to their physical theories. <milestone n="8.20"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But as to how there is to be motion, if all that is premissed
					is Limit and the Unlimited, and Odd and Even, they do not even hint; nor how, without
					motion and change, there can be generation and destruction, or the activities of the
					bodies which traverse the heavens. <milestone n="8.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					further, assuming that it be granted to them or proved by them that
						<emph>magnitude</emph><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle uses the word

					composed of these factors, yet how is it to be explained that some bodies are light, and
					others have weight? For in their premisses and statements they are speaking just as much
					about sensible as about mathematical objects; and this is why they have made no mention of
					fire or earth or other similar bodies, because, I presume, they have no separate
					explanation of sensible things. <milestone n="8.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, how are
					we to understand that number and the modifications of number are the causes <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of all being and generation, both in the beginning and
					now, and at the same time that there is no other number than the number of which the
					universe is composed?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., how can number be both
						reality and the cause of reality?</note> <milestone n="8.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Because when they make out that Opinion and Opportunity are in such and such a region,
					and a little above or below them Injustice and Separation or Mixture, and when they state
					as proof of this that each of these abstractions is a number; and that also in this region
					there is already a plurality of the magnitudes composed of number, inasmuch as these

					must understand each of these abstractions to be the same number which is present in the
					sensible universe, or another kind of number?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						point seems to be this. The Pythagoreans say that Opinion is a number, 3 (or 2,

						because that region is proper to a corporeal magnitude composed of the number 3 (air was
						so composed according to Syrianus). Are we to understand, says Aristotle, that the

						/><milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, philosophy is rightly
						called <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>a knowledge of Truth. The object of
					theoretic knowledge is truth, while that of practical knowledge is action; for even when
					they are investigating <emph>how</emph> a thing is so, practical men study not the eternal
					principle but the relative and immediate application. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But we cannot know the truth apart from the cause. Now every thing
					through which a common quality is communicated to other things is itself of all those
					things in the highest degree possessed of that quality (e.g. fire is hottest, because it
					is the cause of heat in everything else); hence that also is most true which causes all
					subsequent things to be true. <milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore in
					every case the first principles of things must necessarily be true above everything
					else—since they are not merely <emph>sometimes</emph> true, nor is anything the
					cause of their existence, but they are the cause of the existence of other
					things,—and so as each thing is in respect of existence, so it is in respect of
					truth. <milestone n="994a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover,
					it is obvious that there is some first principle, and that the causes of things are not
					infinitely many either in a direct sequence or in kind. For the material generation of one
					thing from another cannot go on in an infinite progression (e.g. flesh from earth, earth
					from air, air from fire, and so on without a stop); nor can the source of motion (e.g. man
					be moved by air, air by the sun, the sun by Strife,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>Aristotle is evidently thinking of Empedocles' system.</note> with no limit to the
						series). <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same way neither can the
					Final Cause recede to infinity—walking having health for its object, and health
					happiness, and happiness something else: one thing always being done for the sake of
						another. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is just the same with the
					Formal Cause. For in the case of all intermediate terms of a series which are contained
					between a first and last term, the prior term is necessarily the cause of those which
					follow it; because if we had to say which of the three is the cause, we should say "the
					first." At any rate it is not the last term, because what comes at the end is not the
					cause of anything. Neither, again, is the intermediate term, which is only the cause of
						one <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and it makes no difference whether there
					is one intermediate term or several, nor whether they are infinite or limited in number).
					But of series which are infinite in this way, and in general of the infinite, all the
					parts are equally intermediate, down to the present moment. Thus if there is no first
					term, there is no cause at all. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand there can be no infinite progression
						downwards <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(where there is a beginning in the
					upper direction) such that from fire comes water, and from water earth, and in this way
					some other kind of thing is always being produced. There are two senses in which one thing
					"comes from" another—apart from that in which one thing is said to come
						<emph>after</emph> another, e.g. the Olympian "from"<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)k</foreign> means not only "from" but "after";
						Aristotle dismisses this latter meaning. The Isthmian fell alternatively in the same
						year as the Olympian festival; when this happened the former was held in the spring and
						the latter in the summer. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1023b">Aristot. Met.
							5.24.5.</bibl></note> the Isthmian games—either as a man comes from a child as
					it develops, or as air comes from water. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now we
					say that a man "comes from" a child in the sense that that which <emph>has</emph> become
					something comes from that which <emph>is</emph> becoming: i.e. the perfect from the
					imperfect. (For just as "becoming" is always intermediate between being and not-being, so
					is that which is becoming between what is and what is not. The learner is becoming
					informed, and that is the meaning of the statement that the informed person "comes from"
					the learner.) <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand A comes from B
					in the sense that water comes from air by the destruction of B. Hence the former class of
					process is not reversible <milestone n="994b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>(e.g. a child cannot come from a man, for the result of the process of
					becoming is not the thing which is becoming, but that which exists after the process is
					complete. So day comes from early dawn, because it is after dawn; and hence dawn does not
					come from day). But the other class is reversible. <milestone n="2.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>In both cases progression to infinity is impossible; for in the former
					the intermediate terms must have an end, and in the second the process is reversible, for
					the destruction of one member of a pair is the generation of the other. At the same time
					the first cause, being eternal, cannot be destroyed; because, since the process of
					generation is not infinite in the upper direction, that cause which first, on its
					destruction, became something else, cannot possibly be eternal.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The argument is elliptical and confused. The meaning is this: Since there
						is an upward limit, there is a first cause which is eternal, being independent of any
						other cause. Therefore this cause cannot cause other things by its destruction, in the
						manner just described.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, the Final cause of a thing is an <emph>end</emph> , and is
					such that it does not happen for the sake of some thing else, but all other things happen
					for its sake. So if there is to be a last term of this kind, the series will not be
					infinite; and if there is no such term, there will be no Final cause. Those who introduce
					infinity do not realize that they are abolishing the nature of the Good (although no one
					would attempt to do anything if he were not likely to reach some limit); <milestone
						n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>nor would there be any intelligence in the world,
					because the man who has intelligence always acts for the sake of something, and this is a
					limit, because the <emph>end</emph> is a limit. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again
					can the Formal cause be referred back to another fuller definition; <milestone n="2.11"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the prior definition is always closer, and the posterior is
					not; and where the original definition does not apply, neither does the subsequent
						one. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Further, those who hold such a view do
					away with scientific knowledge, for on this view it is impossible to know anything until
					one comes to terms which cannot be analyzed. <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Understanding, too, is impossible; for how can one conceive of things which are infinite
					in this way? It is different in the case of the line, which, although in respect of
					divisibility it never stops, yet cannot be conceived of unless we make a stop (which is
					why, in examining an infinite<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. infinitely
						divisible.</note> line, one cannot count the sections).<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">It does not follow that we can apprehend that which is infinite because

					were infinite in <emph>number</emph> it would still be impossible to acquire knowledge;
					for it is only when we have become acquainted with the causes that we assume that we know
					a thing; and we cannot, in a finite time, go completely through what is additively
						infinite. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					effect of a lecture depends upon the habits of the listener; because we expect the
					language to which we are accustomed, <milestone n="995a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and anything beyond this seems not to be on the same level, but
					somewhat strange and unintelligible on account of its unfamiliarity; for it is the
					familiar that is intelligible. The powerful effect of familiarity is clearly shown by the
					laws, in which the fanciful and puerile survivals prevail, through force of habit, against
					our recognition of them. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus some people will
					not accept the statements of a speaker unless he gives a mathematical proof; others will
					not unless he makes use of illustrations; others expect to have a poet adduced as witness.
					Again, some require exactness in everything, while others are annoyed by it, either
					because they cannot follow the reasoning or because of its pettiness; for there is
					something about exactness which seems to some people to be mean, no less in an argument
					than in a business transaction. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence one must have been already trained how to take each kind of
					argument, because it is absurd to seek simultaneously for knowledge and for the method of
					obtaining it; and neither is easy to acquire. Mathematical accuracy is not to be demanded
					in everything, but only in things which do not contain matter. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence this method is not that of natural science, because presumably
					all nature is concerned with matter. Hence we should first inquire what nature is; for in
					this way it will become clear what the objects of natural science are [and whether it

					there would be a class of healthy things apart from those which are sensible and from the

					sensible and perishable magnitudes; for then it would perish as they do. Nor, again, can
					astronomy be concerned with sensible magnitudes or with this heaven of ours; <milestone
						n="998a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.27"

						draw. Like the ruler, it is geometrically imperfect; thus they touch at more than one

						unit="Loeb chap"/>Some, however, say that these so-called Intermediates between Forms

					will be sufficient to observe the following. <milestone n="2.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>On this view it is not logical that only this should be so; in clearly it would be
					possible for the Forms also to be in sensible things; for the same argument applies to

					the Forms cannot be immovable, being present in sensible things, which move. <milestone
						n="2.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general, what is the object of assuming that

					result: there will be a heaven besides the sensible one, only not apart from it, but in
					the same place; which is still more impossible.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						problem is dealt with partly in <bibl n="Aristot.        Met. 12.1071b">Aristot. Met.

					say, not only what view we should adopt in the foregoing questions in order to arrive at
					the truth, but also in the case of the first principles (vi.) whether we should assume
					that the genera, or the simplest constituents of each particular thing, are more truly the
					elements and first principles of existing things. E.g., it is generally agreed that the
					elements and first principles of speech are those things of which, in their simplest form,
					all speech is composed; and not the common term "speech"; and in the case of geometrical
					propositions we call those the "elements"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl

					in the proofs of all or most of the rest. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Again, in the case of bodies, both those who hold that there are several elements and
					those who hold that there is one call the things of which bodies are composed and
					constituted first principles. E.g., Empedocles states that fire and water and the other
					things associated with them are the elements which are present in things and of which
					things are composed; he does not speak of them as genera of things. <milestone n="3.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover in the case of other things too, if a man wishes to
					examine their nature <milestone n="998b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>he observes, e.g., of what parts a bed consists and how they are put
					together; and then he comprehends its nature. Thus to judge from these arguments the first
					principles will not be the genera of things. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But from the
					point of view that it is through definitions that we get to know each particular thing,
					and that the genera are the first principles of definitions, the genera must also be the
					first principles of the things defined. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if
					to gain scientific knowledge of things is to gain it of the species after which things are
					named, the genera are first principles of the species. And apparently some even of
						those<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and Plato.</note> who call
					Unity or Being or the Great and Small elements of things treat them as genera. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again is it possible to speak of the first principles in both
						senses. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The formula of substance is one; but
					the definition by genera will be different from that which tells us of what
						<emph>parts</emph> a thing is composed. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, assuming
					that the genera are first principles in the truest sense, are we to consider the
						<emph>primary</emph> genera to be first principles, or the final terms predicated of
					individuals? This question too involves some dispute. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For if universals are always more truly first principles, clearly the
					answer will be "the highest genera," since these are predicated of everything. Then there
					will be as many first principles of things <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as
					there are primary genera, and so both Unity and Being will be first principles and
					substances, since they are in the highest degree predicated of all things. <milestone
						n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is impossible for either Unity or Being to be
					one genus of existing things. For there must <emph>be</emph> differentiae of each genus,
					and each differentia must be <emph>one</emph><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.,
						each differentia must have Being and Unity predicated of it.</note>; but it is
					impossible either for the species of the genus to be predicated of the specific
					differentiae, or for the genus to be predicated without its species.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reasons are given in <bibl
							n="Aristot. Top. 144a.36">Aristot. Topica, 144a 36-b11</bibl>.</note> Hence if Unity
					or Being is a genus, there will be no differentia Being or Unity. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But if they are not genera, neither will they be first principles,
					assuming that it is the genera that are first principles. And further, the intermediate
					terms, taken together with the differentiae, will be genera, down to the individuals; but
					in point of fact, although some are thought to be such, others are not. Moreover the
					differentiae are more truly principles than are the genera; and if they also are
					principles, we get an almost infinite number of principles, especially if one makes the
					ultimate genus a principle. <milestone n="999a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, if Unity is really more of the nature of a principle, and
					the indivisible is a unity, and every thing indivisible is such either in quantity or in
					kind, and the indivisible in kind is prior to the divisible, and the genera are divisible
					into species, then it is rather the lowest predicate that will be a unity (for "man" is
					not the genus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. but the species.</note> of
					individual men). <milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, in the case of
					things which admit of priority and posteriority, that which is predicated of the things
					cannot exist apart from them. E.g., if 2 is the first number, there will be no Number
					apart from the species of number; and similarly there will be no Figure apart from the
					species of figures. But if the genera do not exist apart from the species in these cases,
					they will scarcely do so in others; because it is assumed that genera are most likely to
					exist in these cases. <milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In individuals, however,
					there is no priority and posteriority. Further, where there is a question of better or
					worse, the better is always prior; so there will be no genus in these cases
						either. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From these considerations it seems that it is the
					terms predicated of individuals, rather than the genera, that are the first principles.
					But again on the other hand it is not easy to say in what sense we are to understand these
					to be principles; <milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the first principle and
					cause must be apart from the things of which it is a principle, and must be able to exist
					when separated from them. But why should we assume that such a thing exists <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>alongside of the individual, except in that it is
					predicated universally and of all the terms? And indeed if this is a sufficient reason, it
					is the more universal concepts that should rather be considered to be principles; and so
					the primary genera will be the principles.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For

					our knowledge of all things only in so far as they contain something universal, some one
					and identical characteristic. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if this is

					anything be eternal or immovable, since sensible things are all perishable and in
						motion. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, if nothing is eternal, even
					generation is impossible; for there must be something which becomes something, i.e. out of
					which something is generated, and of this series the ultimate term must be ungenerated;
					that is if there is any end to the series and generation cannot take place out of
						nothing. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, if there is generation and
					motion, there must be limit too. For (a) no motion is infinite, but every one has an end;

					will exist at all. But if this is impossible, there must be something, the shape or form,
					apart from the concrete whole. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P"

					they are numerically one, and each of the principles is one, and not, as in the case of

					is consistent: he does not represent some things to be perishable and others imperishable,
					but makes everything <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>perishable except the
					elements. But the difficulty now being stated is why some things are perishable and others
					not, assuming that they are derived from the same principles. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
					/>The foregoing remarks may suffice to show that the principles cannot be the
						same. <milestone n="4.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If however they are different, one
					difficulty is whether they too are to be regarded as imperishable or as perishable. For if
					they are perishable, it is clearly necessary that they too must be derived from something
					else, since everything passes upon dissolution into that from which it is derived. Hence
					it follows that there are other principles prior to the first principles; <milestone
						n="4.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but this is impossible, whether the series stops or
					proceeds to infinity. And further, how can perishable things exist if their principles are
					abolished? On the other hand if the principles are imperishable, why should some
					imperishable principles produce perishable things, and others imperishable things? This is
					not reasonable; either it is impossible or it requires much explanation. <milestone
						n="4.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, no one has so much as attempted to maintain
					different principles; they maintain the same principles for everything. <milestone

						unit="Loeb chap"/>But the hardest question of all to investigate and also the most
					important with a view to the discovery of the truth, is whether after all Being and Unity
					are substances of existing things, and each of them is nothing else than Being and Unity
					respectively, or whether we should inquire what exactly Being and Unity are, there being
					some other nature underlying them. <milestone n="4.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some take
					the former, others the latter view of the nature of Being and Unity. Plato and the
					Pythagoreans hold that neither Being nor Unity is anything else than itself, and that this
					is their nature, their essence being simply Being and Unity. <milestone n="4.26" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But the physicists, e.g. Empedocles, explain what Unity is by reducing
					it to something, as it were, more intelligible—or it would seem that by Love
					Empedocles means Unity; at any rate Love is the cause of Unity in all things. Others
					identify fire and others air with this Unity and Being of which things consist and from
					which they have been generated. <milestone n="4.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those who
					posit more numerous elements also hold the same view; for they too must identify Unity and
					Being with all the principles which they recognize. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>And it follows that unless one assumes Unity and Being to be substance in
					some sense, no other universal term can be substance; for Unity and Being are the most
					universal of all terms, <milestone n="4.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if there is no
					absolute Unity or absolute Being, no other concept can well exist apart from the so-called
					particulars. Further, if Unity is not substance, clearly number cannot be a separate
					characteristic of things; for number is units, and the unit is simply a particular kind of
						one. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the
					other hand, if there is absolute Unity and Being, their substance must be Unity and Being;
					for no other term is predicated universally of Unity and Being, but only these terms
					themselves. Again, if there is to be absolute Being and absolute Unity, it is very hard to
					see how there can be anything else besides these; I mean, how things can be more than
						one. <milestone n="4.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For that which is other than what is,
					is not; and so by Parmenides' argument<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">By <foreign
							lang="greek">to\ o)/n</foreign> Parmenides meant "what is," i.e. the real universe,
						which he proved to be one thing because anything else must be "what is not," or

						distinction.</note> it must follow that all things are one, i.e. Being. <milestone
						n="1001b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In either case there
					is a difficulty; for whether Unity is not a substance or whether there is absolute Unity,
					number cannot be a substance. <milestone n="4.31" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It has already
					been stated why this is so if Unity is not a substance; and if it is, there is the same
					difficulty as about Being. For whence, if not from the absolute One or Unity, can there be
					another one? It must be not-one; but all things are either one, or many of which each is
					one. Further, if absolute Unity is indivisible, by Zeno's axiom it will be
						nothing. <milestone n="4.32" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For that which neither when added
					makes a thing greater nor when subtracted makes it smaller is not an existent thing, he
						says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Zeno Eleat. Fr. 2">Zeno, Fr.
							2</bibl>, and see Burnet, E.G.P. sects. 157 ff.</note>; clearly assuming that what
					exists is spatial magnitude. And if it is a spatial magnitude it is corporeal, since the
					corporeal exists in all dimensions, whereas the other magnitudes, the plane or line, when
					added to a thing in one way will increase it, but when added in another will not; and the
					point or unit will not increase a thing in any way whatever. <milestone n="4.33" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But since Zeno's view is unsound, and it is possible for a thing to be
					indivisible in such a way that it can be defended even against his argument (for such a
						thing<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">e.g., a point is indivisible and has no
						magnitude, yet added to other points it increases their number.</note> when added will
					increase a thing in number though not in size)—still how can a
						<emph>magnitude</emph> be composed of one or more such indivisible things? It is like
					saying that the line is composed of points. <milestone n="4.34" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Moreover, even if one supposes the case to be <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"

					which is not one, we must none the less inquire why and how it is that the thing generated

					question whether numbers, bodies, planes and points are substances or not. If not, the
					question of what Being is, what the substances of things are, baffles us; for
					modifications and motions and relations and dispositions and ratios do not seem to
					indicate the substance of anything; they are all predicated of a substrate, and none of
					them is a definite thing. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for those things
					which might be especially supposed to indicate substance—water, earth, fire and air,
					of which composite bodies are composed— <milestone n="1002a" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>their heat and cold and the like are
					modifications, not substances; and it is only the body which undergoes these modifications
					that persists as something real and a kind of substance. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the body is less truly substance than the plane, and the plane
					than the line, and the line than the unit or point; for it is by these that the body is
					defined, and it seems that they are possible without the body, but that the body cannot
					exist without them. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is why the vulgar and
					the earlier thinkers supposed that substance and Being are Body, and everything else the
					modifications of Body; and hence also that the first principles of bodies are the first
					principles of existing things; whereas later thinkers with a greater reputation for wisdom
					supposed that substance and Being are numbers. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone
						n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As we have said, then, if these things are not
					substance, there is no substance or Being at all; for the attributes of these things
					surely have no right to be called existent things. On the other hand, if it be agreed that
					lines and points are more truly substance than bodies are, yet unless we can see to what
						<emph>kind</emph> of bodies they belong (for they cannot be in sensible bodies) there
					will still be no substance. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, it is
					apparent that all these lines are divisions of Body, either in breadth <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or in depth or in length. Moreover every kind of shape is
					equally present in a solid, so that if "Hermes is not in the stone,"<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Apparently a proverbial expression.</note> neither is
					the half-cube in the cube as a determinate shape. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence neither is the plane; for if any kind of plane were in it, so
					would that plane be which defines the half-cube. The same argument applies to the line and
					to the point or unit. Hence however true it may be that body is substance, if planes,
					lines and points are more truly substance than Body is, and these are not substance in any
					sense, the question of what Being is and what is the substance of things baffles
						us. <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Because, in addition to the above
					arguments, absurd results follow from a consideration of generation and destruction; for
					it seems that if substance, not having existed before, now exists, or having existed
					before, subsequently does not exist it suffers these changes in the process of generation
					and destruction. But points, lines and planes, although they exist at one time and at
					another do not, cannot be in process of being either generated or destroyed; <milestone
						n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for whenever bodies are joined or divided, <milestone
						n="1002b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>at one time, when
					they are joined one surface is instantaneously produced, and at another, when they are
					divided, two. Thus when the bodies are combined the surface does not exist but has
					perished; and when they are divided, surfaces exist which did not exist before. (The
					indivisible point is of course never divided into two.) And if they <emph>are</emph>
					generated and destroyed, from what are they generated? <milestone n="5.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is very much the same with "the present moment" in time. This too
					cannot be generated and destroyed; but nevertheless it seems always to be different, not

					argument is the same; they are all similarly either limits or divisions.<note

					Hence if these principles were investigated by those also who investigated the elements of

					that we too must grasp the first causes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1"

					some things are said to "be" because they are substances; others because they are
					modifications of substance; others because they are a process towards substance, or
					destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of

					substance. (Hence we even say that not-being <emph>is</emph> not-being.) <milestone n="2.4"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And so, just as there is one science of all healthy things, so
					it is true of everything else. For it is not only in the case of terms which express one

					if Being and Unity are the same, i.e. a single nature, in the sense that they are
					associated as principle and cause are, and not as being denoted by the same definition
					(although it makes no difference but rather helps our argument if we understand them in

					"existent man" and "man" are the same thing, i.e. the duplication in the statement "he is

					humanity and existence are not dissociated in respect of either coming to be or ceasing to
					be), and similarly in the case of the term "one," so that obviously the additional term in
					these phrases has the same significance, and Unity is nothing distinct from
						Being; <milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and further if the substance of each
					thing is one in no accidental sense, and similarly is of its very nature something which
					is—then there are just as many species of Being as of Unity. And to study the

					/>Now since it is the province of one science to study opposites, and the opposite of
					unity is plurality, and it is the province of one science to study the negation and
					privation of Unity, because in both cases we are studying Unity, to which the negation (or
					privation) refers, stated either in the simple form that Unity is not present, or in the
					form that it is not present in a particular class; in the latter case Unity is modified by
					the differentia, apart from the content of the negation (for the negation of Unity is its
					absence); but in privation there is a substrate of which the privation is
						predicated.— <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The opposite of Unity,
					then, is Plurality; and so the opposites of the above-mentioned concepts—Otherness,
					Dissimilarity, Inequality and everything else which is derived from these or from
					Plurality or Unity— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>fall under the
					cognizance of the aforesaid science. And one of them is Oppositeness; for this is a form
					of Difference, and Difference is a form of Otherness. <milestone n="2.13" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence since the term "one" is used in various senses, so too will
					these terms be used; yet it pertains to one science to take cognizance of them all. For
					terms fall under different sciences, not if they are used in various senses, but if their
					definitions are neither identical nor referable to a common notion. <milestone n="2.14"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since everything is referred to that which is primary, e.g.
					all things which are called "one" are referred to the primary "One," we must admit that
					this is also true of Identity and Otherness and the Contraries. Thus we must first
					distinguish all the senses in which each term is used, and then attribute them to the
					primary in the case of each predicate, and see how they are related to it; for some will
					derive their name from possessing and others from producing it, and others for similar

					because the substance, of which they have no real knowledge, is prior. For just as number
						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> number has its peculiar modifications, e.g. oddness and
					evenness, commensurability and equality, excess and defect, and these things are inherent
					in numbers both considered independently and in relation to other numbers; and as
					similarly other peculiar modifications are inherent in the solid and the immovable and the
					moving and the weightless and that which has weight; so Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					Being has certain peculiar modifications, and it is about these that it is the
					philosopher's function to discover the truth. And here is evidence of this fact. <milestone
						n="2.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Dialecticians and sophists wear the same appearance as
					the philosopher, for sophistry is Wisdom in appearance only, and dialecticians discuss all
						subjects, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and Being is a subject common to
					them all; but clearly they discuss these concepts because they appertain to
						philosophy. <milestone n="2.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For sophistry and dialectic are
					concerned with the same class of subjects as philosophy, but philosophy differs from the
					former in the nature of its capability and from the latter in its outlook on life.
					Dialectic treats as an exercise what philosophy tries to understand, and sophistry seems
					to be philosophy; but is not. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.21" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, the second column of contraries is privative, and everything
					is reducible to Being and Not being, and Unity and Plurality; e.g. Rest falls under Unity
					and Motion under Plurality. And nearly everyone agrees that substance and existing things
					are composed of contraries; at any rate all speak of the first principles as
						contraries— <milestone n="2.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>some as Odd and Even,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans.</note> some as Hot and Cold,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Perhaps Parmenides.</note> some as Limit and
						Unlimited,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Platonists.</note> some as Love and
						Strife.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Empedocles.</note> And it is apparent that
					all other things also are reducible to Unity and Plurality (we may assume this reduction);
						<milestone n="1005a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the
					principles adduced by other thinkers fall entirely under these as genera. <milestone
						n="2.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear, then, from these considerations also,
					that it pertains to a single science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; for
					all things are either contraries or derived from contraries, and the first principles of
					the contraries are Unity and Plurality. And these belong to one science, whether they have
					reference to one common notion or not. Probably the truth is that they have not; but
					nevertheless even if the term "one" is used in various senses, the others will be related
					to the primary sense (and similarly with the contraries)— <milestone n="2.24" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>even if Being or Unity is not a universal and the same in all cases,
					or is not separable from particulars (as it presumably is not; the unity is in some cases
					one of reference and in others one of succession). For this very reason it is not the
					function of the geometrician to inquire what is Contrariety or Completeness or Being or
					Unity or Identity or Otherness, but to proceed from the assumption of them. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly, then, it
					pertains to one science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, and the
					attributes inherent in it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; and the same science
					investigates, besides the concepts mentioned above, Priority and Posteriority, Genus and
					Species, Whole and Part, and all other such concepts. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must pronounce whether it pertains to
					the same science <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to study both the so-called
					axioms in mathematics and substance, or to different sciences. It is obvious that the
					investigation of these axioms too pertains to one science, namely the science of the
					philosopher; for they apply to all existing things, and not to a particular class separate
					and distinct from the rest. Moreover all thinkers employ them—because they are
					axioms of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, and every genus possesses
						Being— <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but employ them only in so far
					as their purposes require; i.e., so far as the genus extends about which they are carrying
					out their proofs. Hence since these axioms apply to all things <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					Being (for this is what is common to them), it is the function of him who studies Being
						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being to investigate them as well. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For this reason no one who is pursuing a particular
					inquiry—neither a geometrician nor an arithmetician—attempts to state whether
					they are true or false; but some of the physicists did so, quite naturally; for they alone
					professed to investigate nature as a whole, and Being. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But inasmuch as there is a more ultimate type of thinker than the
					natural philosopher (for nature is only a genus of Being), the investigation of these
					axioms too will belong to the universal thinker who studies the primary reality.
						<milestone n="1005b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Natural
					philosophy is a kind of Wisdom, but not the primary kind. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>As for the attempts of some of those who discuss how the truth should
					be received, they are due to lack of training in logic; for they should understand these
					things before they approach their task, and not investigate while they are still
						learning. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly then it is the function of
					the philosopher, i.e. the student of the whole of reality in its essential nature, to
					investigate also the principles of syllogistic reasoning. And it is proper for him who
					best understands each class of subject to be able to state the most certain principles of
					that subject; so that he who understands the modes of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					Being should be able to state the most certain principles of all things. <milestone n="3.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now this person is the philosopher, and the most certain
					principle of all is that about which one cannot be mistaken; for such a principle must be
					both the most familiar (for it is about the unfamiliar that errors are always made), and
					not based on hypothesis. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the principle
					which the student of any form of Being must grasp is no hypothesis; and that which a man
					must know if he knows anything he must bring with him to his task. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>Clearly, then, it is a principle of this kind that is the most certain of
					all principles. Let us next state <emph>what</emph> this principle is. <milestone n="3.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"It is impossible for the same attribute at once to belong and
					not to belong <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to the same thing and in the same
					relation"; and we must add any further qualifications that may be necessary to meet
					logical objections. This is the most certain of all principles, since it possesses the
					required definition; <milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is impossible for
					anyone to suppose that the same thing is and is not, as some imagine that Heraclitus
						says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For examples of Heraclitus's paradoxes cf.
							<bibl n="Heraclit. Fr. 36">Heraclitus Fr. 36, 57, 59 (Bywater)</bibl>; and for their
						meaning see Burnet, E.G.P. 80.</note>—for what a man says does not necessarily
					represent what he believes. <milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it is
					impossible for contrary attributes to belong at the same time to the same subject (the
					usual qualifications must be added to this premiss also), and an opinion which contradicts
					another is contrary to it, then clearly it is impossible for the same man to suppose at
					the same time that the same thing is and is not; for the man who made this error would
					entertain two contrary opinions at the same time. <milestone n="3.12" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all men who are demonstrating anything refer back to this as an
					ultimate belief; for it is by nature the starting-point of all the other axioms as
						well. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There
					are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be
					and not be, <milestone n="1006a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>and say that it is possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this
					theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be and not to be, and by
					this means we have proved that this is the most certain of all principles. <milestone
						n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some, indeed, demand to have the law proved, but this
					is because they lack education<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc., in
					logic.</note>; for it shows lack of education not to know of what we should require proof,
					and of what we should not. For it is quite impossible that everything should have a proof;
					the process would go on to infinity, so that even so there would be no proof.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Every proof is based upon some hypothesis, to prove
						which another hypothesis must be assumed, and so on ad infinitum.</note> If on the other
					hand there are some things of which no proof need be sought, they cannot say what
					principle they think to be more self-evident. Even in the case of this law, however, we
					can demonstrate the impossibility by refutation, if only our opponent makes some
					statement. If he makes none, it is absurd to seek for an argument against one who has no
					arguments of his own about anything, in so far as he has none; for such a person, in so
					far as he is such, is really no better than a vegetable. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And I say that proof by refutation differs from simple proof in that
					he who attempts to prove might seem to beg the fundamental question, whereas if the
					discussion is provoked thus by someone else, refutation and not proof will
						result. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The starting-point for all such
					discussions is not the claim that he should state that something is or is not so <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(because this might be supposed to be a begging of the
					question), but that he should say something significant both to himself and to another
					(this is essential if any argument is to follow; for otherwise such a person cannot reason
					either with himself or with another); <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if
					this is granted, demonstration will be possible, for there will be something already
					defined. But the person responsible is not he who demonstrates but he who acquiesces; for
					though he disowns reason he acquiesces to reason. Moreover, he who makes such an admission
					as this has admitted the truth of something apart from demonstration [so that not
					everything will be "so and not so"]. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus in the first place it is obvious that this at any rate is
					true: that the term "to be" or "not to be" has a definite meaning; so that not everything
					can be "so and not so." Again, if "man" has one meaning, let this be "two-footed
						animal." <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By "has one meaning" I mean this: if
					X means "man," then if anything is a man, its humanity will consist in being X. And it
					makes no difference even if it be said that "man" has several meanings, provided that they
					are limited in number; <milestone n="1006b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>for one could assign a different name to each formula. <milestone n="4.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For instance, it might be said that "man" has not one meaning
					but several, one of which has the formula "two-footed animal," and there might be many
					other formulae as well, if they were limited in number; for a particular name could be
					assigned to each for formula. <milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If on the other
					hand it be said that "man" has an infinite number of meanings, obviously there can be no
					discourse; for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning
					there is an end of discourse with others, and even, strictly speaking, with oneself;
					because it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; and even if
					this were possible, one name might be assigned to that of which we think. <milestone
						n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now let this name, as we said at the beginning, have a
					meaning; and let it have one meaning. Now it is impossible that "being man" should have
					the same meaning as "not being man," that is, if "man" is not merely predicable of one
					subject but has one meaning <milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(for we do not
					identify "having one meaning" with "being predicable of one subject," since in this case
					"cultured" and "white" and "man" would have one meaning, and so all things would be one;
					for they would all have the same meaning). And it will be impossible for the same thing to
					be and not to be, except by equivocation, as e.g. one whom we call "man" <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>others might call "not-man"; <milestone n="4.13" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>but the problem is whether the same thing can at once be and not be
					"man," not in <emph>name</emph> , but in <emph>fact</emph> . If "man" and "not-man" have
					not different meanings, clearly "not being a man" will mean nothing different from "being
					a man"; and so "being a man" will be "not being a man"; they will be one. <milestone
						n="4.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For "to be one" means, as in the case of "garment" and
					"coat," that the formula is one. And if "being man" and "being not-man" are to be one,
					they will have the same meaning; but it has been proved above that they have different
					meanings. If then anything can be truly said to be "man," it must be "two-footed animal";
					for this is what "man" was intended to mean. <milestone n="4.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>And if this is necessarily so, it is impossible that at the same time the same thing
					should not be "two-footed animal." For "to be necessarily so" means this: that it is
					impossible not to be so. Thus it cannot be true to say at the same time that the same
					thing is and is not man. <milestone n="4.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same argument
					holds also in the case of not being man; <milestone n="1007a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because "being man" and "being not-man" have different
					meanings if "being white" and "being man" have different meanings (for the opposition is
					much stronger in the former case so as to produce different meanings). <milestone n="4.17"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if we are told that "white" too means one and the same
						thing,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. the same as "man."</note> we shall say
					again just what we said before,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006b">Aristot. Met. 4.4.12</bibl>.</note> that in that case all
					things, and not merely the opposites, will be one. But if this is impossible, what we have
					stated follows; that is, if our opponent answers our question; but if when asked the
					simple question he includes in his answer the negations, he is not answering our
						question. <milestone n="4.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is nothing to prevent the
					same thing from being "man" and "white" and a multitude of other things; but nevertheless
					when asked whether it is true to say that X is man, or not, one should return an answer
					that means one thing, and not add that X is white and large. It is indeed impossible to
					enumerate all the infinity of accidents; and so let him enumerate either all or
						none. <milestone n="4.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly therefore, even if the same
					thing is ten thousand times "man" and "not-man," one should not include in one's answer to
					the question whether it is "man" that it is at the same time also "not-man," unless one is
					also bound to include in one's answer all the other accidental things that the subject is
					or is not. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And if one does this, he is not
					arguing properly. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In general those who talk like this do
					away with substance and essence, <milestone n="4.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for they are
					compelled to assert that all things are accidents, and that there is no such thing as
					"being essentially man" or "animal." For if there is to be such a thing as "being
					essentially man," this will not be "being not-man" nor "not-being man" (and yet these are
					negations of it); for it was intended to have one meaning, i.e. the substance of
						something. <milestone n="4.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to denote a substance means
					that the essence is that and nothing else; and if for it "being essentially man" is the
					same as either "being essentially not-man" or "essentially not-being man," the essence
					will be something else. <milestone n="4.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus they are
					compelled to say that nothing can have such a definition as this, but that all things are
					accidental; for this is the distinction between substance and accident: "white" is an
					accident of "man," because although he is white, he is not white in essence. <milestone
						n="4.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the accidental always implies a predication
					about some subject, if all statements are accidental, there will be nothing primary about
					which they are made; <milestone n="1007b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>so the predication must proceed to infinity. But this is impossible, for
					not even more than two accidents can be combined in predication. An accident cannot be an
					accident of an accident unless both are accidents of the same thing. <milestone n="4.24"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean, e.g., that "white" is "cultured" and "cultured" "white"
					merely because both are accidents of a man. But it is not in this sense—that both
					terms are accidents of something else—that Socrates is cultured. Therefore since
					some accidents are predicated in the latter and some in the former sense, such as are
					predicated in the way that "white" is of Socrates cannot be an infinite series in the
					upper direction; e.g. there cannot be another accident of "white Socrates," for the sum of
					these predications does not make a single statement. <milestone n="4.25" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor can "white " have a further accident, such as "cultured"; for the
					former is no more an accident of the latter than vice versa; and besides we have
					distinguished that although some predicates are accidental in this sense, others are
					accidental in the sense that "cultured" is to Socrates; and whereas in the former case the
					accident is an accident of an accident, it is not so in the latter; and thus not all
					predications will be of accidents. <milestone n="4.26" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					even so there will be something which denotes substance. And if this is so, we have proved
					that contradictory statements cannot be predicated at the same time. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>Again, if all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same
					time are true, clearly all things will be one. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="4.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if it is equally possible either to
					affirm or deny anything of anything, the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a
					man; which is what necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., that all appearances and opinions are
						true.</note> For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a
					trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true. <milestone
						n="4.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras, "all
					things mixed together"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">
						<bibl n="Anaxag. Fr. 1">Fr. 1 (Diels).</bibl>
					</note>; so that nothing truly exists. It seems, then, that they are speaking of the
					Indeterminate; and while they think that they are speaking of what exists, they are really
					speaking of what does not; for the Indeterminate is that which exists potentially but not
						actually. <milestone n="4.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But indeed they must admit the
					affirmation or negation of any predicate of any subject, for it is absurd that in the case
					of each term its own negation should be true, and the negation of some other term which is
					not true of it should not be true. I mean, e.g., that if it is true to say that a man is
					not a man, it is obviously also true to say that he is or is not a trireme. <milestone
						n="4.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if the affirmation is true, so must the negation
					be true; but if the affirmation is not true the negation will be even truer than the
					negation of the original term itself. <milestone n="1008a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore if the latter negation is true, the negation of
					"trireme" will also be true; and if this is true, the affirmation will be true
						too. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And not only does this follow for those who hold this
					theory, but also that it is not necessary either to affirm or to deny a
						statement. <milestone n="4.31" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if it is true that X is both
					man and not-man, clearly he will be neither man nor not-man; for to the two statements
					there correspond two negations, and if the former is taken as a single statement
					compounded out of two, the latter is also a single statement and opposite to it. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.32" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, either this
					applies to all terms, and the same thing is both white and not-white, and existent and
					non-existent, and similarly with all other assertions and negations; or it does not apply
					to all, but only to some and not to others. <milestone n="4.33" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>And if it does not apply to all, the exceptions will be admitted<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">i.e., it will be admitted that in certain cases where an attribute is
						true of a subject, the negation is not true; and therefore some propositions are
						indisputable.</note>; but if it does apply to all, again either (a) the negation will be
					true wherever the affirmation is true, and the affirmation will be true wherever the
					negation is true, or (d) the negation will be true wherever the assertion is true, but the
					assertion will not always be true where the negation is true. <milestone n="4.34" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And in the latter case there will be something which definitely is
					not, and this will be a certain belief; and if that it is not is certain and knowable, the
					opposite assertion will be still more knowable. But if what is denied can be equally truly
					asserted, it must be either true or false to state the predicates separately and say,
						e.g., <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that a thing is white, and again that it
					is not-white. <milestone n="4.35" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it is not-true to state
					them separately, our opponent does not say what he professes to say, and nothing exists;
					and how can that which does not exist speak or walk?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>If our opponent holds that you can only say "A is B and not B," (1) he contradicts
						every statement that he makes; (2) he must say that what exists does not exist.
						Therefore nothing exists, and so he himself does not exist; but how can he speak or walk
						if he does not exist?</note> And again all things will be one, as we said before,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007b">Aristot. Met.
							4.4.27</bibl>.</note> and the same thing will be "man" and "God" and "trireme" and the
					negations of these terms. <milestone n="4.36" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if it is equally
					possible to assert or deny anything of anything, one thing will not differ from another;
					for if anything does differ, it will be true and unique. And similarly even if it is
					possible to make a true statement while separating the predicates, what we have stated
					follows. Moreover it follows that all statements would be true and all false; and that our
					opponent himself admits that what he says is false. Besides, it is obvious that discussion
					with him is pointless, because he makes no real statement. <milestone n="4.37" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For he says neither "yes" nor "no," but "yes and no"; and again he
					denies both of these and says "neither yes nor no"; otherwise there would be already some
					definite statement. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, if when the assertion is true the
					negation is false, and when the latter is true the affirmation is false, it will be
					impossible to assert and deny with truth the same thing at the same time. <milestone
						n="1008b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.38"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps it will be said that this is the point at
						issue. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, is the man wrong who supposes that a thing
					is so or not so, and he who supposes both right? If he is right, what is the meaning of
					saying that "such is the nature of reality"?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If
						everything is both so and not so, nothing has any definite nature.</note> And if he is
					not right, but is more right than the holder of the first view, reality will at once have
					a definite nature, and this will be true, and not at the same time not-true. <milestone
						n="4.39" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if all men are equally right and wrong, an
					exponent of this view can neither speak nor mean anything, since at the same time he says
					both "yes" and "no." And if he forms no judgement, but "thinks" and "thinks not"
					indifferently, what difference will there be between him and the vegetables? <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Hence it is quite evident that no one, either of those who profess
					this theory or of any other school, is really in this position. <milestone n="4.40" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Otherwise, why does a man walk to <placeName key="perseus,Megara"
						>Megara</placeName> and not stay at home, when he thinks he ought to make the journey?
					Why does he not walk early one morning into a well or ravine, if he comes to it, instead
					of clearly guarding against doing so, thus showing that he does <emph>not</emph> think
					that it is equally good and not good to fall in? Obviously then he judges that the one
					course is better and the other worse. <milestone n="4.41" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if
					this is so, he must judge that one thing is man and another not man, <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that one thing is sweet and another not sweet. For when,
					thinking that it is desirable to drink water and see a man, he goes to look for them, he
					does not look for and judge all things indifferently; and yet he should, if the same thing
					were equally man and not-man. <milestone n="4.42" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But as we have
					said, there is no one who does not evidently avoid some things and not others. Hence, as
					it seems, all men form unqualified judgements, if not about all things, at least about
					what is better or worse. <milestone n="4.43" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if they do this
					by guesswork and without knowledge, they should be all the more eager for truth; just as a
					sick man should be more eager for health than a healthy man; for indeed the man who
					guesses, as contrasted with him who knows, is not in a healthy relation to the
						truth. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.44" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again,
					however much things may be "so and not so," yet differences of degree are inherent in the
					nature of things. For we should not say that 2 and 3 are equally even; nor are he who
					thinks that 4 is 5, and he who thinks it is 1000, equally wrong: hence if they are not
					equally wrong, the one is clearly less wrong, and so more right. <milestone n="4.45" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>If then that which has more the nature of something is nearer to that
					something, <milestone n="1009a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>there will be some truth to which the more true is nearer. And even if there is not,
					still there is now something more certain and true, and we shall be freed from the
					undiluted doctrine which precludes any mental determination. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From the same view proceeds the theory of
					Protagoras, and both alike must be either true or false. For if all opinions and
					appearances are true, everything must be at once true and false; for many people form
					judgements which are opposite to those of others, and imagine that those who do not think
					the same as themselves are wrong: hence the same thing must both be and not be. <milestone
						n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if this is so, all opinions must be true; for those
					who are wrong and those who are right think contrarily to each other. So if reality is of
					this nature, everyone will be right. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Clearly then both these
					theories proceed from the same mental outlook. But the method of approach is not the same
					for all cases; for some require persuasion and others compulsion. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The ignorance of those who have formed this judgement through
					perplexity is easily remedied, because we are dealing <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>not with the theory but with their mental outlook; but those who hold the
					theory for its own sake can only be cured by refuting the theory as expressed in their own
					speech and words. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>This view comes to those who are perplexed from their observation of sensible things.
					(1.) The belief that contradictions and contraries can be true at the same time comes to
					them from seeing the contraries generated from the same thing. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if what is not cannot be generated, the thing must have existed
					before as both contraries equally—just as Anaxagoras says<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007b">Aristot. Met. 4.4.28</bibl>.</note>
					that everything is mixed in everything; and also Democritus, for he too says<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.985b">Aristot. Met.
							1.4.9</bibl>.</note> that Void and Plenum are present equally in any part, and yet the
					latter <emph>is</emph> , and the former <emph>is not</emph>. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>To those, then, who base their judgement on these considerations, we
					shall say that although in one sense their theory is correct, in another they are
					mistaken. For "being" has two meanings, so that there is a sense in which something can be
					generated from "not-being," and a sense in which it cannot; and a sense in which the same
					thing can at once be and not be; but not in the same respect. For the same thing can "be"
					contraries at the same time potentially, but not actually. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And further, we shall request them to conceive another kind also of
					substance of existing things, in which there is absolutely no motion or destruction or
					generation. <milestone n="1009b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>And (2.) similarly the theory that there is truth in appearances has come to some people
					from an observation of sensible things. <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>They
					think that the truth should not be judged by the number or fewness of its upholders; and
					they say that the same thing seems sweet to some who taste it, and bitter to others; so
					that if all men were diseased or all insane, except two or three who were healthy or sane,
					the latter would seem to be diseased or insane, and not the others. <milestone n="5.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And further they say that many of the animals as well get from
					the same things impressions which are contrary to ours, and that the individual himself
					does not always think the same in matters of sense-perception. Thus it is uncertain which
					of these impressions are true or false; for one kind is no more true than another, but
					equally so. And hence Democritus says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. Ritter and
						Preller, 204.</note> that either there is no truth or we cannot discover it. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general it is
					because they suppose that thought is sense-perception, and sense-perception physical
					alteration, that they say that the impression given through sense-perception is
					necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both Empedocles and Democritus and
					practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these. <milestone
						n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For Empedocles says that those who change their bodily
					condition change their thought: <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For according to that which

						unit="para"/>For as each at any time hath the temperament of his many-jointed limbs, so

						unit="Loeb chap"/>There is also recorded a saying of Anaxagoras to some of his
					disciples, that things would be for them as they judged them to be. <milestone n="5.14"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And they say that in Homer too clearly held this view, because
					he made Hector,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The only passage in our text of
						Homer to which this reference could apply is<bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.698">Hom. Il.

					stunned by the blow, lie with thoughts deranged—thus implying that even those who
					are "out of their minds" still think, although not the same thoughts. Clearly then, if
					both are kinds of thought, reality also will be "both so and not so." <milestone n="5.15"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is along this path that the consequences are most difficult;
					for if those who have the clearest vision of such truth as is possible (and these are they
					who seek and love it most) hold such opinions and make these pronouncements about the
					truth, surely those who are trying to be philosophers may well despair; for the pursuit of
					truth will be "chasing birds in the air."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.

					<milestone n="1010a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the reason why
					these men hold this view is that although they studied the truth about reality, they
					supposed that reality is confined to sensible things, in which the nature of the
					Indeterminate, i.e. of Being in the sense which we have explained,<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007b">Aristot. Met. 4.4.28</bibl>.</note> is
					abundantly present. (Thus their statements, though plausible, are not true; <milestone
						n="5.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>this form of the criticism is more suitable than that
					which Epicharmus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Fl. early 5th century; held views
						partly Pythagorean, partly Heraclitean.</note> applied to Xenophanes.) And further,
					observing that all this indeterminate substance is in motion, and that no true predication
					can be made of that which changes, they supposed that it is impossible to make any true
					statement about that which is in all ways and entirely changeable. <milestone n="5.18"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it was from this supposition that there blossomed forth the
					most extreme view of those which we have mentioned, that of the professed followers of
					Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus held, who ended by thinking that one need not say
					anything, and only moved his finger; and who criticized Heraclitus for saying that one
					cannot enter the same river twice,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Heraclit. Fr. 41">Heraclitus Fr. 41 (Bywater)</bibl>.</note> for he himself held
					that it cannot be done even once. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.19" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But we shall reply to this theory also that although that which is
					changeable supplies them, when it changes, with some real ground for supposing that it "is
					not," yet there is something debatable in this; for that which is shedding any quality
					retains something of that which is being shed, and something of that which is coming to be
					must already exist. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.20" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general if a thing is ceasing to be, there will be something
					there which <emph>is</emph> ; and if a thing is coming to be, that from which it comes and
					by which it is generated must <emph>be</emph> ; and this cannot go on to infinity. But let
					us leave this line of argument and remark that quantitative and qualitative change are not
					the same. <milestone n="5.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let it be granted that there is
					nothing permanent in respect of quantity; but it is by the <emph>form</emph> that we
					recognize everything. And again those who hold the theory that we are attacking deserve
					censure in that they have maintained about the whole material universe what they have
					observed in the case of a mere minority of sensible things. <milestone n="5.22" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is only the realm of sense around us which continues subject to
					destruction and generation, but this is a practically negligible part of the whole; so
					that it would have been fairer for them to acquit the former on the ground of the latter
					than to condemn the latter on account of the former. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
					/>Further, we shall obviously say to these thinkers too the same as we said some time
						ago<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot.       Met. 4.1009a">Aristot.
							Met. 4.5.7</bibl>.</note>; for we must prove to them and convince them that there is a
					kind of nature that is not moved <milestone n="5.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and yet
					those who claim that things can at once be and not be are logically compelled to admit
					rather that all things are at rest than that they are in motion; for there is nothing for
					them to change into, since everything exists in everything). <milestone n="1010b"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And as concerning reality,
					that not every appearance is real, we shall say, first, that indeed the perception, at
					least of the proper object of a sense, is not false, but the impression we get of it is
					not the same as the perception. <milestone n="5.24" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And then we
					may fairly express surprise if our opponents raise the question whether magnitudes and
					colors are really such as they appear at a distance or close at hand, as they appear to
					the healthy or to the diseased; and whether heavy things are as they appear to the weak or
					to the strong; and whether truth is as it appears to the waking or to the
						sleeping. <milestone n="5.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For clearly they do not really
					believe the latter alternative—at any rate no one, if in the night he thinks that he
					is at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> whereas he is really in
						<placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, starts off to the Odeum.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A concert-hall (used also for other purposes) built by

					future (as indeed Plato says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Plat. Theaet. 171e">Plat. Theaet. 171e, 178cff.</bibl>.</note>) the opinion of the
					doctor and that of the layman are presumably not equally reliable, e.g. as to whether a
					man will get well or not. <milestone n="5.26" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again in the
					case of the senses themselves, our perception of a foreign object and of an object proper
					to a given sense, or of a kindred object and of an actual object of that sense itself, is
					not equally reliable<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">An object of taste is foreign
						to the sense of sight; a thing may look sweet without tasting sweet. Similarly although
						the senses of taste and smell (and therefore their objects) are kindred (<bibl
							n="Aristot. Sens. 440b.29">Aristot. De Sensu 440b 29</bibl>), in judging tastes the
						sense of taste is the more reliable.</note>; but in the case of colors sight, and not
					taste, is authoritative, and in the case of flavor taste, and not sight. But not one of
					the senses ever asserts at the same time of the same object that it is "so and not
						so." <milestone n="5.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor even at another time <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>does it make a conflicting statement about the quality,
					but only about that to which the quality belongs. I mean, e.g., that the same wine may
					seem, as the result of its own change or of that of one's body, at one time sweet and at
					another not; but sweetness, such as it is when it exists, has never yet changed, and there
					is no mistake about it, and that which is to be sweet is necessarily of such a
						nature. <milestone n="5.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet all these theories destroy the
					possibility of anything's existing by necessity, inasmuch as they destroy the existence of
					its essence; for "the necessary" cannot be in one way and in another; and so if anything
					exists of necessity, it cannot be "both so and not so." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And
					in general, if only the sensible exists, without animate things there would be nothing;
					for there would be no sense-faculty. <milestone n="5.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That
					there would be neither sensible qualities nor sensations is probably true<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. de An. 425b.25">Aristot. De Anima
							425b 25-426b 8</bibl>.</note>(for these depend upon an effect produced in the
					percipient), but that the substrates which cause the sensation should not exist even apart
					from the sensation is impossible. <milestone n="5.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					sensation is not of itself, but there is something else too besides the sensation, which
					must be prior to the sensation; <milestone n="1011a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because that which moves is by nature prior to that which is
					moved, and this is no less true if the terms are correlative. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there are some, both of those who
					really hold these convictions and of those who merely profess these views, who raise a
					difficulty; they inquire who is to judge of the healthy man, and in general who is to
					judge rightly in each particular case. But such questions are like wondering whether we
					are at any given moment asleep or awake; <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and
					all problems of this kind amount to the same thing. These people demand a reason for
					everything. They want a starting-point, and want to grasp it by demonstration; while it is
					obvious from their actions that they have no conviction. But their case is just what we
					have stated before<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006a"
							>Aristot. Met. 4.4.2</bibl>.</note>; for they require a reason for things which have
					no reason, since the starting-point of a demonstration is not a matter of
						demonstration. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The first class, then, may be
					readily convinced of this, because it is not hard to grasp. But those who look only for
					cogency in argument look for an impossibility, for they claim the right to contradict
					themselves, and lose no time in doing so. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet
					if not everything is relative, but some things are self-existent, not every appearance
					will be true; for an appearance is an appearance to someone. And so he who says that
						all <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>appearances are true makes everything
						relative. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence those who demand something
					cogent in argument, and at the same time claim to make out a case, must guard themselves
					by saying that the appearance is true; not in itself, but <emph>for him to whom</emph> it
					appears, and at, the time when it appears, and in the <emph>way</emph> and <emph>manner in
						which it appears</emph>. And if they make out a case without this qualification, as a
					result they will soon contradict themselves; <milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>for it is possible in the case of the same man for a thing to appear honey to the sight,
					but not to the taste, and for things to appear different to the sight of each of his two
					eyes, if their sight is unequal. For to those who assert (for the reasons previously
						stated<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1009a">Aristot. Met. 4.5.7-17.</bibl>
					</note>) that appearances are true, and that all things are therefore equally false and
					true, because they do not appear the same to all, nor always the same to the same person,
					but often have contrary appearances at the same time <milestone n="6.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(since if one crosses the fingers touch says that an object is two,
					while sight says that it is only one<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Pr. 958b.14">Aristot. Problemata 958b 14, 959a 5, 965a 36</bibl>.</note>),
					we shall say "but not to the same sense or to the same part of it in the same way and at
					the same time"; so that with this qualification the appearance will be true. <milestone
						n="1011b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But perhaps it is
					for this reason that those who argue not from a sense of difficulty but for argument's
					sake are compelled to say that the appearance is not true in itself, but true to the
						percipient; <milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and, as we have said before, are
					compelled also to make everything relative and dependent upon opinion and sensation, so
					that nothing has happened or will happen unless someone has first formed an opinion about
					it; otherwise clearly all things would not be relative to opinion. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>Further, if a thing is one, it is relative to one thing or to something
					determinate. And if the same thing is both a half and an equal, yet the equal is not
					relative to the double. <milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If to the thinking
					subject "man" and the object of thought are the same, "man" will be not the thinking
					subject but the object of thought; and if each thing is to be regarded as relative to the
					thinking subject, the thinking subject will be relative to an infinity of specifically
					different things. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>That the most certain of all beliefs is that opposite statements are
					not both true at the same time, and what follows for those who maintain that they are
					true, and why these thinkers maintain this, may be regarded as adequately stated. And
					since the contradiction of a statement cannot be true at the same time of the same thing,
					it is obvious that contraries cannot apply at the same time to the same thing. <milestone
						n="6.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in each pair of contraries one is a privation no
					less than it is a contrary—a privation of substance. And privation is the negation
					of a predicate <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to some defined genus. Therefore
					if it is impossible at the same time to affirm and deny a thing truly, it is also
					impossible for contraries to apply to a thing at the same time; either both must apply in
					a modified sense, or one in a modified sense and the other absolutely. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor indeed can there be any
					intermediate between contrary statements, but of one thing we must either assert or deny
					one thing, whatever it may be. This will be plain if we first define truth and falsehood.
					To say that what is is not, or that what is not is, is false; but to say that what is is,
					and what is not is not, is true; and therefore also he who says that a thing is or is not
					will say either what is true or what is false. <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>But neither what is nor what is not is said not to be <emph>or</emph> to be. Further, an
					intermediate between contraries will be intermediate either as grey is between black and
					white, or as "neither man nor horse" is between man and horse. If in the latter sense, it
					cannot change (for change is from not-good to good, or from good to not-good); <milestone
						n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in fact it is clearly always changing; for change
					can only be into the opposite and the intermediate. And if it is a true intermediate, in
					this case too there would be a kind of change into white not from not-white; but in fact
					this is not seen.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">It is not <hi rend="Italic"
							>qua</hi> grey (i.e. intermediate between white and black) that grey changes to white,

						black).</note>
					<milestone n="1012a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Further,
					the understanding either affirms or denies every object of understanding or thought (as is
					clear from the definition<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 4.1011b">Aristot. Met. 4.7.1</bibl>.</note>) <milestone n="7.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>whenever it is right or wrong. When, in asserting or denying, it
					combines the predicates in one way, it is right; when in the other, it is wrong. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, unless it is maintained merely for argument's sake, the
					intermediate must exist beside all contrary terms; so that one will say what is neither
					true nor false. And it will exist beside what is and what is not; so that there will be a
					form of change beside generation and destruction. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone
						n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, there will also be an intermediate in all
					classes in which the negation of a term implies the contrary assertion; e.g., among
					numbers there will be a number which is neither odd nor not-odd. But this is impossible,
					as is clear from the definition.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">What definition
						Aristotle had in mind we cannot tell; but it must have stated that every number is

					infinite progression, and existing things will be not only half as many again, but even
						more. <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For again it will be possible to deny
					the intermediate in reference both to its assertion and to its negation, and the result
					will be something<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If besides A and not-A there is an

						nor not-B; and so on.</note>; for its essence is something distinct. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>Again, when a man is asked whether a thing is white and says "no," he has
					denied nothing except that it is &lt;white&gt;, and its not-being &lt;white&gt; is a
						negation. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now
					this view has occurred to certain people in just the same way as other paradoxes have also
					occurred; for when they cannot find a way out from eristic arguments, they submit to the
					argument and admit that the conclusion is true. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>Some, then, hold the theory for this kind of reason, and others because they require an
					explanation for everything. In dealing with all such persons the starting-point is from
						definition; <milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and definition results from the

					opposing all such theories we must demand, as was said in our discussion above,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006a">Aristot. Met.
							4.4.5</bibl>.</note> not that something should be or not be, but some significant
					statement; and so we must argue from a definition, having first grasped what "falsehood"
					or "truth" means. And if to assert what is true is nothing else than to deny what is
					false, everything cannot be false; for one part of the contradiction must be
						true. <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, if everything must be either
					asserted or denied, both parts cannot be false; for one and only one part of the
					contradiction is false. Indeed, the consequence follows which is notorious in the case of
					all such theories, that they destroy themselves; <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>for he who says that everything is true makes the opposite theory true too, and
					therefore his own untrue (for the opposite theory says that his is not true); and he who
					says that everything is false makes himself a liar. <milestone n="8.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And if they make exceptions, the one that the opposite theory alone is
					not true, and the other that his own theory alone is not false, <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it follows none the less that they postulate an infinite number
					of true and false statements. For the statement that the true statement is true is also
					true; and this will go on to infinity. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor, as is obvious, are those right who say that all things are
					at rest; nor those who say that all things are in motion. For if all things are at rest,
					the same things will always be true and false, whereas this state of affairs is obviously
					subject to change; for the speaker himself once did not exist, and again he will not
					exist. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true, so everything will be false;
					but this has been proved to be impossible. <milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Again, it must be that which <emph>is</emph> that changes, for change is from something
					into something. And further, neither is it true that all things are at rest or in motion

					which each thing may best come into being; e.g., a course of study should sometimes be
					begun not from what is primary or from the starting-point of the subject, but from the
					point from which it is easiest to learn. (c) That thing as a result of whose presence
					something first comes into being; e.g., as the keel is the beginning of a ship, and the
					foundation that of a house, and as in the case of animals some thinkers suppose the
						heart<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This was Aristotle's own view,<bibl

					Again, "beginning" means the point from which a thing is first comprehensible, this too is
					called the "beginning" of the thing; e.g. the hypotheses of demonstrations. ("Cause" can
					have a similar number of different senses, for all causes are "beginnings.") <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is a common property,
					then, of all "beginnings" to be the first thing from which something either exists or
					comes into being or becomes known; and some beginnings are originally inherent in things,
					while others are not. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence "nature" is a
					beginning, and so is "element" and "understanding" and "choice" and "essence" and "final
					cause"—for in many cases the Good and the Beautiful are the beginning both of
					knowledge and of motion. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Cause" means: (a) in one sense, that as the result of whose presence
					something comes into being—e.g. the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and
					the classes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. of material—metal, wood,
						etc.</note> which contain these; (b) in another sense, the <emph>form</emph> or pattern;
					that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it—e.g. the ratio 2:1
					and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the
						formula. <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The source of the first
					beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the
					cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is
					produced, and that which changes of that which is changed. (d) The same as "end"; i.e. the
					final cause; e.g., as the "end" of walking is health. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For why does a man walk? "To be healthy," we say, and by saying this
					we consider that we have supplied the cause. (e) All those means towards the end which
					arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g. fat-reducing, purging, drugs and
					instruments are causes of health; <milestone n="1013b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they all have the <emph>end</emph> as their object,
					although they differ from each other as being some instruments, others actions. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These are roughly all
					the meanings of "cause," but since causes are spoken of with various meanings, it follows
					that there are several causes (and that not in an accidental sense) of the same thing.
					E.g., both <emph>statuary</emph> and <emph>bronze</emph> are causes of the statue; not in
					different connections, but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> statue. However, they are not causes
					in the same way, but the one as <emph>material</emph> and the other as the <emph>source of
						motion</emph>. And things are causes of each other; as e.g. labor of vigor, and vigor of
					labor—but not in the same way; the one as an <emph>end</emph> , and the other as
						<emph>source</emph> of <emph>motion</emph> . <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>And again the same thing is sometimes the cause of contrary results; because that which
					by its presence is the cause of so-and-so we sometimes accuse of being, by its absence,
					the cause of the contrary—as, e.g., we say that the absence of the pilot is the
					cause of a capsize, whereas his presence was the cause of safety. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And both, presence and privation, are <emph>moving</emph>
						causes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now there are four senses which are most obvious
					under which all the causes just described may be classed. <milestone n="2.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The components of syllables; the material of manufactured articles;
					fire, earth and all such bodies; the parts of a whole; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>and the premisses of a syllogistic conclusion; are causes in the
						<emph>material</emph> sense. Of these some are causes as substrate: e.g. the parts; and
					others as <emph>essence</emph> : the whole, and the composition, and the form. <milestone
						n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The seed and the physician and the contriver and in
					general that which produces, all these are the source of change or stationariness. The
					remainder represent the <emph>end</emph> and <emph>good</emph> of the others; for the
					final cause tends to be the greatest good and <emph>end</emph> of the rest. <milestone
						n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let it be assumed that it makes no difference whether
					we call it "good" or "apparent good." In <emph>kind</emph> , then, there are these four
					classes of cause. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The <emph>modes</emph> of cause are
					numerically many, although these too are fewer when summarized. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For causes are spoken of in many senses, and even of those which are
					of the same kind, some are causes in a prior and some in a posterior sense; e.g., the
					physician and the expert are both causes of health; and the ratio 2:1 and number are both
					causes of the octave; and the universals which include a given cause are causes of its
					particular effects. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a thing may be a
					cause in the sense of an accident, and the classes which contain accidents; e.g., the
					cause of a statue is in one sense Polyclitus and in another a sculptor, because it is an
					accident of the sculptor to be Polyclitus. <milestone n="1014a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And the universal terms which include accidents are
					causes; e.g., the cause of a statue is a man, or even, generally, an animal; because
					Polyclitus is a man, and man is an animal. <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					even of accidental causes some are remoter or more proximate than others; e.g., the cause
					of the statue might be said to be "white man" or "cultured man," and not merely
					"Polyclitus" or "man." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And besides the distinction of causes
					as <emph>proper</emph> and <emph>accidental</emph> , some are termed causes in a
						<emph>potential</emph> and others in an <emph>actual</emph> sense; e.g., the cause of
					building is either the builder or the builder who builds. <milestone n="2.13" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same distinctions in meaning as we have already described will
					apply to the <emph>effects</emph> of the causes; e.g. to <emph>this</emph> statue, or
						<emph>a</emph> statue, or generally an image; and to <emph>this</emph> bronze, or
					bronze, or generally material.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Effects, just like
						causes (10), may be particular or general. The metal-worker produces (a) the bronze for
						a particular statue by the sculptor, (b) bronze for a statue, (c) metal for an
						image.</note> And it is the same with accidental effects. Again, the proper and
					accidental senses will be combined; e.g., the cause is neither "Polyclitus" nor "a
					sculptor" but "the sculptor Polyclitus." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.14"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, these classes of cause are in all six in number, each
					used in two senses. Causes are (1.) particular, (2.) generic, (3.) accidental, (4.)
					generically accidental; and these may be either stated singly or (5, 6) in
						combination<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The cause of a statue may be said to
						be (1) a sculptor, (2) an artist, (3) Polyclitus, (4) a man, (5) the sculptor Polyclitus
						(combination of (1) and (3)), (6) an artistic man (combination of (2) and
						(4)).</note>; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and further they are all either
					actual or potential. <milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is this
					difference between them, that actual and particular causes coexist or do not coexist with
					their effects (e.g. <emph>this</emph> man giving medical treatment with <emph>this</emph>
					man recovering his health, and <emph>this</emph> builder with <emph>this</emph> building
					in course of erection); but potential causes do not always do so; for the house and the
					builder do not perish together. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Element" means (a) the primary immanent thing, formally indivisible
					into another form, of which something is composed. E.g., the elements of a sound are the
					parts of which that sound is composed and into which it is ultimately divisible, and which
					are not further divisible into other sounds formally different from themselves. If an
					element be divided, the parts are formally the same as the whole: e.g., a part of water is
					water; but it is not so with the syllable. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b)
					Those who speak of the elements of <emph>bodies</emph> similarly mean the parts into which
					bodies are ultimately divisible, and which are not further divisible into other parts
					different in form. And whether they speak of one such element or of more than one, this is
					what they mean. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The term is applied with a
					very similar meaning to the "elements" of geometrical figures, and generally to the
					"elements" of demonstrations; for the primary demonstrations which are contained in a
					number of other demonstrations <milestone n="1014b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are called "elements" of demonstrations.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.998a">Aristot. Met. 3.3.1</bibl>.</note>
					Such are the primary syllogisms consisting of three terms and with one middle
						term. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The term "element" is also applied
					metaphorically to any small unity which is useful for various purposes; and so that which
					is small or simple or indivisible is called an "element." <milestone n="3.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(e) Hence it comes that the most universal things are elements;
					because each of them, being a simple unity, is present in many things—either in all
					or in as many as possible. Some too think that unity and the point are first
						principles. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(f) Therefore since what are
					called genera<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This must refer to the highest genera,
						which have no definition because they cannot be analyzed into genus and differentia (
						Ross).</note> are universal and indivisible (because they have no formula), some people
					call the genera elements, and these rather than the differentia, because the genus is more
					universal. For where the differentia is present, the genus also follows; but the
					differentia is not always present where the genus is. And it is common to all cases that
					the element of each thing is that which is primarily inherent in each thing. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Nature"<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">On the meaning of <foreign lang="greek"
							>fu/sis</foreign> cf. Burnet, E.G.P. pp. 10-12, 363-364.</note> means: (a) in one
					sense, the genesis of growing things—as would be suggested by pronouncing the
						<foreign lang="greek">u</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign>
					long—and (b) in another, that immanent thing<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>Probably the seed (Bonitz).</note> from which a growing thing first begins to grow. (c)
					The source from which the primary motion in every natural object is induced in that object
					as such. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>All things are said to grow which gain
					increase through something else by contact and organic unity (or adhesion, as in the case
					of embryos). <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Organic unity differs from
					contact; for in the latter case there need be nothing except contact, but in both the
					things which form an organic unity there is some one and the same thing which produces,
					instead of mere contact, a unity which is organic, continuous and quantitative (but not
						qualitative). <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, "nature" means (d) the
					primary stuff, shapeless and unchangeable from its own potency, of which any natural
					object consists or from which it is produced; e.g., bronze is called the "nature" of a
					statue and of bronze articles, and wood that of wooden ones, and similarly in all other
						cases. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For each article consists of these
					"natures," the primary material persisting. It is in this sense that men call the elements
					of natural objects the "nature," some calling it fire, others earth or air or water,
					others something else similar, others some of these, and others all of them. <milestone
						n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again in another sense "nature" means (e) the substance
					of natural objects; as in the case of those who say that the "nature" is the primary
					composition of a thing, or as Empedocles says: <milestone n="1015a" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Of nothing that exists is there nature, but
					only mixture and separation of what has been mixed; nature is but a name given to these by
						men.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Emp. Fr. 8">Empedocles Fr. 8
							(Diels)</bibl>.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence as regards those things which exist or are produced by nature,
					although that from which they naturally are produced or exist is already present, we say
					that they have not their nature yet unless they have their form and shape. <milestone
						n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That which comprises both of these exists by nature;
					e.g. animals and their parts. And nature is both the primary matter (and this in two
					senses: either primary in relation to the thing, or primary in general; e.g., in bronze
					articles the primary matter in relation to those articles is bronze, but in general it is
					perhaps water—that is if all things which can be melted are water) and the form or
					essence, i.e. the end of the process, of generation. Indeed from this sense of "nature,"
					by an extension of meaning, every essence in general is called "nature," because the
					nature of anything is a kind of essence. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.8"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From what has been said, then, the primary and proper sense of
					"nature" is the essence of those things which contain in themselves as such a source of
					motion; for the matter is called "nature" because it is capable of receiving the nature,
					and the processes of generation and growth are called "nature" because they are motions
					derived from it. And nature in this sense is the source of motion in natural objects,
					which is somehow inherent in them, either potentially or actually. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Necessary" means: (a) That without which, as a concomitant condition,
					life is impossible; e.g. respiration and food are necessary for an animal, because it
					cannot exist without them. (b) The conditions without which good cannot be or come to be,
					or without which one cannot get rid or keep free of evil—e.g., drinking medicine is
					necessary to escape from ill-health, and sailing to <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City"
						>Aegina</placeName> is necessary to recover one's money. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The compulsory and compulsion; i.e. that which hinders and
					prevents, in opposition to impulse and purpose. For the compulsory is called necessary,
					and hence the necessary is disagreeable; as indeed Evenus<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Of Poros; sophist and poet, contemporary with Socrates.</note> says: "For
					every necessary thing is by nature grievous."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Even. Fr. 8">Evenus Fr. 8 (Hiller)</bibl>.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And compulsion is a kind of necessity, as
					Sophocles says: "Compulsion makes me do this of necessity."<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. El. 256">Soph. El. 256</bibl> (the quotation is slightly
						inaccurate).</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And necessity is held, rightly, to be
					something inexorable; for it is opposed to motion which is in accordance with purpose and
					calculation. (d) Again, what cannot be otherwise we say is necessarily so. <milestone
						n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is from this sense of "necessary" that all others
					are somehow derived; for the term "compulsory" is used of something which it is necessary
					for one to do or suffer <milestone n="1015b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>only when it is impossible to act according to impulse, because of the
					compulsion: which shows that necessity is that because of which a thing cannot be
					otherwise; and the same is true of the concomitant conditions of living and of the good.
					For when in the one case good, and in the other life or existence, is impossible without
					certain conditions, these conditions are necessary, and the cause is a kind of
						necessity. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(e)
					Again, demonstration is a "necessary" thing, because a thing cannot be otherwise if the
					demonstration has been absolute. And this is the result of the first premisses, when it is
					impossible for the assumptions upon which the syllogism depends to be otherwise. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus of necessary things, some have an external cause of their
					necessity, and others have not, but it is through them that other things are of necessity
					what they are. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the "necessary" in the
					primary and proper sense is the <emph>simple</emph> , for it cannot be in more than one
					condition. Hence it cannot be in one state and in another; for if so it would ipso facto
					be in more than one condition. Therefore if there are certain things which are eternal and
					immutable, there is nothing in them which is compulsory or which violates their
						nature. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					term "one" is used (1.) in an accidental, (2.) in an absolute sense. (1.) In the
					accidental sense it is used as in the case of "Coriscus"<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Coriscus of Scepsis was a Platonist with whom Aristotle was probably
						acquainted; but the name is of course chosen quite arbitrarily.</note> and "cultured"
					and "cultured Coriscus" (for "Coriscus" and "cultured" and "cultured Coriscus" mean the
						same); <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and "cultured" and "upright" <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and "cultured upright Coriscus." For all these terms
					refer accidentally to one thing; "upright" and "cultured" because they are accidental to
					one substance, and "cultured" and "Coriscus" because the one is accidental to the
						other. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And similarly in one sense "cultured
					Coriscus" is one with "Coriscus," because one part of the expression is accidental to the
					other, e.g. "cultured" to "Coriscus"; and "cultured Coriscus" is one with "upright
					Coriscus," because <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>one part of each expression
					is one accident of one and the same thing. It is the same even if the accident is applied
					to a genus or a general term; e.g., "man" and "cultured man" are the same, either because
					"cultured" is an accident of "man," which is one substance, or because both are accidents
					of some individual, e.g. Coriscus. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But they do
					not both belong to it in the same way; the one belongs presumably as <emph>genus</emph> in
					the substance, and the other as <emph>condition</emph> or <emph>affection</emph> of the
					substance. Thus all things which are said to be "one" in an accidental sense are said to
					be so in this way. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) Of those things which are said to be in themselves one, (a) some
					are said to be so in virtue of their continuity; e.g., a faggot is made continuous by its
					string, and pieces of wood by glue; <milestone n="1016a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a continuous line, even if it is bent, is said to be one,
					just like each of the limbs; e.g. the leg or arm. And of these things themselves those
					which are naturally continuous are one in a truer sense than those which are artificially
						continuous. <milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Continuous" means that whose
					motion is essentially one, and cannot be otherwise; and motion is one when it is
					indivisible, i.e. indivisible in <emph>time</emph> . Things are essentially continuous
					which are one not by contact only; for if you put pieces of wood touching one another you
					will not say that they are <emph>one</emph> piece of wood, or body, or any other
					continuous thing. <milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And things which are
					completely continuous are said to be "one" even if they contain a joint, and still more
					those things which contain no joint; e.g., the shin or the thigh is more truly one than
					the leg, because the motion of the leg may not be one. <milestone n="6.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And the straight line is more truly one than the bent. We call the
					line which is bent and contains an angle both one and not one, because it may or may not
					move all at once; but the straight line always moves all at once, and no part of it which
					has magnitude is at rest while another moves, as in the bent line. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>(b) Another sense of "one" is that the substrate is uniform in
						kind. <milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are uniform whose form is
					indistinguishable to sensation; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the
					substrate is either that which is primary, or that which is final in relation to the end.
					For wine is said to be one, and water one, as being something formally indistinguishable.
					And all liquids are said to be one (e.g. oil and wine), and melted things; because the
					ultimate substrate of all of them is the same, for all these things are water or

					Things are said to be "one" whose genus is one and differs in its opposite differentiae.
					All these things too are said to be "one" because the genus, which is the substrate of the
					differentiae, is one (e.g., "horse," "man" and "dog" are in a sense one, because they are
					all animals); and that in a way very similar to that in which the matter is one. <milestone
						n="6.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Sometimes these things are said to be "one" in this
					sense, and sometimes their higher genus is said to be one and the same (if they are final
					species of their genus)—the genus, that is, which is above the genera of which their
					proximate genus is one; e.g., the isosceles and equilateral triangles are one and the same
					figure (because they are both triangles), but not the same triangles. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="6.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) Again, things are said to
					be "one" when the definition stating the essence of one is indistinguishable from a
					definition explaining the other; for in itself every definition is distinguishable
					&lt;into genus and differentiae&gt;. In this way that which increases and decreases is
					one, because its definition is one; just as in the case of planes the definition of the
					form is one. <milestone n="1016b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="6.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general those things whose
					concept, which conceives the essence, is indistinguishable and cannot be separated either
					in time or in place or in definition, are in the truest sense one; and of these such as
					are substances are most truly one. For universally such things as do not admit of
					distinction are called "one" in so far as they do not admit of it; e.g., if "man" <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> "man" does not admit of distinction, he is one man; and similarly
					if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> animal, he is one animal; and if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					magnitude, he is one magnitude. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.15" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Most things, then, are said to be "one" because they produce, or
					possess, or are affected by, or are related to, some other one thing; but some are called
					"one" in a primary sense, and one of these is substance. It is one either in continuity or
					in form or in definition; for we reckon as more than one things which are not continuous,
					or whose form is not one, or whose definition is not one. <milestone n="6.16" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, in one sense we call anything whatever "one" if it is
					quantitative and continuous; and in another sense we say that it is not "one" unless it is
					a <emph>whole</emph> of some kind, i.e. unless it is one in form (e.g., if we saw the
					parts of a shoe put together anyhow, we should not say that they were one — except
					in virtue of their continuity; but only if they were so put together as to be a shoe, and
					to possess already some one form). <milestone n="6.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the
					circumference of a circle is of all lines the most truly one, because it is whole and
						complete. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The essence of "one" is to be a kind of starting
					point of number; for the first measure is a starting point, because that by which first we
					gain knowledge of a thing is the first measure of each class of objects. <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>"The one," then, is the starting-point of what is knowable in
					respect of each particular thing. But the unit is not the same in all classes, <milestone
						n="6.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for in one it is the quarter-tone, and in another the
					vowel or consonant; gravity has another unit, and motion another. But in all cases the
					unit is indivisible, either quantitatively or formally. <milestone n="6.19" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus that which is quantitatively and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					quantitative wholly indivisible and has no position is called a unit; and that which is
					wholly indivisible and has position, a point; that which is divisible in one sense, a
					line; in two senses, a plane; and that which is quantitatively divisible in all three
					senses, a body. <milestone n="6.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And reversely that which is
					divisible in two senses is a plane, and in one sense a line; and that which is in no sense
					quantitatively divisible is a point or a unit; if it has no position, a unit, and if it
					has position, a point. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.21" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, some things are one numerically, others formally, others
					generically, and others analogically; numerically, those whose matter is one; formally,
					those whose definition is one; generically, those which belong to the same category; and
					analogically, those which have the same relation as something else to some third
						object. <milestone n="6.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In every case the latter types of
					unity are implied in the former: e.g., all things which are one numerically are also one
					formally, but not all which are one formally are one numerically; <milestone n="1017a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and all are one generically

						generically. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>It is obvious also that "many" will have the opposite meanings to "one." Some things are
					called "many" because they are not continuous; others because their matter (either primary
					or ultimate) is formally divisible; others because the definitions of their essence are
					more than one. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>"Being" means (1.) accidental being, (2.) absolute being. (1.) E.g., we say that the
					upright person "is" cultured, and that the man "is" cultured, and that the cultured person
					"is" a man; very much as we say that the cultured person builds, because the builder
					happens to be cultured, or the cultured person a builder; for in this sense "X is Y" means
					that Y is an accident of X. <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And so it is with
					the examples cited above; for when we say that "the man is cultured" and "the cultured
					person is a man" or "the white is cultured" or "the cultured is white," in the last two
					cases it is because both predicates are accidental to the same subject, and in the first
					case because the predicate is accidental to what <emph>is</emph> ; and we say that "the
					cultured is a man" because "the cultured" is accidental to a man. <milestone n="7.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(Similarly "not-white" is said to "be," because the subject of which
					"not-white" is an accident, <emph>is</emph> .) <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>These, then, are the senses in which things are said to "be" accidentally: either
					because both predicates belong to the same subject, which <emph>is</emph> ; or because the
					predicate belongs to the subject, which <emph>is</emph> ; or because the subject to which
					belongs that of which it is itself predicated itself <emph>is</emph> . <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) The senses of essential
					being are those which are indicated by the figures of predication<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The categories. For the full list of these see <bibl
							n="Aristot. Cat. 1b.25">Aristot. Categories 1b 25-27</bibl>.</note>; for "being" has
					as many senses as there are ways of predication. Now since some predicates indicate (a)
					what a thing is, and others its (b) quality, (c) quantity, (d) relation, (e) activity or
					passivity, (f) place, (g) time, to each of these corresponds a sense of "being." <milestone
						n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is no difference between "the man is recovering"
					and "the man recovers"; or between "the man is walking" or "cutting" and "the man walks"
					or "cuts"; and similarly in the other cases. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>(3.) Again, "to
					be" and "is" mean that a thing is true, and "not to be" that it is false. <milestone
						n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly too in affirmation and negation; e.g., in "
					Socrates is cultured" "is" means that this is true; or in "Socrates is not-white" that
					this is true; but in "the diagonal is not commensurable"<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.983a">Aristot. Met. 1.2.15</bibl>.</note>"is

						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(4.) Again, "to be" &lt;or "is"&gt; means that some of
					these statements can be made in virtue of a potentiality and others in virtue of an
						actuality. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For we say that both that which
					sees potentially and that which sees actually <emph>is</emph> "a seeing thing." And in the
					same way we call "understanding" both that which <emph>can</emph> use the understanding,
					and that which <emph>does</emph> ; and we call "tranquil" both that in which tranquillity
					is already present, and that which is potentially tranquil. <milestone n="7.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly too in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in
					the stone,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.1002a"
							>Aristot. Met. 3.5.6</bibl>.</note> and the half of the line in the whole; and we call

						unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Substance" means (a) simple
					bodies, e.g. earth, fire, water and the like; and in general bodies, and the things,
					animal or divine, including their parts, which are composed of bodies. All these are
					called substances because they are not predicated of any substrate, but other things are
					predicated of them. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) In another sense,
					whatever, being immanent in such things as are not predicated of a substrate, is the cause
					of their being; as, e.g., the soul is the cause of being for the animal. <milestone n="8.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All parts immanent in things which define and indicate
					their individuality, and whose destruction causes the destruction of the whole; as, e.g.,
					the plane is essential to the body (as some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Pythagoreans and Platonists.</note> hold) and the line to the plane. <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And number in general is thought by some<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and Platonists.</note> to be of this nature, on the
					ground that if it is abolished nothing exists, and that it determines
						everything. <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) Again, the
						<emph>essence</emph> , whose formula is the definition, is also called the substance of
					each particular thing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus it follows that "substance" has
					two senses: the ultimate subject, which cannot be further predicated of something else;
					and whatever has an individual and separate existence. The shape and form of each
					particular thing is of this nature. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"The same" means (a) accidentally the same. E.g., "white" and
					"cultured" are the same because they are accidents of the same subject; and "man" is the
					same as "cultured," because one is an accident of the other; and "cultured" is the same as
					"man" because it is an accident of "man"; and "cultured man" is the same as each of the
					terms "cultured" and "man," and vice versa; for both "man" and "cultured" are used in the
					same way as "cultured man," and the latter in the same way as the former. <milestone
						n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence none of these predications can be made
					universally. For it is not true to say that every man is the same as "the cultured";
					because universal predications are essential to things, <milestone n="1018a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but accidental predications
					are not so, but are made of individuals and with a single application. " Socrates" and
					"cultured Socrates" seem to be the same; but " Socrates" is not a class-name, and hence we
					do not say "every Socrates" as we say "every man." <milestone n="9.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Some things are said to be "the same" in this sense, but (b) others in
					an essential sense, in the same number of senses as "the one" is essentially one; for
					things whose matter is formally or numerically one, and things whose substance is one, are
					said to be the same. Thus "sameness" is clearly a kind of unity in the being, either of
					two or more things, or of one thing treated as more than one; as, e.g., when a thing is
					consistent with itself; for it is then treated as two. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "other" of which either
					the forms or the matter or the definition of essence is more than one; and in general
					"other" is used in the opposite senses to "same." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Things are
					called "different" which, while being in a sense the same, are "other" not only
					numerically, but formally or generically or analogically; also things whose genus is not
					the same; and contraries; and all things which contain "otherness" in their
						essence. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Things are called "like" which have the same attributes in all respects; or more of
					those attributes the same than different; or whose quality is one. Also that which has a
					majority or the more important of those attributes of something else in respect of which
					change is possible (i.e. the contraries) is like that thing. And "unlike" is used in the
					opposite senses to "like." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "opposite" is applied
					to (a) contradiction; (b) contraries; (c) relative terms; (d) privation; (e) state; (f)
					extremes; e.g. in the process of generation and destruction. And (g) all things which
					cannot be present at the same time in that which admits of them both are called opposites;
					either themselves or their constituents. "Grey" and "white" do not apply at the same time
					to the same thing, and hence their constituents are opposite. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Contrary" means: (a) attributes,
					generically different, which cannot apply at the same time to the same thing. (b) The most
					different attributes in the same genus; or (c) in the same subject; or (d) falling under
					the same faculty. (e) Things whose difference is greatest absolutely, or in genus, or in
						species. <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Other things are called "contrary"
					either because they possess attributes of this kind, or because they are receptive of
					them, or because they are productive of or liable to them, or actually produce or incur
					them, or are rejections or acquisitions or possessions or privations of such
						attributes. <milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since "one" and "being" have
					various meanings, all other terms which are used in relation to "one" and "being" must
					vary in meaning with them; and so "same," "other" and "contrary" must so vary, and so must
					have a separate meaning in accordance with each category. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"

					subordinate one to the other; <milestone n="1018b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"

					or (c) which contain a contrariety in their essence. <milestone n="10.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) Contraries, too (either all of them or those which are called so
					in a primary sense), are "other in species" than one another; and (e) so are all things of
					which the formulae are different in the final species of the genus (e.g., "man" and
					"horse" are generically indivisible, but their formulae are different); and (f) attributes
					of the same substance which contain a difference. "The same in species" has the opposite
					meanings to these. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Prior" and "posterior" mean: (1.) (a) In one sense (assuming that
					there is in each genus some primary thing or starting-point) that which is nearer to some
					starting-point, determined either absolutely and naturally, or relatively, or locally, or
					by some agency; e.g., things are prior in space because they are nearer either to some
					place naturally determined, such as the middle or the extreme, or to some chance relation;
					and that which is further is posterior. <milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) In
					another sense, prior or posterior in <emph>time</emph> . Some things are prior as being
					further from the present, as in the case of past events (for the Trojan is prior to the
					Persian war, because it is further distant from the present); and others as being nearer
					the present, as in the case of future events (for the Nemean are prior to the Pythian
					games because they are nearer to the present, regarded as a starting-point and as
						primary). <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="11.3" ed="P"

					to the prime mover is prior; e.g., the boy is prior to the man). This too is a kind of
					starting point in an absolute sense. (d) In respect of potency; for that which is superior
					in potency, or more potent, is prior. Such is that in accordance with whose will the

					thing built; but the science of medicine, which is a potency, may be present in the

					only if it is changed for the better). <milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) The
					power of performing this well or according to intention; because sometimes we say that
					those who can merely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they intended,
					cannot speak or walk. And similarly in the case of passivity. <milestone n="12.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All states in virtue of which things are unaffected generally, or
					are unchangeable, or cannot readily deteriorate, are called "potencies." For things are
					broken and worn out and bent and in general destroyed not through potency but through

					which takes place in another thing, or in itself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other.

					perishes is "capable" of perishing; otherwise, if it had been incapable, it would not have
					perished. As it is, it has a kind of disposition or cause or principle which induces such

					true; e.g., it is impossible that the diagonal of a square should be commensurable with
					the sides, because such a thing is a lie, whose contrary is not only true but inevitable.
					Hence that it is commensurable is not only a lie but necessarily a lie. <milestone

					source of change which exists in something other than that in which the change takes

						cannot bear.</note> because something else has such a <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
					/>potency over them; others because it does not possess it; others because it possesses it
					in a particular way. The term "impotent" is similarly used. Thus the authoritative
					definition of "potency" in the primary sense will be "a principle producing change, which
					is in something other than that in which the change takes place, or in the same thing <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> other." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Quantity" means that which is divisible into constituent parts,
						each<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., if there are only two.</note> or every
					one of which is by nature some one individual thing. Thus plurality, if it is numerically
					calculable, is a kind of quantity; and so is magnitude, if it is measurable. "Plurality"
					means that which is potentially divisible into non-continuous parts; and "magnitude" that
					which is potentially divisible into continuous parts. Of kinds of magnitude, that which is
					continuous in one direction is length; in two directions, breadth; in three,
						depth. <milestone n="13.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of these, plurality, when
					limited, is a number; length, a line; breadth, a plane; depth, a body. Again, some things
					are essentially quantitative, but others only accidentally; e.g. the line is essentially,
					but "cultured" accidentally quantitative. <milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					of the former class some are quantitative in virtue of their substance, e.g. the fine
					(because the definition which describes it is quantitative in some form); <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and others are attributes and conditions of a substance of this
					kind— e.g., "much" and "little," "long" and "short," "broad" and "narrow," "deep"
					and "shallow," "heavy" and "light," etc. <milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Moreover, "great" and "small," and "greater" and "smaller," whether used absolutely or
					relatively to one another, are essential attributes of quantity; by an extension of
					meaning, however, these terms are also applied to other things. <milestone n="13.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Of things called quantitative in an accidental sense, one kind is so
					called in the sense in which we said above that "cultured" or "white" is
					quantitative—because the subject to which they belong is quantitative; and others in
					the sense that motion and time are so called—for these too are said in a sense to be
					quantitative and continuous, since the subjects of which they are attributes are
					divisible. I mean, not the thing moved, but that through or along which the motion has
					taken place; for it is because the latter is quantitative that the motion is quantitative,
					and because the motion is quantitative that the time is also. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="14.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Quality" means (a) in one sense, the
					differentia of essence; e.g., a man is an animal of a certain quality because he is
					two-footed; and so is a horse, because it is four-footed. Also a circle is a geometrical
					figure of a certain quality, because it has no angles; <milestone n="1020b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which shows that the essential differentia
					is quality. <milestone n="14.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In this one sense, then, "quality"
					means differentia of essence; but (b) in another it is used as of immovable and
					mathematical objects, in the sense that numbers are in a way qualitative—e.g. such
					as are composite and are represented geometrically not by a line but by a plane or solid
					(these are products respectively of two and of three factors)—and in general means
					that which is present besides quantity in the essence. For the essence of each number is
					that which goes into it once; e.g. that of 6 is not what goes twice or three times, but
					what goes once; for 6 is once 6. <milestone n="14.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All
					affections of substance in motion in respect of which bodies become different when they
					(the affections) change—e.g. heat and cold, whiteness and blackness, heaviness and
					lightness, etc. (d) The term is used with reference to goodness and badness, and in
					general to good and bad. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="14.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus there are, roughly speaking, two meanings which the term
					"quality" can bear, and of these one is more fundamental than the other. Quality in the
					primary sense is the differentia of the essence; and quality in numbers falls under this
					sense, because it is a kind of differentia of essences, but of things either not in motion
					or not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> in motion. Secondly, there are the affections of things
					in motion <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> in motion, and the differentiae of motions. <milestone
						n="14.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Goodness and badness fall under these
						affections, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they denote differentiae
					of the motion or functioning in respect of which things in motion act or are acted upon
					well or badly. For that which can function or be moved in such-and-such a way is good, and
					that which can function in such-and-such a way and in the contrary way is bad. Quality
					refers especially to "good" and "bad" in the case of living things, and of these
					especially in the case of such as possess choice. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone
						n="15.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "relative" (a) In the sense that
					"the double" is relative to the half, and "the triple" to the third; and in general the
					"many times greater" to the "many times smaller," and that which exceeds to the thing
					exceeded. (b) In the sense that the thing which heats or cuts is relative to the thing
					heated or cut; and in general the active to the passive. (c) In the sense that the
					measurable is relative to the measure, and the knowable to knowledge, and the sensible to
						sensation. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>(a) In the first sense they are said to be numerically relative; either simply, or in a
					definite relation to numbers or to 1. E.g., "the double" in relation to 1 is a definite
					number; the "many times as great" is in a numerical relation to 1, but not in a definite
					relation such as <emph>this</emph> or <emph>that</emph> ; <milestone n="1021a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="15.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>the relation of that which is 1.5 times something else to that
					something is a definite numerical relation to a number; and that which is (n+1)/n times
					something else is in an indefinite relation to a number, just as "the many times as great"
					is in an indefinite relation to 1. <milestone n="15.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					relation of that which exceeds to that which is exceeded is numerically quite indefinite,
					for number is commensurate, and is not predicated of the incommensurate; whereas that
					which exceeds, in relation to that which is exceeded, is "so much" plus something more;
					and this something more is indefinite, for it is indifferently equal or not equal to the
					"so much." <milestone n="15.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus not only are all these things
					said to be relative in respect of number, but also the "equal" and "like" and "same,"
					though in another way: for all these terms are used in respect of "one". Things are "the
					same" whose essence is one; "like" whose quality is one; "equal" whose quantity is one.
					Now "one" is the starting-point and standard of number; and so all these relations involve
					number, though not all in the same way. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.6"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) Active and passive things are called relative in virtue of
					an active or passive potentiality or actualization of the potentialities; e.g., that which
					can heat is called relative to that which can be heated, because it can heat; and again
					the thing heating is called relative to the thing heated, and the thing cutting to the
					thing cut, because their potentialities are actualized. Numerical relations, on the other
					hand, are not actualized <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(except as has been
					described elsewhere)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reference is quite
						uncertain, but cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 9.1051a">Aristot. Met. 9.9.4, 5</bibl>. The
						point is that the actualization of a numerical (or geometrical) relation does not imply
						an active functioning, as in the case of the potentialities just described.</note>; they
					have no actualizations in respect of motion. <milestone n="15.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Of things potentially relative, some are further relative in respect of particular
					times; as, e.g., that which has made or will make is relative to that which has been or
					will be made. It is in this way that a father is called father of a son; the one has
					acted, and the other has been acted upon, in a particular way. Again, some things are
					relative in virtue of a privation of their potentiality; such is "the impossible" and all
					similar terms, e.g. "the invisible." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.8"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus relative terms which involve number and potentiality are
					all relative because their very essence contains a reference to something else; but not
					because something else is related to their essence. But (c) that which is measurable or
					knowable or thinkable is called relative because something else is related to its
						essence. <milestone n="15.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For "thinkable" signifies that
					there is a thought which thinks it; but thought is not relative to that of which it is the
					thought (for then the same thing would have been said twice). And similarly sight is the
					sight of something; not of that of which it is the sight, although this is of course
					true—it is relative to some color or other similar thing. <milestone n="15.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>To describe it in the other way—"the sight of the object of
					sight"—would be to say the same thing twice. <milestone n="1021b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Things, then, which are called relative of
					their own nature are so called, some in these senses, and others because the classes which
					contain them are of this kind. E.g., medicine is reckoned as relative because its genus,
					science, is thought to be a relative thing. <milestone n="15.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Further, there are the properties in virtue of which the things which possess them are
					called relative; e.g., "equality" is relative because "the equal" is relative, and
					"similarity" because "the similar" is relative. Other things are accidentally relative;
					e.g., a man is relative because he happens to be "double" something else, and "double" is
					a relative term; or "white" is relative if the same thing happens to be white as well as
						double. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="16.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>"Perfect" &lt;or "complete"&gt; means: (a) That outside which it is impossible to find
					even a single one of its parts; e.g., the complete time of each thing is that outside
					which it is impossible to find any time which is a part of it. (b) That which, in respect
					of goodness or excellence, cannot be surpassed in its kind; e.g., a doctor and a musician
					are "perfect" when they have no deficiency in respect of the form of their peculiar
						excellence. <milestone n="16.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And thus by an extension of the
					meaning we use the term in a bad connection, and speak of a "perfect" humbug and a
					"perfect" thief; since indeed we call them "good"— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>e.g. a "good" thief and a "good" humbug. <milestone n="16.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) And goodness is a kind of perfection. For each thing, and every
					substance, is perfect when, and only when, in respect of the form of its peculiar
					excellence, it lacks no particle of its natural magnitude. (d) Things which have attained
					their end, if their end is good, are called "perfect"; for they are perfect in virtue of
					having attained the end. <milestone n="16.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, since the end
					is an ultimate thing, we extend the meaning of the term to bad senses, and speak of
					perishing "perfectly" or being "perfectly" destroyed, when the destruction or calamity
					falls short in no respect but reaches its extremity. Hence, by an extension of the
					meaning, death is called an "end," because they are both ultimate things. And the ultimate
					object of action is also an end. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="16.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Things, then, which are called "perfect" in themselves are so called
					in all these senses; either because in respect of excellence they have no deficiency and
					cannot be surpassed, and because no part of them can be found outside them; or because, in
					general, they are unsurpassed in each particular class, and have no part outside.
						<milestone n="1022a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>All other
					things are so called in virtue of these, because they either produce or possess something
					of this kind, or conform to it, or are referred in some way or other to things which are
					perfect in the primary sense. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="17.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Limit" means: (a) The furthest part of each thing, and the first
					point outside which no part of a thing can be found, and the first point within which all
					parts are contained. (b) Any form of magnitude or of something possessing
						magnitude. <milestone n="17.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The end of each thing. (This
					end is that <emph>to</emph> which motion and action proceed, and not the end
						<emph>from</emph> which. But sometimes it is both the end from which and the end to
					which, i.e. the final cause.) (d) The reality or essence of each thing; for this is the
					limit of our knowledge of it, and if it is a limit of the knowledge, it is also a limit of
					the thing. Thus it is obvious that "limit" has not only as many senses as "beginning" but
					even more; because the beginning is a kind of limit, but not every limit is a
						beginning. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="18.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>"That in virtue of which" has various meanings. (a) The form or essence of each
					individual thing; e.g., that in virtue of which a man is good is "goodness itself." (b)
					The immediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e.g., color is
					produced in the surface of things. Thus "that in virtue of which" in the primary sense is
					the <emph>form</emph> , and in the secondary sense, as it were, the <emph>matter</emph> of
					each thing, and the immediate substrate. <milestone n="18.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					in general "that in virtue of which" will exist in the same number of senses as
						"cause." <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we say indifferently "in virtue
					of what has he come?" or "for what reason has he come?" and "in virtue of what has he
					inferred or inferred falsely?" or "what is the cause of his inference or false inference?"
					(And further, there is the positional sense of <foreign lang="greek">kaq' o(/</foreign>,
					"in which he stands," or "in which he walks"; all these examples denote place or
						position.) <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="18.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Hence "in virtue of itself" must also have various meanings. It denotes (a) The essence
					of each particular; e.g., Callias is in virtue of himself Callias and the essence of
					Callias. (b) Everything contained in the definition; e.g., Callias is in virtue of himself
					an animal, because "animal" is present in the definition, since Callias is a kind of
						animal. <milestone n="18.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) Any attribute which a thing has
					received directly in itself or in any of its parts; e.g., the surface is white in virtue
					of itself; and man lives in virtue of himself, because the soul is a part of the man, and
					life is directly contained in it. (d) That which has no other cause. Man has many causes:
					"animal," "twofooted," etc.; but nevertheless man is in virtue of himself man. (e) All
					things which belong to a thing alone and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> alone; and hence that
					which is separate is "in virtue of itself."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This
						seems to be a slightly irrelevant reference to <foreign lang="greek">kaq'

						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="19.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Disposition" means
					arrangement of that which has parts, either in space or in potentiality or in form. It
					must be a kind of position, as indeed is clear from the word, "disposition." <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Having"<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">(/ecis</foreign> means not only
						"having" but "habit" or "state." Cf. Latin, habitus.</note> means (a) In one sense an
					activity, as it were, of the haver and the thing had, or as in the case of an action or
					motion; for when one thing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of
					making. In this way between the man who has a garment and the garment which is had, there
					is a "having." Clearly, then, it is impossible to <emph>have</emph> a "having" in this
					sense; for there will be an infinite series if we can have the having of what we
						have. <milestone n="20.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But (b) there is another sense of
					"having" which means a disposition, in virtue of which the thing which is disposed is
					disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else. E.g.,
					health is a state, since it is a disposition of the kind described. Further, any part of
					such a disposition is called a state; and hence the excellence of the parts is a kind of
						state. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="21.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>"Affection" means (a) In one sense, a quality in virtue of which alteration is possible;
					e.g., whiteness and blackness, sweetness and bitterness, heaviness and lightness, etc. (b)
					The actualizations of these qualities; i.e. the alterations already realized. (c) More
					particularly, hurtful alterations and motions, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>and especially hurts which cause suffering. (d) Extreme cases of misfortune and
					suffering are called "affections."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The English

						or "disaster."</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="22.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>We speak of "privation": (a) In one sense, if a thing does not possess
					an attribute which is a natural possession, even if the thing itself would not naturally
					possess it<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is not a proper sense of privation,
						as Aristotle implies by choosing an example from everyday speech.</note>; e.g., we say
					that a vegetable is "deprived" of eyes. (b) If a thing does not possess an attribute which
					it or its genus would naturally possess. E.g., a blind man is not "deprived" of sight in
					the same sense that a mole is; the latter is "deprived" in virtue of its genus, but the
					former in virtue of himself.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., a mole is blind
						as being a member of a blind genus, whereas a man is blind only as an individual. Of
						course moles are not really blind, but we still speak as though they
						were.</note> <milestone n="22.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) If a thing has not an
					attribute which it would naturally possess, and when it would naturally possess it (for
					blindness is a form of privation; but a man is not blind at <emph>any</emph> age, but only
					if he lacks sight at the age when he would naturally possess it<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The qualification refers, I suppose, to the fact that an embryo does not

						anchored="yes">The subject seems to be indefinite, but no doubt Aristotle is thinking
						primarily of the particular example which he has just given. A man "is not called blind
						if he does not see in the dark, or if he does not see with his ears, or if he does not
						see sound, or if he does not see what is behind him or too far away" ( Ross).</note>
					lacks an attribute in the medium and organ and relation and manner in which it would
					naturally possess it. <milestone n="22.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The forcible removal
					of anything is called privation. (e) Privation has as many senses as there are senses of
					negation derived from the negative affix (<foreign lang="greek">a)</foreign>-). For we
					call a thing "unequal" because it does not possess equality (though it would naturally do
					so); and "invisible" either because it has no color at all or because it has only a faint
					one; and "footless" either because it has no feet at all or because it has rudimentary
						feet. <milestone n="22.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a negative affix may mean
					"having something in a small degree"—e.g. "stoneless"— <milestone n="1023a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that is, having it in some
					rudimentary manner. Again, it may mean having it "not easily" or "not well"; e.g.,
					"uncutable" means not only that which cannot be cut, but that which cannot be cut easily
					or well. And again, it may mean not having a thing at all; for it is not the one-eyed man,
					but the man who lacks sight in both eyes, who is called blind. Hence not every man is good
					or bad, moral or immoral; there is also the intermediate state. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="23.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"To have" &lt;or "possess"&gt;
					is used in various senses. (a) To direct in accordance with one's own nature or impulse;
					whence we say that fever "possesses" a man, and despots "possess" cities, and people who
					wear clothes "possess" them. (b) We speak of anything as "having" in which, as receptive
					material, something is present. E.g., the bronze "has" the shape of the statue, and the
					body "has" the disease. <milestone n="23.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) In the sense that
					the container holds the contained; for when A is contained in B, we say that A is held by
					B. E.g., we say that the vessel holds the liquid, and the city holds men, and the ship
					holds sailors, and so too that the whole "holds" the parts. <milestone n="23.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The same term is applied to that which prevents anything from
					moving or acting in accordance with its own impulse; as pillars hold &lt;up&gt; the
					weights which are imposed upon them, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and as the
					poets make Atlas<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Hes. Th. 517">Hes. Th.

						unit="para"/><milestone n="24.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"To come from something"
					means: (a) In one sense, to come from something as matter, and this in two ways: in
					respect either of the primary genus or of the ultimate species. E.g., in the one sense
					everything liquefiable comes from water, and in the other the statue comes from
						bronze. <milestone n="24.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) To come from something as the
					first moving principle; e.g., "from what comes fighting?" From abuse; because this is the
					beginning of a fight. (c) To come from the combination of matter and form (as the parts
					come from the whole, and the verse from the <title> Iliad </title>, and the stones from
					the house); for the shape is an end, and that is a complete thing which has attained its
						end. <milestone n="24.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) In the sense that the form is made
					out of the part of its definition; as, e.g., "man" is made out of "two-footed " and the
					syllable out of its element<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In the sense that
							<foreign lang="greek">stoixei=on</foreign>("letter") forms part of the definition of

					the bronze; <milestone n="1023b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>for the composite entity is made out of perceptible material, but the form is also made
					out of the material of the form). <milestone n="24.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These, then,
					are some of the meanings of "from" &lt;or "out of"&gt;, but (e) sometimes one of these
					senses only partially applies; e.g., the child comes from the father and mother, and
					plants from the earth, because they come from some part of those things. (f) It means
					"after" in time; e.g., we say that night comes from day, and storm from fine weather,
					because one comes after the other. <milestone n="24.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And we
					speak thus of some of these things in view of their alternation with each other, as in the
					examples just mentioned, and of others in view merely of their succession in time; e.g.,
					"the voyage was made from the equinox," meaning that it was made after it; and "the
					Thargelia are from the Dionysia," meaning after the Dionysia.<note resp="Tredennick"

						/><milestone n="25.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Part" means: (a) That into which a
					quantity can be in any way divided; for that which is taken from a quantity <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantity is always called a part of that quantity—e.g., we
					call 2 part (in a sense) of 3. (b) In another sense the term is only applied to those
					"parts" in sense (a) which measure the whole; hence in one sense we call 2 part of 3, and
					in another not. <milestone n="25.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, (c) those divisions
					into which the form, apart from quantity, can be divided, are also called parts of the
					form. Hence species are called parts of their genus. (d) That into which the
						whole <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(either the form or that which contains
					the form) is divided, or of which it is composed. E.g., of a bronze sphere or cube not
					only is the bronze <milestone n="25.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(i.e. the material which
					contains the form) a part, but also the angle. (e) The elements in the definition of each
					thing are also called parts of the whole. Hence the genus is even called a part of the
					species, whereas in another sense the species is part of the genus. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="26.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Whole" means: (a) That from
					which no part is lacking of those things as composed of which it is called a natural
					whole. (b) That which so contains its contents that they form a unity; and this in two
					ways, either in the sense that each of them is a unity, or in the sense that the unity is
					composed of them. <milestone n="26.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For (i) the universal, or
					term generally applied as being some whole thing, is universal in the sense that it
					contains many particulars; because it is predicated of each of them, and each and all of
					them (e.g. man, horse, god) are one; because they are all living things. And (2) that
					which is continuous and limited is a whole when it is a unity composed of several parts
					(especially if the parts are only potentially present in it; but otherwise even if they
					are present actually). <milestone n="26.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of these things
					themselves, those which are so naturally are more truly wholes than those which are so
					artificially; just as we said of "the one," because "wholeness" is a kind of "oneness."
						<milestone n="1024a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Again,
					since a quantity has a beginning, middle and end, those to which position makes no
					difference we describe as "all," and those to which position makes a difference we
					describe as "whole," and those to which both descriptions can be applied, as both "all"
					and "whole." <milestone n="26.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These are all things whose nature
					remains the same in transposition, but whose shape does not; e.g. wax or a coat. They are
					described as both "whole" and "all"; for they have both characteristics. Water, however,
					and all liquids, and number, are described as "all"; we do not speak of a "whole number"
					or "whole water" except by an extension of meaning. Things are described as "all" in the
					plural <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> differentiated which are described as "all" in the
					singular <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> one; all this number, all these units. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="27.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We do not describe any
					chance quantity as "mutilated"; it must have parts, and must be a whole. The number 2 is
					not mutilated if one of its 1's is taken away—because the part lost by mutilation is
					never equal to the remainder—nor in general is any number mutilated; because the
					essence must persist. If a cup is mutilated, it must still be a cup; but the number is no
					longer the same. <milestone n="27.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, not even all things
					which have dissimilar parts are mutilated; for a number has in a sense dissimilar as well
					as similar parts—e.g. 2, 3. But in general of things whose position makes no
					difference, e.g. water or fire, none is mutilated;— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>to be mutilated, things must be such as have their position according to
					their essence. <milestone n="27.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, they must be
					continuous; for a musical scale is composed of dissimilar parts, and has position; but it
					does not become mutilated. Moreover, even things which are wholes are not mutilated by the
					removal of <emph>any</emph> of their parts; the parts removed must be neither proper to
					their essence nor in any chance location. E.g., a cup is not mutilated if a hole is made
					in it, but only if the handle or some projection is broken; <milestone n="27.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>and a man is not mutilated if he loses flesh or his spleen, but if he
					loses some extremity; and not every extremity, but only such as cannot grow again when
					completely removed. Hence bald people are not mutilated. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="28.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "genus" &lt;or "race"&gt; is
					used: (a) When there is a continuous generation of things of the same type; e.g., "as long
					as the human <emph>race</emph> exists" means "as long as the generation of human beings is
					continuous." (b) Of anything from which things derive their being as the prime mover of
					them into being. Thus some are called Hellenes by race, and others Ionians, because some

						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) In the sense that in formulae the first component, which is
					stated as part of the essence, is the genus, and the qualities are said to be its

					continuous generation of the same type; (b) in respect of the first mover of the same type
					as the things which it moves; (c) in the sense of material. For that to which the
					differentia or quality belongs is the substrate, which we call material. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="28.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "generically
					different" whose immediate substrates are different and cannot be resolved one into the
					other or both into the same thing. E.g., form and matter are generically different, and
					all things which belong to different categories of being; for some of the things of which
					being is predicated denote the essence, others a quality, and others the various other
					things which have already been distinguished. For these also cannot be resolved either
					into each other or into any one thing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="29.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"False" means: (i) false as a <emph>thing</emph> ; (a) because
					it is not or cannot be substantiated; such are the statements that the diagonal of a
					square is commensurable, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or that you are
					sitting. Of these one is false always, and the other sometimes; it is in these senses that
					these things are not facts. <milestone n="29.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) Such things as
					really exist, but whose nature it is to seem either such as they are not, or like things
					which are unreal; e.g. chiaroscuro and dreams. For these are really something, but not
					that of which they create the impression. Things, then, are called false in these senses:
					either because they themselves are unreal, or because the impression derived from them is
					that of something unreal. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="29.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) A false statement is the statement of <emph>what is not</emph>,
					in so far as the statement is false. Hence every definition is untrue of anything other
					than that of which it is true; e.g., the definition of a circle is untrue of a triangle.
					Now in one sense there is only one definition of each thing, namely that of its essence;
					but in another sense there are many definitions,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>Here Aristotle is using the word <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> not in the

						unit="Loeb chap"/>But the false definition is not strictly a definition of anything.
					Hence it was foolish of Antisthenes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Cynic;
						contemporary and renegade "disciple" of Socrates. He taught that definition, and even

					it is possible to describe everything not only by its own definition but by that of

					A false man is one who readily and deliberately makes such statements, for the sake of
					doing so and for no other reason; and one who induces such statements in others—just
					as we call things false which induce a false impression. Hence the proof in the

							n="Plat. Hipp. Min        365">Plat. Hipp. Min 365-375</bibl>.</note> that the same

					assumes (a) that the false man is he who is <emph>able</emph> to deceive, i.e. the man who
					knows and is intelligent; (b) that the man who is willingly bad is better. This false
					assumption is due to the induction; for when he says that the man who limps willingly is
					better than he who does so unwillingly, he means by limping <emph>pretending</emph> to
					limp. For if he is willingly lame, he is presumably worse in this case just as he is in
					the case of moral character. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="30.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>"Accident" &lt;or "attribute"&gt; means that which applies to
					something and is truly stated, but neither necessarily nor usually; as if, for example,
					while digging a hole for a plant one found a treasure. Then the finding of treasure is an
					accident to the man who is digging the hole; for the one thing is not a necessary
					consequence or sequel of the other, nor does one usually find treasure while
						planting. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="30.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And a cultured man might be white; but since this does not happen
					necessarily or usually, we call it an accident. Thus since there are attributes and
					subjects, and some attributes apply to their subjects only at a certain place and time,
					any attribute which applies to a subject, but not because it was a particular subject or
					time or place, will be an accident. <milestone n="30.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor is
					there any definite cause for an accident, but only a chance, i.e. indefinite, cause. It
					was by accident that X went to <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName> if

					his course by a storm, or captured by pirates. <milestone n="30.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"

					intellectual science or science which involves intellect deals with causes and principles,
					more or less exactly or simply considered. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					all these sciences single out some existent thing or class, and concern themselves with
					that; not with Being unqualified, nor <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, nor do they give
					any account of the essence; but starting from it, some making it clear to perception, and
					others assuming it as a hypothesis, they demonstrate, more or less cogently, the essential
					attributes of the class with which they are dealing. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence obviously there is no demonstration of substance or essence from
					this method of approach, but some other means of exhibiting it. And similarly they say
					nothing as to whether the class of objects with which they are concerned exists or not;
					because the demonstration of its essence and that of its existence belong to the same
					intellectual process. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since physical
					science also happens to deal with a genus of Being <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>(for it deals with the sort of substance which contains in itself the
					principle of motion and rest), obviously it is neither a practical nor a productive
						science. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in the case of things produced
					the principle of motion (either mind or art or some kind of potency) is in the producer;
					and in the case of things done the will is the agent—for the thing done and the
					thing willed are the same. Thus if every intellectual activity is either practical or
					productive or speculative, physics will be a speculative science; but speculative about
					that kind of Being which can be moved, and about formulated substance for the most part
					only <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> inseparable from matter. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But we must not fail to observe <emph>how</emph> the essence and the
					formula exist, since without this our inquiry is ineffectual. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
					/>Now of things defined, i.e. of essences, some apply in the sense that "snub" does, and
					some in the sense that "concave" does. The difference is that "snub" is a combination of
					form with matter; because the "snub" is a concave <emph>nose</emph> , whereas concavity is
					independent of sensible matter. <milestone n="1026a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if all physical
					terms are used in the same sense as "snub"—e.g. nose, eye, face, flesh, bone, and in
					general animal; leaf, root, bark, and in general vegetable (for not one of these has a
					definition without motion; the definition invariably includes matter)—it is clear
					how we should look for and define the essence in physical things, and why it is the
					province of the physicist to study even some aspects of the soul, so far as it is not
					independent of matter. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious, then, from these considerations, that physics is a form
					of speculative science. And mathematics is also speculative; but it is not clear at
					present whether its objects are immutable and separable from matter; it is clear, however,
					that some branches of mathematics study their objects <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> immutable
					and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> separable from matter. Obviously it is the province of a
					speculative science to discover whether a thing is eternal and immutable and separable
					from matter; <milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>not, however, of physics (since
					physics deals with mutable objects) nor of mathematics, but of a science prior to both.
					For physics deals with things which exist separately but are not immutable; and some
					branches of mathematics deal with things which are immutable, but presumably not
					separable, but present in matter; but the primary science treats of things which are both
					separable and immutable. <milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now all causes must
					be eternal, but these especially; since they are the causes of what is visible of things
					divine. Hence there will be three speculative philosophies: mathematics, physics, and
						theology— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since it is obvious that if
					the divine is present anywhere, it is present in this kind of entity; and also the most
					honorable science must deal with the most honorable class of subject. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The speculative sciences,
					then, are to be preferred to the other sciences, and "theology" to the other speculative
					sciences. One might indeed raise the question whether the primary philosophy is universal
					or deals with some one genus or entity; because even the mathematical sciences differ in
					this respect—geometry and astronomy deal with a particular kind of entity, whereas
					universal mathematics applies to all kinds alike. <milestone n="1.12" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if there is not some other substance besides those which are
					naturally composed, physics will be the primary science; but if there is a substance which
					is immutable, the science which studies this will be prior to physics, and will be primary
					philosophy, and universal in this sense, that it is primary. And it will be the province
					of this science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; what it is, and what the
					attributes are which belong to it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since the simple term
					"being" is used in various senses, of which we saw that one was <emph>accidental</emph> ,
					and another <emph>true</emph> (not-being being used in the sense of "false"); and since

						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and further besides all these the <emph>potential</emph> and
						<emph>actual</emph> : since the term "being" has various senses, it must first be said
					of what "is" accidentally, that there can be no speculation about it. <milestone n="2.2"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is shown by the fact that no science, whether practical,
					productive or speculative, concerns itself with it. The man who produces a house does not
					produce all the attributes which are accidental to the house in its construction; for they
					are infinite in number. There is no reason why the house so produced should not be
					agreeable to some, injurious to others, and beneficial to others, and different perhaps
					from every other existing thing; but the act of building is productive of none of these
						results. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same way the geometrician
					does not study the accidental attributes of his figures, nor whether a triangle is
					different from a triangle the sum of whose angles is equal to two right angles. And this
					accords with what we should reasonably expect, because "accident" is only, as it were, a
					sort of name. Hence in a way Plato<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl

					must state further, so far as it is possible, with regard to the accidental, what its

					confectioner's art. Hence, we say, it was accidental; and he produces it in a sense, but
					not in an unqualified sense. <milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For there are
					potencies which produce other things, but there is no art or determinate potency of

						accidental. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, since not everything is
					or comes to be of necessity and always, but most things happen usually, the accidental
					must exist. E.g., the white man is neither always nor usually cultured; but since this
					sometimes happens, it must be regarded as accidental. Otherwise, everything must be

					not be able to state the exception to the rule: when it is not beneficial—e.g. at

					this if he gets thirsty; and this if something else happens; and thus we shall come to
					what is the case now, or to something which has already happened. E.g. "if he is thirsty";
					this will happen if he is eating pungent food, and this is either the case or
						not. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus of necessity he will either die or
					not die. And similarly if one jumps over to the past, the principle is the same; for
					this—I mean that which has just happened—is already present in something.
					Everything, then, which is to be, will be of necessity; e.g., he who is alive must
					die—for some stage of the process has been reached already; e.g., the contraries are
					present in the same body—but whether by disease or violence is not yet determined;
					it depends upon whether so-and-so happens. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Clearly, then, the series goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to
					something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing
					else is the cause of its generation. But to what sort of starting-point and cause this
					process of tracing back leads, whether to a material or final or moving cause, is a
					question for careful consideration. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So much, then, for the accidental sense of "being"; we have
					defined it sufficiently. As for "being" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> truth, and "not-being"
						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> falsity, since they depend upon combination and
						separation, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and taken together are concerned
					with the arrangement of the parts of a contradiction (since the true has affirmation when
					the subject and predicate are combined, and negation where they are divided; but the false
					has the contrary arrangement. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>How it happens
					that we combine or separate in thought is another question. By "combining or separating in
					thought" I mean thinking them not as a succession but as a unity<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">sc., "or not as a unity but as a succession" (this is
							<emph>separating</emph> in thought).</note>); for "falsity" and "truth" are not in
						<emph>things</emph> —the good, for example, being true, and the bad
					false—but in <emph>thought</emph> ; and with regard to simple concepts and essences
					there is no truth or falsity even in thought; <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>—what points we must study in connection with being and not-being in this sense,
					we must consider later. But since the combination and separation exists in thought and not
					in things, and this sense of "being" is different from the proper senses (since thought
					attaches or detaches essence or quality or quantity or some other category), we may
					dismiss the accidental and real senses<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the
						senses in which the verb "to be" is used to express an accidental or a true
						relation.</note> of "being." <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the cause of
					the one is indeterminate and of the other an affection of thought; <milestone n="1028a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and both are connected with
					the remaining genus of "being," and do not indicate any objective reality. Let us
					therefore dismiss them, and consider the causes and principles of Being itself <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being. [We have made it clear in our distinction of the number of
					senses in which each term is used that "being" has several senses.]<note resp="Tredennick"

					"being" has several senses, which we have classified in our discussion<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1017a">Aristot. Met.
							5.7</bibl>.</note> of the number of senses in which terms are used. It denotes first
					the " <emph>what</emph> " of a thing, i.e. the individuality; and then the quality or
					quantity or any other such category. Now of all these senses which "being" has, the
					primary sense is clearly the "what," which denotes the <emph>substance</emph>
					<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(because when we describe the quality of a
					particular thing we say that it is "good or bad," and not "five feet high" or "a man"; but
					when we describe <emph>what</emph> it is, we say not that it is "white" or "hot" or "five
					feet high," but that it is "a man" or "a god"), and all other things are said to "be"
					because they are either quantities or qualities or affections or some other such
						thing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence one might raise the question whether
					the terms "to walk" and "to be well" and "to sit" signify each of these things as "being,"
					or not; and similarly in the case of any other such terms; for not one of them by nature
					has an independent existence or can be separated from its substance. Rather, if anything
					it is the <emph>thing</emph> which walks or sits or is well that is existent. <milestone
						n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason why these things are more truly existent is
					because their subject is something definite; i.e. the substance and the individual, which
					is clearly implied in a designation of this kind, since apart from it we cannot speak of
					"the good" or "sitting." Clearly then it is by reason of the substance that each of the
					things referred to exists. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence that which
						<emph>is</emph> primarily, not in a qualified sense but absolutely, will be
						substance. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now "primary" has several meanings; but
					nevertheless substance is primary in all senses, both in definition and in knowledge and
					in time. For none of the other categories can exist separately, but substance
						alone; <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and it is primary also in definition,
					because in the formula of each thing the formula of substance must be inherent; and we
					assume that we know each particular thing most truly when we know <emph>what</emph> "man"
					or "fire" is— <milestone n="1028b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>rather than its quality or quantity or position; because we know each of
					these points too when we know <emph>what</emph> the quantity or quality is. <milestone
						n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed, the question which was raised long ago, is
					still and always will be, and which always baffles us—"What is Being?"—is in
					other words "What is substance?" Some say that it is one<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The Milesians and Eleatics.</note>; others, more than one; some,
						finite<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and Empedocles.</note>;
					others, infinite.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Anaxagoras and the
						Atomists.</note> And so for us too our chief and primary and practically our only
					concern is to investigate the nature of "being" in the sense of substance. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Substance is thought to
					be present most obviously in bodies. Hence we call animals and plants and their parts
					substances, and also natural bodies, such as fire, water, earth, etc., and all things
					which are parts of these or composed of these, either of parts or them or of their
					totality; e.g. the visible universe and its parts, the stars and moon and sun. <milestone
						n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must consider whether (a) these are the only
					substances, or (b) these and some others, or (c) some of these, or (d) some of these and
					some others, or (e) none of these, but certain others. Some<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans.</note> hold that the bounds of body—i.e. the
					surface, line, point and unit—are substances, and in a truer sense than body or the
						solid. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, some<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The pre-Socratics.</note> believe that there is nothing of this kind
					besides sensible things, while others believe in eternal entities more numerous and more
					real than sensible things. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus Plato posited
					the Forms and the objects of mathematics as two kinds of substance, and as a third the
					substance of sensible bodies; <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and
						Speusippus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Plato's nephew and successor as the
						head of the Academy.</note> assumed still more kinds of substances, starting with "the
					One," and positing principles for each kind: one for numbers, another for magnitudes, and
					then another for the soul. In this way he multiplies the kinds of substance. Some<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The followers of Xenocrates, successor to
						Speusippus.</note> again hold that the Forms and numbers have the same nature, and that
					other things—lines and planes—are dependent upon them; and soon back to the
					substance of the visible universe and sensible things. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>We must consider, then, with regard to these matters, which of the
					views expressed is right and which wrong; and what things are substances; and whether
					there are any substances besides the sensible substances, or not; and how sensible
					substances exist; and whether there is any separable substance (and if so, why and how) or
					no substance besides the sensible ones. We must first give a rough sketch of what
					substance is. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>The term "substance" is used, if not in more, at least in four principal cases; for both
					the essence and the universal and the genus are held to be the substance of the
					particular, and fourthly the substrate. The substrate is that of which the rest are
					predicated, while it is not itself predicated of anything else. Hence we must first
					determine its nature, <milestone n="1029a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>for the primary substrate is considered to be in the truest sense
						substance. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now
					in one sense we call the <emph>matter</emph> the substrate; in another, the
						<emph>shape</emph> ; and in a third, the combination of the two. By matter I mean, for
					instance, bronze; by shape, the arrangement of the form; and by the combination of the
					two, the concrete thing: the statue. Thus if the form is prior to the matter and more
					truly existent, by the same argument it will also be prior to the combination. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now stated in
					outline the nature of substance—that it is not that which is predicated of a
					subject, but that of which the other things are predicated. But we must not merely define
					it so, for it is not enough. Not only is the statement itself obscure, but also it makes
					matter substance; for if matter is not substance, it is beyond our power to say what else
						is. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For when everything else is removed,
					clearly nothing but matter remains; because all the other things are affections, products
					and potencies of bodies, and length, breadth and depth are kinds of quantity, and not
					substances. For quantity is not a substance; rather the substance is that to which these
					affections primarily belong. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when we take
					away length and breadth and depth we can see no thing remaining, unless it be the
					something bounded by them; so that on this view matter must appear to be the only
						substance. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>By matter I mean that which in
					itself is neither a particular thing nor a quantity nor designated by any of the
					categories which define Being. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For there is
					something of which each of these is predicated, whose being is different from that of each
					one of the categories; because all other things are predicated of substance, but this is
					predicated of matter. Thus the ultimate substrate is in itself neither a particular thing
					nor a quantity nor anything else. Nor indeed is it the negations of these; for the
					negations too will only apply to it accidentally. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone
						n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If we hold this view, it follows that matter is
					substance. But this is impossible; for it is accepted that separability and individuality
					belong especially to substance. Hence it would seem that the form and the combination of
					form and matter are more truly substance than matter is. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The substance, then, which consists of both—I mean of matter and
					form—may be dismissed, since it is posterior and obvious. Matter too is in a sense
					evident. We must consider the third type, for this is the most perplexing. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is agreed that some sensible things are substances, and so we
					should begin our inquiry in connection with these. <milestone n="1029b" unit="section"

					/>It is convenient to advance to the more intelligible<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">sc. by nature. All learning proceeds by induction from that which is
						intelligible to <emph>us</emph> (i.e., the complex facts and objects of our experience,
						which are bound up with sensation and therefore less intelligible in themselves), to
						that which is intelligible in itself (i.e., the simple universal principles of
						scientific knowledge).</note>; for learning is always acquired in this way, by advancing
					through what is less intelligible by nature to what is more so. And just as in actions it
					is our task to start from the good of the individual and make absolute good good for the
						individual,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1129b"
							>Aristot. Ethics 1129b 5</bibl>.</note> so it is our task to start from what is more
					intelligible to oneself and make what is by nature intelligible intelligible to
						oneself. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now that which is intelligible and
					primary to individuals is often but slightly intelligible, and contains but little
					reality; but nevertheless, starting from that which is imperfectly intelligible but
					intelligible to oneself, we must try to understand the absolutely intelligible; advancing,
					as we have said, by means of these very things which are intelligible to us. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Since we distinguished at the beginning<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1028b">Aristot. Met. 7.3.1</bibl>.</note> the
					number of ways in which substance is defined, and since one of these appeared to be
					essence, we must investigate this. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>First, let
					us make certain linguistic statements about it. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The essence
					of each thing is that which it is said to be per se. "To be you" is not "to be cultured,"
					because you are not of your own nature cultured. Your essence, then, is that which you are
					said to be <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>of your own nature. But not even all of this is
					the essence; for the essence is not that which is said to be per se in the sense that
					whiteness is said to belong to a surface,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 5.1024b">Aristot. Met. 5.18.3, 4</bibl>.</note> because "being a
					surface" is not "being white." <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor is the
					essence the combination of both, "being a white surface." Why? Because the word itself is
						repeated. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the formula of the essence of
					each thing is that which defines the term but does not contain it. Thus if "being a white
					surface" is the same as "being a smooth surface," "white" and "smooth" are one and the
						same.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The statement that "to be a white surface"
						is the same as "to be a smooth surface" tells us nothing fresh about surface; it simply
						identifies "white" with "smooth." Aristotle has in mind Democritus's theory of color
						(that it is an impression conveyed to our eyes from the superficial texture of the
						object; <bibl n="Thphr. Sens. 73">Theophrastus, De Sensu 73-75</bibl>); cf.<bibl
							n="Aristot. Sens. 442b.11">Aristot. De Sensu 442b 11</bibl>, <bibl

						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since in the other
					categories too there are compounds with substance (because there is a substrate for each
					category, e.g. quality, quantity, time, place and motion), we must inquire whether there
					is a formula of the essence of each one of them; whether these compounds, e.g. "white
					man," also have an essence. Let the compound be denoted by X.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Literally "cloak," but the word is chosen quite arbitrarily. Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 8.1045a">Aristot. Met. 8.6.4</bibl>.</note> What is the essence of
						X? <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>"But this is not even a per se expression." We reply
					that there are two ways in which a definition can be not per se true of its subject: (a)
					by an addition, and (b) by an omission. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In one
					case the definition is not per se true because the term which is being defined is combined
					with something else; as if, e.g., in defining whiteness one were to state the definition
					of a white man. In the other, because something else (which is not in the definition) is
					combined with the subject; as if, e.g., X were to denote "white man," and X were defined
					as "white." "White man" is white, <milestone n="1030a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but its essence is not "to be white." But is "to be X" an
					essence at all? <milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Surely not. The essence is an
					individual type; but when a subject has something distinct from it predicated of it, it is
					not an individual type. E.g., "white man" is not an individual type; that is, assuming
					that individuality belongs only to substances. Hence essence belongs to all things the
					account of which is a definition. <milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have a
					definition, not if the name and the account signify the same (for then all accounts would
					be definitions; because any account can have a name, so that even "the <emph>Iliad</emph>
					" will be a definition), but if the account is of something primary. Such are all
					statements which do not involve the predication of one thing of another. <milestone
						n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence essence will belong to nothing except species of
					a genus, but to these only; for in these the predicate is not considered to be related to
					the subject by participation or affection, nor as an accident. But of everything else as
					well, if it has a name, there will be a formula of <emph>what it means</emph>—that X
					belongs to Y; or instead of a simple formula one more exact—but no definition, nor
						essence. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or
					perhaps "definition," like the "what," has more than one sense. For the "what" in one
					sense means the substance and the individual, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>and in another each one of the categories: quantity, quality, etc. <milestone n="4.13"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Just as "is" applies to everything, although not in the same
					way, but primarily to one thing and secondarily to others; so "what it is" applies in an
					unqualified sense to substance, and to other things in a qualified sense. For we might ask
					also what quality "is," so that quality also is a "what it is"; not however without
					qualification, but just as in the case of not-being some say by a verbal quibble that
					not-being "is"—not in an unqualified sense, but "is" not-being—so too with
						quality. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now
					although we must also consider how we should express ourselves in each particular case, it
					is still more important to consider what the facts are. Hence now, since the language
					which we are using is clear, similarly essence also will belong primarily and simply to
					substance, and secondarily to other things as well; just as the "what it is" is not
					essence simply, but the essence of a quality or quantity. <milestone n="4.15" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For it must be either by equivocation that we say that these things
						<emph>are</emph> , or by adding and subtracting qualifications, as we say that the
					unknowable is known<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. to be unknowable.</note>;
					since the truth is that we use the terms neither equivocally nor in the same sense, but
					just as we use the term "medical" in <emph>relation</emph> to one and the same thing;
						<milestone n="1030b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not
						<emph>of</emph> one and the same thing, nor yet equivocally. The term "medical" is
					applied to a body and a function and an instrument, neither equivocally nor in one sense,
					but in relation to one thing.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 4.1003a">Aristot. Met. 4.2.2</bibl>.</note> <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="4.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, in whichever way one
					chooses to speak of these things, it matters nothing; but this point is clear: that the
					primary and unqualified definition, and the essence, belong to substances. It is true that
					they belong equally to other things too, but not <emph>primarily</emph> . For if we assume
					this, it does not necessarily follow that there is a definition of anything which means
					the same as any formula; it must mean the same as a particular kind of formula, i.e. the
					formula of one thing— <milestone n="4.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>one not by
					continuity like the <title>Iliad</title>, or things which are arbitrarily combined, but in
					one of the proper senses of "one." And "one" has the same variety of senses as "being."
					"Being" means sometimes the individual thing, sometimes the quantity, sometimes the
					quality. Hence even "white man" will have a formula and definition; but in a different
					sense from the definition of "whiteness" and "substance." <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question arises: If one denies that a
					formula involving an added determinant is a definition, how can there be a definition of
					terms which are not simple but coupled? Because they can only be explained by adding a
						determinant. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean, e.g., there is "nose"
					and "concavity" and "snubness," the term compounded of the two, because the one is present
					in the other. Neither "concavity" nor "snubness" is an accidental, but a per se affection
					of the nose.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Snubness is a per se affection of the
						nose, because it applies only to the nose and cannot be explained apart from it, but the
						same can hardly be said of concavity. Aristotle himself uses the word (<foreign
							lang="greek">koilo/ths</foreign>) elsewhere in other connections.</note> <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Nor are they attributes in the sense that "white" is of
					Callias or a man, because Callias is white and is by accident a man; but in the sense that
					"male" is an attribute of animal, and equality of quantity, and all other attributes which
					we say belong per se. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That is, all things which
					involve the formula or name of the subject of the affection, and cannot be explained apart
					from it. Thus "white" can be explained apart from "man," but not "female" apart from
					"animal." Thus either these terms have no essence or definition, or else they have it in a
					different sense, as we have said. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is also another difficulty about them. If "snub nose" is the
					same as "concave nose," "snub" will be the same as "concave." But if not, since it is
					impossible to speak of "snub" apart from the thing of which it is a per se affection
					(because "snub" means a concavity in the nose), either it is impossible to call the nose
					snub, or it will be a tautology, "concave-nose nose" because "snub nose" will equal
					"concave-nose nose." <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it is absurd that
					such terms as these should have an essence. Otherwise there will be an infinite
					regression; for in "snub-nose nose" there will be yet another nose. <milestone n="1031a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Clearly, then, there is
					definition of substance alone. If there were definition of the other categories also, it
					would have to involve an added determinant, as in the case of the qualitative; and of the
					odd, for this cannot be defined apart from number; nor can "female" apart from
						"animal." <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By "involving an added determinant"
					I mean descriptions which involve a tautology, as in the above examples. Now if this is
					true, there will be no definition of compound expressions either; e.g., "odd number." We
					fail to realize this because our terms are not used accurately. If on the other hand there
					are definitions of these too, either they are defined in a different way, or, as we have
					said, "definition" and "essence" must be used in more than one sense; <milestone n="5.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>thus in one sense there will be no definition of anything, and
					nothing will have an essence, except substances; and in another those other things will
					have a definition and essence. It is obvious, then, that the definition is the formula of
					the essence, and that the essence belongs either <emph>only</emph> to substances, or
					especially and primarily and simply. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must inquire whether the essence is the same as the
					particular thing, or different. This is useful for our inquiry about substance; because a
					particular thing is considered to be nothing other than its own substance, and the essence
					is called the substance of the thing. <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In
					accidental predications, indeed, the thing itself would seem to be different from its
						essence; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g., "white man" is different from
					"essence of white man." If it were the same, "essence of man" and "essence of white man"
					would be the same. For "man" and "white man" are the same, they say, and therefore
					"essence of white man" is the same as "essence of man." <milestone n="6.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps it is not necessarily true that the essence of accidental
					combinations is the same as that of the simple terms; because the extremes of the
					syllogism are not identical with the middle term in the same way.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The argument consists of two syllogisms: White=essence of white man.
						Man=white man. Therefore man=essence of white man. But essence of man=man. Therefore
						essence of man=essence of white man. The conclusion is faulty because whereas the first
						identity is assumed to be absolute, the second is accidental.</note> Perhaps it might be
					thought to follow that the accidental extremes are identical; e.g. "essence of white" and

					substance of the privation is the opposite substance; e.g., health is the substance of
					disease; for disease is the absence of health, and health is the formula and knowledge in

					health is so-and-so, if the subject is to be healthy, it must have such-and-such a
					quality, e.g. homogeneity; and if so, it must have heat. <milestone n="7.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>And the physician continues reasoning until he arrives at what he
					himself finally can do; then the process from this point onwards, i.e. the process towards
					health, is called "production." Therefore it follows in a sense that health comes from
					health and a house from a house; that which has matter from that which has not (for the
					art of medicine or of building is the <emph>form</emph> of health or the house). By

					is production. Each of the other intermediate measures is carried out in the same way. I
					mean, e.g., that if A is to be healthy, his physical condition will have to be made
					uniform. What, then, does being made uniform entail? So-and-so; <milestone n="20"

					thing which produces, and from which the process of recovering health begins, is the form
					in the soul, if the process is artificial; if spontaneous, it is whatever is the
					starting-point of the production for the artificial producer; as in medical treatment the
					starting-point is, perhaps, the heating of the patient; and this the doctor produces by
					friction. Heat in the body, then, is either a part of health, or is followed (directly or
					through several intermediaries) by something similar which is a part of health. This is
					the ultimate thing, namely that produces, and in this sense is a part of, health—or
					of the house <milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(in the form of stones)<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">There is no real analogy between the casual

						efficient; the latter only material. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.  7.1034a">Aristot. Met.
							7.9.1</bibl>.</note> or of other things. Therefore, as we say, generation would be
					impossible if nothing were already existent. It is clear, then, that some part must
					necessarily pre-exist; because the matter is a part, since it is matter which pre-exists
					in the product and becomes something. <milestone n="1033a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But then is matter part of the formula? Well, we define
					bronze circles in both ways; we describe the matter as bronze, and the form as
					such-and-such a shape; and this shape is the proximate genus in which the circle is
						placed. <milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The bronze circle, then, has its
					matter in its formula. Now as for that from which, as matter, things are generated, some
					things when they are generated are called not "so-and-so," but "made of so-and-so"; e.g.,
					a statue is not called stone, but made of stone. But the man who becomes healthy is not
					called after that from which he becomes healthy. This is because the generation proceeds
					from the privation and the substrate, which we call matter (e.g., both "the man" and "the
					invalid" become healthy), <milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but it is more
					properly said to proceed from the privation; e.g., a man becomes healthy from being an
					invalid rather than from being a man. Hence a healthy person is not called an invalid, but
					a man, and a healthy man. But where the privation is obscure and has no name—e.g. in
					bronze the privation of any given shape, or in bricks and wood the privation of the shape
					of a house—the generation is considered to proceed from these materials, as in the
					former case from the invalid. <milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence just as in
					the former case the subject is not called that from which it is generated, so in this case
					the statue is not called wood, but is called by a verbal change not wood, but wooden; not
					bronze, but made of bronze; not stone, but made of stone; and the house is called not
					bricks, but made of bricks. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For if we consider
					the matter carefully, we should not even say without qualification that a statue is
					generated from wood, or a house from bricks; because that from which a thing is generated
					should not persist, but be changed. This, then, is why we speak in this way. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since that which is
					generated is generated <emph>by</emph> something (by which I mean the starting-point of
					the process of generation), and <emph>from</emph> something (by which let us understand
					not the privation but the matter; for we have already distinguished the meanings of
					these), and <emph>becomes</emph> something (i.e. a sphere or circle or whatever else it
					may be); just as the craftsman does not produce the substrate, i.e. the bronze, so neither
					does he produce the sphere; except accidentally, inasmuch as the bronze sphere is a
					sphere, and he makes the former. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For to make an
					individual thing is to make it out of the substrate in the fullest sense. I mean that to
					make the bronze round is not to make the round or the sphere, but something else; i.e. to
					produce this form in another medium. For if we make the form, we must make it out of
					something else; for this has been assumed. <milestone n="1033b" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>E.g., we make a bronze sphere; we do this in the sense
					that from A, i.e. bronze, we make B, i.e. a sphere. <milestone n="8.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, we make the spherical form itself, clearly we shall have to
					make it in the same way; and the processes of generation will continue to
						infinity. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is therefore obvious that the form (or
					whatever we should call the shape in the sensible thing) is not generated—generation
					does not apply to it— nor is the essence generated; for this is that which is
					induced in something else either by art or by nature or by potency. <milestone n="8.4"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we do cause a bronze sphere to be, for we produce it from
					bronze and a sphere; we induce the form into this particular matter, and the result is a
					bronze sphere. But if the essence of sphere in general is generated, something must be
					generated from something; for that which is generated will always have to be divisible,
					and be partly one thing and partly another; I mean partly matter and partly
						form. <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then a sphere is the figure whose
					circumference is everywhere equidistant from the center, part of this will be the medium
					in which that which we produce will be contained, and part will be in that medium; and the
					whole will be the thing generated, as in the case of the bronze sphere. It is obvious,
					then, from what we have said, that the thing in the sense of form or essence is not
					generated, whereas the concrete whole which is called after it is generated; and that in
					everything that is generated matter is present, and one part is matter and the other
						form. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Is there then some sphere besides the
					particular spheres, or some house besides the bricks? Surely no individual thing would
					ever have been generated if form had existed thus independently.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">If forms are self-subsistent substances, individual substances cannot be
						generated from them; for the individual contains the form, but one substance cannot
						contain another actually existing substance (<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1033b">Aristot.
							Met. 7.8.8</bibl>). Form, however, is not a substance but a characteristic.</note>
					Form means "of such a kind"; it is not a definite individual, but we produce or generate
					from the individual something "of such a kind"; and when it is generated it is an
					individual "of such a kind." <milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The whole
					individual, Callias or Socrates, corresponds to "this bronze sphere," but "man" and
					"animal" correspond to bronze sphere in general. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Obviously
					therefore the cause which consists of the Forms (in the sense in which some speak of them,
					assuming that there are certain entities besides particulars), in respect at least of
					generation and destruction, is useless; nor, for this reason at any rate, should they be
					regarded as self-subsistent substances. <milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed
					in some cases it is even obvious that that which generates is of the same kind as that
					which is generated—not however identical with it, nor numerically one with it, but
					formally one—e.g. in natural productions (for man begets man), unless something
					happens contrary to nature, as when a horse sires a mule. And even these cases are
					similar; for that which would be common to both horse and ass, the genus immediately above
					them, has no name; but it would probably be both, just as the mule is both.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Normally the sire communicates his form to the
						offspring. In the case of a mule, the material element contributed by the dam, which is
						an ass, limits the effect of the formal element contributed bu the sire, which is a
						horse; but even so the form of the sire is generically the same as that of the
						offspring.</note>
					<milestone n="1034a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus obviously there is
					no need to set up a form as a pattern (for we should have looked for Forms in these cases
					especially, since living things are in a special sense substances); the thing which
					generates is sufficient to produce, and to be the cause of the form in the matter. The
					completed whole, such-and-such a form induced in this flesh and these bones, is Callias or
					Socrates. And it is different from that which generated it, because the matter is
					different but identical in form, because the form is indivisible. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question might be raised
					why some things are generated both artificially and spontaneously—e.g.
					health—and others not; e.g. a house. The reason is that in some cases the
					matter—which is the starting-point of the process in the production and generation
					of artificial things, and in which some part of the result is already existent—is
					such that it can initiate its own motion, and in other cases it is not; and of the former
					kind some can initiate motion in a particular way, and some cannot. For many things can
					move themselves, but not in a particular way, e.g. so as to dance. <milestone n="9.2"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is impossible, then, for any things whose matter is of this
					kind (e.g. stones) to be moved in <emph>this</emph> particular way except by something
					else; but in <emph>that</emph> particular way it is possible. And it is so with fire.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Stones can fall by themselves, but cannot by themselves
						build a house; fire can rise by itself, but cannot boil a kettle.</note> For this reason
					some things cannot exist apart from the possessor of the art, and others can; <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the motion can be initiated by those things
					which do not indeed possess the art, but can themselves be moved either by other things
					which do not possess the art, or by the motion from the part of the product which
					pre-exists in them.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">e.g., health can be produced as
						the result of the activity set up by heat in the body.</note> <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear also from what we
					have said that in a sense all artificial things are generated either from something which
					bears the same name (as is the case with natural objects) or from a part of themselves
					which bears the same name as themselves (e.g. a house from a house, inasmuch as it is
					generated by mind; for the art is the form), or from something which contains some part;
					that is if the generation is not accidental; for the direct and independent cause of the
					production is a part of the product. <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Heat in
					the motion produces heat in the body; and either this is health or a part of health, or a
					part of health or health accompanies it. And this is why heat is said to produce health,
					because it produces that of which health is a concomitant and consequence. Therefore as
					essence is the starting-point of everything in syllogisms (because syllogisms start from
					the "what" of a thing), so too generation proceeds from it. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is the same with natural formations
					as it is with the products of art. For the seed produces just as do those things which
					function by art. It contains the form potentially, <milestone n="1034b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that from which the seed comes has in
					some sense the same name as the product (for we must not expect that all should have the
					same name in the sense that "man" is produced by "man"—since woman is also produced
					by man); unless the product is a freak. This is why a mule is not produced by a
						mule. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those
					natural objects which are produced, like artificial objects, spontaneously, are those
					whose matter can also initiate for itself that motion which the seed initiates. Those
					whose matter cannot do this cannot be generated otherwise than by their proper
						parents. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is not only with reference to substance that
					our argument shows that the form is not generated; the same argument is common in its
					application to all the primary divisions, i.e. quantity, quality and the other
						categories. <milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For just as the bronze sphere is
					generated, but not the sphere nor the bronze; and as in the case of bronze, if it is
					generated the form and matter are not (because they must always pre-exist), so it is too
					with the "what" and the quality and quantity and the other categories similarly; for it is
					not the quality that is generated, but the wood of that quality; nor is it the size, but
					the wood or animal of that size. <milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But a
					peculiarity of substance may be gathered from this: that some other substance must
					pre-exist in actuality which produces it; e.g. an animal, if an animal is being generated;
					but a quality or quantity need not pre-exist otherwise than potentially. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Since a definition is a formula, and every formula has parts; and
					since the formula is related to the thing in the same way as the part of the formula to
					the part of the thing, the question<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The questions
						discussed in chs. 10-12 arise out of the consideration of essence as definition.</note>
					now arises: Must the formula of the parts be contained in the formula of the whole, or
					not? It seems clear that it is so in some cases, but not in others. <milestone n="10.2"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The formula of the circle does not include that of the
					segments, but the formula of the syllable includes that of the letters. And yet the circle
					is divisible into its segments in just the same way as the syllable into its
						letters. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, if the parts are prior to the whole, and
					the acute angle is part of the right angle, and the finger part of the animal, the acute
					angle will be prior to the right angle, and the finger to the man. <milestone n="10.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is considered that the latter are prior; for in the
					formula the parts are explained from them; and the wholes are prior also in virtue of
					their ability to exist independently. The truth probably is that "part" has several
					meanings, one of which is "that which measures in respect of quantity." However, let us
					dismiss this question and consider of what, in the sense of parts, substance consists.
						<milestone n="1035a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then
					matter, form, and the combination of the two are distinct, and if both matter and form and
					their combination are substance, there is one sense in which even matter may be called
					"part" of a thing; and another in which it is not, but the only parts are those elements
					of which the formula of the form consists. E.g., flesh is not a part of concavity, because
					flesh is the matter in which concavity is induced; but it is a part of snubness. And
					bronze is part of the statue as a concrete whole, but not of the statue in the sense of
						form. <milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We may speak of the form (or the thing
					as having a form) as an individual thing, but we may never so speak of that which is
					material by itself. This is why the formula of the circle does not contain that of the
					segments, whereas the formula of the syllable does contain that of the letters; for the
					letters are parts of the formula of the form; they are not matter; but the segments are
					parts in the sense of matter in which the form is induced. They approximate, however, more
					closely to the form than does the bronze when roundness is engendered in bronze. <milestone
						n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is a sense in which not even all the letters
					will be contained in the formula of the syllable; e.g. particular letters on wax<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. written on a waxed tablet.</note> or sounds in the
					air; for these too are part of the syllable in the sense that they are its sensible
						matter. <milestone n="10.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For even if the line is divided and
					resolved into its halves, or if the man is resolved into bones and muscles and
						flesh, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it does not follow that they are
					composed of these as parts of their essence, but as their matter; and these are parts of
					the concrete whole, but not of the form, or that to which the formula refers. Hence they
					are not in the formulae. <milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Accordingly in some
					cases the formula will include the formula of such parts as the above, but in others it
					need not necessarily contain their formula, unless it is the formula of the concrete
					object. It is for this reason that some things are composed of parts in the sense of
					principles into which they can be resolved, while others are not. <milestone n="10.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All things which are concrete combinations of form and matter
					(e.g. "the snub" or the bronze circle) can be resolved into form and matter, and the
					matter is a part of them; but such as are not concrete combinations with matter, but are
					without matter—whose formulae refer to the form only—cannot be resolved;
					either not at all, or at least not in this way. <milestone n="10.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus these material components are principles and parts of the
					concrete objects, but they are neither parts nor principles of the form. For this reason
					the clay statue can be resolved into clay, and the sphere into bronze, and Callias into
					flesh and bones, and the circle too into segments, because it is something which is
					combined with matter. <milestone n="1035b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>For we use the same name for the absolute circle and for the particular
					circle, since there is no special name for the particular circles. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="10.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now stated the truth;
					nevertheless let us recapitulate and state it more clearly. All constituents which are
					parts of the formula, and into which the formula can be divided, are prior to their
					wholes—either all or some of them. But the formula of the right angle is not
					divisible into the formula of an acute angle, but vice versa; since in defining the acute
					angle we use the right angle, because "the acute angle is less than a right
						angle." <milestone n="10.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is the same with the circle and
					the semicircle; for the semicircle is defined by means of the circle. And the finger is
					defined by means of the whole body; for a finger is a particular kind of part of a man.
					Thus such parts as are material, and into which the whole is resolved as into matter, are
					posterior to the whole; but such as are parts in the sense of parts of the formula and of
					the essence as expressed in the formula, are prior; either all or some of them. <milestone
						n="10.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the soul of animals (which is the substance
					of the living creature) is their substance in accordance with the formula, and the form
					and essence of that particular kind of body (at least each part, if it is to be properly
					defined, will not be defined apart from its function; and this will not belong to it apart
					from perception<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Which implies soul.</note>);
					therefore the parts of the soul are prior, either all or some of them, to the concrete
					animal; and similarly in other individual cases. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="10.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the body and its parts are posterior
					to this substance, and it is not the substance, but the concrete whole, which is resolved
					into these parts as into matter. Therefore in one sense these parts are prior to the
					concrete whole, and in another not; for they cannot exist in separation. A finger cannot
					in every state be a part of a living animal; for the dead finger has only the name in
					common with the living one. <milestone n="10.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some parts are
					contemporary with the whole: such as are indispensable and in which the formula and the
					essence are primarily present; e.g. the heart or perhaps the brain,<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1012b">Aristot. Met. 5.1.1</bibl>.</note>
					for it does not matter which of them is of this nature. But "man" and "horse" and terms
					which are applied in this way to individuals, but universally, are not substance, but a
					kind of concrete whole composed of <emph>this</emph> particular formula and
						<emph>this</emph> particular matter regarded as universal. But individually Socrates is
					already composed of ultimate matter; and similarly in all other cases. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="10.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A part, then, may be part of
					the form (by form I mean essence), or of the concrete whole composed of form and matter,
					or of the matter itself. But only the parts of the form are parts of the formula, and the
					formula refers to the universal; <milestone n="1036a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for "circle" is the same as "essence of circle," and "soul" the
					same as "essence of soul." <milestone n="10.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when we come
					to the concrete thing, e.g. this circle—which is a particular individual, either
					sensible or intelligible (by intelligible circles I mean those of mathematics,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., something very similar to the Platonic
						"intermediates." Cf. Introduction.</note> and by sensible those which are of bronze or
					wood)—of these individuals there is no definition; <milestone n="10.18" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>we apprehend them by intelligence or perception; and when they have
					passed from the sphere of actuality it is uncertain whether they exist or not, but they
					are always spoken of and apprehended by the universal formula. But the matter is in itself
					unknowable. Some matter is sensible and some intelligible; sensible, such as bronze and
					wood and all movable matter; intelligible, that which is present in sensible things not
						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> sensible, e.g. the objects of mathematics.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1076a">Aristot. Met.

						unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now discussed the case of the whole and part, and of prior and
					posterior. But we must answer the question, when we are asked which is prior—the
					right angle and circle and animal, or that into which they are resolved and of which they
					are composed, i.e. their parts—by saying that neither is <emph>absolutely</emph>
						prior. <milestone n="10.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if the soul also <emph>is</emph>
					the animal or living thing, or the soul of the individual <emph>is</emph> the individual,
					and "being a circle" <emph>is</emph> the circle, and "being a right angle" or the essence
					of the right angle <emph>is</emph> the right angle, then we must admit that the whole in
					one sense is posterior to the part in one sense: <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>e.g. to the parts in the formula and the parts of a particular right angle <milestone
						n="10.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(since both the material right angle of bronze and
					the right angle included by individual lines are posterior to their parts), but the
					immaterial angle is posterior to the parts in the formula, but prior to the parts in the
					individual. We must not give an unqualified answer. And if the soul is not the animal but
					something else, even so we must say that some wholes are prior and some are not, as has
					been stated. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>The question naturally presents itself, what sort of parts belong to the form and what
					sort belong not to it but to the concrete object. Yet if this is not plain it is
					impossible to define the particular; because the definition refers to the universal and
					the form. Therefore if it is not clear what kind of parts are material and what kind are
					not, the formula of the thing will not be clear either. <milestone n="11.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>In the case of things which can be seen to be induced in specifically
					different materials, as, e.g., a circle is in bronze and stone and wood, it seems clear
					that these things, the bronze and the stone, are in no sense part of the essential
					substance of the circle, because it is separable from them. <milestone n="11.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>As for things which are not visibly separable, there is no reason why
					the same should not apply to them; e.g., if all the circles that had ever been seen were
					bronze; <milestone n="1036b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for
					the bronze would be none the less no part of the form, but it is difficult to separate it
					in thought. <milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For example, the form of "man" is
					always manifested in flesh and bones and elements of this kind; then are these actually
					parts of the form and formula, or are they not so, but matter, though since the form is
					not induced in other materials, we cannot separate it? <milestone n="11.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since this seems to be possible, but it is not clear
						<emph>when</emph>, some thinkers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Pythagoreans.</note> are doubtful even in the case of the circle and the triangle,
					considering that it is not proper to define them by lines and continuous space, but that
					all these are to the circle or triangle as flesh or bone is to man, and bronze or stone to
					the statue; and they reduce everything to numbers, and say that the formula of "line" is
					the formula of 2. <milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of the exponents of the
					Forms, some make 2 the Ideal line, and some the form of the line<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The distinction seems to be that given in <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1043a"
							>Aristot. Met. 8.3.1</bibl>. Some held that the line, considered absolutely, is simply
						"twoness"; others that it is "twoness in length."</note>; for they say that in some
					cases the form and that of which it is the form, e.g. 2 and the form of 2, are the same;
					but in the case of "line" this is no longer so. <milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>It follows, then, that there is one form of many things whose form is clearly different
					(a consequence which confronted the Pythagoreans too<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"
						>Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.987a">Aristot. Met. 1.5.17</bibl>.</note>), and that it is
					possible to make one supreme Form of everything, and not to regard the rest as
						forms. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In this way, however, all things would
					be one. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now we
					have stated that the question of definitions involves some difficulty, and have shown why
					this is so. Hence to reduce everything in this way and to dispose of the matter is going
					too far; for some things are presumably a particular form in particular matter, or
					particular things in a particular state. <milestone n="11.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					the analogy in the case of the living thing which the younger Socrates<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A "disciple" of the great Socrates; one of the speakers
						in the Politicus<bibl n="Plat. Stat. 1">Plat. Stat.</bibl> and referred to in <bibl

							Soph. 218b</bibl>.</note> used to state is not a good one; for it leads one away from
					the truth, and makes one suppose that it is possible for a man to exist without his parts,
					as a circle does without the bronze. But the case is not similar; for the animal is
					sensible and cannot be defined without motion, and hence not unless its parts are in some
					definite condition; <milestone n="11.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is not the hand in
						<emph>any</emph> condition that is a part of a man, but only when it can perform its
					function, and so has life in it. Without life in it it is not a part. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>And with respect to mathematical objects, why are the formulae of the parts
					not parts of the formulae of the whole; e.g., why are the formulae of the semicircles not
					parts of the formula of the circle? for they are not sensible. <milestone n="11.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Probably this makes no difference; because there will be matter even
					of some things which are not sensible. <milestone n="1037a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Indeed there will be matter in some sense in everything
					which is not essence or form considered independently, but a particular thing. Thus the
					semicircles will be parts not of the universal circle but of the particular circles, as we
					said before<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1036a">Aristot.
							Met. 7.10.17</bibl>.</note>—for some matter is sensible, and some
						intelligible. <milestone n="11.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear also that the
					soul is the primary substance, and the body matter; and "man" or "animal" is the
					combination of both taken universally. And " Socrates" or "Coriscus" has a double sense,
					that is if the soul too can be called Socrates (for by Socrates some mean the soul and
					some the concrete person); but if Socrates means simply <emph>this</emph> soul and
						<emph>this</emph> body, the individual is composed similarly to the universal. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Whether there is some

					look for some further substance in them, such as numbers or something of that kind, must
					be considered later.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In Books 13 and 14.</note> It
					is with a view to this that we are trying to determine the nature of sensible substances,
					since in a sense the study of sensible substances belongs to physics or secondary
					philosophy; for the physicist must know not only about the matter, but also about the
					substance according to the formula; this is even more essential. <milestone n="11.14"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in the case of definitions, in what sense the elements in
					the formula are parts of the definition, and why the definition is one formula (for the
					thing is clearly one, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but in virtue of what is
					it one, seeing that it has parts?); this must be considered later.<note resp="Tredennick"

						unit="Loeb chap"/>We have stated, then, in a general account which covers all cases,
					what essence is, and how it is independent; and why the formula of the essence of some
					things contains the parts of the thing defined, while that of others does not; and we have
					shown that the material parts of a thing cannot be present in the formula of the substance
					(since they are not even parts of the substance in that sense, but of the concrete
					substance; and of this in one sense there is a formula, and in another sense there is
						not. <milestone n="11.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is no formula involving the
					matter, for this is indeterminate; but there is a formula in accordance with the primary
					substance, e.g., in the case of a man, the formula of the soul; because the substance is
					the indwelling form, of which and of the matter the so called concrete substance is
					composed. E.g., concavity is such a form, since from this and "nose" is derived "snub
					nose" and "snubness"—for "nose" will be present twice over in these
						expressions); <milestone n="11.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in the concrete

						anchored="yes">Chapters. 10-11; and cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1029b">Aristot. Met.

						unit="line"/>as in the case of the primary substances; e.g. crookedness and "essence of
					crookedness," if this is primary. <milestone n="11.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By primary
					I mean that which does not imply the presence of something in something else as a material
					substrate. But such things as are material or are compounded with matter are not the same
					as their essence; not even if they are accidentally one, e.g. Socrates and "cultured"; for
					these are only accidentally the same. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now let us first deal with definition, in so far as it has not
					been dealt with in the <title>Analytics</title>; for the problem stated there<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APo. 92a.29">Aristot. An. Post. 92a
							29</bibl>.</note> has a bearing upon our discussion of substance. The problem I mean
					is this: what constitutes the unity of the thing of which we say that the formula is a
					definition? E.g., in the case of man, "two-footed animal"; for let us take this as the
					formula of "man." <milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why, then, is this a unity
					and not a plurality, "animal" and "two-footed"? For in the case of "man" and "white" we
					have a plurality when the latter does not refer to the former, but a unity when it does
					refer to it, and the subject, "man," has an attribute; for then they become a unity and we
					have "the white man." <milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in the case before
					us one term does not partake of the other; the genus is not considered to partake of its
					differentiae, for then the same thing would be partaking simultaneously of
						contraries, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since the differentiae by which
					the genus is distinguished are contrary. And even if it does partake of them, the same
					argument applies, since the differentiae are many; e.g. terrestrial, two-footed,
						wingless. <milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why is it that these are a unity
					and not a plurality? Not because they are present in one genus, for in that case all the
					differentiae of the genus will form a unity. But all the elements in the definition must
					form a unity, because the definition is a kind of formula which is one and defines
					substance, so that it must be a formula of one particular thing; because the substance
					denotes one thing and an individual, as we say. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We must
						first<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The other type of definition, that which
						states the constituent parts of a thing, is not discussed here.</note> examine
					definitions which are reached by the process of division. <milestone n="12.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For there is nothing else in the definition but the primary genus and
					the differentiae; the other genera consist of the primary genus together with the
					differentiae which are taken with it. E.g., the primary genus is "animal"; the next below
					it, "two-footed animal"; and again, "two-footed wingless animal"; and similarly also if
					the expression contains more terms still. <milestone n="1038a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In general
					it does not matter whether it contains many or few terms, nor, therefore, whether it
					contains few or two. Of the two one is differentia and the other genus; e.g., in
					"two-footed animal" "animal" is genus, and the other term differentia. <milestone n="12.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, the genus absolutely does not exist apart from the
					species which it includes, or if it exists, but only as matter (for speech is genus and
					matter, and the differentiae make the species, i.e. the letters, out of it), obviously the
					definition is the formula composed of the differentiae. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="12.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But further we must also divide by the
					differentia of the differentia. E.g., "having feet" is a differentia of "animal"; then in
					turn we must discover the differentia of "animal having feet" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					"having feet." Accordingly we should not say that of "that which has feet" one kind is
					winged and another wingless, (that is if we are to speak correctly; if we say this it will
					be through incapability), but only that one kind is cloven-footed and another not; because
					these are differentiae of "foot," since cloven-footedness is a kind of
						footedness. <milestone n="12.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And thus we tend always to
					progress until we come to the species which contain no differentiae. At this point there
					will be just as many species of foot as there are differentiae, and the kinds of animals
					having feet will be equal in number to the differentiae. Then, if this is so, <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>obviously the ultimate differentia will be the substance
					and definition of the thing, since we need not state the same things more than once in
					definitions, because this is superfluous. <milestone n="12.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>However, it does happen; for when we say "footed two-footed animal" we have simply said
					"animal having feet, having two feet." And if we divide this by its proper division, we
					shall be stating the same thing several times, as many times as there are
						differentiae. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>If, then, we keep on taking a differentia of a differentia, one of them, the last, will
					be the form and the substance. But if we proceed with reference to accidental
					qualities—e.g. if we divide "that which has feet" into white and black—there
					will be as many differentiae as there are divisions. It is therefore obvious that the
					definition is the formula derived from the differentiae, and strictly speaking from the
					last of them. <milestone n="12.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This will be clear if we change
					the order of such definitions, e.g. that of man, saying "two-footed footed animal"; for
					"footed" is superfluous when we have already said "two-footed." But there is no question
					of order in the substance; for how are we to think of one part as posterior and the other
						prior? <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>With regard, then, to definitions by division, let
					this suffice as a preliminary statement of their nature. <milestone n="1038b"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="13.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since the subject of our inquiry is
					substance, let us return to it. Just as the substrate and the essence and the combination
					of these are called substance, so too is the universal. With two of these we have already
					dealt, i.e. with the essence<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Chs. 4-5.,10-12.</note>
					and the substrate<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Ch. 3.</note>; of the latter we
					have said that it underlies in two senses—either being an individual thing (as the
					animal underlies its attributes), or as matter underlies the actuality. <milestone n="13.2"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The universal also is thought by some<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The Platonists.</note> to be in the truest sense a cause and a principle.
					Let us therefore proceed to discuss this question too; for it seems impossible that any
					universal term can be substance. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>First, the substance of an
					individual is the substance which is peculiar to it and belongs to nothing else; whereas
					the universal is common; for by universal we mean that which by nature appertains to
					several things. <milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Of what particular, then, will
					the universal be the substance? Either of all or of none. But it cannot be the substance
					of all; while, if it is to be the substance of one, the rest also will be that one;
					because things whose substance is one have also one essence and are themselves
						one. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, substance means that which is not predicated
					of a subject, whereas the universal is always predicated of some subject. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>But perhaps although the universal cannot be substance in the sense that
					essence is, it can be present in the essence, as "animal" can be present in "man" and
						"horse." <milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then clearly there is in some sense
					a formula of the universal. It makes no difference <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>even if there is not a formula of everything that is in the substance; for
					the universal will be none the less the substance of something; e.g., "man" will be the
					substance of the man in whom it is present. Thus the same thing will happen again<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the argument in ch. 3 will apply to this case
						also.</note>; e.g. "animal" will be the substance of that in which it is present as
					peculiar to it. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Again, it is impossible and absurd that the individual or substance, if it is composed
					of anything, should be composed not of substances nor of the individual, but of a quality;
					for then non-substance or quality will be prior to substance or the individual. Which is
					impossible; for neither in formula nor in time nor in generation can the affections of
					substance be prior to the substance, since then they would be separable. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="13.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a substance will be
					present in "Socrates," who is a substance; so that it will be the substance of two things.
					And in general it follows that if "man" and all terms used in this way are substance, none
					of the elements in the formula is the substance of anything, nor can it exist apart from
					the species or in anything else; I mean, e.g., that neither "animal" nor any other element
					of the formula can exist apart from the particular species. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="13.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If we look at the question from this
					standpoint it is obvious that no universal attribute is substance; and it is also clear
					from the fact that none of the common predicates means "so-and-so," <milestone n="1039a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but "such and-such." Otherwise
					amongst many other awkward consequences we have the "third man."<note resp="Tredennick"

						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, it is clear in this way too. Substance can not consist of
					substances actually present in it; for that which is actually two can never be actually
					one, whereas if it is potentially two it can be one. E.g., the double consists of two
					halves—that is, potentially; for the actualization separates the halves. <milestone
						n="13.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus if substance is one, it cannot consist of

					consequence follows for those who maintain that the Forms are substances and separable,
					and who at the same time make the species consist of the genus and the differentiae. If
					there are Forms, and if "animal" is present in the man and the horse, it is either
					numerically one and the same with them, or not. <milestone n="14.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>(In formula they are clearly one; for in each case the speaker will enunciate the same
					formula.) If, then, there is in some sense an Absolute Man, who is an individual and
					exists separately, then the constituents, e.g. "animal" and "two-footed," must have an
					individual meaning and be separable and substances. Hence there must be an Absolute Animal
						too. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="14.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(i) Then
					if the "animal" which is in the horse and the man is one and the same, as you are one and
					the same with yourself, <milestone n="1039b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>how can the one which in things that exist separately be one, and why
					should not this "animal" also be separated from itself? Again, if it is to partake of
					"two-footed" and of "many-footed," an impossibility follows; for contrary attributes will
					belong to it although it is one and individual. <milestone n="14.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>But if it does not, in what sense is it that one calls an animal "two-footed" or
					"terrestrial"? Perhaps the terms are "combined" and "in contact" or "mixed." But all these
					expressions are absurd. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>(2) "But there is a different
					'animal' in each species." Then there will be practically an infinity of things of which
					"animal" is the substance, since it is not in an accidental sense that "man" is derived
					from "animal." <milestone n="14.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the Absolute Animal will
					be a plurality. For (a) the "animal" in each species will be the substance of that
					species, since the species is called after it and no other thing. Otherwise "man" would be
					derived from that other thing, which would be the genus of "man." (b) Further, all the
					constituents of "man" will be Ideas. Then, since nothing can be the Idea of one thing and
					the substance of another (for this is impossible), <milestone n="14.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>each and every "animal" in the various species will be the Absolute
						Animal. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, from what will these Forms be derived,
					and how can they be derived from the Absolute Animal? Or how can "the animal," whose very
					essence is "animal," exist apart from the Absolute Animal? And further, in the case of
					sensible things both these and still more absurd consequences follow. If, then, these
					consequences are impossible, clearly there are not Forms of sensible things in the sense
					in which some hold that there are. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="15.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since substance is
					of two kinds, the concrete thing and the formula (I mean that one kind of substance is the
					formula in combination with the matter, and the other is the formula in its full sense),
					substances in the former sense admit of destruction, for they also admit of generation.
					But the formula does not admit of destruction in the sense that it is ever
						<emph>being</emph> destroyed, since neither does it so admit of generation (for the
					essence of house is not generated, but only the essence of <emph>this</emph> house);
					formulae <emph>are</emph> , and <emph>are not</emph>, independently of generation and
					destruction; for it has been shown<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl

					generates or creates them. <milestone n="15.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this reason
					also there is no definition or demonstration of particular sensible substances, because
					they contain matter whose nature is such that it can both exist and not exist. Hence all
					the individual instances of them are perishable. <milestone n="15.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, the demonstration and definition of necessary truths
					requires scientific knowledge, and if, just as knowledge cannot be sometimes knowledge and
					sometimes ignorance (it is opinion that is of this nature), so too demonstration and
					definition cannot vary (it is opinion that is concerned with that which can be otherwise
					than it is)— <milestone n="1040a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>then clearly there can be neither definition nor demonstration of
					individual sensible substances. <milestone n="15.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For (a) things
					which perish are obscure to those who have knowledge of them when they are removed from
					the sphere of their perception, and (b) even though their formulae are preserved in the
					soul, there will no longer be either definition or demonstration of them. Therefore in
					cases relating to definition, when we are trying to define any individual, we must not
					fail to realize that our definition may always be upset; because it is impossible to
					define these things. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor, indeed, can any Idea be defined; for the Idea is an individual,
					as they say, and separable; and the formula must consist of words, and the man who is
					defining must not coin a word, because it would not be comprehensible. But the words which
					are in use are common to all the things which they denote; and so they must necessarily
					apply to something else as well. E.g., if a man were to define you, he would say that you
					are an animal which is lean or white or has some other attribute, which will apply to
					something else as well. <milestone n="15.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it should be
					said that there is no reason why all the attributes separately should not belong to
					several things, and yet in combination belong to this alone, we must reply, (1.) that they
					also belong to both the elements; e.g., "two-footed animal" belongs both to "animal" and
					to "two-footed" (and in the case of eternal elements this is even necessarily so; since
					they are prior to the compound, and parts of it. <milestone n="15.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed they are also separable, if the term "man" is
					separable—for either neither can be separable, or both are so. <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>If neither, the genus will not exist apart from the species, or
					if it is so to exist, so will the differentia); (2.) that "animal" and "two-footed" are
					prior in being to "two-footed animal," and that which is prior to something else is not
					destroyed together with it. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, if the Ideas are composed of Ideas (for constituents are less
					composite than that which they compose), still the elements of which the Idea is composed
					(e.g. "animal" and "two-footed") will have to be predicated of many particulars.
					Otherwise, how can they be known? For there would be an Idea which cannot be predicated of
					more than one thing. But this is not considered possible; every Idea is thought to admit
					of participation. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus, as we have said,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						statement has only been implied in the preceding arguments.</note> the impossibility of
					defining individuals is hard to realize when we are dealing with eternal entities,
					especially in the case of such as are unique, e.g. the sun and moon. For people go wrong
					not only by including in the definition attributes on whose removal it will still be
					sun—e.g., "that which goes round the earth," or "night-hidden " (for they suppose
					that if it stops or becomes visible<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. in the
						night.</note> it will no longer be sun; but it is absurd that this should be so, since
					"the sun "denotes a definite substance)—they also mention attributes which may apply
					to something else; e.g., if another thing with those attributes comes into being, clearly
					it will be a sun. The formula, then, is general; <milestone n="1040b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but the sun was supposed to be an
					individual, like Cleon or Socrates. <milestone n="15.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why does
					not one of the exponents of the Ideas produce a definition of them? If they were to try,
					it would become obvious that what we have just said is true. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="16.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious that even of those things
					which are thought to be substances the majority are potentialities; both the parts of
					living things (for none of them has a separate substantial existence; and when they are
					separated, although they still exist, they exist as matter), and earth, fire and air; for
					none of these is one <emph>thing</emph> —they are a mere aggregate before they are
					digested and some one thing is generated from them. <milestone n="16.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It might be supposed very reasonably that the parts of living things
					and the corresponding parts of their vital principle are both, i.e. exist both actually
					and potentially, because they contain principles of motion derived from something in their
					joints; and hence some animals<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">e.g. wasps, bees,
						tortoises (<bibl n="Plin. Nat.">P. Nat. 467a 18</bibl>, <bibl n="Plin. Nat.">468a

					potentially that all of them will exist when they are one and continuous by nature and not
					by force or concretion; for this sort of thing is malformation.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">i.e., it is only when they do not properly constitute a unity that parts
						can be said to exist actually.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="16.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since "unity" has the same variety of senses as "being,"
					and the substance of Unity is one, and things whose substance is numerically one are
					numerically one, evidently neither Unity nor Being can be the substance of things, just as
					neither "being an element" or "principle" can be the substance; <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but we ask what the principle is so that we may refer to
					something more intelligible.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., a thing is a
						principle in relation to something else which it explains; therefore a principle is less
						substantial than unity or being, which belong to a thing in itself.</note> <milestone
						n="16.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now of these concepts Being and Unity are more nearly
					substance than are principle, element and cause; but not even the former are quite
					substance, since nothing else that is common is substance; for substance belongs to
					nothing except itself and that which contains it and of which it is the
						substance. <milestone n="16.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, Unity cannot exist in many
					places at the same time, but that which is common is present in many things at the same
					time. Hence it is clear that no universal exists in separation apart from its particulars.
					The exponents of the Forms are partly right in their account when they make the Forms
					separate; that is, if the Forms are substances, but they are also partly wrong, since by
					"Form" they mean the "one-over-many."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.
						universal; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.990a">Aristot. Met.
						1.9.1</bibl>.</note> <milestone n="16.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason for this is
					that they cannot explain what are the imperishable substances of this kind which exist
					besides particular sensible substances; so they make them the same in kind as perishable
					things (for these we know); i.e., they make "Ideal Man" and "Ideal Horse," adding the word
					"Ideal" to the names of sensible things. <milestone n="16.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>However, I presume that even if we had never seen the stars, <milestone n="1041a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>none the less there would be
					eternal substances besides those which we knew; and so in the present case even if we
					cannot apprehend what they are, still there must be eternal substances of some

					substance and that no substance is composed of substances. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="17.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for what and what sort of thing we
					mean by substance, let us explain this by making, as it were, another fresh start. Perhaps
					in this way we shall also obtain some light upon that kind of substance which exists in
					separation from sensible substances. Since, then, substance is a kind of principle and
					cause, we had better pursue our inquiry from this point. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now
					when we ask why a thing is, it is always in the sense "why does A belong to B?" <milestone
						n="17.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To ask why the cultured man is a cultured man is to
					ask either, as we have said, why the man is cultured, or something else. Now to ask why a
					thing is itself is no question; because when we ask the reason of a thing the fact must
					first be evident; e.g., that the moon suffers eclipse; <milestone n="17.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>and "because it is itself" is the one explanation and reason which
					applies to all questions such as "why is man man?" or "why is the cultured person
					cultured?" (unless one were to say that each thing is indivisible from itself, and that
					this is what "being one" really means); <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but
					this, besides being a general answer, is a summary one.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">The argument is: The question "Why is the cultured man a cultured man?"
						if it does <emph>not</emph> mean "Why is the man cultured?" can only mean "Why is a
						thing itself?" But when we ask a question the fact must be obvious; and since it is
						obvious that a thing is itself, "because it is itself" (or "because each thing is
						indivisible from itself") is the one and only complete answer to all questions of this
						type. Since this answer (in either form) is clearly unsatisfactory, the question which
						it answers cannot be a proper question.</note> We may, however, ask why a man is an
					animal of such-and-such a kind. <milestone n="17.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear,
					then, that we are not asking why he who is a man is a man; therefore we are asking why A,
					which is predicated of B, belongs to B. (The fact that A does belong to B must be evident,
					for if this is not so, the question is pointless.) E.g., "Why does it thunder?" means "why
					is a noise produced in the clouds?" for the true form of the question is one thing
					predicated in this way of another. <milestone n="17.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or again,
					"why are these things, e.g. bricks and stones, a house?" Clearly then we are inquiring for
					the cause (i.e., to speak abstractly, the essence); which is in the case of some things,
					e.g. house or bed, the <emph>end</emph> , and in others the prime mover—for this
					also is a cause. We look for the latter kind of cause in the case of generation and
					destruction, but for the former also in the case of existence. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="17.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What we are now looking for is
					most obscure when one term is not predicated of another; <milestone n="1041b"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g. when we inquire what man
					is; because the expression is a simple one not analyzed into subject and attributes. We
					must make the question articulate before we ask it; otherwise we get something which
					shares the nature of a pointless and of a definite question. <milestone n="17.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since we must know that the fact actually exists, it is surely
					clear that the question is "why is the <emph>matter</emph> so-and-so?" e.g. "why are these
					materials a house?" Because the essence of house is present in them. And this matter, or
					the body containing this particular form, is man. Thus what we are seeking is the cause
					(i.e. the form) in virtue of which the matter is a definite thing; and this is the
					substance of the thing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Clearly then in the case of simple
						entities<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Pure forms which contain no matter; in

					different mode of inquiry. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="17.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since that which is composed of something in such a way that the
					whole is a unity; not as an aggregate is a unity, but as a syllable is<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This sentence is not finished; the parenthesis which
						follows lasts until the end of the chapter.</note>—the syllable is not the
					letters, nor is BA the same as B and A; nor is flesh fire and earth; because after
					dissolution the compounds, e.g. flesh or the syllable, no longer exist; but the letters
					exist, and so do fire and earth. <milestone n="17.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore the
					syllable is some particular thing; not merely the letters, vowel and consonant, but
					something else besides. And flesh is not merely fire and earth, or hot and cold, but
					something else besides. <milestone n="17.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since then this
					something else must be either an element or composed of elements, <milestone n="20"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(a) if it is an element, the same argument applies again; for
					flesh will be composed of <emph>this</emph> and fire and earth, and again of another
					element, so that there will be an infinite regression. And (b) if it is composed of
					elements, clearly it is composed not of one (otherwise it will itself be that element) but
					of several; so that we shall use the same argument in this case as about the flesh or the
						syllable. <milestone n="17.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It would seem, however, that this
					"something else" is something that is not an element, but is the cause that
						<emph>this</emph> matter is flesh and <emph>that</emph> matter a syllable, and similarly
					in other cases. <milestone n="17.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And this is the substance of

					chest; or by more than one of these methods. Other things are defined by their position,

					direction&gt;, e.g. the winds; others by time, e.g. dinner and breakfast; and others by

					the differences in degree, or in density and rarity, and in other such modifications, for
					they are all instances of excess and defect. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>And if anything differs in shape or in smoothness or roughness, all these are
					differences in straightness and curvature. For some things mixture will constitute being,
						<milestone n="1043a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the
					opposite state not-being. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From this it is evident that if
					substance is the cause of the existence of each thing, we must look among these
					"differences" for the cause of the being of each thing. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>No one of them, nor the combination of any two of them, is substance,
					but nevertheless each one of them contains something analogous to substance. And just as
					in the case of substances that which is predicated of the matter is the actuality itself,
					so in the other kinds of definition it is the nearest approximation to actuality. E.g., if
					we have to define a threshold, we shall call it "a piece of wood or stone placed in
					such-and-such a way"; and we should define a house as "bricks and timber arranged in
					such-and-such a way"; <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>or again in some cases
					there is the final cause as well. And if we are defining ice, we shall describe it as
					"water congealed or condensed in such-and-such a way"; and a harmony is "such-and-such a
					combination of high and low"; and similarly in the other cases. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>From this it is evident that the actuality or formula is different in the
					case of different matter; for in some cases it is a combination, in others a mixture, and
					in others some other of the modes which we have described. <milestone n="2.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in defining the nature of a house, those who describe it as
					stones, bricks and wood, describe the potential house, since these things are its matter;
					those who describe it as "a receptacle for containing goods and bodies," or something else
					to the same effect, describe its actuality; but those who combine these two definitions
					describe the third kind of substance, that which is composed of matter and form. <milestone
						n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it would seem that the formula which involves the
					differentiae is that of the form and the actuality, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>while that which involves the constituent parts is rather that of the
					matter. The same is true of the kind of definitions which Archytas<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">A celebrated Pythagorean, contemporary with Plato.</note> used to accept;
					for they are definitions of the combined matter and form. E.g., what is "windlessness?"
					Stillness in a large extent of air; for the air is the matter, and the stillness is the
					actuality and substance. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What is a calm?
					Levelness of sea. The sea is the material substrate, and the levelness is the actuality or
						form. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From the foregoing account it is clear what sensible
					substance is, and in what sense it exists; either as matter, or as form and actuality, or
					thirdly as the combination of the two. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must not fail to realize that sometimes it is doubtful
					whether a name denotes the composite substance or the actuality and the form—e.g.
					whether "house" denotes the composite thing, "a covering made of bricks and stones
					arranged in such-and-such a way," or the actuality and form, "a covering"; and whether
					"line" means "duality in length" or "duality"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
							<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1036b">Aristot. Met. 7.11.6</bibl>.</note>; and whether
					"animal" means "a soul in a body" or "a soul"; for the soul is the substance and actuality
					of some body. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "animal" would be
					applicable to both cases; not as being defined by one formula, but as relating to one
					concept. These distinctions are of importance from another point of view, but unimportant
					for the investigation of sensible substance; <milestone n="1043b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the essence belongs to the form and
					the actualization. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Soul and essence of soul are
					the same, but man and essence of man are not, unless the soul is also to be called man;
					and although this is so in one sense, it is not so in another. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>It appears, then, upon inquiry into the matter,<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 204a">Plat. Theaet. 204aff.</bibl></note> that
					a syllable is not derived from the phonetic elements plus combination, nor is a house
					bricks plus combination. And this is true; for the combination or mixture is not derived
					from the things of which it is a combination or mixture, <milestone n="3.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>nor, similarly, is any other of the "differences." E.g., if the
					threshold is defined by its position, the position is not derived from the threshold, but
					rather vice versa. Nor, indeed, is man "animal" <emph>plus</emph> "two-footed"; there must
					be something which exists besides these, if they are matter; but it is neither an element
					nor derived from an element, but the substance; and those who offer the definition given
					above are omitting this and describing the matter. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, this something else is the cause of a man's being, and this
					is his substance, they will not be stating his actual substance. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>Now the substance must be either eternal or perishable without ever being
					in process of perishing, and generated without ever being in process of generation. It has
					been clearly demonstrated elsewhere<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 7.1033a">Aristot. Met. 7.8</bibl>.</note> that no one generates or
					creates the form; it is the individual thing that is created, and the compound that is
						generated. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But whether the substances of
					perishable things are separable or not is not yet at all clear<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1042a">Aristot. Met. 8.1.6.
						n.</bibl>.</note>; only it is clear that this is impossible in some cases, <milestone

					from the particular instances; e.g. house or implement.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1033b">Aristot. Met. 7.8.6</bibl>.</note>
					Probably, then, neither these things themselves, nor anything else which is not naturally
					composed, are substances; for their nature is the only substance which one can assume in
					the case of perishable things. <milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the
					difficulty which perplexed the followers of Antisthenes<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1024b">Aristot. Met. 5.29.4</bibl>.</note>
					and others similarly unlearned has a certain application; I mean the difficulty that it is
					impossible to define <emph>what</emph> a thing is (for the definition, they say, is a
					lengthy formula), but it <emph>is</emph> possible actually to teach others what a thing
						<emph>is like</emph>; e.g., we cannot say <emph>what</emph> silver is, but we can say
					that it is like tin. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence there can be
					definition and formula of one kind of substance, i.e. the composite, whether it is
					sensible or intelligible; but not of its primary constituents, since the defining formula
					denotes something predicated of something, and this must be partly of the nature of matter
					and partly of the nature of form. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.9" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>It is also obvious that, if numbers are in any sense substances, they
					are such in this sense, and not, as some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle
						is referring to the Pythagoreans and Platonists, but seems as usual to misrepresent
						their views. His object in this section is to show that the relation of number to
						substance is only one of analogy. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1080a">Aristot. Met.
							13.6, 7</bibl>, and see Introduction.</note> describe them, aggregates of units. For
					(a) the definition is a kind of number, since it is divisible, and divisible into
					indivisible parts (for formulae are not infinite); and number is of this nature. <milestone
						n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And (b) just as when any element which composes the
					number is subtracted or added, it is no longer the same number but a different one,
					however small the subtraction or addition is; <milestone n="1044a" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so neither the definition nor the essence
					will continue to exist if something is subtracted from or added to it. And (c) a number
					must be something in virtue of which it is a unity (whereas our opponents cannot say what
					makes it one); that is, if it is a unity. <milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					either it is not a unity but a kind of aggregate, or if it is a unity, we must explain
					what makes a unity out of a plurality. And the definition is a unity; but similarly they
					cannot explain the definition either. This is a natural consequence, for the same reason
					applies to both, and substance is a unity in the way which we have explained, and not as
					some thinkers say: e.g. because it is a kind of unit or point; but each substance is a
					kind of actuality and nature. <milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also (d) just as
					a number does not admit of variation in degree, so neither does substance in the sense of
					form; if any substance does admit of this, it is substance in combination with
						matter.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In <bibl n="Aristot. Cat. 3b.33">Aristot.

						/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As regards material substance, we must not
					fail to realize that even if all things are derived from the same primary cause, or from
					the same things as primary causes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. from prime
						matter or the four elements.</note>; i.e. even if all things that are generated have the
					same matter for their first principle, nevertheless each thing has some matter peculiar to
					it; e.g., "the sweet" or "the viscous" is the proximate matter of mucus, and "the bitter"
					or some such thing is that of bile— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>although probably mucus and bile are derived from the same ultimate matter. <milestone
						n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The result is that there is more than one matter of the
					same thing, when one thing is the matter of the other; e.g., mucus is derived from "the
					viscous"; and from "the sweet," if "the viscous" is derived from "the sweet"; and from
					bile, by the analysis of bile into its ultimate matter. For there are two senses in which
					X comes from Y; either because X will be found further on than Y in the process of
					development, or because X is produced when Y is analyzed into its original
						constituents. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And different things can be
					generated by the moving cause when the matter is one and the same, e.g. a chest and a bed
					from wood. But some different things must necessarily have different matter; e.g., a saw
					cannot be generated from wood, nor does this lie in the power of the moving cause, for it
					cannot make a saw of wool or wood. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, it is possible to make the same thing from different matter,
					clearly the art, i.e. the moving principle, is the same; for if both the matter and the
					mover are different, so too is the product. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So whenever we
					inquire what the cause is, since there are causes in several senses, we must state all the
					possible causes. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., what is the material
					cause of a man? The menses. What is the moving cause? The semen. What is the formal cause?
					The essence. What is the final cause? The end. <milestone n="1044b" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(But perhaps both the latter are the same.)
					We must, however, state the most proximate causes. What is the matter? Not fire or earth,
					but the matter proper to man. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus as regards generable natural substances we must proceed in this
					manner, if we are to proceed correctly; that is, if the causes are these and of this
					number, and it is necessary to know the causes. But in the case of substances which though
					natural are eternal the principle is different. For presumably some of them have no
					matter; or no matter of this kind, but only such as is spatially mobile.<note

					exist by nature but are not substances have no matter; their substrate is their substance.
					E.g., what is the cause of an eclipse; what is its matter? It has none; it is the moon
					which is affected. What is the moving cause which destroys the light? The earth. There is
					probably no final cause. The formal cause is the formula; but this is obscure unless it
					includes the efficient cause. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., what is an
					eclipse? A privation of light; and if we add "caused by the earth's intervention," this is
					the definition which includes the &lt;efficient&gt; cause. In the case of sleep it is not
					clear what it is that is proximately affected. Is it the animal? Yes; but in respect of
					what, and of what proximately? The heart, or some other part. Again, by what is it
					affected? Again, what is the affection which affects that part, and not the whole animal?

					contact is the cause of their unity, and sometimes viscosity or some other such

					account, not by connection, like the <title> Iliad </title>, but because it is a
					definition of one thing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>What is it, then, that makes "man"
					one thing, and why does it make him one thing and not many, e.g. "animal" and
					"two-footed," especially if, as some say, there is an Idea of "animal" and an Idea of
						"two-footed"? <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why are not these Ideas "man,"
					and why should not man exist by participation, not in any "man," but in two Ideas, those
					of "animal" and "two-footed"? <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And in general
					"man" will be not one, but two things—"animal" and "two-footed." Evidently if we
					proceed in this way, as it is usual to define and explain, it will be impossible to answer
					and solve the difficulty. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if, as we
					maintain, man is part matter and part form—the matter being potentially, and the
					form actually man—, the point which we are investigating will no longer seem to be a

					something one, just as it is something existent. <milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Hence also there is no other cause of the unity of any of these things, or of their
					existence; for each one of them is one and "existent" not because it is contained in the

					and others speak of "communion"; e.g., Lycophron<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A

					"being healthy" will be the "communion" or "connection" or "combination" of soul and
					health; and "being a bronze triangle" a "combination" of bronze and triangle; and "being
					white" a "combination" of surface and whiteness. The reason for this is that people look

					cause of unity in general; for each individual thing is one, and the potential and the

					(1.) to anything which does not possess a certain attribute; (2.) to that which would

						/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since some of these principles are
					inherent in inanimate things, and others in animate things and in the soul and in the
					rational part of the soul, <milestone n="1046b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is clear that some of the potencies also will be irrational
					and some rational. Hence all arts, i.e. the productive sciences, are potencies; because
					they are principles of change in another thing, or in the artist himself <hi rend="Italic"
						>qua</hi> other. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Every rational potency admits equally of contrary results, but
					irrational potencies admit of one result only. E.g., heat can only produce heat, but
					medical science can produce disease and health. The reason of this is that science is a
					rational account, and the same account explains both the thing and its privation, though
					not in the same way; and in one sense it applies to both, and in another sense rather to
					the actual fact. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore such sciences must
					treat of contraries—essentially of the one, and non-essentially of the other; for
					the rational account also applies essentially to the one, but to the other in a kind of
					accidental way, since it is by negation and removal that it throws light on the contrary.
					For the contrary is the primary privation,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 10.1055a">Aristot. Met. 10.4.7</bibl>.</note> and this is the removal
					of that to which it is contrary.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Literally "of the
						other," i.e. the positive term.</note> <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					since contrary attributes cannot be induced in the same subject, and science is a potency
					which depends upon the possession of a rational formula, and the soul contains a principle
					of motion, it follows that whereas "the salutary" can only produce health, and "the
					calefactory" only heat, and "the frigorific" only cold, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>the scientific man can produce both contrary results. <milestone n="2.5"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the rational account includes both, though not in the same
					way; and it is in the soul, which contains a principle of motion, and will therefore, by
					means of the same principle, set both processes in motion, by linking them with the same
					rational account. Hence things which have a rational potency produce results contrary to
					those of things whose potency is irrational<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						meaning of this awkward sentence is clearly shown in the latter part of 4.</note>; for
					the results of the former are included under one principle, the rational
						account. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is evident also that whereas the
					power of merely producing (or suffering) a given effect is implied in the power of
					producing that effect <emph>well</emph> , the contrary is not always true; for that which
					produces an effect well must also produce it, but that which merely produces a given
					effect does not necessarily produce it well. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone

						Eleatic system and developed it along dialectical lines.</note> who say that a thing
					only has potency when it functions, and that when it is not functioning it has no potency.
					E.g., they say that a man who is not building cannot build, but only the man who is
					building, and at the moment when he is building; and similarly in the other
						cases. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is not difficult to see the absurd
					consequences of this theory. Obviously a man will not be a builder unless he is building,
					because "to be a builder" is "to be capable of building"; and the same will be true of the

					for that which is standing will always stand, and that which is sitting will always sit;
					because if it is sitting it will not get up, since it is impossible that anything which is
					incapable of getting up should get up. <milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since,

						walk. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A thing is capable of doing something
					if there is nothing impossible in its having the actuality of that of which it is said to
					have the potentiality. I mean, e.g., that if a thing is capable of sitting and is not
					prevented from sitting, there is nothing impossible in its actually sitting; and similarly
					if it is capable of being moved or moving or standing or making to stand or being or
					becoming or not being or not becoming. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.9"

					for it is agreed that actuality is properly motion. <milestone n="3.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence people do not invest non-existent things with motion, although
					they do invest them with certain other predicates. E.g., they say that non-existent things
					are conceivable and desirable, but not that they are in motion. This is because, although
					these things do not exist actually, they will exist actually; <milestone n="1047b"

					if it is possible for A to be real, it must also be possible for B to be real; for even if

					that whose nature it is to move or be moved by something else, either without
					qualification or in some definite way, but also in other senses; and it is on this account
					that in the course of our inquiry we have discussed these as well. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Actuality" means the presence

					because it can be separated from it; and as we call even a man who is not studying "a
					scholar" if he is capable of studying. That which is present in the opposite sense to this
					is present actually. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What we mean can be
					plainly seen in the particular cases by induction; we need not seek a definition for every
					term, but must comprehend the analogy: that as that which is actually building is to that
					which is capable of building, <milestone n="1048b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so is that which is awake to that which is asleep; and that

					which is differentiated out of matter to the matter; and the finished article to the raw
						material. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let actuality be defined by one
					member of this antithesis, and the potential by the other. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"

					be truly made without qualification, since "that which is seen" is so called sometimes
					because it is seen and sometimes because it is capable of being seen; but the Infinite
					does not exist potentially in the sense that it will ever exist separately in actuality;

					an illustration of our point if it is similarly not some other thing, but a definite
					material—it is always the latter term in this series which is, in the fullest sense,
					potentially something else. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., a box is not
					earth, nor earthen, but wooden; for it is this that is potentially a box, and this is the
					matter of the box—that is, wooden material in general is the matter of "box" in
					general, whereas the matter of a particular box is a particular piece of wood. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>If there is some primary stuff, which is not further called the
					material of some other thing, this is primary matter. E.g., if earth is "made of air," and
					air is not fire, but "made of fire," then fire is primary matter, not being an individual
						thing. <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the subject or substrate is
					distinguishable into two kinds by either being or not being an individual thing. Take for
					example as the subject of the attributes "man," or "body" or "soul," and as an attribute
					"cultured" or "white." Now the subject, when culture is induced in it, is called not
					"culture" but "cultured," and the man is called not whiteness but white; nor is he called
					"ambulation" or "motion," but "walking" or "moving"; just as we said that things are of a
					definite material. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus where "subject" has
					this sense, the ultimate substrate is substance; but where it has not this sense, and the
					predicate is a form or individuality, the ultimate substrate is matter or material
					substance. It is quite proper that both matter and attributes should be described by a

					potentiality in this sense too, i.e. in respect of generation and time. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/>But it is also prior in substantiality; (a) because things which are
					posterior in generation are prior in form and substantiality; e.g., adult is prior to
					child, and man to semen, because the one already possesses the form, but the other does
						not; <milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and (b) because everything which is
					generated moves towards a principle, i.e. its <emph>end</emph> . For the object of a thing
					is its principle; and generation has as its object the <emph>end</emph> . And the
					actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired;
					for animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but have sight in order that
					they may see. <milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly men possess the art of
					building in order that they may build, and the power of speculation that they may
					speculate; they do not speculate in order that they may have the power of
					speculation—except those who are learning by practice; and they do not really
					speculate, but only in a limited sense, or about a subject about which they have no desire
					to speculate. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, matter exists potentially, because it
					may attain to the form; but when it exists actually, it is then <emph>in</emph> the form.
					The same applies in all other cases, including those where the end is motion. <milestone
						n="8.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, just as teachers think that they have achieved
					their end when they have exhibited their pupil performing, so it is with nature. For if
					this is not so, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it will be another case of
					"Pauson's Hermes"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Probably a "trick" picture of some

						<emph>in</emph> the pupil or outside him, as in the case of the Hermes. For the activity
					is the end, and the actuality is the activity; hence the term "actuality" is derived from
					"activity," and tends to have the meaning of "complete reality." <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="8.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now whereas in some cases the
					ultimate thing is the use of the faculty, as, e.g., in the case of sight seeing is the
					ultimate thing, and sight produces nothing else besides this; but in other cases something
					is produced, e.g. the art of building produces not only the act of building but a house;
					nevertheless in the one case the use of the faculty is the end, and in the other it is
					more truly the end than is the potentiality. For the act of building resides in the thing
					built; i.e., it comes to be and exists simultaneously with the house. <milestone ed="P"

					result is something other than the exercise of the faculty, the actuality resides in the
					thing produced; e.g. the act of building in the thing built, the act of weaving in the
					thing woven, and so on; and in general the motion resides in the thing moved. But where
					there is no other result besides the actualization, the actualization resides in the
					subject; e.g. seeing in the seer, and speculation in the speculator, and life in the soul

						/><milestone n="8.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and hence also happiness, since
					happiness is a particular kind of life). Evidently, therefore, substance or form is
					actuality. Thus it is obvious by this argument that actuality is prior in substantiality
					to potentiality; and that in point of time, as we have said, one actuality presupposes
					another right back to that of the prime mover in each case. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="8.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is also prior in a deeper sense;
					because that which is eternal is prior in substantiality to that which is perishable, and
					nothing eternal is potential. The argument is as follows. Every potentiality is at the
					same time a potentiality for the opposite.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						19.</note> For whereas that which is incapable of happening cannot happen to anything,
					everything which is capable may fail to be actualized. <milestone n="8.16" ed="P"

					Therefore the same thing is capable both of being and of not being. But that which is
					capable of not being may possibly not be; and that which may possibly not be is
					perishable; either absolutely, or in the particular sense in which it is said that it may
					possibly not be; that is, in respect either of place or of quantity or of quality.
					"Absolutely" means in respect of substance. <milestone n="8.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"

					is no reason why it should not be potential in some particular respect; e.g. of quality or

					necessity be potential; and yet these things are primary, for if they did not exist,
					nothing would exist. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Nor can motion be
					potential, if there is any eternal motion. Nor, if there is anything eternally in motion,
					is it potentially in motion (except in respect of some starting-point or destination), and

					higher degree is that which is a whole and has a definite shape or form, particularly that
					which is such by nature and not by constraint (like things which are joined by glue or
					nails or by being tied together), but which contains in itself the cause of its
						continuity. <milestone n="I.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A thing is of this kind if its
					motion is one and indivisible in respect of place and time; so that clearly if a thing has
					as its principle of motion the primary kind of motion (i.e. locomotion) in its primary
					form (i.e. circular locomotion), it is in the primary sense <emph>one</emph> spatial
						magnitude.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This description applies to the
						celestial spheres.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Some things, then, are one in
					this sense, <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> continuous or whole; the other things which are one
					are those whose formula is one. <milestone n="I.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such are the
					things of which the concept is one, i.e. of which the concept is indivisible; and this is
					indivisible when the object is indivisible (3.) in form or (4.) in number. Now in number
					the individual is indivisible, and in form that which is indivisible in comprehension and
					knowledge; so that that which causes the unity of substances must be one in the primary
						sense. <milestone n="I.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such, then, in number are the meanings
					of "one": the naturally continuous, the whole, the individual, and the universal. All
					these are one because they are indivisible; some in motion, and others in concept or
					formula. <milestone n="1052b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>But we must recognize that the questions, "What sort of things are called one?" and
					"What is essential unity, and what is the formula?" must not be taken to be the same.
						<milestone n="I.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"One" has these several meanings, and each
					thing to which some one of these senses applies will be one; but essential unity will have
					now one of these senses and now something else, which is still nearer to the
						<emph>term</emph> one, whereas they are nearer to its <emph>denotation</emph> . This is
					also true of "element" and "cause," supposing that one had to explain them both by
					exhibiting concrete examples and by giving a definition of the term. <milestone n="I.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is a sense in which fire is an element (and no doubt so
					too is "the indeterminate"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reference is
						undoubtedly to Anaximander. </note> or some other similar thing, of its own nature), and
					there is a sense in which it is not; because "to be fire" and "to be an element" are not
					the same. It is as a concrete thing and as a stuff that fire is an element; but the term
					"element" denotes that it has this attribute: that something is made of it as a primary
					constituent. <milestone n="I.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The same is true of "cause" or
					"one" and all other such terms. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hence "to be one" means "to
					be indivisible" (being essentially a particular thing, distinct and separate in place or
					form or thought), or "to be whole and indivisible"; but especially "to be the first
					measure of each kind," and above all of quantity; for it is from this that it has been
					extended to the other categories. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone
						n="I.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Measure is that by which quantity is known, and
					quantity <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantity is known either by unity or by number, and

					is known by unity, and that by which quantities are primarily known is absolute
						unity. <milestone n="I.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus unity is the starting point of
					number <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> number. Hence in other cases too "measure" means that by
					which each thing is primarily known, and the measure of each thing is a unit—in
					length, breadth, depth, weight and speed. <milestone n="I.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(The
					terms "weight" and "speed" are common to both contraries, for each of them has a double

					that which has excess of it, and speed to that which has the least amount of motion and
					also to that which has excess of it; for even the slow has some speed, and the light some
						weight.) <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In
					all these cases, then, the measure and starting-point is some indivisible unit (since even
					in the case of lines we treat the "one-foot line" as indivisible). For everywhere we
					require as our measure an indivisible unit; i.e., that which is simple either in quality
					or in quantity. <milestone n="I.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now where it seems impossible
					to take away or add, there the measure is exact. <milestone n="1053a" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the measure of number is most exact,
					for we posit the unit as in every way indivisible; and in all other cases we follow this
					example, for with the furlong or talent or in general with the greater measure an addition
					or subtraction would be less obvious than with a smaller one. <milestone n="I.14" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore the first thing from which, according to our perception,
					nothing can be subtracted is used by all men as their measure of wet and dry, weight and
					magnitude; and they think that they know the quantity only when they know it in terms of
					this measure. And they know motion too by simple motion and the most rapid, for this takes
					least time. <milestone n="I.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in astronomy a unit of this
					kind is the starting point and measure; for they assume that the motion of the heavens is
					uniform and the most rapid, and by it they judge the others. In music the measure is the
					quarter tone, because it is the smallest interval; and in language the letter. All these
					are examples of units in this sense—not in the sense that unity is something common
					to them all, but in the sense which we have described. <milestone n="I.16" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The measure is not always numerically one, but sometimes more than
					one; e.g., there are two quarter tones, distinguished not by our hearing but by their
					theoretical ratios<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the enharmonic (or
						quarter-tone proper) and the chromatic, which was 1/3 of a tone (<bibl n="Aristox. 1.21"

					same sense—e.g. the foot and the arithmetical unit; but the latter is absolutely

					and in particular the measure of length is a length; of breadth, a breadth; of sounds, a
					sound; of weight, a weight; of units, a unit; for this is the view that we must take, and
					not that the measure of numbers is a number. The latter, indeed, would necessarily be
					true, if the analogy held good; but the supposition is not analogous—it is as though

						unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must inquire, with regard

						<emph>what</emph> unity is, and what view we are to take of it; whether that unity
					itself is a kind of substance—as first the Pythagoreans, and later Plato, both
					maintain—or whether rather some nature underlies it, and we should give a more
					intelligible account of it, and more after the manner of the physicists; for of them
						one<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Empedocles.</note> holds that the One is Love,

					and being itself cannot be a substance in the sense of one thing existing alongside the
					many (since it is common to them), but only as a predicate, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>then clearly neither can unity be a substance; because being and unity are
					the most universal of all predicates. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					(a) genera are not certain entities and substances separate from other things; and (b)
					unity cannot be a genus, for the same reasons that being and substance cannot.<note

					be the same for all categories. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now being and
					unity have the same number of meanings; so that since in the category of qualities unity
					is something definite, i.e. some definite entity, and similarly in the category of
					quantity, clearly we must also inquire in general what unity is, just as in the case of
					being; since it is not enough to say that its nature is simply unity or being. <milestone
						n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in the sphere of colors unity is a color, e.g.
					white; that is if all the other colors are apparently derived from white and black, and
					black is a privation of white, as darkness is of light. Thus if all existing things were
					colors, all existing things would be a number; but of what? <milestone n="2.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly of colors. And unity would be some one color, e.g. white.
					Similarly if all existing things were tunes, there would be a number—of
					quarter-tones; but their substance would not be a number; and unity would be something
					whose substance is not unity but a quarter-tone. <milestone n="1054a" unit="section"
						/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Similarly in the case of sounds, existing
					things would be a number of letters, and unity would be a vowel; <milestone n="2.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>and if existing things were right-lined figures, they would be a
					number of figures, and unity would be a triangle. And the same principle holds for all
					other genera. Therefore if in the categories of passivity and quality and quantity and
					motion there is in every category a number and a unity, and if the number is of particular
					things and the unity is a particular unity, and its substance is not unity, then the same
					must be true in the case of substances, because the same is true in all cases. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious, then,

							n="Aristot. Met. 5.1018a">Aristot. Met. 5.10</bibl>.</note> are different, and
					contrariety is a kind of difference. That this is rightly premissed is made clear by
					induction; for the contraries are obviously all different, since they are not merely
					"other," but some are other in genus, and others are in the same line of predication,
						<milestone n="1055a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and so
					are in the same genus and the same in genus. We have distinguished elsewhere<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1024b">Aristot. Met.
							5.28.4</bibl>.</note> what sort of things are the same or other in genus. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since things which
					differ can differ from one another in a greater or less degree, there is a certain maximum
					difference, and this I call contrariety. That it is the maximum difference is shown by
					induction. For whereas things which differ in genus have no means of passing into each
					other, and are more widely distant, and are not comparable, in the case of things which
					differ in species the contraries are the extremes from which generation takes
						place; <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the greatest distance is that
					which is between the extremes, and therefore also between the contraries. But in every
					class the greatest thing is complete. For (a) that is greatest which cannot be exceeded,
					and (b) that is complete outside which nothing proper to it can be found. For complete
					difference implies an end, just as all other things are called complete because they imply
					an end. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is nothing beyond the end;
					for in everything the end is the last thing, and forms the boundary. Thus there is nothing
					beyond the end, and that which is complete lacks nothing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
					/>From this argument, then, it is clear that contrariety is maximum difference; and since
					we speak of contraries in various senses, the sense of completeness will vary in
					accordance with the sense of contrariety which applies to the contraries. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>This being so, evidently one thing cannot have more than one contrary
					(since there can be nothing more extreme than the extreme, nor can there be more than two
					extremes of one interval); and in general this is evident, if contrariety is difference,
					and difference (and therefore complete difference) is between two things. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The other definitions of
					contraries must also be true, for (1.) complete difference is the maximum difference;
					since (a) we can find nothing beyond it, whether things differ in genus or in species (for
					we have shown that difference in relation to things outside the genus is impossible; this
					is the maximum difference between them); and (b) the things which differ most in the same
					genus are contraries; for complete difference is the maximum difference between
						these. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) The things which differ most in
					the same receptive material are contraries; for contraries have the same matter. (3.) The
					most different things which come under the same faculty are contraries; for one science
					treats of one class of things, in which complete difference is the greatest. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Positive state" and
					"Privation" constitute primary contrariety—not every form of privation (for it has
					several senses), but any form which is complete. All other contraries must be so called
					with respect to these; some because they possess these, others because they produce them
					or are productive of them, and others because they are acquisitions or losses of these or
					other contraries. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if the types of
					opposition are contradiction, privation, contrariety and relation, <milestone n="1055b"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and of these the primary type
					is contradiction, and an intermediate is impossible in contradiction but possible between
					contraries, obviously contradiction is not the same as contrariety; and privation is a
					form of contradiction; <milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is either that
					which is totally incapable of possessing some attribute,<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">This is not a proper example of privation. Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 5.1022b">Aristot. Met. 5.22</bibl>.</note> or that which would
					naturally possess some attribute but does not, that suffers privation—either
					absolutely or in some specified way. Here we already have several meanings, which we have
					distinguished elsewhere. Thus privation is a kind of contradiction or incapacity which is
					determinate or associated with the receptive material. <milestone n="4.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>This is why though there is no intermediate in contradiction there is
					one in some kinds of privation. For everything is either equal or not equal, but not
					everything is either equal or unequal; if it is, it is only so in the case of a material
					which admits of equality. If, then, processes of material generation start from the
					contraries, and proceed either from the form and the possession of the form, or from some
					privation of the form or shape, clearly all contrariety must be a form of privation,
					although presumably not all privation is contrariety. <milestone n="4.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>This is because that which suffers privation may suffer it in several
					senses; for it is only the extremes from which changes proceed that are
						contraries. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This can also be shown by induction. Every
					contrariety involves privation as one of its contraries, but not always in the same
						way: <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>inequality involves the privation of
					equality, dissimilarity that of similarity, evil that of goodness. <milestone n="4.12"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the differences are as we have stated: one case is, if a
					thing is merely deprived; another, if it is deprived at a certain time or in a certain
					part—e.g. at a certain age or in the important part—or entirely. Hence in some
					cases there is an intermediate (there are men who are neither good nor bad), and in others
					there is not—a thing must be either odd or even. <milestone n="4.13" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, some have a determinate subject, and others have not. Thus it
					is evident that one of a pair of contraries always has a privative sense; but it is enough
					if this is true of the primary or generic contraries, e.g. unity and plurality; for the
					others can be reduced to them. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Since one thing has one contrary, it might be asked in what sense
					unity is opposed to plurality, and the equal to the great and to the small. For if we
					always use the word "whether" in an antithesis—e.g., "whether it is white or black,"
					or "whether it is white or not" (but we do not ask "whether it is a man or white," unless
					we are proceeding upon some assumption, and asking, for instance, whether it was Cleon who
					came or Socrates. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is not a necessary
					disjunction in any class of things, but is derived from the use in the case of
					opposites—for it is only opposites that cannot be true at the same time—and we
					have this same use here in the question "which of the two came?" <milestone n="1056a"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for if both alternatives were
					possible, the question would be absurd; but even so the question falls into an antithesis:
					that of "one" or "many"—i.e., "whether both came, or one")— <milestone n="5.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>if, then, the question "whether" is always concerned with
					opposites, and we can ask "whether it is greater or smaller, or equal," what is the nature
					of the antithesis between "equal" and "greater or smaller"? It is contrary neither to one
					only, nor to both: for (a) it is no more contrary to the greater than to the smaller; (b)
					"equal" is contrary to "unequal," and thus it will be contrary to more than one
						thing; <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) if "unequal" means the same as
					both "greater" and "smaller" at the same time, "equal" must still be opposed to them both:
					This difficulty supports the theory<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Held by the
						Platonists. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 14.1087b">Aristot. Met. 14.1.4, 5</bibl>.</note>
					that "the unequal" is a duality. But the result is that one thing is contrary to two;
					which is impossible. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, it is apparent that "equal" is intermediate between "great"
					and "small," but it is not apparent that any contrariety is intermediate, nor can it be,
					by definition; for it could not be complete if it were the intermediate of something, but
					rather it always has something intermediate between itself and the other
						extreme. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It remains, then, that it is opposed either as
					negation or as privation. Now it cannot be so opposed to one of the two, for it is no more
					opposed to the great than to the small. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Therefore it is a privative negation of both. For this reason we say "whether" with
					reference to both, and not to one of the two—e.g., "whether it is greater or equal,"
					or "whether it is equal or smaller"; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there are
					always three alternatives. But it is not a necessary privation; for not everything is
					equal which is not greater or smaller, but only things which would naturally have these
						attributes. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>					The equal, then, is that which is neither great nor small, but would naturally be either
					great or small; and it is opposed to both as a privative negation, and therefore is
					intermediate between them. And that which is neither good nor bad is opposed to both, but
					it has no name (for each of these terms has several meanings, and there is no one material
					which is receptive of both); that which is neither white nor black is better entitled to a
						name, <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>although even this has no single name,
					but the colors of which this negation is privatively predicated are to a certain extent
					limited; for it must be either grey or buff or something similar. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore those persons are
					wrong in their criticism who imagine that all terms are used analogously, so that that
					which is neither a shoe nor a hand will be intermediate between "shoe" and "hand," because
					that which is neither good nor bad is intermediate between good and bad—as though
					there must be an intermediate in all cases; but this does not necessarily
						follow. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the one is a joint negation of
					opposites where there is an intermediate and a natural interval; <milestone n="1056b"
						unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but in the other case there is
					no question of difference, since the joint negation applies to things which are in
					different genera, and therefore the substrate is not one.<note resp="Tredennick"

						unit="Loeb chap"/>A similar question might be raised about "one" and "many." For if
					"many" is absolutely opposed to "one," certain impossibilities result. (1) One will be
					few; for "many" is also opposed to "few." <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2)
					Two will be many; since "twofold" is "manifold," and "twofold" is derived from two.
					Therefore one will be few; for in what relation can two be many if not in relation to one,
					which must therefore be few? for there can be nothing less. (3) If "much" and "little" are
					in plurality what "long" and "short" are in length, and if whatever is "much" is also
						"many," <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and "many" is "much" (unless indeed
					there is a difference in the case of a plastic continuum<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">i.e., a fluid, which cannot be described as "many."</note>), "few" will
					be a plurality. Therefore one will be a plurality, if it is few; and this necessarily
					follows if two is many. Presumably, however, although "many" in a sense means "much,"
					there is a distinction; e.g., water is called "much" but not "many." <milestone n="6.4"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To all things, however, which are divisible the term "many" is
					applicable: in one sense, if there is a plurality which involves excess either absolutely
					or relatively (and similarly "few" is a plurality involving defect); and in another in the
					sense of number, in which case it is opposed to "one" only. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>For we say "one or many" just as if we were to say "one and ones," or
					"white thing and white things," or were to compare the things measured with the
						measure. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Multiples, too, are spoken of in
					this way; for every number is "many," because it consists of "ones," and because every
					number is measurable by one; and also as being the opposite of one, and not of few. In
					this sense even two is many; but as a plurality involving excess either relatively or
					absolutely it is not many, but the first plurality. Two is, however, absolutely few;
					because it is the first plurality involving defect <milestone n="6.6" ed="P"

					fewer it is not therefore few. Plurality is, as it were, a genus of number, since number
					is a plurality measurable by one. And in a sense one and number are opposed; not, however,
					as being contrary, but as we have said some relative terms to be; for it is <hi

						unit="line"/>for all intermediates are in the same genus as the things between which
					they are intermediate. <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By intermediates we mean
					those things into which that which changes must first change. E.g., if we change from the
					highest string to the lowest by the smallest gradations we shall first come to the
					intermediate notes; and in the case of colors if we change from white to black we shall
					come to red and grey before we come to black; and similarly in other cases. <milestone
						n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But change from one genus into another is impossible
					except accidentally; e.g., from color to shape. Therefore intermediates must be in the
					same genus as one another and as the things between which they are intermediate. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>But all intermediates are between certain opposites, for it is only
					from these per se that change is possible. <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Hence there can be no intermediate between things which are not opposites; for then
					there would be change also between things which are not opposites. Of things which are
					opposites, contradiction has no intermediate term (for contradiction means this: an
					antithesis one term of which must apply to any given thing, and which contains no
					intermediate term); of the remaining types of opposites some are relative, others
					privative, and others contrary. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those relative
					opposites which are not contrary have no intermediate. The reason for this is that they
					are not in the same genus— <milestone n="1057b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for what is intermediate between knowledge and the
					knowable?—but between great and small there is an intermediate. Now since
					intermediates are in the same genus, as has been shown, and are between contraries, they
					must be composed of those contraries. For the contraries must either belong to a genus or
					not. And if there is a genus in such a way <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>that
					it is something prior to the contraries, then the differentiae which constitute the
					contrary species (for species consist of genus and differentiae) will be contraries in a
					prior sense. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., if white and black are
					contraries, and the one is a penetrative<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is
						Plato's definition. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 67d">Plat. Tim. 67d, e</bibl>.</note> and
					the other a compressive color, these differentiae, "penetrative" and "compressive," are
					prior, and so are opposed to each other in a prior sense. <milestone n="7.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is the species which have contrary differentiae that are more
					truly contraries; the other, i.e. intermediate, species will consist of genus and
					differentiae. E.g., all colors which are intermediate between white and black should be
					described by their genus (i.e. color) and by certain differentiae. <milestone n="7.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But these differentiae will not be the primary contraries;
					otherwise every thing will be either white or black. Therefore they will be different from
					the primary contraries. Therefore they will be intermediate between them, and the primary
					differentiae will be "the penetrative" and "the compressive." <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>Thus we must first investigate the contraries which are not contained in a
					genus, and discover of what their intermediates are composed. <milestone n="7.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For things which are in the same genus must either be composed of
					differentiae which are not compounded with the genus, or be incomposite. Contraries are
					not compounded with one another, and are therefore first principles; but intermediates are
					either all incomposite or none of them. Now from the contraries something is generated in
					such a way that change will reach it before reaching the contraries themselves (for there
					must be something which is less in degree than one contrary and greater than the other).
					Therefore this also will be intermediate between the contraries. <milestone n="7.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all the other intermediates must be composite; for that which is
					greater in degree than one contrary and less than the other is in some sense a compound of
					the contraries of which it is said to be greater in degree than one and less than the
					other. And since there is nothing else homogeneous which is prior to the contraries, all
					intermediates must be composed of contraries. <milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Therefore all the lower terms, both contraries and intermediates, must be composed of
					the primary contraries. Thus it is clear that intermediates are all in the same genus, and
					are between contraries, and are all composed of contraries. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That which is "other in species" than
					something else is "other" in respect of something and that something must apply to both.
					E.g., if an animal is other in species than something else, they must both be animals.
					Hence things which are other in species must be in the same genus. The sort of thing I
					mean by "genus" is that in virtue of which two things are both called the same one thing;
						<milestone n="1058a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and which
					is not accidentally differentiated, whether regarded as matter or otherwise. <milestone
						n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For not only must the common quality belong to both,
					e.g., that they are both animals, but the very animality of each must be different; e.g.,
					in one case it must be equinity and in the other humanity. Hence the common quality must
					for one be other in species than that which it is for the other. They must be, then, of
					their very nature, the one <emph>this</emph> kind of animal, and the other
						<emph>that</emph> ; e.g., the one a horse and the other a man. <milestone n="8.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore this difference must be "otherness of genus" (I say
					"otherness of genus" because by "difference of genus" I mean an otherness which makes the
					genus itself other); this, then, will be a form of contrariety. This is obvious by
						induction.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle does not use induction to
						prove his point; indeed he does not prove it at all.</note> For all differentiation is
					by opposites, and we have shown<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In ch. 4.</note>
					that contraries are in the same genus, because contrariety was shown to be complete
					difference. But difference in species is always difference from something in respect of
					something; therefore this is the same thing, i.e. the genus, for both. <milestone n="8.4"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Hence too all contraries which differ in species but not in
					genus are in the same line of predication,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Or
						"category."</note> and are other than each other in the highest degree; for their
					difference is complete, and they cannot come into existence simultaneously.) Hence the
					difference is a form of contrariety. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To be "other in
					species," then, means this: to be in the same genus and involve contrariety, while being
						indivisible <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and "the same in species"
					applies to all things which do not involve contrariety, while being
						indivisible); <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for it is in the course of
					differentiation and in the intermediate terms that contrariety appears, before we come to
					the indivisibles.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., indivisible species and
						individuals.</note> <milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus it is evident that
					in relation to what is called genus no species is either the same or other in species (and
					this is as it should be, for the matter is disclosed by negation, and the genus is the
					matter of that of which it is predicated as genus; not in the sense in which we speak of
					the genus or clan of the Heraclidae,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 5.1024a">Aristot. Met. 5.28.1</bibl>.</note> but as we speak of a
					genus in nature); nor yet in relation to things which are not in the same genus. From the
					latter it will differ in genus, but in species from things which are in the same genus.
					For the difference of things which differ in species must be a contrariety; and this
					belongs only to things which are in the same genus. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question might be raised as to why
					woman does not differ in species from man, seeing that female is contrary to male, and

					does; "male" and "female" belong to it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> animal. <milestone
						n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This problem is practically the same as "why does one
					kind of contrariety (e.g. "footed" and "winged") make things other in species, while
					another (e.g. whiteness and blackness) does not?" The answer may be that in the one case
					the attributes are peculiar to the genus, and in the other they are less so; <milestone
						n="1058b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and since one
					element is formula and the other matter, contrarieties in the formula produce difference
					in species, but contrarieties in the concrete whole do not. <milestone n="9.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the whiteness or blackness of a man does not produce this, nor
					is there any specific difference between a white man and a black man; not even if one term
					is assigned to each. For we are now regarding "man" as matter, and matter does not produce
					difference; and for this reason, too, individual men are not species of "man," although
					the flesh and bones of which this and that man consist are different. The concrete whole
					is "other," but not "other in species," because there is no contrariety in the formula,
					and this is the ultimate indivisible species. <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>But Callias is definition <emph>and</emph> matter. Then so too is "white man," because
					it is the individual, Callias, who is white. Hence "man" is only white accidentally.
					Again, a bronze circle and a wooden one do not differ in species; and a bronze triangle
					and a wooden circle differ in species not because of their matter, but because there is
					contrariety in their formulae. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>But does not matter, when it is "other" in a particular way, make
					things "other in species"? Probably there is a sense in which it does. Otherwise why is
					this particular horse "other in species" than this particular man, although the
					definitions involve matter? Surely it is because there is contrariety in the definition,
					for so there also is in "white man" and "black horse"; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"

					permanent things, but not with things which can exist separately. <milestone n="7.8" ed="P"

						unit="Loeb chap"/>Each of the mathematical sciences deals with some one class of things

					substances are the first of existing things, physics will be the first of the sciences;

					be no science of such a thing, because every science has as its object that which is so
					always or usually, and the accidental falls under neither of these descriptions. <milestone

					everything will be of necessity, and the element of chance, i.e. the possibility of a

					same; for everything will come to be of necessity. <milestone n="8.8" ed="P"

					the potential and the real, I call the actualization of the potential as such,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">What Aristotle means by this is explained more clearly
						in the following sections, which may be summarized thus. The material substrate, e.g.
						bricks, etc., which is potentially a house, may be regarded (a) as potential material;
						in this sense it is actualized as bricks before building begins; (b) as potentially a
						house; in this sense when it is actualized it is no longer buildable but built, i.e., it
						is no longer potential; (c) as potentially buildable into a house. In this sense its
						actualization is conterminous with the process of building, and is incomplete (sect.11),
						and should not be described as <foreign lang="greek">E)NTELE/XEIA</foreign> or "complete
						reality." But Aristotle often uses this term as synonymous with the vaguer <foreign
							lang="greek">E)NE/RGEIA</foreign>.</note> motion. <milestone n="9.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>That this is a true statement will be clear from what follows. When
					the "buildable" in the sense in which we call it such exists actually, it is being built;
					and this is the process of building. The same is true of the processes of learning,
					healing, walking, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>jumping, ageing, maturing.
					Motion results when the complete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor
						later. <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The complete reality, then, of that
					which exists potentially, when it is completely real and actual, not <hi rend="Italic"
						>qua</hi> itself but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable, is motion. By <hi rend="Italic"
						>qua</hi> I mean this. The bronze is potentially a statue; but nevertheless the complete
					reality of the bronze <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> bronze is not motion. To be bronze is not
					the same as to be a particular potentiality; since if it were absolutely the same by
					definition the complete reality of the bronze would be a kind of motion; but it is not the
						same. <milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(This is obvious in the case of
					contraries; for the potentiality for health and the potentiality for illness are not the
					same—for if they were, health and illness would be the same too—but the
					substrate which becomes healthy or ill, whether it is moisture or blood, is one and the
					same.) And since it is not the same, just as "color" and "visible" are not the same, it is
					the complete reality of the potential <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> potential that is
						motion. <milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is evident that it is this, and
					that motion results when the complete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor later.
						<milestone n="1066a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For
					everything may sometimes be actual, and sometimes not; e.g. the "buildable" <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> "buildable"; and the actualization of the "buildable" <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> "buildable" is the act of building. <milestone n="9.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For the actualization is either this—the act of
					building—or a house. But when the house exists, it will no longer be buildable; the
					buildable is that which is <emph>being</emph> built. Hence the actualization must be the
					act of building, and the act of building is a kind of motion. The same argument applies to
					the other kinds of motion. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.8" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>That this account is correct is clear from what the other authorities
					say about motion, and from the fact that it is not easy to define it otherwise. For one

					this class is that it is considered to be indeterminate, and the principles in one of the
					columns of contraries are indeterminate, being privative; for none of them is a
					determinate thing or quality or any of the other categories. <milestone n="9.10" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason for considering motion to be indeterminate is that it
					cannot be associated either with the potentiality or with the actuality of things; for
					neither that which is potentially <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>nor that which
					is actually of a certain size is necessarily moved. <milestone n="9.11" ed="P"

							<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 9.1048b">Aristot. Met. 9.6.7-10</bibl>.</note>; the reason of
					this is that the potential, of which it is the actualization, is incomplete. <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus it is difficult to comprehend what motion is; for we must
					associate it either with privation or with potentiality or with absolute actuality; and
					apparently none of these is possible. <milestone n="9.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There
					remains, then, the account which we have given; that it is an actuality, and an actuality
					of the kind which we have described, which is hard to visualize but capable of
						existing. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That motion is in the movable is evident; for it
					is the complete realization of the movable by that which is capable of causing motion, and
					the actualization of that which is capable of causing motion is identical with that of the
						movable. <milestone n="9.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it must be a complete
					realization of them both; since a thing is capable of moving because it has the
					potentiality, but it moves only when it is active; but it is upon the movable that it is
					capable of acting. Thus the actuality of both alike is one; just as there is the same
					interval from one to two as from two to one, and the hill up and the hill down are one,

						perceptible and individual. Flesh (in general) represents the matter in an intermediate
						stage.</note>(for everything which is characterized by contact and so not by coalescence
					is matter and substrate; e.g. fire, flesh and head; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"

					strictest sense); (2.) the "nature"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.,
						form.</note>(existing individually)—i.e. a kind of positive state which is the
					terminus of motion; and (3.) the particular combination of these, e.g. Socrates or
					Callias. In some cases the individuality does not exist apart from the composite substance
					(e.g., the form of a house does not exist separately, except as the art of
						building; <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>nor are these forms liable to
					generation and destruction; there is a distinct sense in which "house" and "health" and
					every artificial product, considered in the abstract, do or do not exist<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., in the mind of the architect or doctor.</note>);
					if it does so at all, it does so in the case of natural objects. Hence Plato was not far
					wrong in saying<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See Introduction.</note> that there
					are as many Forms as there are kinds of natural objects; that is if there are Forms
					distinct from the things of our world. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.5"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moving causes are causes in the sense of pre-existent things,
					but formal causes coexist with their effects. For it is when the man becomes healthy that
					health exists, and the shape of the bronze sphere comes into being simultaneously with the
					bronze sphere. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Whether any form remains also
					afterwards is another question. In some cases there is nothing to prevent this, e.g. the
					soul may be of this nature (not all of it, but the intelligent part; for presumably all of
					it cannot be). Clearly then there is no need on these grounds for the Ideas to exist; for
					man begets man, the individual begetting the particular person. And the same is true of
					the arts, for the art of medicine is the formula of health. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In one sense the causes and principles
					are different for different things; but in another, if one speaks generally and
					analogically, they are the same for all. For the question might be raised whether the
					principles and elements of substances and of relations are the same or different; and
					similarly with respect to each of the other categories. But it is absurd that they should
					be the same for all; for then relations and substance would have the same constituents.
						<milestone n="1070b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
						/><milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What then can their common constituent
					be? For there is nothing common to and yet distinct from substance and the other
					predicable categories, yet the element is prior to that of which it is an element.
					Moreover substance is not an element of relations, nor is any of the latter an element of
					substance. Further, how can all the categories have the same elements? <milestone n="4.3"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For no element can be the same as that which is composed of
					elements; e.g., neither B nor A can be the same as BA (nor indeed can any of the
						"intelligibles,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Unity and Being are called
						intelligibles as being the most universal predicates and as contrasted with particulars,
						which are sensible.</note> e.g. Unity or Being, be an element; for these apply in every
					case, even to composite things); hence no element can be either substance or relation. But
					it must be one or the other. Therefore the categories have not all the same
						elements. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					truth is that, as we say, in one sense all things have the same elements and in another
					they have not. E.g., the elements of sensible bodies are, let us say, (1) as form, the
					hot, and in another sense the cold, which is the corresponding privation; as matter, that
					which directly and of its own nature is potentially hot or cold. And not only these are
					substances, but so are (2) the compounds<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This
						apparently refers to the elements; fire and air are hot matter, water and earth cold
						matter.</note> of which they are principles, and (3) any unity which is generated from
					hot and cold, e.g. flesh or bone; for the product of hot and cold must be distinct from
						them. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These things, then, have the same
					elements and principles, although specifically different things have specifically
					different elements; we cannot, however, say that all things have the same elements in this
					sense, but only by analogy: i.e., one might say that there are three principles, form,
					privation and matter. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But each of these is
					different in respect of each class of things, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>e.g., in the case of color they are white, black, surface; or again there is light,
					darkness and air, of which day and night are composed. And since not only things which are
					inherent in an object are its causes, but also certain external things, e.g. the moving
					cause, clearly "principle" and "element" are not the same; but both are causes. Principles
					are divided into these two kinds, and that which moves a thing or brings it to rest is a
					kind of principle and substance. <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus
					analogically there are three elements and four causes or principles; but they are
					different in different cases, and the proximate moving cause is different in different
					cases. Health, disease, body; and the moving cause is the art of medicine. Form, a
					particular kind of disorder, bricks; and the moving cause is the art of
						building. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since in the sphere of natural
					objects the moving cause of man is man, while in the sphere of objects of thought the
					moving cause is the form or its contrary, in one sense there are three causes and in
					another four. For in a sense the art of medicine is health, and the art of building is the
					form of a house, and man begets man; but besides these there is that which as first of all
					things moves all things.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For the first time the
						ultimate efficient cause is distinguished from the proximate. Aristotle is leading up to
						the description of the Prime Mover which occupies the latter half of the
						book.</note> <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>					Now since some things can exist in separation and others cannot, it is the former that are
					substances. <milestone n="1071a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>And therefore all things have the same causes, because without substance there can be no
					affections and motions. Next we shall see<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See
						Introduction.</note> that these causes are probably soul and body, or mind, appetite and
						body.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is thinking of animals and human
						beings, which are substances in the truest sense.</note> Again, there is another sense
					in which by analogy the principles are the same viz. actuality and potentiality; but these
					are different for different things, and apply to them in different ways. <milestone n="5.2"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in some cases the same thing exists now actually and now
					potentially; e.g. wine or flesh or man (actuality and potentiality also fall under the
					causes as already described; for the form exists actually if it is separable, and so does
					the compound of form and matter, and the privation, e.g. darkness or disease; and the
					matter exists potentially, for it is this which has the potentiality of becoming both<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., of acquiring either of the contrary qualities
						distinguished by the form and the privation</note>; <milestone n="5.3" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>but the distinction in virtue of actuality and potentiality applies in
					a different sense to cases where the matter of cause and effect is not the same, in some
					of which the form is not the same but different. E.g., the cause of a man is (i) his
					elements: fire and earth as matter, and the particular form; (2) some external formal
					cause, viz. his father; and besides these (3) the sun and the ecliptic,<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The sun, moving in the ecliptic, approaches nearer to
						the earth in summer, causing generation, and recedes farther from the earth in winter,
						causing destruction. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1072a">Aristot. Met. 12.6.10

					with him, but cause motion. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, we must observe that
					some causes can be stated universally, but others cannot. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The proximate principles of all things are the proximate actual
					individual and another individual which exists potentially.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">i.e., the proximate efficient cause and proximate
						matter.</note> <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore the proximate

					person as "man," whereas Peleus is the principle of Achilles and your father of you, and
					this particular B of this particular BA; but B in general is the principle of BA regarded

							><bibl n="Aristot.       Met. 12.1070b">Aristot. Met. 12.4.6</bibl>.</note> different
					things, i.e. things which are not in the same genus, as colors, sounds, substances and

						ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for the question
					what are the principles or elements of substances and relations and qualities, whether

					meanings are distinguished, they are not the same but different; except that in a certain
					sense they are the same for all. In a certain sense they are the same or analogous,

					Substances are the primary reality, and if they are all perishable, everything is
					perishable. But motion cannot be either generated or destroyed, for it always existed<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 8.1">Aristot. Physics

					too is motion; for time is either identical with motion or an affection of it.<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 11.1068a">Aristot. Met.

					primary locomotion, then in so far as "the heaven" is moved, in this respect at least it
					is possible for it to be otherwise; i.e. in respect of place, even if not of

					they are really Ideas or not, or whether they are principles and substances of existing
					things or not—and merely inquire whether as mathematical objects they exist or not,
					and if they do, in what sense; then after this we must separately consider the Ideas
					themselves, simply and in so far as the accepted procedure requires; for most of the

						n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And further, the greater part of our discussion must
					bear directly upon this second question—viz. when we are considering whether the

					have dealt with the Ideas there remains this third question. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if the objects of mathematics exist,
					they must be either in sensible things, as some hold; or separate from them (there are
					some also who hold this view); or if they are neither the one nor the other, either they
					do not exist at all, or they exist in some other way. Thus the point which we shall have
					to discuss is concerned not with their existence, but with the mode of their
						existence. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>					That the objects of mathematics cannot be in sensible things, and that moreover the theory
					that they are is a fabrication, has been observed already in our discussion of

							>Aristot. Met. 3.2.23-30</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="1076b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>—the
					reasons being (a) that two solids cannot occupy the same space, and (b) that on this same
					theory all other potentialities and characteristics would exist in sensible things, and
					none of them would exist separately. This, then, has been already stated; <milestone
						n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in addition to this it is clearly impossible on
					this theory for any body to be divided. For it must be divided in a plane, and the plane
					in a line, and the line at a point; and therefore if the point is indivisible, so is the
					line, and so on. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For what difference does it
					make whether entities of this kind are sensible objects, or while not being the objects
					themselves, are yet present in them? the consequence will be the same, for either they
					must be divided when the sensible objects are divided, or else not even the sensible
					objects can be divided. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again can entities of this kind
					exist separately. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if besides sensible
					solids there are to be other solids which are separate from them and prior to sensible
					solids, clearly besides sensible planes there must be other separate planes, and so too
					with points and lines; for the same argument applies. And if these exist, again besides
					the planes, lines and points of the mathematical solid, there must be others which are
						separate; <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the incomposite is prior to the
					composite, and if prior to sensible bodies there are other non-sensible bodies, <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>then by the same argument the planes which exist
					independently must be prior to those which are present in the immovable solids. Therefore
					there will be planes and lines distinct from those which coexist with the
					separately-existent solids; for the latter coexist with the mathematical solids, but the
					former are prior to the mathematical solids. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Again, in these planes there will be lines, and by the same argument there must be other
					lines prior to these; and prior to the points which are in the prior lines there must be
					other points, although there will be no other points prior to these. <milestone n="2.7"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now the accumulation becomes absurd; because whereas we get
					only one class of solids besides sensible solids, we get three classes of planes besides
					sensible planes—those which exist separately from sensible planes, those which exist
					in the mathematical solids, and those which exist separately from those in the
					mathematical solids—four classes of lines, and five of points; <milestone n="2.8"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>with which of these, then, will the mathematical sciences deal?
					Not, surely, with the planes, lines and points in the immovable solid; for knowledge is
					always concerned with that which is prior. And the same argument applies to numbers; for
					there will be other units besides each class of points, and besides each class of existing
					things, first the sensible and then the intelligible; so that there will be an infinite
					number of kinds of mathematical numbers. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.9"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, there are the problems which we enumerated in our
					discussion of difficulties<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl
							n="Aristot. Met. 3.997b">Aristot. Met. 3.2.23-27</bibl>.</note>: how can they be
					solved? <milestone n="1077a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For
					the objects of astronomy will similarly be distinct from sensible things, and so will
					those of geometry; but how can a heaven and its parts (or anything else which has motion)
					exist apart from the sensible heaven? And similarly the objects of optics and of harmonics
					will be distinct, for there will be sound and sight apart from the sensible and particular
						objects. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence clearly the other senses and
					objects of sense will exist separately; for why should one class of objects do so rather
					than another? And if this is so, animals too will exist separately, inasmuch as the senses
						will. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, there are certain general mathematical
					theorems which are not restricted to these substances. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Here, then, we shall have yet another kind of substance intermediate
					between and distinct from the Ideas and the intermediates, which is neither number nor
					points nor spatial magnitude nor time. And if this is impossible, clearly it is also
					impossible that the aforesaid substances should exist separately from sensible
						objects. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In
					general, consequences result which are contrary both to the truth and to received opinion
					if we thus posit the objects of mathematics as definite separately-existent entities. For
					if they exist in this way, they must be prior to sensible spatial magnitudes, whereas in
					truth they must be posterior to them; for the incomplete spatial magnitude is in point of
					generation prior, but in point of substantiality posterior, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker"
						unit="line"/>as the inanimate is to the animate. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"
						/><milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, in virtue of what can we possibly
					regard mathematical magnitudes as one? Things in this world of ours may be reasonably
					supposed to be one in virtue of soul or part of the soul, or some other influence; apart
					from this they are a plurality and are disintegrated. But inasmuch as the former are
					divisible and quantitative, what is the cause of their unity and cohesion? <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, the ways in which the objects of mathematics are generated
					prove our point; <milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for they are generated first
					in the dimension of length, then in that of breadth, and finally in that of depth,
					whereupon the process is complete. Thus if that which is posterior in generation<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., in the natural order of development. Thus
						"generation" (<foreign lang="greek">GE/NESIS</foreign>) is used in two different senses
						in this argument, which therefore becomes invalid (Bonitz).</note> is prior in
					substantiality, body will be prior to plane and line, and in this sense it will also be
					more truly complete and whole, because it can become animate; whereas how could a line or
					plane be animate? The supposition is beyond our powers of apprehension. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, body is a kind of
					substance, since it already in some sense possesses completeness; but in what sense are
					lines substances? Neither as being a kind of form or shape, as perhaps the soul is, nor as
					being matter, like the body; for it does not appear that anything can be composed either
					of lines or of planes or of points, <milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>whereas if
					they were a kind of material substance it would be apparent that things can be so
					composed. <milestone n="1077b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"
					/>Let it be granted that they are prior in formula; yet not everything which is prior in
					formula is also prior in substantiality. Things are prior in substantiality which when
					separated have a superior power of existence; things are prior in formula from whose
					formulae the formulae of other things are compounded. And these characteristics are not
						indissociable. <milestone n="2.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if attributes, such as
					"moving" or "white," do not exist apart from their substances, "white" will be prior in
					formula to "white man," but not in substantiality; for it cannot exist in separation, but
					always exists conjointly with the concrete whole—by which I mean "white
						man." <milestone n="2.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus it is obvious that neither is the
					result of abstraction prior, nor the result of adding a determinant posterior—for
					the expression "white man" is the result of adding a determinant to "white." <milestone
						ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus we have sufficiently shown (a) that the objects of mathematics
					are not more substantial than corporeal objects; (b) that they are not prior in point of
					existence to sensible things, but only in formula; and (c) that they cannot in any way
					exist in separation. <milestone n="2.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we have
						seen<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sect. 1-3 above.</note> that they cannot
					exist in sensible things, it is clear that either they do not exist at all, or they exist
					only in a certain way, and therefore not absolutely; for "exist" has several
						senses. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					general propositions in mathematics are not concerned with objects which exist separately
					apart from magnitudes and numbers; they are concerned with magnitudes and
						numbers, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not with them as possessing
					magnitude or being divisible. It is clearly possible that in the same way propositions and
					logical proofs may apply to sensible magnitudes; not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> sensible,
					but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> having certain characteristics. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>For just as there can be many propositions about things merely <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable, without any reference to the essential nature of each
					one or to their attributes, and it does not necessarily follow from this either that there
					is something movable which exists in separation from sensible things or that there is a
					distinct movable nature in sensible things; so too there will be propositions and sciences
					which apply to movable things, not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable but <hi
						rend="Italic">qua</hi> corporeal only; and again <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> planes only
					and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> lines only, and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> divisible, and
						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> indivisible but having position, and <hi rend="Italic"
						>qua</hi> indivisible only. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore since
					it is true to say in a general sense not only that things which are separable but that
					things which are inseparable exist, e.g., that movable things exist, it is also true to
					say in a general sense that mathematical objects exist, and in such a form as
					mathematicians describe them. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And just as it is
					true to say generally of the other sciences that they deal with a particular
					subject—not with that which is accidental to it (e.g. not with "white" if "the
					healthy" is white, and the subject of the science is "the healthy"), but with that which
					is the subject of the particular science; <milestone n="1078a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with the healthy if it treats of things <hi rend="Italic"
						>qua</hi> healthy, and with man if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> man—so this is also
					true of geometry. If the things of which it treats are accidentally sensible although it
					does not treat of them <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> sensible, it does not follow that the
					mathematical sciences treat of sensible things—nor, on the other hand, that they
					treat of other things which exist independently apart from these. <milestone ed="P"
						unit="para"/><milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Many attributes are essential
					properties of things as possessing a particular characteristic; e.g., there are attributes
					peculiar to an animal <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> female or <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					male, although there is no such thing as female or male in separation from animals. Hence
					there are also attributes which are peculiar to things merely <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					lines or planes. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in proportion as the
					things which we are considering are prior in formula and simpler, they admit of greater
					exactness; for simplicity implies exactness. Hence we find greater exactness where there
					is no magnitude, and the greatest exactness where there is no motion; or if motion is
					involved, where it is primary, because this is the simplest kind; and the simplest kind of
					primary motion is uniform motion.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl

					man, <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> man, is one indivisible thing; and the arithmetician

						<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> man nor <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> indivisible, but <hi

					are in error who assert that the mathematical sciences tell us nothing about beauty or

					result was very nearly the same as if a man who wishes to count a number of things were to
					suppose that he could not do so when they are few, and yet were to try to count them when
					he has added to them. For it is hardly an exaggeration to say that there are more Forms
					than there are particular sensible things <milestone n="1079a" unit="section"/><milestone
						n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(in seeking for whose causes these thinkers were led on
					from particulars to Ideas); because corresponding to each thing there is a synonymous
					entity, apart from the substances (and in the case of non-substantial things there is a
					One over the Many) both in our everyday world and in the realm of eternal
						entities. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>					Again, not one of the ways in which it is attempted to prove that the Forms exist
					demonstrates their point; from some of them no necessary conclusion follows, and from
					others it follows that there are Form of things of which they hold that there are no
						Forms. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For according to the arguments from
					the sciences, there will be Forms of all things of which there are sciences; and according
					to the "One-over-Many" argument, of negations too; and according to the argument that "we
					have some conception of what has perished" there will be Forms of perishable things,
					because we have a mental picture of these things. Further, of the most exact arguments
					some establish Ideas of relations, of which the Idealists deny that there is a separate
					genus, and others state the "Third Man." <milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in
					general the arguments for the Forms do away with things which are more important to the
					exponents of the Forms than the existence of the Ideas; for they imply that it is not the
					Dyad that is primary, but Number; and that the relative is prior to number, and therefore
					to the absolute; and all the other conclusions in respect of which certain persons by
					following up the views held about the Forms have gone against the principles of the
						theory. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>					Again, according to the assumption by which they hold that the Ideas exist, <milestone
						n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there will be Forms not only of substances but of many
					other things (since the concept is one not only in the case of substances but in the case
					of non-substantial things as well; and there can be sciences not only of substances but
					also of other things; and there are a thousand other similar consequences); <milestone
						n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but it follows necessarily from the views generally
					held about them that if the Forms are participated in, there can only be Ideas of
					substances, because they are not participated in accidentally; things can only participate
					in a Form in so far as it is not predicated of a subject. <milestone n="4.12" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean, e.g., that if a thing participates in absolute doubleness, it
					participates also in something eternal, but only accidentally; because it is an accident
					of "doubleness" to be eternal. Thus the Ideas will be substance. But the same terms denote
					substance in the sensible as in the Ideal world; otherwise what meaning will there be in
					saying that something exists besides the particulars, i.e. the unity comprising their
						multiplicity? <milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If the form of the Ideas and
					of the things which participate in them is the same, they will have something in common
					(for why should duality mean one and the same thing in the case of perishable 2's and the
					2's which are many but eternal, <milestone n="1079b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1"
						ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and not in the case of absolute duality and a particular 2?).
					But if the form is not the same, they will simply be homonyms; just as though one were to
					call both Callias and a piece of wood "man," without remarking any property common to

					being imitated from something else; thus a man may become like Socrates whether Socrates
					exists or not, <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and even if Socrates were
					eternal, clearly the case would be the same. Also there will be several "patterns" (and

					"man," and so too will the Idea of man. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Further, the Forms will be patterns not only of sensible things but of Ideas; e.g. the
					genus will be the pattern of its species; hence the same thing will be pattern and copy.
					Further, it would seem impossible for the substance and that of which it is the substance
					to exist in separation; <milestone n="1080a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"

					there is something to impart motion; and many other things are generated (e.g. house and
					ring) of which the Idealists say that there are no Forms. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P"

					/>Now that we have dealt with the problems concerning the Ideas, we had better
					re-investigate the problems connected with numbers that follow from the theory that

						no alternative statement of the nature of number in general, such as we should expect

					units, as is held of mathematical number; for in mathematical number no one unit differs
					in any way from another. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or (c) some units must
					be addible and others not. E.g., 2 is first after 1, and then 3, and so on with the other
					numbers; and the units in each number are addible, e.g. the units in the first<note

					numbers. Hence whereas mathematical number is counted thus: after 1, 2 (which consists of
					another 1 added to the former) and 3 (which consists of another 1 added to these two) and
					the other numbers in the same way, Ideal number is counted like this: after 1, a distinct
					2 not including the original 1; and a 3 not including the 2, and the rest of the numbers
						similarly. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or (d) one kind of number must be
					such as we first described, and another or such as the mathematicians maintain, and that
					which we have last described must be a third kind. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again,
					these numbers must exist either in separation from things, <milestone n="1080b"

					e.g. one of Humanity and another one of Animality; but the numbers which are similar and
					do not differ in kind are infinitely many, so that this is no more the Idea of Man than
					any other 3 is. But if the Ideas are not numbers, they cannot exist at all; <milestone
						n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for from what principles can the Ideas be derived?

						unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same argument applies to the units, because the units in the
					original 2 produce the four units in 4; and so all the units become Ideas, and an Idea
					will be composed of Ideas. Hence clearly those things also of which these things are Ideas
					will be composite; <milestone n="1082b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker"

					absurd and fictitious (by "fictitious" I mean "dragged in to support a hypothesis"). For
					we can see that one unit differs from another neither in quantity nor in quality; and a
					number must be either equal or unequal—this applies to all numbers, but especially
					to numbers consisting of abstract units. <milestone n="7.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus
					if a number is neither more nor less, it is equal; and things which are equal and entirely

					It rather seems that it must be prior, because one of the units is contemporaneous with 3,

						2, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is strange; and if it is greater, then

					number does, in quantity." But if units also differed in quantity, number would differ
					from number, although equal in number of units. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"
					/>Again, are the first units greater or smaller, and do the later units increase in size,

					If on the other hand each of the units comes from both Great and Small, when they are

						separable, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>how are we to regard their elements
					and principles? <milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If they are particular and not
					universal, there will be as many real things as there are elements, and the elements will
					not be knowable. For let us suppose that the syllables in speech are substances, and that
					their letters are the elements of substances. Then there must be only one BA, and only one
					of each of the other syllables; that is, if they are not universal and identical in form,
					but each is numerically one and an individual, and not a member of a class bearing a
					common name. <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Moreover, the Platonists assume
					that each Ideal entity is unique.) Now if this is true of the syllables, it is also true
					of their letters. Hence there will not be more than one A, nor more than one of any of the
					other letters,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is, as a matter of fact, the
						assumption upon which the whole argument rests; Aristotle is arguing in a circle.</note>
					on the same argument by which in the case of the syllable there cannot be more than one

					the letters, but only the letters. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.4"
						ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor again will the elements be knowable; for they will not be
					universal, and knowledge is of the universal. This can be seen by reference to proofs and
					definitions; for there is no logical conclusion that a given triangle has its angles equal
					to two right angles unless every triangle has its angles equal to two right angles, or
					that a given man is an animal unless every man is an animal. <milestone n="1087a"

						/><milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand, if the first
					principles are universal, either the substances composed of them will be universal too, or
					there will be a non-substance prior to substance; because the universal is not substance,
					and the element or first principle is universal; and the element or first principle is
					prior to that of which it is an element or first principle. <milestone n="10.6" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>All this naturally follows when they compose the Ideas of elements and
					assert that besides the substances which have the same form there are also Ideas each of
					which is a separate entity. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But if, as in the case of the
					phonetic elements, there is no reason why there should not be many A's and B's, and no "A
					itself" or "B itself" apart from these many, then on this basis there may be any number of
					similar syllables. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.7" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>The doctrine that all knowledge is of the universal, and hence that
					the principles of existing things must also be universal and not separate substances,
					presents the greatest difficulty of all that we have discussed; there is, however, a sense
					in which this statement is true, although there is another in which it is not
						true. <milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Knowledge, like the verb "to know,"
					has two senses, of which one is potential and the other actual. The potentiality being, as
					matter, universal and indefinite, has a universal and indefinite object; but the actuality
					is definite and has a definite object, because it is particular and deals with the
						particular. <milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is only accidentally that
					sight sees universal color, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the
					particular color which it sees is color; and the particular A which the grammarian studies
					is an A. For if the first principles must be universal, that which is derived from them
					must also be universal, as in the case of logical proofs<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">"Because <foreign lang="greek">A)PO/DEICIS</foreign>" (logical or

					it; e.g., in the scale there is the quarter-tone; in spatial magnitude the inch or foot or
					some similar thing; and in rhythms the foot or syllable. Similarly in the case of gravity
					there is some definite weight. Unity is predicated of all things in the same way;
						<milestone n="1088a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of
					qualities as a quality, and of quantities as a quantity. <milestone n="1.11" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>(The measure is indivisible, in the former case in kind, and in the
					latter to our senses.) This shows that unity is not any independent substance. And this is
					reasonable; because unity denotes a measure of some plurality, and number denotes a
					measured plurality and a plurality of measures. (Hence too it stands to reason that unity
					is not a number; for the measure is not measures, but the measure and unity are
						starting-points.) <milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The measure must always be
					something which applies to all alike; e.g., if the things are horses, the measure is a
					horse; if they are men, the measure is a man; and if they are man, horse and god, the
					measure will presumably be an animate being, and the number of them animate
						beings. <milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If the things are "man," "white" and
					"walking," there will scarcely be a number of them, because they all belong to a subject
					which is one and the same in number; however, their number will be a number of genera, or
					some other such appellation. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.14" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Those<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. sect. 5.</note> who
					regard the unequal as a unity, and the dyad as an indeterminate compound of great and
					small, hold theories which are very far from being probable or possible. For these terms
					represent affections and attributes, rather than substrates, of numbers and
					magnitudes—"many" and "few" applying to number, and "great" and "small" to
						magnitude— <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>just as odd and even, smooth
					and rough, straight and crooked, are attributes. <milestone n="1.15" ed="P"
						unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, in addition to this error, "great" and "small" and all other
					such terms must be relative. And the relative is of all the categories in the least degree
					a definite entity or substance; it is posterior to quality and quantity. The relative is
					an affection of quantity, as we have said, and not its matter; since there is something
					else distinct which is the matter both of the relative in general and of its parts and
						kinds. <milestone n="1.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is nothing great or small, many

					separately and together, of number; and "long" and "short" are predicated of the line, and
					the Plane is both broad and narrow. <milestone n="1.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then,
					there is a plurality of which one term, viz. "few," is always predicable, e.g. 2 (for if 2

					abandoned the theory (viz. those who agree that unity is a first principle and element,

					Hence one thinker<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Speusippus.</note> avoided

						n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the ratios of mixtures are expressed by the
					relation of numbers, and not simply by numbers; e.g., it is 3 : 2, not 3 X 2<note
						resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. previous note.</note>; for in products of
					multiplication the units must belong to the same genus. Thus the product of 1 x 2 x 3 must
					be measurable by 1, and the product of 4 X 5 x 7 by 4. Therefore all products which
					contain the same factor must be measurable by that factor. Hence the number of fire cannot
					be 2 X 5 X 3 X 7 if the number of water is 2 x 3.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"

					because of number that the object exists? Or is this not conclusive? E.g., there is a
					certain number of the sun's motions, and again of the moon's,<note resp="Tredennick"

					life and maturity of every animate thing. What reason, then, is there why some of these
					numbers should not be squares and others cubes, some equal and others double? <milestone
						n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is no reason; all things must fall within this
					range of numbers if, as was assumed, all things share in number, and different things may
					fall under the same number. Hence if certain things happened to have the same number, on

					same form of number; e.g., sun and moon would be the same.<note resp="Tredennick"
						anchored="yes">Cf. previous note.</note> <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					why are these numbers causes? There are seven vowels,<note resp="Tredennick"

					<milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is a sense, however, in which these
