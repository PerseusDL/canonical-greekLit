<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone n="1094a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>Every art and every investigation, and likewise every practical pursuit or undertaking, seems to aim at some good: hence it has been well said that the Good is That at which all things aim. </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="2"> 
<p>(It is true that a certain variety is to be observed among the ends at which the arts and sciences aim: in some cases the activity of practising the art is itself the end,<note resp="Rackham">Aristotle gives flute-playing as an instance of an art the practice of which is an end in itself, in contrast with the art of building, the end of which is the house built <bibl n="Aristot. MM 1211b.27">Aristot. Gtr. Mor. 1211b 27 ff.</bibl></note> whereas in others the end is some product over and above the mere exercise of the art; and in the arts whose ends are certain things beside the practice of the arts themselves, these products are essentially superior in value to the activities.)</p></div>  
 <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="3"> 
<p>But as there are numerous pursuits and arts and sciences, it follows that their ends are correspondingly numerous: for instance, the end of the science of medicine is health, that of the art of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of domestic economy wealth.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="4"> 
<p>Now in cases where several such pursuits are subordinate to some single faculty—as bridle-making and the other trades concerned with horses’ harness are subordinate to horsemanship, and this and every other military pursuit to the science of strategy, and similarly other arts to different arts again—in all these cases, I say, the ends of the master arts are things more to be desired than the ends of the arts subordinate to them; since the latter ends are only pursued for the sake of the former.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="5"> 
<p>(And it makes no difference whether the ends of the pursuits are the activities themselves or some other thing beside these, as in the case of the sciences mentioned.)</p></div></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1" n="2"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If therefore among the ends at which our actions aim there be one which we will for its own sake, while we will the others only for the sake of this, and if we do not 
<milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> choose everything for the sake of something else (which would obviously result in a process <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad infinitum</foreign>, so that all desire would be futile and vain), it is clear that this one ultimate End must be the Good, and indeed the Supreme Good.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="2"> 
<p>Will not then a knowledge of this Supreme Good be also of great practical importance for the conduct of life? Will it not better enable us to attain our proper object, like archers having a target to aim at?</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="3"> 
<p>If this be so, we ought to make an attempt to determine at all events in outline what exactly this Supreme Good is, and of which of the sciences or faculties it is the object.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now it would seem that this supreme End must be the object of the most authoritative of the sciences—some science which is pre-eminently a master-craft.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="5"> 
<p>But such is manifestly the science of Politics;</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="6"> 
<p>for it is this that ordains which of the sciences are to exist in states, <milestone n="1094b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>and what branches of knowledge the different classes of the citizens are to learn, and up to what point; and we observe that even the most highly esteemed of the faculties, such as strategy, domestic economy, oratory, are subordinate to the political science.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="7"> 
<p>Inasmuch then as the rest of the sciences are employed by this one, and as it moreover lays down laws as to what people shall do and what things they shall refrain from doing, the end of this science must include the ends of all the others. Therefore, the Good of man must be the end of the science of Politics.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="8"> 
<p>For even though it be the case that the Good is the same for the individual and for the state, nevertheless, the good of the state is manifestly a greater and more perfect good, both to attain and to preserve.<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <q rend="single">both to ascertain and to secure.</q></note> To secure the good of one person only is better than nothing; but to secure the good of a nation or a state is a nobler and more divine achievement.</p>
    <p rend="align(indent)">This then being its aim, our investigation is in a sense the study of Politics.</p></div></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now our treatment of this science will be adequate, if it achieves that amount of precision which belongs to its subject matter. The same exactness must not be expected in all departments of philosophy alike, any more than in all the products of the arts and crafts.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="2"> 
<p>The subjects studied by political science are Moral Nobility<note resp="Rackham"><foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> is a term of admiration applied to what is correct, especially (1) bodies well shaped and works of art or handicraft well made, and (2) actions well done (see 3.7.6); it thus means (1) beautiful, (2) morally right. For the analogy between material and moral correctness see 2.6.9.</note> and Justice; but these conceptions involve much difference of opinion and uncertainty, so that they are sometimes believed to be mere conventions and to have no real existence in the nature of things.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="3"> 
<p>And a similar uncertainty surrounds the conception of the Good, because it frequently occurs that good things have harmful consequences: people have before now been ruined by wealth, and in other cases courage has cost men their lives.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="4"> 
<p>We must therefore be content if, in dealing with subjects <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> and starting from premises thus uncertain, we succeed in presenting a broad outline of the truth: when our subjects and our premises are merely generalities, it is enough if we arrive at generally valid conclusions. Accordingly we may ask the student also to accept the various views we put forward in the same spirit; for it is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of exactness in each kind which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an orator.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="5"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Again, each man judges correctly those matters with which he is acquainted; it is of these that he is a competent critic. <milestone n="1095a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>To criticize a particular subject, therefore, a man must have been trained in that subject: to be a good critic generally, he must have had an all-round education. Hence the young are not fit to be students of Political Science.<note resp="Rackham">Quoted in <title>Troilus and Cressida</title>, II. ii. 165.: Young men, whom Aristotle thought/Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</note> For they have no experience of life and conduct, and it is these that supply the premises and subject matter of this branch of philosophy. </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="6"> 
<p>And moreover they are led by their feelings; so that they will study the subject to no purpose or advantage, since the end of this science is not knowledge but action. </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="7"> 
<p>And it makes no difference whether they are young in years or immature in character: the defect is not a question of time, it is because their life and its various aims are guided by feeling; for to such persons their knowledge is of no use, any more than it is to persons of defective self-restraint.<note resp="Rackham">The argument is, that even if the young could gain a knowledge of Ethics (which they cannot, because it requires experience of life), they would not use it as a guide to conduct, because they are led by their passions and appetites; and therefore the study is of no value for them, since Ethics, being a practical science, is only pursued for the sake of its practical application.</note> But Moral Science may be of great value to those who guide their desires and actions by principle.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.3" n="8"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Let so much suffice by way of introduction as to the student of the subject, the spirit in which our conclusions are to be received, and the object that we set before us.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">To resume, inasmuch as all studies and undertakings are directed to the attainment of some good, let us discuss what it is that we pronounce to be the aim of Politics, that is, what is the highest of all the goods that action can achieve.</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="2"> 
<p>As far as the name goes, we may almost say that the great majority of mankind are agreed about this; for both the multitude and persons of refinement speak of it as Happiness,<note resp="Rackham">This translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαιμονία</foreign> can hardly be avoided, but it would perhaps be more accurately rendered by <q rend="single">Well-being</q> or <q rend="single">Prosperity</q>; and it will be found that the writer does not interpret it as a state of feeling but as a kind of activity.</note> and conceive <q rend="single">the good life</q> or <q rend="single">doing well</q><note resp="Rackham">The English phrase preserves the ambiguity of the Greek, which in its ordinary acceptation rather means <q rend="single">faring well</q> than <q rend="single">acting well,</q> though in the sequel Aristotle diverts it to the active sense.</note> to be the same thing <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> as <q rend="single">being happy.</q> But what constitutes happiness is a matter of dispute; and the popular account of it is not the same as that given by the philosophers.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="3"> 
<p>Ordinary people identify it with some obvious and visible good, such as pleasure or wealth or honor—some say one thing and some another, indeed very often the same man says different things at different times: when he falls sick he thinks health is happiness, when he is poor, wealth. At other times, feeling conscious of their own ignorance, men admire those who propound something grand and above their heads; and it has been held by some thinkers<note resp="Rackham">Viz. Plato and the Academy; see chap. 6.</note> that beside the many good things we have mentioned, there exists another Good, that is good in itself, and stands to all those goods as the cause of their being good.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now perhaps it would be a somewhat fruitless task to review all the different opinions that are held. It will suffice to examine those that are most widely prevalent, or that seem to have some argument in their favour.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="5"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And we must not overlook the distinction between arguments that start from first principles and those that lead to first principles. It was a good practice of Plato to raise this question, and to enquire whether the true procedure is to start from or to lead up to one’s first principles, <milestone n="1095b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>as in a race-course one may run from the judges to the far end of the track or the reverse. Now no doubt it is proper to start from the known. But <q rend="single">the known</q> has two meanings—<q rend="single">what is known to us,</q> which is one thing, and <q rend="single">what is knowable in itself,</q> which is another. Perhaps then for us<note resp="Rackham">In contrast apparently with the school of Plato.</note> at all events it proper to start from what is known to us.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="6"> 
<p>This is why in order to be a competent student of the Right and Just, and in short of the topics of Politics in general, the pupil is bound to have been well-trained in his habits.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.4" n="7"> 
<p>For the starting-point or first principle is the fact that a thing is so; if this be satisfactorily ascertained, there will be no need also to know the reason why it is so. And the man of good moral training knows first principles already, or can easily acquire them. As for the person who neither knows nor can learn, let him hear the words of Hesiod<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hes. WD 293">Hes. WD 293 ff.</bibl> </note>: <quote rend="align(blockquote)"> <lg type="couplet"> <l>Best is the man who can himself advise;</l> <l>He too is good who hearkens to the wise;</l> <l>But who, himself being witless, will not heed</l> <l>Another’s wisdom, is a fool indeed.</l> </lg> </quote></p></div></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1" n="5"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.5" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But let us continue from the point<note resp="Rackham">a 30.</note> where we digressed. To judge from men’s lives, the more or less reasoned conceptions of the Good or Happiness that seem to prevail are the following. On the one hand the generality of men and the most vulgar identify the Good with pleasure,</p></div>  
    <div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.5" n="2"> 
<p>and accordingly are content with the Life of Enjoyment—for there are three specially prominent Lives,<note resp="Rackham">The doctrine of the three Lives goes back to Pythagoras, who compared the three kinds of men to the three classes of strangers who went to the Games, traders, competitors, and spectators (Iamblichus, <title>Vit. Pythag.</title> 58). This apologue brings out the metaphor underlying the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρητικὸς βίος</foreign>, lit. <q rend="single">the life of the spectator</q> (Burnet).</note> the one just mentioned, the Life of Politics, and thirdly, the Life of Contemplation.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.5" n="3"> 
<p>The generality of mankind then 
<milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> show themselves to be utterly slavish, by preferring what is only a life for cattle; but they get a hearing for their view as reasonable because many persons of high position share the feelings of Sardanapallus.<note resp="Rackham">The last two words of the Greek look like a verse passage loosely quoted. Sardanapallus was a mythical Assyrian king; two versions of his epitaph are recorded by Athenaeus (336, 530), one containing the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσθιε, πῖνε, παῖζε· ὡς τἆλλα τούτου οὐκ ἄξια τοῦ ἀποκροτήματος</foreign>, <q rend="single">Eat, drink, play, since all else is not worth that snap of the fingers</q>; the other ends <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖν’ ἔχω ὅσσ’ ἔφαγον καὶ ἐφύβρισα καὶ μετ’ ἔρωτος τέρπν’ ἔπαθον· τὰ δὲ καὶ ὄλβια πάντα λέλυνται</foreign>, <q rend="single">I have what I ate; and the delightful deeds of wantonness and love which I did and suffered; whereas all my wealth is vanished.</q></note></p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.5" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Men of refinement, on the other hand, and men of action think that the Good is honor—for this may be said to be the end of the Life of Politics. But honor after all seems too superficial to be the Good for which we are seeking; since it appears to depend on those who confer it more than on him upon whom it is conferred, whereas we instinctively feel that the Good must be something proper to its possessor and not easy to be taken away from him.</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:1.5" n="5"> 
<p>Moreover men’s motive in pursuing honor seems to be to assure themselves of their own merit; at least they seek to be honored by men of judgement and by people who know them, that is, they desire to be honored on the ground of virtue. It is clear therefore that in the opinion at all events of men of action, virtue is a greater good than honor;</p></div>

What definition of the Good then will hold true in all the arts? Perhaps we may define it as that for the sake of which everything else is done. This applies to something different in each different art—to health in the case of medicine, <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> to victory in that of strategy, to a house in architecture, and to something else in each of the other arts; but in every pursuit or undertaking it describes the end of that pursuit or undertaking, since in all of them it is for the sake of the end that everything else is done.

And the same holds good of our dispositions with regard to the appetites, and anger; some men become temperate and gentle, others profligate and irascible, <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> by actually comporting themselves in one way or the other in relation to those passions.

The related adjectives and verbs have various connotations connected with the various meanings of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> both in its wider and in its narrower usage. For instance, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δίκαια</foreign> means sometimes <q rend="single">just acts</q> in the English sense, sometimes any acts in conformity with the law, sometimes <q rend="single">rights</q> or <q rend="single">claims,</q> i.e., any consideration which by law, equity, or custom, certain persons have a right to expect from certain others. Or again <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικεῖν</foreign> means not only to act unjustly, or dishonestly, but also to do, or have done, any wrongful injury to another, or any wrongful or illegal act, and so, as a legal term, to be guilty of a breach of the law. In translating however, if the connection of all these various meanings in the writer’s mind is to be represented, it seems necessary to keep the words <q rend="single">justice,</q> <q rend="single">injustice,</q> etc., throughout, in spite of their occasional unsuitability to the context.</note> and Injustice, we have to enquire what sort of actions precisely they are concerned with, in what sense Justice is the observance of a mean, and what are the extremes between which that which is just is a mean. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The foregoing discussion has indicated the answer to the question, Is it possible or not for a man to commit injustice against himself? (1) One class of just actions consists of those acts, in accordance with any virtue, which are ordained by law.<note resp="Rackham">The argument seems to be, that suicide does not prove the possibility of a man’s committing <q rend="single">injustice,</q> in the wider sense of any illegal injury, against himself. Suicide is an act of injustice in this sense, since it is the voluntary infliction of bodily harm not in retaliation and therefore contrary to law; but it is an offense not against oneself but against the State, since it is punished as such.</note> For instance, the law does not sanction suicide (and what<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <q rend="single">and any form of homicide that it does not expressly permit.</q></note> it does not expressly sanction, it forbids). </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:5.11" n="2"> 
<p>Further, when a man voluntarily (which means with knowledge of the person affected and the instrument employed) does an injury (not in retaliation) that is against the law, he commits injustice.

<p>Therefore the suicide commits injustice; but against whom? It seems to be against the state rather than against himself; for he suffers voluntarily, and nobody suffers injustice voluntarily. This is why the state exacts a penalty; suicide is punished by certain marks of dishonor,<note resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> a suicide’s hand was buried apart from the body; <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.244">Aeschin. 3.244</bibl>.</note> as being an offense against the state. </p></div>

For (a) if it were, it would be possible for the same thing to have been taken away from and added to the same thing at the same time.

<p rend="align(indent)">But we must go a little deeper into the objection that Prudence does not render men more capable of performing noble and just actions. Let us start with the following consideration. As some people, we maintain, perform just acts and yet are not just men (for instance, those who do what the law enjoins but do it unwillingly, or in ignorance, or for some ulterior object, and not for the sake of the actions themselves, although they are as a matter of fact doing what they ought to do and all that a good man should), on the other hand it appears, there is a state of mind in which a man may do these various acts with the result that he really is a good man: I mean when he does them from choice, and for the sake 
<milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> of the acts themselves. </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:6.12" n="8"> 
<p>Now rightness in our choice of an end is secured by Virtue<note resp="Rackham">i.e., Moral Virtue.</note>; but to do the actions that must in the nature of things be done in order to attain the end we have chosen, is not a matter for Virtue but for a different faculty.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">We must dwell on this point to make it more clear. </p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:6.12" n="9"> 
<p>There is a certain faculty called Cleverness, which is the capacity for doing the things aforesaid that conduce to the aim we propose, and so attaining that aim.

<p>Now this faculty is not identical with Prudence, but Prudence implies it. But that eye of the soul of which we spoke<note resp="Rackham">See 11.6 and cf. 1.6.12.</note> cannot acquire the quality of Prudence without possessing Virtue. This we have said before, and it is manifestly true. For deductive inferences about matters of conduct always have a major premise of the form <q rend="single">Since the End or Supreme Good is so and so</q> (whatever it may be, since we may take it as anything we like for the sake of the argument); but the Supreme Good only appears good to the good man: vice perverts the mind and causes it to hold false views about the first principles of conduct.

<p><milestone n="1144b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>We have therefore also to reconsider the nature of Virtue. The fact is that the case of Virtue is closely analogous to that of Prudence in relation to Cleverness. Prudence and Cleverness are not the same, but they are similar; and natural virtue is related in the same way to Virtue in the true sense. All are agreed that the various moral qualities are in a sense bestowed by nature: we are just, and capable of temperance, and brave, and possessed of the other virtues from the moment of our birth. But nevertheless we expect to find that true goodness is something different, and that the virtues in the true sense come to belong to us in another way. For even children and wild animals possess the natural dispositions, yet without Intelligence these may manifestly be harmful. This at all events appears to be a matter of observation, that just as a man of powerful frame who has lost his sight meets with heavy falls when he moves about, because he cannot see, so it also happens in the moral sphere;</p></div>

Hence just as with the faculty of forming opinions<note resp="Rackham">See first note on 5.8.</note> there are two qualities, Cleverness and Prudence, so also in the moral part of the soul there are two qualities, natural virtue and true Virtue; and true Virtue cannot exist without Prudence. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The difficulties that may be raised are the following. (c) How can a man fail in self-restraint when believing correctly that what he does is wrong? Some people say that he cannot do so when he knows the act to be wrong; since, as Socrates held, it would be strange if, when a man possessed Knowledge, some other thing should overpower it, and <q rend="single">drag it about like a slave.</q><note resp="Rackham">A quotation from <bibl n="Plat.

<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:7.2" n="2"> 
<p>Now this theory is manifestly at variance with plain facts; and we ought to investigate the state of mind in question more closely. If failure of self-restraint is caused by ignorance, we must examine what sort of ignorance it is. For it is clear that the man who fails in self-restraint does not think the action right before he comes under the influence of passion.—</p></div>  
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:7.2" n="3"> 
<p>But some thinkers accept the doctrine in a modified form.

<p>for Prudence is extremely strong.

<p rend="align(indent)">Again (d) if Self-restraint implies having strong and evil desires, the temperate man cannot be self-restrained, nor the self-restrained man temperate; for the temperate man does not have excessive or evil desires. But a self-restrained man must necessarily have strong and evil desires; since if a man’s desires are good, the disposition that prevents him from obeying them will be evil, and so Self-restraint will not always be good; while if his desires are weak and not evil, there is nothing to be proud of in resisting them; nor is it anything remarkable if they are evil and weak. </p></div>

A second question is, can Self-restraint and Unrestraint be displayed in regard to everything, or not? When a man is said to be <q rend="single">unrestrained</q> without further qualification, it does not mean that he is so in relation to everything,  <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> but to those things in regard to which a man can be profligate; and also it does not mean merely that he is concerned with these things (for in that case Unrestraint would be the same thing as Profligacy), but that he is concerned with them in a particular manner. The profligate yields to his appetites from choice, considering it right always to pursue the pleasure that offers, whereas the man of defective self-restraint does not think so, but pursues it all the same. </p></div>

    <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone n="1147a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>(2) Again, reasoning on matters of conduct employs premises of two forms.<note resp="Rackham">The major premise of a practical syllogism is universal, a general rule; the minor is particular, the application of the rule to the case in hand. The next sentence points out that this application really requires two syllogisms; in the first, the personal term of the major premise is predicated in the minor of the particular person concerned (Dry food is good for all men: I am a man: therefore dry food is good for me) ; in the second, the other universal term is predicated in the minor of a particular thing about which the person is deliberating (Dry food is good for me: this stale loaf is dry food: therefore this stale loaf is good for me). It is the minor premise of the second syllogism, viz. the application of the general rule not to himself but to the thing in question, that the unrestrained man seems not to know, or not to think of, at the time. This illustration is confused in the text by the insertion of another minor premise <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ ὅτι ξηρὸν τὸ τοιόνδε</foreign>, <q rend="single">or that food of a certain kind [e.g. stale bread] is dry.</q> It would have been enough to write <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ’ εἰ τόδε ξηρόν</foreign>, <q rend="single">but whether this [stale loaf] is dry.</q></note> Now it is quite possible for a man to act against knowledge when he knows both premises but is only exercising his knowledge of the universal premise and not of the particular; for action has to do with particular things. Moreover, there is a distinction as regards the universal term: one universal is predicated of the man himself, the other of the thing; for example, he may know and be conscious of the knowledge that dry food is good for every man and that he himself is a man, or even that food of a certain kind is dry, but either not possess or not be actualizing the knowledge whether the particular food before him is food of that kind. Now clearly the distinction between these two ways of knowing will make all the difference in the world.

<p rend="align(indent)">(3) Again, it is possible for men to <q rend="single">have knowledge</q> in yet another way besides those just discussed; for even in the state of having knowledge without exercising it we can observe a distinction: a man may in a sense both have it and not have it; for instance, when he is asleep, or mad, or drunk. But persons under the influence of passion are in the same condition; for it is evident that anger, sexual desire, and certain other passions, actually alter the state of the body, and in some cases even cause madness.

Similarly anger, owing to the heat and swiftness of its nature, hears, but does not hear the order given, and rushes off to take vengeance.

It is therefore suggested that the term here means the propositions of mathematics, which are assumed as the starting-point of the analytical process by which a proof of a theorem or solution of a problem may be discovered: cf. 3.3.12.</note> of mathematics; hence no more in ethics than in mathematics are the first principles imparted by process of reasoning, but by virtue, whether natural or acquired by training in right opinion as to the first principle.

This is the unrestrained man: he is better than the profligate, and not absolutely bad, for in him the highest part of man, the fundamental principle, is still preserved.

<p rend="align(indent)">But the following considerations will show that these arguments are not conclusive to prove (1) that pleasure is not a good at all, nor (3) that it is not the Supreme Good.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">(1) (a) In the first place (i.) <q rend="single">the good</q> has two meanings: it means both that which is good absolutely, and that which is good for somebody, or relatively. Consequently the term <q rend="single">good</q> has the same double meaning when applied to men’s natures and dispositions; and therefore also when applied to movements and to processes. Also those processes which are thought to be bad will in some cases, though bad absolutely, be not bad relatively, but in fact desirable for a particular person, or in other cases, though not even desirable generally for the particular person, nevertheless desirable for him in particular circumstances and for a short time, although not really desirable. And some such processes<note resp="Rackham">Certain <q rend="single">felt processes towards a natural state</q> (9.4) , which are obviously not good, are not really pleasant either.</note> are not really pleasures at all, but only seem to be so: I mean the painful processes that are undergone for their curative effects, for instance, treatment applied to the sick. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Again (ii.) , the good is either an <emph>activity</emph> or a <emph>state</emph>. Now the pleasures that restore us to our natural <emph>state</emph> are only accidentally pleasant; while the <emph>activity</emph> of desire is the activity of that part of us which has remained in the natural state<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 14.7.</note>: for that matter, there are some pleasures which do not involve pain or desire at all <milestone n="1153a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for instance, the pleasure of contemplation), being experienced without any deficiency from the normal having occurred. That restorative pleasures are only accidentally pleasant is indicated by the fact that we do not enjoy the same things while the natural state is being replenished as we do after it has been restored to the normal; in the normal state we enjoy things that are absolutely pleasant, but during the process of replenishment we enjoy even their opposites; for instance, sour and bitter things, none of which are naturally or absolutely pleasant, so that the pleasures we get from them are not naturally or absolutely pleasant either, since there is the same distinction between various pleasures as there is between the pleasant things from which they arise. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Again (iii.) , it does not follow, as some argue, that as the end is better than the process towards it, so there must be something better than pleasure. For pleasures are not really processes, nor are they all incidental to a process: they are activities, and therefore an end; nor do they result from the process of acquiring our faculties, but from their exercise; nor have they all of them some end other than themselves: this is only true of the pleasures of progress towards the perfection of our nature. Hence it is not correct to define pleasure as a <q rend="single">conscious process</q> ; the term should rather be <q rend="single">activity of our natural state,</q> and for <q rend="single">conscious</q> we must substitute <q rend="single">unimpeded.</q> Some thinkers hold that pleasure is a process on the ground that it is good in the fullest sense, because in their view an activity is a process; but really an activity is different from a process. </p></div>

Speusippus attempted to refute this argument<note resp="Rackham">See more fully, 10.2.5.</note> by saying that, as the greater is opposed to the equal as well as to the less, so pleasure is opposed to a neutral state of feeling as well as to pain.

<p rend="align(indent)">(1) Now the first reason is that pleasure drives out pain; and excessive pain leads men to seek excessive pleasure, and bodily pleasure generally, as a restorative. And these restorative pleasures are intense, and therefore sought for, because they are seen in contrast with their opposite. (The view that pleasure is not a good at all is also due to these two facts, as has been said,<note resp="Rackham">The reference is presumably to 12.1, but the two passages do not correspond very closely.</note> (a) that some pleasures are actions indicative of an evil nature, whether it be depraved from birth, like the nature of an animal,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.6, second note.</note> or corrupted by habit, as is the case with evil men, and (b) that others are restoratives of a defective state,<note resp="Rackham">Or possibly <q rend="single">that the restorative pleasures imply a defective state.</q></note> and to be in the natural state is better than to be in process of returning to it. <milestone n="1154b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>But as a matter of fact the latter sort of pleasures accompany a process towards perfection, so that accidentally they are good.)</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">(2) Another reason is that bodily pleasures are sought for, just because of their intensity, by people who are incapable of enjoying others (for instance, some deliberately take steps to make themselves thirsty) : not that there is any objection to this if the pleasures are innocuous, but it is bad if they are productive of harmful results. The fact is that some men have no other sources of enjoyment; and also many are so constituted that a neutral state of feeling is to them positively painful. (This is because a state of strain is the normal condition of an animal organism, as physiology testifies; it tells us that sight and hearing are in fact painful, but we have got used to them in course of time—such is the theory.)</p></div>

<p>Similarly the young are in a condition resembling intoxication, because they are growing, and youth is pleasant in itself; but persons of an excitable nature need a restorative perpetually, because their temperament keeps their bodies in a constant state of irritation, and their appetites are continually active; and any pleasure, if strong, drives out pain, not only the opposite pleasure. This is why excitable men become profligate and vicious. </p></div>

Since if any man had a simple nature, the same activity would afford him the greatest pleasure always. Hence God enjoys a single simple pleasure perpetually.

<p rend="align(indent)">Perhaps the answer to these questions will appear if we ascertain what sort of things arouse liking or love. It seems that not everything is loved, but only what is lovable, and that this is either what is good, or pleasant, or useful.

<p>Then, do men like what is really good, or what is good for them? for sometimes the two may be at variance; and the same with what is pleasant. Now it appears that each person loves what is good for himself, and that while what is really good is lovable absolutely, what is good for a particular person is lovable for that person. Further, each person loves not what is really good for himself, but what appears to him to be so; however, this will not affect our argument, for <q rend="single">lovable</q> will mean <q rend="single">what appears lovable.</q></p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">There being then three motives of love, the term Friendship is not applied to love for inanimate objects, since here there is no return of affection, and also no wish for the good of the object—for instance, it would be ridiculous to wish well to a bottle of wine: at the most one wishes that it may keep well in order that one may have it oneself; whereas we are told that we ought to wish our friend well for his own sake.

Here then we have a case of two people mutually well-disposed, whom nevertheless we cannot speak of as friends, because they are not aware of each other’s regard. To be friends therefore, men must (1) feel goodwill for each other, that is, wish each other’s good, and (2) be aware of each other’s goodwill, and (3) the cause of their goodwill must be one of the lovable qualities mentioned above. </p></div></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Now these qualities differ in kind; hence the affection or friendship they occasion may differ in kind also. There are accordingly three kinds of friendship, corresponding in number to the three lovable qualities; since a reciprocal affection, known to either party, can be based on each of the three, and when men love each other, they wish each other well in respect of the quality which is the ground of their friendship.<note resp="Rackham">i.e., they wish each other to become more virtuous, pleasant, or useful as the case may be; so that there is a different species of will-wishing in each case.</note> Thus friends whose affection is based on utility do not love each other in themselves, but in so far as some benefit accrues to them from each other.

This is why lovers sometimes appear ridiculous when they claim that their love should be equally reciprocated; no doubt if they are equally lovable this is a reasonable demand, but it is ridiculous if they have nothing attractive about them. </p></div>

At the same time, no doubt it is unlikely that a father ever would abandon a son unless the son were excessively vicious; for natural affection apart, it is not in human nature to reject the assistance that a son will be able to render.

A friend is defined as (a) one who wishes, and promotes by action, the real or apparent good of another for that other’s sake; or (b) one who wishes the existence and preservation of his friend for the friend’s sake. (This is the feeling of mothers towards their children, and of former friends who have quarrelled.<note resp="Rackham">i.e., have had a difference which keeps them from meeting, but still leaves them well disposed to each other.</note>) Others say that a friend is (c) one who frequents another’s society, and (d) who desires the same things as he does, or (e) one who shares his friend’s joys and sorrows. (This too is very characteristic of mothers.) Friendship also is defined by one or other of these marks.<note resp="Rackham">These five notes of friendship are taken seriatim in sects. 2-5, and again in sects. 8, 9, but in both cases the fourth is dealt with first.</note></p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Goodwill appears to be an element of friendly feeling, but it is not the same thing as friendship; for it can be felt towards strangers, and it can be unknown to its object, whereas friendship cannot.

  <p rend="align(indent)">Neither is goodwill the same as affection. For it has no intensity, nor does it include desire, but these things are necessarily involved in affection. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Goodwill seems therefore to be the beginning of friendship, just as the pleasure of the eye is the beginning of love. No one falls in love without first being charmed by beauty, but one may delight in another’s beauty without necessarily being in love: one is in love only if one longs for the beloved when absent, and eagerly desires his presence. Similarly men cannot be friends without having conceived mutual goodwill, though well-wishers are not necessarily friends: they merely desire the good of those whose well-wishers they are, and would not actively assist them to attain it, nor be put to any trouble on their behalf. Hence extending the meaning of the term friendship we may say that goodwill is inoperative friendship, which when it continues and reaches the point of intimacy may become friendship proper—not the sort of friendship whose motive is utility or pleasure, for these do not arouse goodwill. Goodwill is indeed rendered in return for favors received, but this is merely the payment of a due; and that desire for an other’s welfare which springs from the anticipation of favors to come does not seem really to show goodwill for one’s benefactor, but rather for oneself; just as to court a man for some interested motive is not friendship. </p></div>

Nor yet is agreement in reasoned judgements about any subject whatever, for instance astronomy, termed concord; to agree about the facts of astronomy is not a bond of friendship. Concord is said to prevail in a state, when the citizens agree as to their interests, adopt the same policy, and carry their common resolves into execution. </p></div>

<p>Concord then refers to practical ends, and practical ends of importance, and able to be realized by both or all the parties: for instance, there is concord in the state when the citizens unanimously decree that the offices of state shall be elective, or that an alliance shall be made with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, or that Pittacus shall be dictator (when Pittacus was himself willing to be dictator<note resp="Rackham">Pittacus was elected dictator of <placeName key="perseus,Mitylene">Mitylene</placeName> early in the sixth century B.C.; he ruled for fourteen years, and then laid down his office.

Phoen. 558">Eur.

<p rend="align(indent)">Benefactors seem to love those whom they benefit more than those who have received benefits love those who have conferred them; and it is asked why this is so, as it seems to be unreasonable. The view most generally taken is 
    <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> that it is because the one party is in the position of a debtor and the other of a creditor; just as therefore in the case of a loan, whereas the borrower would be glad to have his creditor out of the way, the lender actually watches over his debtor’s safety, so it is thought that the conferrer of a benefit wishes the recipient to live in order that he may receive a return, but the recipient is not particularly anxious to make a return.

<p rend="align(indent)">But it might be held that the real reason lies deeper,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.3.9.</note> and that the case of the creditor is not really a parallel. With him it is not a matter of affection, but only of wishing his debtor’s preservation for the sake of recovering his money; whereas a benefactor feels friendship and affection for the recipient of his bounty even though he is not getting anything out of him and is never likely to do so. </p></div>

<p>The position of the benefactor then resembles that of the artist; the recipient of his bounty is his handiwork, and he therefore loves him more than his handiwork loves its maker.

Now those who take more than their share of these things are men who indulge <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> their appetites, and generally their passions and the irrational part of their souls. But most men are of this kind. Accordingly the use of the term <q rend="single">lover of self</q> as a reproach has arisen from the fact that self-love of the ordinary kind is bad.

<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng2:9.8" n="5"> 
<p>And that it is those who take too large a share of things of this sort whom most people usually mean when they speak of lovers of self, is clear enough. For if a man were always bent on outdoing everybody else in acting justly or temperately or in displaying any other of the virtues, and in general were always trying to secure for himself moral nobility, no one will charge him with love of self nor find any fault with him. </p></div>

<p>Yet as a matter of fact such a man might be held to be a lover of self in an exceptional degree. At all events he takes for himself the things that are noblest and most truly good.

But (a) as in the state it is the sovereign that is held in the fullest sense to be the state, and in any other composite whole it is the dominant part that is deemed especially to be that whole, so it is with man. He therefore who loves and indulges the dominant part of himself is a lover of self in the fullest degree. Again (b) , the terms <q rend="single">self-restrained</q> and <q rend="single">unrestrained</q> denote being restrained or not by one’s intellect, and thus imply that the intellect is the man himself.

Hence the good man will be a lover of self in the fullest degree, though in another sense than the lover of self so-called by way of reproach, from whom he differs as much as living by principle differs from living by passion, and aiming at what is noble from aiming at what seems expedient. </p></div>

<p>Persons therefore who are exceptionally zealous in noble actions are universally approved and commended; and if all men vied with each other in moral nobility and strove to perform the noblest deeds, the common welfare would be fully realized, while individuals also could enjoy the greatest of goods, inasmuch as virtue is the greatest good.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)">Therefore the good man ought to be a lover of self, since he will then both benefit himself by acting nobly and aid his fellows; but the bad man ought not to be a lover of self, since he will follow his base passions, and so injure both himself and his neighbors. </p></div>

And this is doubtless the case with those who give their lives for others; thus they choose great nobility for themselves.

<p rend="align(indent)">Another debated question is whether friends are necessary or not for happiness. People say that the supremely happy are self-sufficing, and so have no need of friends: for they have the good things of life already, and therefore, being complete in themselves, require nothing further; whereas the function of a friend, who is a second self, is to supply things we cannot procure for ourselves.

<p rend="align(indent)">What then do the upholders of the former view mean, and in what sense is it true? Perhaps the explanation of it is that most men think of friends as being people who are useful to us. Now it is true that the supremely happy man will have no need of friends of that kind, inasmuch as he is supplied with good things already. Nor yet will he want friends of the pleasant sort, or only to a very small extent, for his life is intrinsically pleasant and has no need of adventitious pleasure.

<p rend="align(indent)">But perhaps this inference is really untrue. For as we said at the beginning,<note resp="Rackham">1.7.15. The argument for friendship from the definition of happiness as virtuous and therefore pleasant activity is threefold: (<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign>) the virtuous actions of our friends give us (by sympathy) the same pleasure as our own; (<foreign xml:lang="grc">β</foreign>) good activities (e.g. study) can be carried on longer (because less liable to fatigue) ; (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γ</foreign>) virtuous friends increase our own virtue (as we unconsciously imitate their acts). Hence friends useful and pleasant because virtuous (though not useful or pleasant friends in the ordinary sense) are necessary adjuncts of happiness.</note> happiness is a form of activity, and an activity clearly is something that comes into being, not a thing that we possess all the time, like a piece of property. But if happiness consists in life and activity, and the activity of a good man, as was said at the beginning,<note resp="Rackham">1.8.13.</note> is good and so pleasant in itself, and if the sense that a thing is our own is also pleasant, yet we are better able to contemplate our neighbors than ourselves, and their actions than our own, and thus good men find pleasure in the actions of other good men who are their friends, 
<milestone n="1170a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>since those actions possess both these essentially pleasant qualities,<note resp="Rackham">i.e., they are good, and they are their own, i.e. like their own.</note> it therefore follows that the supremely happy man will require good friends, insomuch as he desires to contemplate actions that are good and that are his own, and the actions of a good man that is his friend are such. Also men think that the life of the happy man ought to be pleasant. Now a solitary man has a hard life, for it is not easy to keep up continuous activity by oneself; it is easier to do so with the aid of and in relation to other people. </p></div>

<p>Now as for the last argument, it seems only to prove that pleasure is a good, and not that it is in any way better than any other good; for every good is more desirable when combined with some other good than in isolation.

<p>Again, these thinkers’ refutation of the argument from the converse appears equally unsound. They pain say, if pain is bad, it does not follow therefore that pleasure is good: for an evil can also be opposed to an evil and to a thing that is neither good nor evil: a statement which is indeed sound enough, but which does not apply to the things in question. If both pleasure and pain were in the class of evils, both would be also of necessity things to be avoided, and if in the class of things neutral, neither ought to be avoided, or they ought to be avoided alike; but as it is we see men avoid pain as evil and choose pleasure as good; it is therefore as good and evil that they are opposed. </p></div></div>

<p>The same thing occurs in other cases when a man tries to do two things at once; the pleasanter activity drives out the other, the more so if it is much more pleasant, until the other activity ceases altogether.

<p rend="align(indent)">Now some thinkers hold that virtue is a gift of nature; others think we become good by habit, others that we can be taught to be good. Natural endowment is obviously not under our control; it is bestowed on those who are fortunate, in the true sense, by some divine dispensation. Again, theory and teaching are not, I fear, equally efficacious in all cases: the soil must have been previously tilled if it is to foster the seed, the mind of the pupil must have been prepared by the cultivation of habits, so as to like and dislike aright. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">We must therefore by some means secure that the character shall have at the outset a natural affinity for virtue, loving what is noble and hating what is base. And it is difficult to obtain a right education in virtue from youth up without being brought up under right laws; for to live temperately and hardily is not pleasant to most men, especially when young; hence the nurture and exercises of the young should be regulated by law, since temperance and hardiness will not be painful when they have become habitual. </p></div>

<p><milestone n="1180a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>But doubtless it is not enough for people to receive the right nurture and discipline in youth; they must also practice the lessons they have learnt, and confirm them by habit, when they are grown up. Accordingly we shall need laws to regulate the discipline of adults as well, and in fact the whole life of the people generally; for the many are more amenable to compulsion and punishment than to reason and to moral ideals. </p></div>

<p>Hence some persons hold,<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Laws 722d">Plat. Laws 722d ff.</bibl> </note> that while it is proper for the lawgiver to encourage and exhort men to virtue on moral grounds, in the expectation that those who have had a virtuous moral upbringing will respond, yet he is bound to impose chastisement and penalties on the disobedient and ill-conditioned, and to banish the incorrigible out of the state altogether.<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 325a">Plat. Prot. 325a</bibl> </note> For (they argue) although the virtuous man, who guides his life by moral ideals, will be obedient to reason, the base, whose desires are fixed on pleasure, must be chastised by pain, like a beast of burden. This indeed is the ground for the view that the pains and penalties for transgressors should be such as are most opposed to their favorite pleasures. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">But to resume: if, as has been said, in order to be good a man must have been properly educated and trained, and must subsequently continue to follow virtuous habits of life, and to do nothing base whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then this will be secured if men’s lives are regulated by a certain intelligence, and by a right system, invested with adequate sanctions. </p></div>

<p>Now paternal authority has not the power to compel obedience, <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> nor indeed, speaking generally, has the authority of any individual unless he be a king or the like; but law on the other hand is a rule, emanating from a certain wisdom and intelligence, that has compulsory force.

<p>But <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> appears to be the only or almost the only state in which the lawgiver has paid attention to the nurture and exercises of the citizens; in most states such matters have been entirely neglected, and every man lives as he likes, in Cyclops fashion <q rend="single">laying down the law For children and for spouse.</q><note resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom.

<p rend="align(indent)">The best thing is then that there should be a proper system of public regulation; but when the matter is neglected by the community, it would seem to be the duty of the individual to assist his own children and friends to attain virtue, or even if not able to do so successfully,<note resp="Rackham">This clause, literally <q rend="single">and to be able to do it,</q> Bywater would place here; it comes in the mss. after <q rend="single">public regulation</q> above.</note> at all events to make this his aim. But it would seem to follow from what has been said before, that he will be more likely to be successful in this if he has acquired the science of legislation. Public regulations in any case must clearly be established by law, and only good laws will produce good regulations;  <milestone n="1180b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>but it would not seem to make any difference whether these laws are written or unwritten, or whether they are to regulate the education of a single person or of a number of people, any more than in the case of music or athletics or any other form of training. Paternal exhortations and family habits have authority in the household, just as legal enactments and national customs have authority in the state, and the more so on account of the ties of relationship and of benefits conferred that unite the head of the household to its other members: he can count on their natural affection and obedience at the outset. </p></div>

<p>Moreover individual treatment is better than a common system, in education as in medicine. As a general rule rest and fasting are good for a fever, but they may not be best for a particular case; and presumably a professor of boxing does not impose the same style of fighting on all his pupils. It would appear then that private attention gives more accurate results in particular cases, for the particular subject is more likely to get the treatment that suits him. But a physician or trainer or any other director can best treat a particular person if he has a general knowledge of what is good for everybody, or for other people of the same kind: for the sciences deal with what is universal, as their names<note resp="Rackham">e.g., medicine is <q rend="single">the science of healing,</q> not the <q rend="single">science of healing Brown or Jones.</q></note> imply. </p></div>

<p>Not but what it is possible no doubt for a particular individual to be successfully treated by someone who is not a scientific expert, but has an empirical knowledge based on careful observation of the effects of various forms of treatment upon the person in question; just as some people appear to be their own best doctors, though they could not do any good <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> to someone else. But nevertheless it would doubtless be agreed that anyone who wishes to make himself a professional and a man of science must advance to general principles, and acquaint himself with these by the proper method: for science, as we said, deals with the universal. </p></div>

<p>So presumably a man who wishes to make other people better (whether few or many) by discipline, must endeavor to acquire the science of legislation—assuming that it is possible to make us good by laws. For to mold aright the character of any and every person that presents himself is not a task that can be done by anybody, but only (if at all) by the man with scientific knowledge, just as is the case in medicine and the other professions involving a system of treatment and the exercise of prudence. </p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Is not then the next question to consider from whom or how the science of legislation can be learnt? Perhaps, like other subjects, from the experts, namely the politicians; for we saw<note resp="Rackham">See 6.8.2.</note> that legislation who is a branch of political science. But possibly it may seem that political science is unlike the other sciences and faculties. In these the persons who impart a knowledge of the faculty are the same as those who practice it, for instance physicians and painters; but in politics the sophists, who profess to teach the science, <milestone n="1181a" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>never practice it. It is practiced by the politicians, who would appear to rely more upon a sort of empirical skill than on the exercise of abstract intelligence; for we do not see them writing or lecturing about political principles (though this might be a more honorable employment than composing forensic and parliamentary speeches), nor yet do we notice that they have made their own sons or any others of their friends into statesmen. </p></div>

<p>Yet we should expect them to have done so had they been able, for they could have bequeathed no more valuable legacy to their countries, nor is there any quality they would choose for themselves, and therefore for those nearest to them, to possess, in preference to political capacity. Not that experience does not seem to contribute considerably to political success; otherwise men would never have become statesmen merely through practical association with politics; so it would appear that those who aspire to a scientific knowledge of politics require practical experience as well as study. </p></div>

<p>On the other hand those sophists who profess to teach politics are found to be very far from doing so successfully. In fact they are absolutely ignorant of the very nature of the science and of the subjects with which it deals; otherwise they would not class it as identical with, or even inferior to, the art of rhetoric.<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Isoc. 15.80">Isoc. 15.80</bibl> </note> Nor would they imagine that it is easy to frame a constitution by making a collection of such existing laws as are reputed to be good ones, on the assumption that one can then select the best among them; as if even this selection did not call for understanding, and as if to judge correctly were not a very difficult task, just as much as it is for instance in music. It is only the experts in an art <milestone n="20" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/> who can judge correctly the productions of that art, and who understand the means and the method by which perfection is attained, and know which elements harmonize with which; amateurs may be content if they can discern whether the general result produced is good or bad, for example in the art of painting. Laws are the product, so to speak, of the art of politics; <milestone n="1181b" resp="Bekker" unit="page"/><milestone n="1" resp="Bekker" unit="line"/>how then can a mere collection of laws teach a man the science of legislation, or make him able to judge which of them are the best?</p></div>

<p>We do not see men becoming expert physicians from a study of medical handbooks. Yet medical writers attempt to describe not only general courses of treatment, but also methods of cure and modes of treatment for particular sorts of patients, classified according to their various habits of body; and their treatises appear to be of value for men who have had practical experience, though they are useless for the novice. Very possibly therefore collections of laws and constitutions may be serviceable to students capable of studying them critically, and judging what measures are valuable or the reverse, and what kind of institutions are suited to what national characteristics. But those who peruse such compilations without possessing a trained faculty cannot be capable of judging them correctly, unless they do so by instinct, though they may very likely sharpen their political intelligence. </p></div>
