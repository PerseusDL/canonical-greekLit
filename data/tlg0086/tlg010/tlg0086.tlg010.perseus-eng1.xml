				<head>Book 1</head>
				<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>Every art and every investigation, and likewise every practical pursuit or undertaking,
					seems to aim at some good: hence it has been well said that the Good is That at which all
					things aim. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>&lpar;It is true that a certain variety
					is to be observed among the ends at which the arts and sciences aim: in some cases the
					activity of practising the art is itself the end,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle gives flute-playing as an instance of an art the practice of which is an end
						in itself, in contrast with the art of building, the end of which is the house built
						<bibl n="Aristot. MM 1211b.27">Aristot. Gtr. Mor. 1211b 27 ff.</bibl></note> whereas
					in others the end is some product over and above the mere exercise of the art; and in the
					arts whose ends are certain things beside the practice of the arts themselves, these
					products are essentially superior in value to the activities.&rpar; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But as there are numerous pursuits and arts and sciences, it follows
					that their ends are correspondingly numerous: for instance, the end of the science of
					medicine is health, that of the art of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory,
					that of domestic economy wealth. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now in cases where
					several such pursuits are subordinate to some single faculty&mdash;as bridle-making
					and the other trades concerned with horses' harness are subordinate to horsemanship, and
					this and every other military pursuit to the science of strategy, and similarly other arts
					to different arts again&mdash;in all these cases, I say, the ends of the master arts
					are things more to be desired than the ends of the arts subordinate to them; since the
					latter ends are only pursued for the sake of the former. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>&lpar;And it makes no difference whether the ends of the pursuits are the activities
					themselves or some other thing beside these, as in the case of the sciences
					mentioned.&rpar;<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If therefore among the ends at which our actions aim there be one which we will for its
					own sake, while we will the others only for the sake of this, and if we do not <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> choose everything for the sake of something else
					&lpar;which would obviously result in a process <foreign lang="la">ad
						infinitum</foreign>, so that all desire would be futile and vain&rpar;, it is clear
					that this one ultimate End must be the Good, and indeed the Supreme Good. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Will not then a knowledge of this Supreme Good be also of great
					practical importance for the conduct of life? Will it not better enable us to attain our
					proper object, like archers having a target to aim at? <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If
					this be so, we ought to make an attempt to determine at all events in outline what exactly
					this Supreme Good is, and of which of the sciences or faculties it is the object.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now it would seem that this supreme End must be the object of the most authoritative of
					the sciences&mdash;some science which is pre-eminently a master-craft. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But such is manifestly the science of Politics; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>for it is this that ordains which of the sciences are to exist in
					states, <milestone n="1094b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and
					what branches of knowledge the different classes of the citizens are to learn, and up to
					what point; and we observe that even the most highly esteemed of the faculties, such as
					strategy, domestic economy, oratory, are subordinate to the political science. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Inasmuch then as the rest of the sciences are employed by this
					one, and as it moreover lays down laws as to what people shall do and what things they
					shall refrain from doing, the end of this science must include the ends of all the others.
					Therefore, the Good of man must be the end of the science of Politics. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>For even though it be the case that the Good is the same for the
					individual and for the state, nevertheless, the good of the state is manifestly a greater
					and more perfect good, both to attain and to preserve.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;both to ascertain and to secure.&rsquo;</note> To secure the
					good of one person only is better than nothing; but to secure the good of a nation or a
					state is a nobler and more divine achievement.</p>
				<p>This then being its aim, our investigation is in a sense the study of Politics.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now our treatment of this science will be adequate, if it achieves that amount of
					precision which belongs to its subject matter. The same exactness must not be expected in
					all departments of philosophy alike, any more than in all the products of the arts and
					crafts. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The subjects studied by political science are
					Moral Nobility<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">kalo/n</foreign>
						is a term of admiration applied to what is correct, especially &lpar;1&rpar;
						bodies well shaped and works of art or handicraft well made, and &lpar;2&rpar;
						actions well done &lpar;see 3.7.6&rpar;; it thus means &lpar;1&rpar;
						beautiful, &lpar;2&rpar; morally right. For the analogy between material and
						moral correctness see 2.6.9.</note> and Justice; but these conceptions involve much
					difference of opinion and uncertainty, so that they are sometimes believed to be mere
					conventions and to have no real existence in the nature of things. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And a similar uncertainty surrounds the conception of the Good, because
					it frequently occurs that good things have harmful consequences: people have before now
					been ruined by wealth, and in other cases courage has cost men their lives. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>We must therefore be content if, in dealing with subjects
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and starting from premises thus uncertain, we
					succeed in presenting a broad outline of the truth: when our subjects and our premises are
					merely generalities, it is enough if we arrive at generally valid conclusions. Accordingly
					we may ask the student also to accept the various views we put forward in the same spirit;
					for it is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of exactness in each kind
					which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is equally unreasonable to accept
					merely probable conclusions from a mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from
					an orator.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, each man judges correctly those matters with which he is acquainted; it is of
					these that he is a competent critic. <milestone n="1095a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>To criticize a particular subject, therefore, a man must have
					been trained in that subject: to be a good critic generally, he must have had an all-round
					education. Hence the young are not fit to be students of Political Science.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Quoted in <title>Troilus and Cressida</title>, II. ii.
						165.: Young men, whom Aristotle thought/Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</note> For they
					have no experience of life and conduct, and it is these that supply the premises and
					subject matter of this branch of philosophy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And moreover
					they are led by their feelings; so that they will study the subject to no purpose or
					advantage, since the end of this science is not knowledge but action. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>And it makes no difference whether they are young in years or immature
					in character: the defect is not a question of time, it is because their life and its
					various aims are guided by feeling; for to such persons their knowledge is of no use, any
					more than it is to persons of defective self-restraint.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The argument is, that even if the young could gain a knowledge of Ethics
						&lpar;which they cannot, because it requires experience of life&rpar;, they
						would not use it as a guide to conduct, because they are led by their passions and
						appetites; and therefore the study is of no value for them, since Ethics, being a
						practical science, is only pursued for the sake of its practical application.</note> But
					Moral Science may be of great value to those who guide their desires and actions by
					principle.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let so much suffice by way of introduction as to the student of the subject, the spirit
					in which our conclusions are to be received, and the object that we set before
					us.<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>To resume, inasmuch as all studies and undertakings are directed to the attainment of
					some good, let us discuss what it is that we pronounce to be the aim of Politics, that is,
					what is the highest of all the goods that action can achieve. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>As far as the name goes, we may almost say that the great majority of
					mankind are agreed about this; for both the multitude and persons of refinement speak of
					it as Happiness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This translation of <foreign lang="greek">eu)daimoni/a</foreign> can hardly be avoided, but it would perhaps be
						more accurately rendered by &lsquo;Well-being&rsquo; or
						&lsquo;Prosperity&rsquo;; and it will be found that the writer does not
						interpret it as a state of feeling but as a kind of activity.</note> and conceive
					&lsquo;the good life&rsquo; or &lsquo;doing well&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The English phrase preserves the ambiguity of the Greek,
						which in its ordinary acceptation rather means &lsquo;faring well&rsquo; than
						&lsquo;acting well,&rsquo; though in the sequel Aristotle diverts it to the
						active sense.</note> to be the same thing <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> as
					&lsquo;being happy.&rsquo; But what constitutes happiness is a matter of dispute;
					and the popular account of it is not the same as that given by the philosophers.
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Ordinary people identify it with some obvious and
					visible good, such as pleasure or wealth or honor&mdash;some say one thing and some
					another, indeed very often the same man says different things at different times: when he
					falls sick he thinks health is happiness, when he is poor, wealth. At other times, feeling
					conscious of their own ignorance, men admire those who propound something grand and above
					their heads; and it has been held by some thinkers<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz.
						Plato and the Academy; see chap. 6.</note> that beside the many good things we have
					mentioned, there exists another Good, that is good in itself, and stands to all those
					goods as the cause of their being good.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now perhaps it would be a somewhat fruitless task to review all the different opinions
					that are held. It will suffice to examine those that are most widely prevalent, or that
					seem to have some argument in their favour.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And we must not overlook the distinction between arguments that start from first
					principles and those that lead to first principles. It was a good practice of Plato to
					raise this question, and to enquire whether the true procedure is to start from or to lead
					up to one's first principles, <milestone n="1095b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>as in a race-course one may run from the judges to the far end of
					the track or the reverse. Now no doubt it is proper to start from the known. But
					&lsquo;the known&rsquo; has two meanings&mdash;&lsquo;what is known to
					us,&rsquo; which is one thing, and &lsquo;what is knowable in itself,&rsquo;
					which is another. Perhaps then for us<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In contrast
						apparently with the school of Plato.</note> at all events it proper to start from what
					is known to us. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>This is why in order to be a competent
					student of the Right and Just, and in short of the topics of Politics in general, the
					pupil is bound to have been well-trained in his habits. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>For the starting-point or first principle is the fact that a thing is so; if this be
					satisfactorily ascertained, there will be no need also to know the reason why it is so.
					And the man of good moral training knows first principles already, or can easily acquire
					them. As for the person who neither knows nor can learn, let him hear the words of
					Hesiod<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hes. WD 293">Hes. WD 293 ff.</bibl>
					</note>: <quote>
						<lg type="couplet">
							<l>Best is the man who can himself advise;</l>
							<l>He too is good who hearkens to the wise;</l>
							<l>But who, himself being witless, will not heed</l>
							<l>Another's wisdom, is a fool indeed.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But let us continue from the point<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">a 30.</note> where
					we digressed. To judge from men's lives, the more or less reasoned conceptions of the Good
					or Happiness that seem to prevail are the following. On the one hand the generality of men
					and the most vulgar identify the Good with pleasure, <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>and
					accordingly are content with the Life of Enjoyment&mdash;for there are three specially
					prominent Lives,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The doctrine of the three Lives goes
						back to Pythagoras, who compared the three kinds of men to the three classes of
						strangers who went to the Games, traders, competitors, and spectators
						&lpar;Iamblichus, <title>Vit. Pythag.</title> 58&rpar;. This apologue brings out
						the metaphor underlying the phrase <foreign lang="greek">qewrhtiko\s bi/os</foreign>,
						lit. &lsquo;the life of the spectator&rsquo; &lpar;
						Burnet&rpar;.</note> the one just mentioned, the
					Life of Politics, and thirdly, the Life of Contemplation. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The generality of mankind then <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> show themselves to
					be utterly slavish, by preferring what is only a life for cattle; but they get a hearing
					for their view as reasonable because many persons of high position share the feelings of
					Sardanapallus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The last two words of the Greek look
						like a verse passage loosely quoted. Sardanapallus was a mythical Assyrian king; two
						versions of his epitaph are recorded by Athenaeus &lpar;336, 530&rpar;, one
						containing the words <foreign lang="greek">e)/sqie, pi=ne, pai=ze: w(s ta)=lla tou/tou
							ou)k a)/cia tou= a)pokroth/matos</foreign>, &lsquo;Eat, drink, play, since all
						else is not worth that snap of the fingers&rsquo;; the other ends <foreign lang="greek">kei=n' e)/xw o(/ss' e)/fagon kai\ e)fu/brisa kai\ met' e)/rwtos te/rpn'
							e)/paqon: ta\ de\ kai\ o)/lbia pa/nta le/luntai</foreign>, &lsquo;I have what I
						ate; and the delightful deeds of wantonness and love which I did and suffered; whereas
						all my wealth is vanished.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Men of refinement, on the other hand, and men of action think that the Good is
					honor&mdash;for this may be said to be the end of the Life of Politics. But honor
					after all seems too superficial to be the Good for which we are seeking; since it appears
					to depend on those who confer it more than on him upon whom it is conferred, whereas we
					instinctively feel that the Good must be something proper to its possessor and not easy to
					be taken away from him. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Moreover men's motive in pursuing
					honor seems to be to assure themselves of their own merit; at least they seek to be
					honored by men of judgement and by people who know them, that is, they desire to be
					honored on the ground of virtue. It is clear therefore that in the opinion at all events
					of men of action, virtue is a greater good than honor; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>and one might perhaps accordingly suppose that virtue rather than honor is the end of
					the Political Life. But even virtue proves on examination to be too incomplete to be the
					End; since it appears possible to possess it while you are asleep, or without putting it
					into practice throughout the whole of your life; and also for the virtuous man to suffer
					the greatest misery and misfortune&mdash; <milestone n="1096a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>though no one would pronounce a man living a life
					of misery to be happy, unless for the sake of maintaining a paradox. But we need not
					pursue this subject, since it has been sufficiently treated in the ordinary
					discussions.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is not certain whether this phrase
						refers to written treatises &lpar;whether Aristotle's own dialogues and other
						popular works, now lost, or those of other philosophers&rpar;, or to philosophical
						debates like those which Plato's dialogues purport to report &lpar;as did doubtless
						those of Aristotle&rpar;. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Cael. 279a.30">De caelo 279a 30</bibl>
						<foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s e)gkukli/ois filosofh/masi</foreign>, &lsquo;in the
						ordinary philosophical discussions,&rsquo; and <bibl n="Aristot. De an. 407b.29">De anima
							407b 29</bibl>
						<foreign lang="greek">toi=s e)n koinw=| ginome/nois lo/gois</foreign>, &lsquo;the
						discussions that go on in public&rsquo;; and see 13.9 note for similar references to
						&lsquo;extraneous discussions.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The third type of life is the Life of Contemplation, which we shall consider in the
					sequel.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The Life of Money-making is a constrained<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally
					&lsquo;violent&rsquo;; the adjective is applied to the strict diet and and
					laborious exercises of athletes, and to physical phenomena such as motion, in the sense
					of &lsquo;constrained&rsquo;, &lsquo;not natural&rsquo;. The text here
					has been suspected.</note> kind of life, and clearly wealth is not the Good we are in
					search of, for it is only good as being useful, a means to something else. On this score
					indeed one might conceive the ends before mentioned to have a better claim, for they are
					approved for their own sakes. But even they do not really seem to be the Supreme Good;
					however, many arguments against them have been disseminated, so we may dismiss
					them.<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But perhaps it is desirable that we should examine the notion of a Universal Good, and
					review the difficulties that it involves, although such an inquiry goes against the grain
					because of our friendship for the authors of the Theory of Ideas.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The translation &lsquo;Forms&rsquo; is perhaps less misleading:
						<foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign> is not a psychological term.</note> Still
					perhaps it would appear desirable, and indeed it would seem to be obligatory, especially
					for a philosopher, to sacrifice even one's closest personal ties in defense of the truth.
					Both are dear to us, yet 'tis our duty to prefer the truth.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably a verse quotation.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The originators<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps
					&lsquo;importers&rsquo; from the Pythagoreans of S. Italy.</note> of this
					theory, then, used not to postulate Ideas of groups of things in which they posited<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps &lsquo;we posit&rsquo;.</note> an order of
					priority and posteriority<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A is &lsquo;prior in
						nature&rsquo; &lpar;though not necessarily in time&rpar; to B, when A can
						exist without B but not B without A; and they cannot then be on a par as members of one
						class.</note> &lpar;for which reason they did not construct an Idea of numbers in
					general&rpar;. But Good is predicated alike in <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					the Categories of Substance, of Quality, and Relation; yet the Absolute,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit. &lsquo;that which is by itself&rsquo;.</note>
					or Substance, is prior in nature to the Relative, which seems to be a sort of offshoot or
					&lsquo;accident&rsquo; of Substance; so that there cannot be a common Idea
					corresponding to the absolutely good and the relatively good.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, the word &lsquo;good&rsquo; is used in as many senses as the word
					&lsquo;is&rsquo;; for we may predicate good in the Category of Substance, for
					instance of God, or intelligence; in that of Quality&mdash;the excellences; in that of
					Quantity&mdash;moderate in amount; in that of Relation&mdash;useful; in that of
					Time&mdash;a favorable opportunity; in that of Place&mdash;a suitable
					&lsquo;habitat&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">di/aita</foreign> is used of the habitat of a species of animals, <bibl n="Aristot. Mu. 398b.32">De mundo 398b 32</bibl>; though it has been taken here to mean
						&lsquo;a favorable climate&rsquo; for human beings. In <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 114">Aristoph. Frogs 114</bibl> it may mean &lsquo;a
						lodging&rsquo;, and later it denotes an apartment or suite of rooms, as in
						Pliny's descriptions of Italian
						villas.</note>; and so on. So clearly good cannot be a single and universal general
					notion; if it were, it would not be predicable in all the Categories, but only in
					one.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, things that come under a single Idea must be objects of a single science; hence
					there ought to be a single science dealing with all good things. But as a matter of fact
					there are a number of sciences even for the goods in one Category: for example,

				<p>One might also raise the question what precisely they mean by their expression the
					&lsquo;Ideal so and-so,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally
						&lsquo;so-and-so itself.&rsquo;</note> seeing that one and the same definition
					of man <milestone n="1096b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>applies both to &lsquo;the Ideal man&rsquo; and to
					&lsquo;man,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., &lsquo;the
						ordinary notion of man&rsquo;&mdash;the concept of man in general which we form
						from our experience of particular men, but do not regard as a thing existing
						independently of them&mdash;; or perhaps &lsquo;a particular man,&rsquo; but
						this seems to require <foreign lang="greek">a)nqrw/pw| tini/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">tw=|de</foreign>.</note> for in so far as both are man, there will be no
					difference between them; and if so, no more will there be any difference between
					&lsquo;the Ideal Good&rsquo; and &lsquo;Good&rsquo; in so far as both are
					good. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Nor yet will the Ideal Good be any more good
					because it is eternal, seeing that a white thing that lasts a long time is no whiter than
					one that lasts only a day.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The Pythagoreans<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthetical note might come
					better after 6.4 &lpar;Burnet, <title>Cl. Rev.</title> 3:198&rpar;. The
					Pythagoreans, instead of &lpar;like Plato&rpar; saying the Good was one, more
					wisely said the One was good &lpar;or akin to the Good&rpar;. Some of them
					&lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.986a.22">Aristot. Met. 986a 22</bibl>&rpar;
					taught that there were ten pairs of opposing principles, which they ranged in two
					columns&mdash;limit and the unlimited, odd and even, unity and plurality, right and
					left, male and female, resting and moving, straight and crooked, light and darkness,
					good and bad, square and oblong. They also held &lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1072b.32">Aristot. Met. 1072b 32</bibl>&rpar; that good and
					beauty were not original, but appeared in the course of the evolution of the world;
					hence perhaps the late position of good in the list of opposites. The phrase
					&lsquo;column of goods&rsquo; &lpar;cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 14.1093b.12">Aristot. Met. 1093b 12</bibl> &lsquo;column of the beautiful&rsquo;&rpar;
					is inexact, as good was only one of the things in the column&mdash;unless it means
					the column to which good things among others belong; but doubtless all the positive
					principles were regarded as akin.</note> seem to give a more probable doctrine on the
					subject of the Good when they place Unity in their column of goods; and indeed
					Speusippus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Speusippus was Plato's nephew, and
						succeeded him as head of the Academy.</note> appears to have followed them. But this
					subject must be left for another discussion.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We can descry an objection that may be raised against our arguments on the ground that
					the theory in question was not intended to apply to every sort of good, and that only
					things pursued and accepted for their own sake are pronounced good as belonging to a
					single species, while things productive or preservative of these in any way, or preventive
					of their opposites, are said to be good as a means to these, and in a different sense.
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Clearly then the term &lsquo;goods&rsquo; would
					have two meanings, &lpar;1&rpar; things good in themselves and
					&lpar;2&rpar; things good as a means to these; let us then separate things good in
					themselves from things useful as means, and consider whether the former are called good
					because they fall under a single Idea. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>But what sort of
					things is one to class as good in themselves? Are they not those things which are sought
					after even without any accessory advantage, such as wisdom, sight, and certain pleasures
					and honors? for even if we also pursue these things as means to something else, still one
					would class them among things good in themselves. Or is there nothing <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> else good in itself except the Idea? If so, the species will be of
					no use.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the species or class of things good in
						themselves will be a class to which nothing belongs &lpar;for the Idea is not
						<emph>in</emph> the class&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/>If on the contrary the class of things good in
					themselves includes these objects, the same notion of good ought to be manifested in all
					of them, just as the same notion of white is manifested in snow and in white paint. But as
					a matter of fact the notions of honor and wisdom and pleasure, as being good, are
					different and distinct. Therefore, good is not a general term corresponding to a single
					Idea.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But in what sense then are different things called good? For they do not seem to be a
					case of things that bear the same name merely by chance. Possibly things are called good
					in virtue of being derived from one good; or because they all contribute to one good. Or
					perhaps it is rather by way of a proportion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						writer's own solution: when different things are called good, it means they each bear
						the same relation to &lpar;viz. contribute to the welfare of&rpar; certain other
						things, not all to the same thing.</note>: that is, as sight is good in the body, so
					intelligence is good in the soul, and similarly another thing in something else.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Perhaps however this question must be dismissed for the present, since a detailed
					investigation of it belongs more properly to another branch of philosophy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">.i.e., First Philosophy or Metaphysics.</note> And
					likewise with the Idea of the Good; for even if the goodness predicated of various in
					common really is a unity or something existing separately and absolute, it clearly will
					not be practicable or attainable by man; but the Good which we are now seeking is a good
					within human reach. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But possibly someone may think that to know the Ideal Good may be desirable <milestone n="1097a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>as an aid to
					achieving those goods which are practicable and attainable: having the Ideal Good as a
					pattern we shall more easily know what things are good for us, and knowing them, obtain
					them. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Now it is true that this argument has a certain
					plausibility; but it does not seem to square with the actual procedure of the sciences.
					For these all aim at some good, and seek to make up their deficiencies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;to supply what is lacking of
						it&rsquo; &lpar;the good at which they aim&rpar;; cf. 7.17.</note> but they
					do not trouble about a knowledge of the Ideal Good. Yet if it were so potent an aid, it is
					improbable that all the professors of the arts and sciences should not know it, nor even
					seek to discover it. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Moreover, it is not easy to see how
					knowing that same Ideal Good will help a weaver or carpenter in the practice of his own
					craft, or how anybody will be a better physician or general for having contemplated the
					absolute Idea. In fact it does not appear that the physician studies even health<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the particular good which is the end of his own
						science.</note> in the abstract; he studies the health of the human being&mdash;or
					rather of some particular human being, for it is individuals that he has to cure.</p>
				<p>Let us here conclude our discussion of this subject.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We may now return to the Good which is the object of our search, and try to find out what
					exactly it can be. For good appears to be one thing in one pursuit or art and another in
					another: it is different in medicine from what it is in strategy, and so on with the rest
					of the arts. What definition of the Good then will hold true in all the arts? Perhaps we
					may define it as that for the sake of which everything else is done. This applies to
					something different in each different art&mdash;to health in the case of medicine,
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> to victory in that of strategy, to a house in
					architecture, and to something else in each of the other arts; but in every pursuit or
					undertaking it describes the end of that pursuit or undertaking, since in all of them it
					is for the sake of the end that everything else is done. Hence if there be something which
					is the end of all the things done by human action, this will be the practicable
					Good&mdash;or if there be several such ends, the sum of these will be the Good.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Thus by changing its ground the argument has reached
					the same result as before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.1.</note> We must
					attempt however to render this still more precise.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now there do appear to be several ends at which our actions aim; but as we choose some of
					them&mdash;for instance wealth, or flutes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						a note on &lsquo;instruments,&rsquo; interpolated.</note> and instruments
					generally&mdash;as a means to something else, it is clear that not all of them are
					final ends; whereas the Supreme Good seems to be something final. Consequently if there be
					some one thing which alone is a final end, this thing&mdash;or if there be several
					final ends, the one among them which is the most final&mdash;will be the Good which we
					are seeking. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>In speaking of degrees of finality, we mean
					that a thing pursued as an end in itself is more final than one pursued as a means to
					something else, and that a thing never chosen as a means to anything else is more final
					than things chosen both as ends in themselves and as means to that thing; and accordingly
					a thing chosen always as an end and never as a means we call absolutely final. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Now happiness above all else appears to be absolutely final in
					this sense, <milestone n="1097b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since we always choose it for its own sake and never as a means to something else;
					whereas honor, pleasure, intelligence, and excellence in its various forms, we choose
					indeed for their own sakes &lpar;since we should be glad to have each of them although
					no extraneous advantage resulted from it&rpar;, but we also choose them for the sake
					of happiness, in the belief that they will be a means to our securing it. But no one
					chooses happiness for the sake of honor, pleasure, etc., nor as a means to anything
					whatever other than itself.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The same conclusion also appears to follow from a consideration of the self-sufficiency
					of happiness&mdash;for it is felt that the final good must be a thing sufficient in
					itself. The term self-sufficient, however, we employ with reference not to oneself alone,
					living a life of isolation, but also to one's parents and children and wife, and one's
					friends and fellow citizens in general, since man is by nature a social being.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit. &lsquo;a political thing.&rsquo; <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1.1253a.2">Aristot. Pol. 1253a 2</bibl> adds <foreign lang="greek">zw=|on</foreign>, &lsquo;a political animal.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>On the other hand a limit has to be assumed in these
					relationships; for if the list be extended to one's ancestors and descendants and to the
					friends of one's friends, it will go on <foreign lang="la">ad infinitum.</foreign> But
					this is a point that must be considered later on; we take a self-sufficient thing to mean
					a thing which merely standing by itself alone renders life desirable lacking in
					nothing,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable emendation gives
						&lsquo;renders life sufficient, that is, lacking in nothing.&rsquo;</note> and
					such a thing we deem happiness to be. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Moreover, we think
					happiness the most desirable of all good things without being itself reckoned as one among
					the rest<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc. but as including all other good things as
						the end includes the means.</note>; for if it were so reckoned, it is clear that we
					should consider it more desirable when even the smallest of other good things were
					combined with it, since this addition would result in a larger total of good, and of two
					goods the greater is always the more desirable. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
				</p>
				<p>Happiness, therefore, being found to be something final and self-sufficient, is the End
					at which all actions aim.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>To say however that the Supreme Good is happiness will probably appear a truism; we still
					require a more explicit account of what constitutes happiness. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Perhaps then we may arrive at this by ascertaining what is man's
					function. For the goodness or efficiency of a flute-player or sculptor or craftsman of any
					sort, and in general of anybody who has some function or business to perform, is thought
					to reside in that function; and similarly it may be held that the good of man resides in
					the function of man, if he has a function.<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Are we then to suppose that, while the carpenter and the shoemaker have definite
					functions or businesses belonging to them, man as such has none, and is not designed by
					nature to fulfil any function? Must we not rather assume that, just as the eye, the hand,
					the foot and each of the various members of the body manifestly has a certain function of
					its own, so a human being also has a certain function over and above all the functions of
					his particular members? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>What then precisely can this
					function be? The mere act of living appears to be shared even by plants, whereas we are
					looking for the function peculiar to man; <milestone n="1098a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>we must therefore set aside the vital activity of
					nutrition and growth. Next in the scale will come some form of sentient life; but this too
					appears to be shared by horses, oxen, and animals generally. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>There remains therefore what may be called the practical<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Practice&rsquo; for Aristotle denotes
						purposeful conduct, of which only rational beings are capable, cf. 6.2.2 note.</note>
					life of the rational part of man. &lpar;This part has two divisions,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This anticipation of 13.19 is irrelevant, and states
						decisively a point there left doubtful. Also on grounds of Greek this parenthesis has
						been suspected as an interpolation, and perhaps we should leave it out and render the
						preceding words &lsquo;the practical life of a rational being.&rsquo;</note> one
					rational as obedient to principle, the others possessing principle and exercising
					intelligence&rpar;. Rational life again has two meanings; let us assume that we are
					here concerned with the active exercise<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In contrast
						with the mere state of possessing the faculty.</note> of the rational faculty, since
					this seems to be the more proper sense of the term. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>If
					then the function of man is the active exercise of the soul's faculties<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;activity of soul&rsquo;; <foreign lang="greek">yuxh/</foreign> however has a wider connotation than either
						&lsquo;soul&rsquo; or &lsquo;mind,&rsquo; and includes the whole of the
						vitality of any living creature.</note> in conformity with rational principle, or at all
					events not in dissociation from rational principle, and if we acknowledge the function of
					an individual and of a good individual of the same class &lpar;for instance, a harper
					and a good harper, and so generally with all classes&rpar; to be generically the same,
					the qualification of the latter's superiority in excellence being added to the function in
					his case &lpar;I mean that if the function of a harper is to play the harp, that of a
					good harper is to play the harp well&rpar;: if this is so, and if we declare that the
					function of man is a certain form of life, and define that form of life as the exercise of
					the soul's faculties and activities in association with rational principle, <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>and say that the function of a good man is to perform these
					activities well and rightly, and if a function is well performed when it is performed in
					accordance with its own proper excellence&mdash;from these premises it follows that
					the Good of man is the active exercise of his soul's faculties in conformity with
					excellence or virtue, or if there be several human excellences or virtues, in conformity
					with the best and most perfect among them. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Moreover, to
					be happy takes a complete lifetime; for one swallow does not make spring, nor does one
					fine day; and similarly one day or a brief period of happiness <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> does not make a man supremely blessed<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word <foreign lang="greek">maka/rios</foreign>, rendered
						&lsquo;blessed&rsquo; or &lsquo;supremely happy,&rsquo; is a derivative
						of <foreign lang="greek">ma/kar</foreign>, the adjective applied in Homer and Hesiod to
						the gods and to those of mankind who have been admitted after death to the Islands of
						the Blest. See 10.16, 12.4.</note> and happy.<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let this account then serve to describe the Good in outline&mdash;for no doubt the
					proper procedure is to begin by making a rough sketch, and to fill it in afterwards. If a
					work has been well laid down in outline, to carry it on and complete it in detail may be
					supposed to be within the capacity of anybody; and in this working out of details Time
					seems to be a good inventor or at all events coadjutor. This indeed is how advances in the
					arts have actually come about, since anyone can fill in the gaps. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>Also the warning given above<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">3.1-4.</note> must not be forgotten; we must not look for equal exactness in all
					departments of study, but only such as belongs to the subject matter of each, and in such
					a degree as is appropriate to the particular line of enquiry. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>A carpenter and a geometrician both try to find a right angle,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;straight line.&rsquo;</note> but in
					different ways; the former is content with that approximation to it which satisfies the
					purpose of his work; the latter, being a student of truth, seeks to find its essence or
					essential attributes. We should therefore proceed in the same manner in other subjects
					also, and not allow side issues to outbalance the main task in hand. <milestone n="1098b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nor again must we in all matters alike demand an explanation of the reason why things are
					what they are; in some cases it is enough if the fact that they are so is satisfactorily
					established.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4.7.</note> This is the case with
					first principles; and the fact is the primary thing&mdash;it <emph>is</emph> a first
					principle. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>And principles are studied&mdash;some by
					induction, others by perception, others by some form of habituation, and also others
					otherwise<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This is usually taken &lsquo;that is,
						different ones in different ways,&rsquo; but <foreign lang="greek">kai\ . . .
							de/</foreign> seems to refer to other classes as well.</note>; <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>so we must endeavor to arrive at the principles of each kind in their
					natural manner, and must also be careful to define them correctly, <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>since they are of great importance for the subsequent course of the
					enquiry. The beginning is admittedly more than half of the whole,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The usual form of the proverb is &lsquo;The beginning is half of the
						whole.&rsquo; Aristotle applies it by a sort of play on words to <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> in its technical sense of a general principle of
						science, which is a &lsquo;beginning&rsquo; in the sense that it is the
						starting-point of deductive reasoning. There is a reminiscence of Hesiod, <bibl n="Hes. WD 30">Hes. WD 30</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ple/on h(/misu
							panto/s</foreign>, &lsquo;The half is more than the whole,&rsquo; though the
						meaning of that is entirely different.</note> and throws light at once on many of the
					questions under investigation.<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Accordingly we must examine our first principle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
					our definition of the Good for man, or happiness.</note> not only as a logical
					conclusion deduced from certain premises but also in the light of the current opinions on
					the subject. For if a proposition be true, all the facts harmonize with it, but if it is
					false, it is quickly seen to be discordant with them.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now things good have been divided into three classes, external goods on the one hand, and
					goods of the soul and of the body on the other<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The turn
						of phrase associates &lsquo;bodily goods&rsquo; with &lsquo;goods of the
						soul,&rsquo; both being personal, in contrast with the third class,
						&lsquo;external goods.&rsquo; But it at once appears that the important
						distinction is between &lsquo;goods of the soul&rsquo; on the one hand and all
						rest &lpar;&lsquo;the good in the body and those outside and of
						fortune,&rsquo; 7.13.2&rpar; on the other. Hence in 8.3 &lsquo;external
						goods&rsquo; must include &lsquo;bodily goods&rsquo; as also 8.15 f., where
						&lsquo;external goods&rsquo; are subdivided into the instruments and the
						indispensable conditions of well-being &lpar;and so in more scientific language,
						9.7&rpar;, the latter subdivision including beauty, the only bodily good there
						specified.</note>; and of these three kinds of goods, those of the soul we commonly
					pronounce good in the fullest sense and the highest degree. But it is our actions and the
					soul's active exercise of its functions<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See the
						definition, 7.15.</note> that we posit &lpar;as being Happiness&rpar;; hence so
					far as this opinion goes&mdash;and it is of long standing, and generally accepted by
					students of philosophy&mdash;it supports the correctness of our definition of
					Happiness.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It also shows it to be right in declaring the End to consist in certain actions or
					activities, for thus the End is included among goods of the soul, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and not among external goods.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 8.2, first note.</note>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, our definition accords with the description of the happy man as one who
					&lsquo;lives well&rsquo; or &lsquo;does well&rsquo;; for it has virtually
					identified happiness with a form of good life or doing well.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4.2 note.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And moreover all the various characteristics that are looked for in happiness are found
					to belong to the Good as we define it. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Some people think
					happiness is goodness or virtue, others prudence, others a form of wisdom; others again
					say it is all of these things, or one of them, in combination with pleasure, or
					accompanied by pleasure as an indispensable adjunct; another school include external
					prosperity as a concomitant factor. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Some of these views
					have been held by many people and from ancient times, others by a few distinguished men,
					and neither class is likely to be altogether mistaken; the probability is that their
					beliefs are at least partly, or indeed mainly, correct.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now with those who pronounce happiness to be virtue, or some particular virtue, our
					definition is in agreement; for &lsquo;activity in conformity with virtue&rsquo;
					involves virtue. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But no doubt it makes a great difference
					whether we conceive the Supreme Good to depend on possessing virtue or on displaying
					it&mdash;on disposition, or on the manifestation of a disposition in action. For a man
					may possess the disposition without its producing any good result, <milestone n="1099a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>as for instance when he is
					asleep, or has ceased to function from some other cause; but virtue in active exercise
					cannot be inoperative&mdash;it will of necessity act, and act well. And just as at the
					Olympic games the wreaths of victory are not bestowed upon the handsomest and strongest
					persons present, but on men who enter for the competitions&mdash;since it is among
					these that the winners are found,&mdash;so it is those who <emph>act</emph> rightly
					who carry off the prizes and good things of life.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And further, the life of active virtue is essentially pleasant. For the feeling of
					pleasure is an experience of the soul,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not an
						experience of the body &lpar;cf. 10.3.6&rpar;, even the case of
						&lsquo;bodily pleasures.&rsquo; This brings pleasure within the definition of
						happiness as &ldquo;an activity of the soul.&rdquo;</note> and a thing gives a
					man pleasure in regard to which he is described as &lsquo;fond of&rsquo;
					so-and-so: for instance a horse gives pleasure to one fond of horses, a play to one fond
					of the theater, and similarly just actions are pleasant to the lover of justice, and acts
					conforming with virtue generally to the lover of virtue. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>But whereas the mass of mankind take pleasure in things that conflict with one
					another,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Morally inferior people like things that are
						only pleasant &lsquo;accidentally,&rsquo; i.e. owing not to some quality
						inherent in the thing but to something extraneous to it, viz. some depravity of taste or
						temporary affection in the person. Hence not only do different people think different
						things pleasant but the same person thinks the same thing pleasant at one time and
						unpleasant at another&mdash;and so repents today of his indulgence yesterday; or he
						desires two incompatible things at once, or desires a thing with one part of his nature
						that he dislikes with another, so that there is a conflict between his desires, or
						between his desire for pleasure and his wish for what he thinks good &lpar;see Bk.
						9.4, esp. 4.8-10, and contrast 4.5.&rpar;</note> because they are not pleasant of
					their own nature, things pleasant by nature are pleasant to lovers of what is noble, and
					so always are actions in conformity with virtue, so that they are pleasant essentially as
					well as pleasant to lovers of the noble. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Therefore their
					life has no need of pleasure as a sort of ornamental appendage,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word is especially used of an amulet hung round the neck or fastened
						round a limb</note> but contains its pleasure in itself. For there is the further
					consideration that the man who does not enjoy doing noble actions is not a good man at
					all: no one would call a man just if he did not like acting justly, nor liberal if he did
					not like <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> doing liberal things, and similarly with
					the other virtues. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>But if so, actions in conformity with
					virtue must be essentially pleasant.</p>
				<p>But they are also of course both good and noble, and each in the highest degree, if the
					good man judges them rightly; and his judgement is as we have said. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>It follows therefore that happiness is at once the best, the noblest,
					and the pleasantest of things: these qualities are not separated as the inscription at
					<placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> makes out&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="couplet">
							<l>Justice is noblest, and health is best,</l>
							<l>But the heart's desire is the pleasantest&mdash;,</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> for the best activities possess them all; and it is the best activities, or one
					activity which is the best of all, in which according to our definition happiness
					consists.<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nevertheless it is manifest that happiness also requires external goods in addition, as
					we said; for it is impossible, or at least not easy, to play a noble part unless furnished
					with the necessary equipment.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It was one of the public
						duties of rich citizens at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to equip the
						chorus and actors of a drama at their own expense. One so doing was called <foreign lang="greek">xorhgo/s</foreign> &lpar;chorus-leader, as no doubt originally he

					shape of friends or wealth or political power; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>also
					there are certain external advantages, the lack of which sullies supreme felicity, such as
					good birth, satisfactory children, and personal beauty: a man of very ugly appearance or
					low birth, or childless and alone in the world, is not our idea of a happy man, and still
					less so perhaps is one who has children or friends<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps &lsquo;or friends&rsquo; is slipped in because of &lsquo;alone in
						the world&rsquo; just above, but friends should not be mentioned here among the
						indispensable conditions of happiness, as they were included just above among its
						instruments &lpar;see 8.2, first note&rpar;.</note> that are worthless, or who
					has had good ones but lost them by death. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>As we said
					therefore, happiness does seem to require the addition of external prosperity, and this is
					why some people identify it with good fortune &lpar;though some identify it with
					virtue<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This irrelevant addition looks like an
						interpolation.</note>&rpar;.<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is this that gives rise to the question whether happiness is a thing that can be
					learnt, or acquired by training, or cultivated in some other manner, or whether it is
					bestowed by some divine dispensation or even by fortune. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>&lpar;1&rpar; Now if anything that men have is a gift of the gods, it is
					reasonable to suppose that happiness is divinely given&mdash;indeed of all man's
					possessions it is most likely to be so, inasmuch as it is the best of them all. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This subject however may perhaps more properly belong to another
					branch of study.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., theology, but Aristotle does not
						reopen the question in the <title>Metaphysics</title> or elsewhere.</note> Still, even
					if happiness is not sent us from heaven, but is won by virtue and by some kind of study or
					practice, it seems to be one of the most divine things that exist. For the prize and end
					of virtue must clearly be supremely good&mdash;it must be something divine and
					blissful. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>&lpar;2&rpar; And also on our view it
					will admit of being widely diffused, since it can be attained through some process of
					study or effort by all persons whose capacity for virtue has not been stunted or maimed.
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>&lpar;3&rpar; Again, if it is better to be happy
					as a result of one's own exertions than by the gift of fortune, it is reasonable to
					suppose that this is how happiness is won; inasmuch as in the world of nature things have
					a natural tendency to be ordered in the best possible way, <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>and the same is true of the products of art, and of causation of any kind, and
					especially the highest.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the intelligence of
						man.</note> Whereas that the greatest and noblest of all things should be left to fortune
					would be too contrary to the fitness of things.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Light is also thrown on the question by our definition of happiness, which said that it
					is a certain kind of activity of the soul; whereas the remaining good things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.15, 16, and 8.2 note.</note> are either merely
					indispensable conditions of happiness, or are of the nature of auxiliary means, and useful
					instrumentally. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>This conclusion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz., that happiness depends on us and not on fortune, the answer implied
						by the foregoing arguments to the question raised in 9.1.</note> moreover agrees with
					what we laid down at the outset; for we stated that the Supreme Good was the end of
					political science, but the principal care of this science is to produce a certain
					character in the citizens, namely to make them virtuous, and capable of performing noble
					actions.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have good reasons therefore for not speaking of an ox or horse or any other animal as
					being happy, <milestone n="1100a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>because none of these is able to participate in noble activities. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>For this cause also children cannot be happy, for they are not old
					enough to be capable of noble acts; when children are spoken of as happy, it is in
					compliment to their promise for the future. Happiness, as we said, requires both complete
					goodness and a complete lifetime. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>For many reverses and
					vicissitudes of all sorts occur in the course of life, and it is possible that the most
					prosperous man may encounter great disasters in his declining years, as the story is told
					of Priam in the epics; but no one calls a man happy who meets with misfortunes like
					Priam's, and comes to a miserable end.<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Are we then to count no other human being happy either, as long as he is alive? Must we
					obey Solon's warning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Hdt. 1.30">Hdt.
						1.30-33</bibl>. Solon visited Croesus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, and was shown all his treasures, but refused to call him the
						happiest of mankind until he should have heard that he had ended his life without
						misfortune; he bade him &lsquo;mark the end of every matter, how it should turn
						out.&rsquo;</note> and &lsquo;look to the end&rsquo;? <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And if we are indeed to lay down this rule, can a man really be happy
					after he is dead? Surely that is an extremely strange notion, especially for us who define
					happiness as a form of activity! <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>While if on the other
					hand we refuse to speak of a dead man as happy, and Solon's words do not mean this, but
					that only when a man is dead can one safely call him blessed as being now beyond the reach
					of evil and misfortune, this also admits of some dispute; for it is believed that some
					evil and also some good can befall the dead, just as much as they can happen to the living
					without <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> their being aware of it&mdash; for
					instance honors, and disgraces, and the prosperity and misfortunes of their children and
					their descendants in general. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But here too there is a
					difficulty. For suppose a man to have lived in perfect happiness until old age, and to
					have come to a correspondingly happy end: he may still have many vicissitudes befall his
					descendants, some of whom may be good and meet with the fortune they deserve, and others
					the opposite; and moreover these descendants may clearly stand in every possible degree of
					remoteness from the ancestors in question. Now it would be a strange thing if the dead man
					also were to change<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., if our estimate of his life
						as happy or the reverse had to change. There is no idea of the dead being conscious of
						what happens to their descendants &lpar;cf. 10.3 fin.&rpar;, though this is
						inconsistently suggested by the wording of 10.5.</note> with the fortunes of his family,
					and were to become a happy man at one time and then miserable at another; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>yet on the other hand it would also be strange if ancestors were not
					affected at all, even over a limited period, by the fortunes of their
					descendants.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But let us go back to our former difficulty,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That
					raised in 10.1.</note> for perhaps it will throw light on the question<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That raised in 10.4.</note> we are now examining.
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>If we are to look to the end, and congratulate a man
					when dead not as actually being blessed, but because he has been blessed in the past,
					surely it is strange if at the actual time when a man is happy that fact cannot be truly
					predicated of him, <milestone n="1100b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>because we are unwilling to call the living happy owing to the
					vicissitudes of fortune, and owing to our conception of happiness as something permanent
					and not readily subject to change, whereas the wheel of fortune often turns full circle in
					the same person's experience. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>For it is clear that if we
					are to be guided by fortune, we shall often have to call the same man first happy and then
					miserable; we shall make out the happy man to be a sort of &lsquo;chameleon, or a
					house built on the sand.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps a verse
						from an unknown play.</note>
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But perhaps it is quite wrong to be guided in our judgement by the changes of fortune,
					since true prosperity and adversity do not depend on fortune's favours, although, as we
					said, our life does require these in addition; but it is the active exercise of our
					faculties in conformity with virtue that causes happiness, and the opposite activities its
					opposite.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And the difficulty just discussed is a further confirmation of our definition; since none
					of man's functions possess the quality of permanence so fully as the activities in
					conformity with virtue: they appear to be more lasting even than our knowledge of
					particular sciences. And among these activities themselves those which are highest in the
					scale of values are the more lasting, because they most fully and continuously occupy the
					lives of the supremely happy: for this appears to be the reason why we do not forget
					them.<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The happy man therefore will possess that element of stability in question, and will
					remain happy all his life; since he will be always or at least most often employed in
					doing and contemplating <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the things that are in
					conformity with virtue. And he will bear changes of fortunes most nobly, and with perfect
					propriety in every way, being as he is &lsquo;good in very truth&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;four-square without reproach.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">From the poem of Simonides quoted and discussed in <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 339">Plat.
						Prot. 339</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the accidents of fortune are many and vary in degree of magnitude; and although small
					pieces of good luck, as also of misfortune, clearly do not change the whole course of
					life, yet great and repeated successes will render life more blissful, since both of their
					own nature they help to embellish it, and also they can be nobly and virtuously
					utilized<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This distinction of the two values of good
						fortune recalls the two classes of external goods defined in 8.15,16 and 9.7.</note>;
					while great and frequent reverses can crush and mar our bliss both by the pain they cause
					and by the hindrance they offer to many activities. Yet nevertheless even in adversity
					nobility shines through, when a man endures repeated and severe misfortune with patience,
					not owing to insensibility but from generosity and greatness of soul. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>And if, as we said, a man's life is determined by his activities, no
					supremely happy man can ever become miserable. For he will never do hateful or base
					actions, <milestone n="1101a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since we hold that the truly good and wise man will bear all kinds of fortune in a
					seemly way, and will always act in the noblest manner that the circumstances allow; even
					as a good general makes the most effective use of the forces at his disposal, and a good
					shoemaker makes the finest shoe possible out of the leather supplied him, and so on with
					all the other crafts and professions. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>And this being so,
					the happy man can never become miserable; though it is true he will not be supremely
					blessed if he encounters the misfortunes of a Priam. Nor yet assuredly will he be variable
					and liable to change; for he will not be dislodged from his happiness easily, nor by
					ordinary misfortunes, but only by severe and frequent disasters, nor will he recover from
					such disasters and become happy again quickly, but only, if at all, after a long term of
					years, in which he has had time to compass high distinctions and achievements.<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>May not we then confidently pronounce that man happy who realizes complete goodness in
					action, and is adequately furnished with external goods? Or should we add, that he must
					also be destined to go on living not<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The clause
						&lsquo;not . . . lifetime&rsquo; stands above after &lsquo;external
						goods&rsquo; in the mss.</note> for any casual period but throughout a complete
					lifetime in the same manner, and to die accordingly, because the future is hidden from us,
					and we conceive happiness as an end, something utterly and absolutely final and complete?
					<milestone n="16" unit="section"/>If this is so, we shall pronounce <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> those of the living who possess and are destined to go on
					possessing the good things we have specified to be supremely blessed, though on the human
					scale of bliss.</p>
				<p>So much for a discussion of this question.<milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>That the happiness of the dead is not influenced at all by the fortunes of their
					descendants and their friends in general seems too heartless a doctrine, and contrary to
					accepted beliefs. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the accidents of life are many and
					diverse, and vary in the degree in which they affect us. To distinguish between them in
					detail would clearly be a long and indeed endless undertaking, and a general treatment in
					outline may perhaps be enough. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Even our own misfortunes,
					then, though in some cases they exercise considerable weight and influence upon the course
					of our lives, in other cases seem comparatively unimportant; and the same is true of the
					misfortunes of our friends of all degrees. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Also it makes
					a great difference whether those who are connected with any occurrence are alive or dead,
					much more so than it does in a tragedy whether the crimes and horrors are assumed to have
					taken place beforehand or are enacted on the stage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>We
					ought therefore to take this difference also into account, and still more perhaps the
					doubt that exists whether the dead really participate in good or evil at all. <milestone n="1101b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>For the above
					considerations seem to show that even if any good or evil does penetrate to them, the
					effect is only small and trifling, either intrinsically or in relation to them, or if not
					trifling, at all events not of such magnitude and kind as to make the unhappy happy or to
					rob the happy of their blessedness.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It does then appear that the dead are influenced in some measure by the good fortune of
					their friends, and likewise by their misfortunes, but that the effect is not of such a
					kind or degree as to render the happy unhappy or vice versa.<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These questions being settled, let us consider whether happiness is one of the things we
					praise or rather one of those that we honor<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						definition of happiness is now shown to be supported by the current terms of moral
						approbation; apparently <foreign lang="greek">e)paineton</foreign>,
						&lsquo;praiseworthy&rsquo; or &lsquo;commendable,&rsquo; was appropriate
						to means , or things having relative value, and <foreign lang="greek">ti/mion</foreign>,
						&lsquo;valued&rsquo; or &lsquo;revered,&rsquo; to ends, or things of
						absolute value.</note>; for it is at all events clear that it is not a mere
					potentiality.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., not merely a potentiality of good
						but an actual good, whether as means or end.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now it appears that a thing which we praise is always praised because it has a certain
					quality and stands in a certain relation to something. For we praise just men and brave
					men, in fact good men and virtue generally, because of their actions and the results they
					produce; and also we praise those who are strong of body, swift of foot and the like on
					account of their possessing certain natural qualities, and standing in a certain relation
					to something good and excellent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The point is also
					illustrated by our feeling about praises addressed to the gods: it strikes us as absurd
					that the gods should be referred to our standards, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					and this is what praising them amounts to, since praise, as we said, involves a reference
					of its object to something else. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But if praise belongs to
					what is relative, it is clear that the best things do not merit praise, but something
					greater and better: as indeed is generally recognized, since we speak of the gods as
					blessed and happy,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">But we do not praise them.</note>
					and also &lsquo;blessed&rsquo; is the term that we apply to the most godlike men;
					and similarly with good things&mdash;no one praises happiness as one praises justice,
					but we call it a &lsquo;blessing,&rsquo; deeming it something higher and more
					divine than things we praise.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Indeed it seems that Eudoxus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For a criticism of the
					hedonism of this unorthodox pupil of Plato see Bk. 10.2, 3.</note> took a good line in
					advocating the claims of pleasure to the prize of highest excellence, when he held that
					the fact that pleasure, though a good, is not praised, is an indication that it is
					superior to the things we praise, as God and the Good are, because they are the standards
					to which everything else is referred.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>For praise belongs to goodness, since it is this that makes men capable of accomplishing
					noble deeds, while encomia<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Encomia or laudatory
						orations are the chief constituent of Epideictic or Declamatory Oratory, one of the
						three branches &lpar;the others being Deliberative and Forensic&rpar; into which
						rhetoric is divided by Aristotle &lpar;<title>Rhet.</title> 1.3.&rpar;. The
						topics of encomia are virtue and vice, the noble and disgraceful, which are analyzed
						from this point of view in <title>Rhet.</title> 1.9. That chapter contains a parenthesis
						&lpar;9.33,34&rpar; distinguishing praise, as proper to <foreign lang="greek">pra/ceis</foreign>, actions in operation, from encomia, which belong to <foreign lang="greek">e)/rga</foreign>, the results achieved by action; but this distinction is
						not maintained in the context &lpar;9.35, and cf. 9.2 where God as well as man is
						given as an object of praise&rpar;.</note> are for deeds accomplished, whether
					bodily feats or achievements of the mind. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>However, to
					develop this subject is perhaps rather the business of those who have made a study of
					encomia. For our purpose we may draw the conclusion from the foregoing remarks, <milestone n="1102a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>that happiness is a
					thing honored and perfect. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>This seems to be borne out by
					the fact that it is a first principle or starting-point, since all other things that all
					men do are done for its sake; and that which is the first principle and cause of things
					good we agree to be something honorable and divine.<milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But inasmuch as happiness is a certain activity of soul in conformity with perfect
					virtue, it is necessary to examine the nature of virtue. For this will probably assist us
					in our investigation of the nature of happiness. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Also,
					the true statesman seems to be one who has made a special study of goodness, since his aim
					is to make the citizens good and law-abiding men&mdash;<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>witness the lawgivers of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and the other great legislators of history;
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>but if the study of virtue falls within the province of
					Political Science, it is clear that in investigating virtue we shall be keeping to the
					plan which we laid down at the outset.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the goodness that we have to consider is clearly human virtue, since the good or
					happiness which we set out to seek is human good and human happiness. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But human virtue means in our view excellence of soul, not excellence of
					body; also our definition of happiness is an activity of the soul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Now if this is so, clearly it behoves the statesman to have some
					acquaintance with psychology, just as the physician who is to heal the eye <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> or the other parts of the body<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The context seems to disprove the alternative rendering &lsquo;just
						as to cure eyes the oculist must have a general of the structure of the whole of the
						body as well.&rsquo; The illustration is a reminiscence of <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 156b">Plat. Charm. 156b-e</bibl>, but does not follow that passage
						exactly.</note> must know their anatomy. Indeed a foundation of science is even more
					requisite for the statesman, inasmuch as politics is a higher and more honorable art than
					medicine; but physicians of the better class devote much attention to the study of the
					human body. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>The student of politics<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">politiko/s</foreign> means for Aristotle both
						&ldquo;political scientist&rdquo; and &ldquo;statesman&rdquo;: for him
						they are the same thing, since <foreign lang="greek">politikh/</foreign> is a practical
						science.</note> therefore as well as the psychologist must study the nature of the soul,
					though he will do so as an aid to politics, and only so far as is requisite for the
					objects of enquiry that he has in view: to pursue the subject in further detail would
					doubtless be more laborious than is necessary for his purpose.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now on the subject of psychology some of the teaching current in extraneous
					discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These <foreign lang="greek">e)cwterikoi\
						lo/goi</foreign> are also mentioned in 6.4.2 and six other places in Aristotle
						&lpar;see Ross on <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1076a.28">Aristot. Met. 1076a 28</bibl>&rpar;. In <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 7.1323a.22">Aristot. Pol. 1323a 22</bibl> they are appealed to for the
						tripartite classification of goods which in 8.2 above is ascribed to current opinion
						&lsquo;of long standing and generally accepted by students of philosophy.&rsquo;
						The phrase therefore seems to denote arguments or doctrines &lpar;whether familiar
						in philosophic debates, for which see note on 5.6, or actually recorded in
						books&rpar;, that were not peculiar to the Peripatetic school; in some cases, as
						here, it may refer specially to the tenets of the Academy.</note> is satisfactory, and
					may be adopted here: namely that the soul consists of two parts, one irrational and the
					other capable of reason.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &ldquo;having a
						plan or principle.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone n="10" unit="section"/>&lpar;Whether these two parts are really distinct in
					the sense that the parts of the body or of any other divisible whole are distinct, or
					whether though distinguishable in thought as two they are inseparable in reality, like the
					convex and concave sides of a curve, is a question of no importance for the matter in
					hand.&rpar; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Of the irrational part of the soul again
					one division appears to be common to all living things, and of a vegetative nature: I
					refer to the part that causes nutrition and growth; for we must assume that a vital
					faculty of this nature exists in all things that assimilate nourishment, <milestone n="1102b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>including
					embryos&mdash;the same faculty being present also in the fully-developed organism
					&lpar;this is more reasonable than to assume a different nutritive faculty in the
					latter&rpar;. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>The excellence of this faculty
					therefore appears to be common to all animate things and not peculiar to man; for it is
					believed that this faculty or part of the soul is most active during sleep, but when they
					are asleep you cannot tell a good man from a bad one &lpar;whence the saying that for
					half their lives there is no difference between the happy and the miserable&rpar;.
					<milestone n="13" unit="section"/>This is a natural result of the fact that sleep is a
					cessation of the soul from the functions on which its goodness or badness
					depends&mdash;except that in some small degree certain of the sense-impressions may
					reach into soul during sleep, and consequently the dreams of the good are better than
					those of ordinary men. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>We need not however pursue this
					subject further, but may omit from consideration the nutritive part of the soul, since it
					exhibits no specifically human excellence.<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But there also appears to be another element in the soul, which, though irrational, yet
					in a manner participates in rational principle. In self-restrained and unrestrained<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For these terms see Bk. 7 init.</note> people we approve
					their principle, or the rational part of their souls, because it urges them in the right
					way and exhorts them to the best course; but their nature seems also to contain another
					element beside that of rational principle, which combats and resists that principle.
					<milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Exactly the same thing may take place in the soul as
					occurs with the body in a case of paralysis: when the patient wills to move his limbs to
					the right <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> they swerve to the left; and similarly in
					unrestrained persons their impulses run counter to their principle. But whereas in the
					body we see the erratic member, in the case of the soul we do not see it; nevertheless it
					cannot be doubted that in the soul also there is an element beside that of principle,
					which opposes and runs counter to principle &lpar;though in what sense the two are
					distinct does not concern us here&rpar;. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>But this
					second element also seems, as we said, to participate in rational principle; at least in
					the self-restrained man it obeys the behest of principle&mdash;and no doubt in the
					temperate and brave man it is still more amenable, for all parts of his nature are in
					harmony with principle.<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus we see that the irrational part, as well as the soul as a whole, is double. One
					division of it, the vegetative, does not share in rational principle at all; the other,
					the seat of the appetites and of desire in general, does in a sense participate in
					principle, as being amenable and obedient to it &lpar;in the sense in fact in which we
					speak of &lsquo;paying heed&rsquo; to one's father and friends, not in the sense
					of the term &lsquo;rational&rsquo; in mathematics<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthetical note on the phrase &lsquo;to have <foreign lang="xgreek">logos</foreign>&rsquo; is untranslatable, and confusing even in the
						Greek. According to the psychology here expounded, the intellect &lsquo;has a plan
						or principle,&rsquo; in the sense of understanding principle, and being able to
						reason and make a plan: in other words, it is fully rational. The appetitive part of
						man's nature &lsquo;has a plan or principle&rsquo; in so far as it is capable of
						following or obeying a principle. It happens that this relationship of following or
						obeying can itself be expressed by the words &lsquo;to have <foreign lang="xgreek">logos</foreign>&rsquo; in another sense of that phrase, viz. &lsquo;to take
						account of, pay heed to.&rsquo; To be precise the writer should say that the
						appetitive part <foreign lang="greek">lo/gon e)/xei tou= lo/gou</foreign> &lsquo;has
						<foreign lang="xgreek">logos</foreign> &lpar;takes account&rpar; of the
						<foreign lang="xgreek">logos</foreign>.&rsquo; The phrase has yet a third sense in
						mathematics, where &ldquo;to have <foreign lang="xgreek">logos</foreign>&rdquo;
						&lpar;<foreign lang="la">ratio</foreign>&rpar; means &lsquo;to be
						rational&rsquo; in the sense of commensurable.</note>&rpar;. And that principle
					can in a manner appeal to the irrational part, is indicated by our practice of admonishing
					delinquents, and by our employment of rebuke and exhortation generally. <milestone n="1103a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If the other hand it be more correct to speak of the appetitive part of the soul also as
					rational, in that case it is the rational part which, as well as the whole soul, is
					divided into two, the one division having rational principle in the proper sense and in
					itself, the other obedient to it as a child to its father.<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now virtue also is differentiated in correspondence with this division of the soul. Some
					forms of virtue are called intellectual virtues, others moral virtues: Wisdom or
					intelligence and Prudence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., practical, as
						distinguished from speculative, wisdom.</note> are intellectual, Liberality and
					Temperance are moral virtues. When describing a man's moral character we do not say that
					he is wise or intelligent, but gentle or temperate; but a wise man also is praised for his
					disposition<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. Speculative Wisdom &lpar;as
						distinguished from Prudence or Practical Wisdom&rpar;, which is therefore a virtue,
						though not a virtue in the narrower sense of moral virtue. Throughout Aristotle's

				<p>Virtue being, as we have seen, of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue
					is for the most part both produced and increased by instruction, and therefore requires
					experience and time; whereas moral or ethical virtue is the product of habit
					&lpar;<foreign lang="xgreek">ethos</foreign>&rpar;, and has indeed derived its
					name, with a slight variation of form, from that word.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is probable that <foreign lang="greek">e)/qos</foreign>, &lsquo;habit&rsquo;
						and <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, &lsquo;character&rsquo;
						&lpar;whence &lsquo;ethical,&rsquo; moral&rpar; are kindred words.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And therefore it is
					clear that none of the moral virtues formed is engendered in us by nature, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for no natural property can be altered by habit. For
					instance, it is the nature of a stone to move downwards, and it cannot be trained to move
					upwards, even though you should try to train it to do so by throwing it up into the air
					ten thousand times; nor can fire be trained to move downwards, nor can anything else that
					naturally behaves in one way be trained into a habit of behaving in another way.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The virtues<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> is here as often
						in this and the following Books employed in the limited sense of &lsquo;moral
						excellence&rsquo; or &lsquo;goodness of character,&rsquo; i.e. virtue in the
						ordinary sense of the term.</note> therefore are engendered in us neither by nature nor
					yet in violation of nature; nature gives us the capacity to receive them, and this
					capacity is brought to maturity by habit.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Moreover, the faculties given us by nature are bestowed on us first in a potential form;
					we exhibit their actual exercise afterwards. This is clearly so with our senses: we did
					not acquire the faculty of sight or hearing by repeatedly seeing or repeatedly listening,
					but the other way about&mdash;because we had the senses we began to use them, we did
					not get them by using them. The virtues on the other hand we acquire by first having
					actually practised them, just as we do the arts. We learn an art or craft by doing the
					things that we shall have to do when we have learnt it<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly &lsquo;For things that we have to learn to do &lsqb;in contrast
						with things that we do by nature&rsqb;, we learn by doing them.&rsquo;</note>:
					for instance, men become builders by building houses, harpers by playing on the harp.
					<milestone n="1103b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Similarly
					we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave
					acts. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>This truth is
					attested by the experience of states: lawgivers make the citizens good by training them in
					habits of right action&mdash;this is the aim of all legislation, and if it fails to do
					this it is a failure; this is what distinguishes a good form of constitution from a bad
					one. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Again, the actions
					from or through which any virtue is produced are the same as those through which it also
					is destroyed&mdash;just as is the case with skill in the arts, for both the good
					harpers and the bad ones are produced by harping, and similarly with builders and all the
					other craftsmen: as you will become a good builder from building well, so you will become
					a bad one from building badly. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Were this not so, there would be no need for teachers of the arts, but
					everybody would be born a good or bad craftsman as the case might be. The same then is
					true of the virtues. It is by taking part in transactions with our fellow-men that some of
					us become just and others unjust; by acting in dangerous situations and forming a habit of
					fear or of confidence we become courageous or cowardly. And the same holds good of our
					dispositions with regard to the appetites, and anger; some men become temperate and
					gentle, others profligate and irascible, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> by
					actually comporting themselves in one way or the other in relation to those passions. In a
					word, our moral dispositions are formed as a result of the corresponding activities.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Hence it is incumbent
					on us to control the character of our activities, since on the quality of these depends
					the quality of our dispositions. It is therefore not of small moment whether we are
					trained from childhood in one set of habits or another; on the contrary it is of very
					great, or rather of supreme, importance.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As then our present study, unlike the other branches of philosophy, has a practical aim
					&lpar;for we are not investigating the nature of virtue for the sake of knowing what
					it is, but in order that we may become good, without which result our investigation would
					be of no use&rpar;, we have consequently to carry our enquiry into the region of
					conduct, and to ask how we are to act rightly; since our actions, as we have said,
					determine the quality of our dispositions.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the formula &lsquo;to act in conformity with right principle&rsquo; is common
					ground, and may be assumed as the basis of our discussion. &lpar;We shall speak about
					this formula later,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in Bk. 6. For the sense in
						which &lsquo;the right principle&rsquo; can be said to be the virtue of Prudence
						see 6.13.5 note.</note> and consider both the definition of right principle and its
					relation to the other virtues.&rpar; <milestone n="1104a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But let it be granted to begin with that the whole theory of conduct is bound to be an
					outline only and not an exact system, in accordance with the rule we laid down at the
					beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.3.1.</note> that philosophical
					theories must only be required to correspond to their subject matter; and matters of
					conduct and expediency have nothing fixed or invariable about them, any more than have
					matters of health. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And
					if this is true of the general theory of ethics, still less is exact precision possible in
					dealing with particular cases of conduct; for these come under no science or professional
					tradition, but the agents themselves have to consider what is suited to the circumstances
					on each occasion, just as is the case with the art of medicine or of navigation.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But although the
					discussion now proceeding is thus necessarily inexact, we must do our best to help it
					out.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>First of all then we have to observe, that moral qualities are so constituted as to be
					destroyed by excess and by deficiency&mdash;as we see is the case with bodily strength
					and health &lpar;for one is forced to explain what is invisible by means of visible
					illustrations&rpar;. Strength is destroyed both by excessive and by deficient
					exercises, and similarly health is destroyed both by too much and by too little food and
					drink; while they are produced, increased and preserved by suitable quantities. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>The same therefore is true of
					Temperance, Courage, and the other virtues. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> The man
					who runs away from everything in fear and never endures anything becomes a coward; the man
					who fears nothing whatsoever but encounters everything becomes rash. Similarly he that
					indulges in every pleasure and refrains from none turns out a profligate, and he that
					shuns all pleasure, as boorish persons do, becomes what may be called insensible. Thus
					Temperance and Courage are destroyed by excess and deficiency, and preserved by the
					observance of the mean.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">We here resume from the end of chap. 1. The
					preceding paragraphs, repeating from Bk. 1. the caution as to method, and introducing
					the doctrine of the Mean, which is to be developed below, are parenthetical.</note> not
					only are the virtues both generated and fostered on the one hand, and destroyed on the
					other, from and by the same actions, but they will also find their full exercise in the
					same actions. This is clearly the case with the other more visible qualities, such as
					bodily strength: for strength is produced by taking much food and undergoing much
					exertion, while also it is the strong man who will be able to eat most food and endure
					most exertion. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>The same
					holds good with the virtues. We become temperate by abstaining from pleasures, and at the
					same time we are best able to abstain from pleasures when we have become temperate.
					<milestone n="1104b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>And so
					with Courage: we become brave by training ourselves to despise and endure terrors, and we
					shall be best able to endure terrors when we have become brave.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>An index of our dispositions is afforded by the pleasure or pain that accompanies our
					actions. A man is temperate if he abstains from bodily pleasures and finds this abstinence
					itself enjoyable, profligate if he feels it irksome; he is brave if he faces danger with
					pleasure or at all events without pain, cowardly if he does so with pain. </p>
				<p>In fact pleasures and pains are the things with which moral virtue is concerned.</p>
				<p>For &lpar;1&rpar; pleasure causes us to do base actions and pain cause us to
					abstain from doing noble actions. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Hence the importance, as Plato points out, of having been definitely
					trained from childhood to like and dislike the proper things; this is what good education
					means.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar;Again, if the virtues have to do with actions and feelings, and
					every action is attended with pleasure or pain, this too shows that virtue has to do with
					pleasure and pain.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; Another indication is the fact that pain is the medium of
					punishment; for punishment is a sort of medicine, and the nature of medicine to work by
					means of opposites.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The contrary maxim to <foreign lang="la">similia similibus curantur</foreign> or homoeopathy. Fever, caused by heat,
						is cured by cold, hence if the remedy for wickedness is pain, it must have been caused
						by pleasure.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;4&rpar;Again, as we said before, every formed disposition of the soul
					realizes its full nature<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., is actively exercised
						when fully developed, cf. 2.8.</note>
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> in relation to and in dealing with that class of
					objects by which it is its nature to be corrupted or improved. But men are corrupted
					through pleasures and pains, that is, either by pursuing and avoiding the wrong pleasures
					and pains, or by pursuing and avoiding them at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner, or
					in one of the other wrong ways under which errors of conduct can be logically classified.
					This is why some thinkers<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is probably to
						Speusippus, although in the extant remains of Greek philosophy <emph>apathy</emph>, or
						freedom from passions or emotions, first appears as an ethical ideal of the
						Stoics.</note> define the virtues as states of impassivity or tranquillity, though they
					make a mistake in using these terms absolutely, without adding &lsquo;in the right
					&lpar;or wrong&rpar; manner&rsquo; and &lsquo;at the right &lpar;or
					wrong&rpar; time&rsquo; and the other qualifications.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We assume therefore that moral virtue is the quality of acting in the best way in
					relation to pleasures and pains, and that vice is the opposite.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the following considerations also will give us further light on the same point.</p>
				<p>&lpar;5&rpar; There are three things that are the motives of choice and three
					that are the motives of avoidance; namely, the noble, the expedient, and the pleasant, and
					their opposites, the base, the harmful, and the painful. Now in respect of all these the
					good man is likely to go right and the bad to go wrong, but especially in respect of
					pleasure; for pleasure is common to man with the lower animals, and also it is a
					concomitant of all the objects of choice, <milestone n="1105a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since both the noble and the expedient appear to
					us pleasant.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;6&rpar; Again, the susceptibility to pleasure has grown up with all of us
					from the cradle. Hence this feeling is hard to eradicate, being engrained in the fabric of
					our lives.</p>
				<p>&lpar;7&rpar; Again, pleasure and pain are also<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc., as well as being the sources of our feelings.</note> the standards
					by which we all, in a greater or less degree, regulate our actions. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>On this account therefore pleasure and
					pain are necessarily our main concern, since to feel pleasure and pain rightly or wrongly
					has a great effect on conduct.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;8&rpar; And again, it is harder to fight against pleasure than against
					anger &lpar;hard as that is, as Heracleitus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Heraclitus, Fr. 105 &lpar;Bywater&rpar; <foreign lang="greek">qumw=| ma/xesqai
						xalepo/n: o(/ ti ga\r a)\n xrhi/zh| gi/nesqai, yuxh=s w)ne/etai</foreign>,
						&lsquo;it is hard to fight with anger &lsqb;or &lsquo;desire,&rsquo;
						<foreign lang="greek">qumw=|</foreign> in the Homeric sense,
						Burnet&rsqb;. Whatever it wishes to get, it
						purchases at the cost of life.&rsquo;</note> says&rpar;; but virtue, like art,
					is constantly dealing with what is harder, since the harder the task the better is
					success. For this reason also therefore pleasure and pain are necessarily the main concern
					both of virtue and of political science, since he who comports himself towards them
					rightly will be good, and he who does so wrongly, bad.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We may then take it as established that virtue has to do with pleasures and pains, that
					the actions which produce it are those which increase it, and also, if differently
					performed, destroy it, and that the actions from which it was produced are also those in
					which it is exercised.<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>A difficulty may however be raised as to what we mean by saying that in order to become
					just men must do just actions, and in order to become temperate they must do temperate
					actions. For if they do just and temperate actions, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					they are just and temperate already, just as, if they spell correctly or play in tune,
					they are scholars or musicians.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But perhaps this is not the case even with the arts. It is possible to spell a word
					correctly by chance, or because some one else prompts you; hence you will be a scholar
					only if you spell correctly in the scholar's way, that is, in virtue of the scholarly
					knowledge which you yourself possess.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Moreover the case of the arts is not really analogous to that of the virtues. Works of
					art have their merit in themselves, so that it is enough if they are produced having a
					certain quality of their own; but acts done in conformity with the virtues are not done
					justly or temperately if they themselves are of a certain sort, but only if the agent also
					is in a certain state of mind when he does them: first he must act with knowledge<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See Bk. 3.1, where this is interpreted as meaning both
						knowledge of what he is doing &lpar;the act must not be unconscious or
						accidental&rpar;, and knowledge of moral principle &lpar;he must know that the
						act is a right one&rpar;.</note>; secondly he must deliberately choose the act, and
					choose it for its own sake; and thirdly the act must spring from a fixed and permanent
					disposition of character. <milestone n="1105b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>For the possession of an art, none of these conditions is included,
					except the mere qualification of knowledge; but for the possession of the virtues,
					knowledge is of little or no avail, whereas the other conditions, so far from being of
					little moment, are all-important, inasmuch as virtue results from the repeated performance
					of just and temperate actions. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Thus although actions are
					entitled just and temperate when they are such acts as just and temperate men would do,
					the agent is just and temperate not when he does these acts merely, but when he does them
					in the way in which just and temperate men do them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It is
					correct therefore to say that a man becomes just by doing just actions and temperate by
					doing temperate actions; and no one can have the remotest chance of becoming good without
					doing them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But the mass of mankind, instead of doing
					virtuous acts, have recourse to discussing virtue, and fancy that they are pursuing
					philosophy and that this will make them good men. In so doing they act like invalids who
					listen carefully to what the doctor says, but entirely neglect to carry out his
					prescriptions. That sort of philosophy will no more lead to a healthy state of soul than
					will the mode of treatment produce health of body.<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have next to consider the formal definition of virtue. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
				</p>
				<p>A state of the soul is either &lpar;l&rpar; an emotion, &lpar;2&rpar; a
					capacity, or &lpar;3&rpar; a disposition; virtue therefore must be one of these
					three things. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>By the emotions, I mean desire, anger,
					fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, jealousy, pity; and generally
					those states of consciousness which are accompanied by pleasure or pain. The capacities
					are the faculties in virtue of which we can be said to be liable to the emotions, for
					example, capable of feeling anger or pain<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably for
						&lsquo;pain&rsquo; we should read &lsquo;fear.&rsquo;</note> or pity.
					The dispositions are the formed states of character in virtue of which we are well or ill
					disposed in respect of the emotions; for instance, we have a bad disposition in regard to
					anger if we are disposed to get angry too violently or not violently enough, a good
					disposition if we habitually feel a moderate amount of anger; and similarly in respect of
					the other emotions.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the virtues and vices are not emotions because we are not pronounced good or bad
					according to our emotions, but we are according to our virtues and vices; nor are we
					either praised or blamed for our emotions&mdash;a man is not praised for being
					frightened or angry, nor is he blamed for being angry merely, but for being angry in a
					certain way&mdash; <milestone n="1106a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>but we are praised or blamed for our virtues and vices. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Again, we are not angry or afraid from choice, but the virtues are
					certain modes of choice, or at all events involve choice. Moreover, we are said to be
					&lsquo;moved&rsquo; by the emotions, whereas in respect of the virtues and vices
					we are not said to be &lsquo;moved&rsquo; but to be &lsquo;disposed&rsquo;
					in a certain way.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And the same considerations also prove that the virtues and vices are not capacities;
					since we are not pronounced good or bad, praised or blamed, merely by reason of our
					capacity for emotion. Again, we possess certain capacities by nature, but we are not born
					good or bad by nature: of this however we spoke before.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If then the virtues are neither emotions nor capacities, it remains that they are
					dispositions.</p>
				<p>Thus we have stated what virtue is generically.<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it is not enough merely to define virtue generically as a disposition; we must also
					say what species of disposition it is. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It must then be
					premised that all excellence has a twofold effect on the thing to which it belongs: it not
					only renders the thing itself good, but it also causes it to perform its function well.
					For example, the effect of excellence in the eye is that the eye is good <emph>and</emph>
					functions well; since having good eyes means having good sight. Similarly excellence in a
					horse <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> makes it a good horse, and also good at
					galloping, at carrying its rider, and at facing the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If therefore this is true of all things, excellence or virtue in a man will be the
					disposition which renders him a good man and also which will cause him to perform his
					function well. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>We have already indicated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.8 f.</note> what this means; but it will throw more
					light on the subject if we consider what constitutes the specific nature of virtue.</p>
				<p>Now of everything that is continuous<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., without
					distinct parts, and so &lpar;if divisible at all&rpar;, divisible at any point,
					as opposed to what is <foreign lang="greek">dih|rhme/non</foreign>,
					&lsquo;discrete,&rsquo; or made up of distinct parts and only divisible between
					them.</note> and divisible, it is possible to take the larger part, or the smaller part,
					or an equal part, and these parts may be larger, smaller, and equal either with respect to
					the thing itself or relatively to us; the equal part being a mean between excess and
					deficiency.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Greek comparatives,
						&lsquo;larger&rsquo;, &lsquo;smaller&rsquo;, etc., may also mean
						&lsquo;too large&rsquo;, &lsquo;too small&rsquo;, etc.; and there is the
						same ambiguity in the words translated &lsquo;excess&rsquo; and
						&lsquo;deficiency&rsquo;. Again <foreign lang="greek">me/son</foreign>,
						&lsquo;middle&rsquo; or &lsquo;mean&rsquo;, is used as a synonym for
						<foreign lang="greek">me/trion</foreign> &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; or of the
						right amount, and <foreign lang="greek">i)/son</foreign> &lsquo;equal&rsquo; can
						mean &lsquo;equitable&rsquo;. Hence &lsquo;to take an equal part with
						respect to the thing itself&rsquo; means to take a part equal to the part left, viz.
						a half; &lsquo;to take an equal part relatively to us,&rsquo; means to take what
						is a fair or suitable amount. The former is a mean as being exactly in the middle
						between all and none&mdash;if the thing in question is represented by a line, this
						is bisected at a point equidistant from its two ends; the latter is a mean in the sense
						of being the right amount for the recipient, and also of lying somewhere between any two
						other amounts that happen to be too much and too little for him.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>By the mean of the thing I denote a point equally distant
					from either extreme, which is one and the same for everybody; by the mean relative to us,
					that amount which is neither too much nor too little, and this is not one and the same for
					everybody. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>For example, let 10 be many and 2 few; then
					one takes the mean with respect to the thing if one takes 6; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>since 6 &mdash;2 = 10 &mdash; 6, and this is the mean according
					to arithmetical proportion.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">We should rather call this
						an arithmetical progression.</note> But we cannot arrive by this method at the mean
					relative to us. <milestone n="1106b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Suppose that 10 lb. of food is a large ration for anybody and 2 lb.
					a small one: it does not follow that a trainer will prescribe 6 lb., for perhaps even this
					will be a large ration, or a small one, for the particular athlete who is to receive it;
					it is a small ration for a Milo,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A famous wrestler.</note> but a large one for a man just
					beginning to go in for athletics. And similarly with the amount of running or wrestling
					exercise to be taken. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>In the same way then an expert in
					any art avoids excess and deficiency, and seeks and adopts the mean&mdash;the mean
					that is not of the thing but relative to us. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>If therefore
					the way in which every art or science performs its work well is by looking to the mean and
					applying that as a standard to its productions &lpar;hence the common remark about a
					perfect work of art, that you could not take from it nor add to it&mdash;meaning that
					excess and deficiency destroy perfection, while adherence to the mean preserves
					it&rpar;&mdash;if then, as we say, good craftsmen look to the mean as they work,
					and if virtue, like nature, is more accurate and better than any form of art, it will
					follow that virtue has the quality of hitting the mean. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>I refer to moral virtue,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The formula of the mean does
						not apply to the intellectual virtues.</note> for this is concerned with emotions and
					actions, in which one can have excess or deficiency or a due mean. For example, one can be
					frightened or bold, feel desire or anger or pity, and experience pleasure <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and pain in general, either too much or too little, and in
					both cases wrongly; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>whereas to feel these feelings at
					the right time, on the right occasion, towards the right people, for the right purpose and
					in the right manner, is to feel the best amount of them, which is the mean
					amount&mdash;and the best amount is of course the mark of virtue. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>And similarly there can be excess, deficiency, and the due mean in
					actions. Now feelings and actions are the objects with which virtue is concerned; and in
					feelings and actions excess and deficiency are errors, while the mean amount is praised,
					and constitutes success; and to be praised and to be successful are both marks of virtue.
					<milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Virtue, therefore is a mean state in the sense that it
					is able to hit the mean. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>Again, error is multiform
					&lpar;for evil is a form of the unlimited, as in the old Pythagorean imagery,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1.6.7.</note> and good of the limited&rpar;,
					whereas success is possible in one way only &lpar;which is why it is easy to fail and
					difficult to succeed&mdash;easy to miss the target and difficult to hit it&rpar;;
					so this is another reason why excess and deficiency are a mark of vice, and observance of
					the mean a mark of virtue:</p>
				<p>Goodness is simple, badness manifold.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The verse from
					an unknown source would come in better just before or just after the last parenthesis.</note>
					<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>

				<p>And it is a mean state between two vices, one of excess and one of defect. Furthermore,
					it is a mean state in that whereas the vices either fall short of or exceed what is right
					in feelings and in actions, virtue ascertains and adopts the mean. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>Hence while in respect of its substance and the definition that states
					what it really is in essence virtue is the observance of the mean, in point of excellence
					and rightness it is an extreme.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.4.8.</note>
					<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Not every action or emotion however admits of the observance of a due mean. Indeed the
					very names of some directly imply evil, for instance malice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 7.15. The word means &lsquo;delight at another's
						misfortune&rsquo;, <foreign lang="de">Schadenfreude.</foreign></note> shamelessness,
					envy, and, of actions, adultery, theft, murder. All these and similar actions and feelings
					are blamed as being bad in themselves; it is not the excess or deficiency of them that we
					blame. It is impossible therefore ever to go right in regard to them&mdash;one must
					always be wrong; nor does right or wrong in their case depend on the circumstances, for
					instance, whether one commits adultery with the right woman, at the right time, and in the
					right manner; the mere commission of any of them is wrong. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>One might as well suppose there could be a due mean and excess and
					deficiency in acts of injustice or cowardice or profligacy, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> which would imply that one could have a medium amount of excess and
					of deficiency, an excessive amount of excess and a deficient amount of deficiency.
					<milestone n="20" unit="section"/>But just as there can be no excess or deficiency in
					temperance and justice because the mean is in a sense an extreme,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.17 above.</note> so there can be no observance of the mean nor
					excess nor deficiency in the corresponding vicious acts mentioned above, but however they
					are committed, they are wrong; since, to put it in general terms, there is no such thing
					as observing a mean in excess or deficiency, nor as exceeding or falling short in the
					observance of a mean.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We must not however rest content with stating this general definition, but must show that
					it applies to the particular virtues. In practical philosophy, although universal
					principles have a wider application,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;have
						a wider acceptance.&rsquo;</note> those covering a particular part of the field
					possess a higher degree of truth; because conduct deals with particular facts, and our
					theories are bound to accord with these.</p>
				<p>Let us then take the particular virtues from the diagram.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here apparently the lecturer displayed a table of virtues &lpar;like
					the one in <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 2.1220b.37">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1220b
						37</bibl>&rpar;, exhibiting each as a mean between two vices of excess and defect in
					respect of a certain class of action or feeling. This is developed in detail in Bk. 3.
					6-end and Bk. 4.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The observance of the mean in fear and confidence is Courage. <milestone n="1107b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>The man that exceeds in
					fearlessness not designated by any special name &lpar;and this the case with many of
					the virtues and vices&rpar;; he that exceeds in confidence is Rash; he that exceeds in
					fear and is deficient in confidence is Cowardly. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>In
					respect of pleasures and pains&mdash;not all of them, and to a less degree in respect
					of pains<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthesis looks like an interpolation
						from 3.10.1.</note>&mdash;the observance of the mean is Temperance, the excess
					Profligacy. Men deficient in the enjoyment of pleasures scarcely occur, and hence this
					character also has not been assigned a name, but we may call it Insensible. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>In regard to giving and getting money, the observance of the mean
					is Liberality; the excess and deficiency are Prodigality and Meanness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek word is the negative of that translated Liberality, but
						&lsquo;illiberality&rsquo; and &lsquo;illiberal&rsquo; we do not usually
						employ with reference to money.</note> but the prodigal man and the mean man exceed and
					fall short in opposite ways to one another: the prodigal exceeds in giving and is
					deficient in getting, whereas the mean man exceeds in getting and is deficient in giving.
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>For the present then we describe these qualities in
					outline and summarily, which is enough for the purpose in hand; but they will be more
					accurately defined later.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are also other dispositions in relation to money, namely, the mode of observing the
					mean called Magnificence &lpar;the magnificent man being different from the liberal,
					as the former deals with large amounts and the latter with small ones&rpar;, the
					excess called Tastelessness or Vulgarity, and the defect <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> called Paltriness. These are not the same as Liberality and the
					vices corresponding to it; but the way in which they differ will be discussed
					later.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In respect of honor and dishonor, the observance of the mean is Greatness of Soul, the
					excess a sort of Vanity, as it may be called, and the deficiency, Smallness of Soul.
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>And just as we said that Liberality is related to
					Magnificence, differing from it in being concerned with small amounts of money, so there
					is a certain quality related to Greatness of Soul, which is concerned with great honors,
					while this quality itself is concerned with small honors; for it is possible to aspire to
					minor honors in the right way, or more than is right, or less. He who exceeds in these
					aspirations is called ambitious, he who is deficient, unambitious; but the middle
					character has no name, and the dispositions of these persons are also unnamed, except that
					that of the ambitious man is called Ambitiousness. Consequently the extreme characters put
					in a claim to the middle position, and in fact we ourselves sometimes call the middle
					person ambitious and sometimes unambitious: <milestone n="1108a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>we sometimes praise a man for being ambitious,
					sometimes for being unambitious. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Why we do so shall be
					discussed later; for the present let us classify the remaining virtues and vices on the
					lines which we have laid down.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In respect of anger also we have excess, deficiency, and the observance of the mean.
					These states are virtually without names, but as we call a person of the middle character
					gentle, let us name the observance of the mean Gentleness, while of the extremes, he that
					exceeds may be styled irascible and his vice Irascibility, and he that is deficient,
					spiritless, and the deficiency Spiritlessness.<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are also three other modes of observing a mean which bear some resemblance to each
					other, and yet are different; all have to do with intercourse in conversation and action,
					but they differ in that one is concerned with truthfulness of speech and behavior, and the
					other with pleasantness, in its two divisions of pleasantness in social amusement and
					pleasantness in the general affairs of life. We must then discuss these qualities also, in
					order the better to discern that in all things the observance of the mean is to be
					praised, while the extremes are neither right nor praiseworthy, but reprehensible. Most of
					these qualities also are unnamed, but in these as in the other cases we must attempt to
					coin names for them ourselves, for the sake of clearness and so that our meaning may be
					easily followed. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In respect of truth then, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the middle character may
					be called truthful, and the observance of the mean Truthfulness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">From Bk. 4.7 it appears that the quality intended is sincerity of speech
						and conduct in the matter of asserting one's own merits. The observance of the mean in
						this respect is there said to have no name; and here the form of expression apologizes
						for using &lsquo;Truthfulness&rsquo; in so limited a sense. The defect in this
						respect Aristotle expresses by <foreign lang="greek">ei)rwnei/a</foreign>, a word
						specially associated with the affectation of ignorance practised by
						Socrates. Neither this nor its other shades of meaning
						correspond very closely to that of its English derivative <emph>irony</emph>.</note>;
					pretence in the form of exaggeration is Boastfulness, and its possessor a boaster; in the
					form of understatement, Self-depreciation, and its possessor the
					self-depreciator.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In respect of pleasantness and social amusement, the middle character is witty and the
					middle disposition Wittiness; the excess is Buffoonery and its possessor a buffoon; the
					deficient man may be called boorish, and his disposition Boorishness. In respect of
					general pleasantness in life, the man who is pleasant in the proper manner is friendly,
					and the observance of the mean is Friendliness; he that exceeds, if from no interested
					motive, is obsequious, if for his own advantage, a flatterer; he that is deficient, and
					unpleasant in all the affairs of life, may be called quarrelsome and surly.<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are also modes of observing a mean in the sphere of and in relation to the
					emotions. For<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence in the mss. follows the
						next one.</note> in these also one man is spoken of as moderate and another as
					excessive&mdash;for example the bashful man whose modesty takes alarm at everything;
					while he that is deficient in shame, or abashed at nothing whatsoever, is shameless, and
					the man of middle character modest. For though Modesty is not a virtue, it is praised, and
					so is the modest man. <milestone n="1108b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, Righteous Indignation is the observance of a mean between Envy and Malice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.18 &lpar;and note&rpar;: there envy and
					&lsquo;rejoicing-in-evil&rsquo; come in a list of emotions in which a due mean
					is impossible; and in <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1386b">Aristot. Rh. 1386b 34</bibl> they
					are said to be two sides of the same character. The present attempt to force them into
					the scheme as opposite extremes is not very successful, and it is noteworthy that this
					group of qualities is omitted in Bk. 4.</note> and these qualities are concerned with
					pain and pleasure felt at the fortunes of one's neighbors. The righteously indignant man
					is pained by undeserved good fortune; the jealous man exceeds him and is pained by all the
					good fortune of others;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is difficult not to think
						that some words have been lost here, such as &lsquo;and the righteously indignant
						man is pained by the undeserved misfortune of others.&rsquo;</note> while the
					malicious man so far falls short of being pained that he actually feels
					pleasure.<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These qualities however it will be time to discuss in another place. After them we will
					treat Justice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Bk. 6</note> distinguishing its two
					kinds&mdash;for it has more than one sense&mdash;and showing in what way each is a
					mode of observing the mean. &lsqb;And we will deal similarly with the logical
					virtues.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Grant rightly rejects this sentence, since
						the intellectual virtues are nowhere else thus designated by Aristotle, nor does he
						regard them as modes of observing a mean.</note>&rsqb;<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are then three dispositions&mdash;two vices, one of excess and one of defect,
					and one virtue which is the observance of the mean; and each of them is in a certain way
					opposed to both the others. For the extreme states are the opposite both of the middle
					state and of each other, and the middle state is the opposite of both extremes; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>since just as the equal is greater in comparison with the less and
					less in comparison with the greater, so the middle states of character are in excess as
					compared with the defective states and defective as compared with the excessive states,
					whether in the case of feelings or of actions. For instance, a brave man appears rash in
					contrast with a coward <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and cowardly in contrast
					with a rash man; similarly a temperate man appears profligate in contrast with a man
					insensible to pleasure and pain, but insensible in contrast with a profligate; and a
					liberal man seems prodigal in contrast with a mean man, mean in contrast with one who is
					prodigal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Hence either extreme character tries to push
					the middle character towards the other extreme; a coward calls a brave man rash and a rash
					man calls him a coward, and correspondingly in other cases.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But while all three dispositions are thus opposed to one another, the greatest degree of
					contrariety exists between the two extremes. For the extremes are farther apart from each
					other than from the mean, just as great is farther from small and small from great than
					either from equal. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Again<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence should perhaps follow the next one, as it gives a second
						test of opposition, viz. unlikeness. However, unlikeness and remoteness are blended
						together in 8.7.</note> some extremes show a certain likeness to the mean&mdash;for
					instance, Rashness resembles Courage, Prodigality Liberality, whereas the extremes display
					the greatest unlikeness to one another. But it is things farthest apart from each other
					that logicians define as contraries, so that the farther apart things are the more
					contrary they are.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And in some cases <milestone n="1109a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>the defect, in others the excess, is more opposed to the mean; for
					example Cowardice, which is a vice of deficiency, is more opposed to Courage than is
					Rashness which is a vice of excess; but Profligacy, or excess of feeling, is more opposed
					to Temperance than is Insensibility, or lack of feeling. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>This results from either of two causes. One of these arises from the thing itself; owing
					to one extreme being nearer to the mean and resembling it more, we count not this but
					rather the contrary extreme as the opposite of the mean; for example, because Rashness
					seems to resemble Courage more than Cowardice does, and to be nearer to it, we reckon
					Cowardice rather than Rashness as the contrary of Courage; for those extremes which are
					more remote from the mean are thought to be more contrary to it. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>This then is one cause, arising out of the thing itself. The other cause
					has its origin in us: those things appear more contrary to the mean to which we are
					ourselves more inclined by nature. For example, we are of ourselves more inclined to
					pleasure, which is why we are prone to Profligacy &lsqb;more than to
					Propriety&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words are probably an
						interpolation, since the sense requires &lsquo;more than to
						Insensibility&rsquo;.</note> We therefore rather call those things the contrary of
					the mean, into which we are more inclined to lapse; and hence Profligacy, the excess, is
					more particularly the contrary of Temperance <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Enough has now been said to show that moral virtue is a mean, and in what sense this is
					so, namely that it is a mean between two vices, one of excess and the other of defect; and
					that it is such a mean because it aims at hitting the middle point in feelings and in
					actions. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This is why it is a hard task to be good, for it
					is hard to find the middle point in anything: for instance, not everybody can find the
					center of a circle, but only someone who knows geometry. So also anybody can become
					angry&mdash;that is easy, and so it is to give and spend money; but to be angry with
					or give money to the right person, and to the right amount, and at the right time, and for
					the right purpose, and in the right way&mdash;this is not within everybody's power and
					is not easy; so that to do these things properly is rare, praiseworthy, and
					noble.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence the first rule in aiming at the mean is to avoid that extreme which is the more
					opposed to the mean, as Calypso advises<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 12.219">Hom. Od. 12.219</bibl>: really the words are said by Odysseus,
						conveying to his steersman Circe's advice, to avoid the whirlpool of
						Charybdis which will engulf them all, and steer nearer
						to the monster Scylla who will devour only some of them.</note>&mdash; <quote>
							<lg type="iambic">
								<l>Steer the ship clear of yonder spray and surge.</l>
							</lg>
						</quote> For of the two extremes one is a more serious error than the other. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Hence, inasmuch as to hit the mean extremely well is
					difficult,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;to hit the mean is extremely
						difficult.&rsquo;</note> the second best way to sail,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A proverb, meaning to take to the oars when the wind fails.</note> as the
					saying goes, is to take the least of the evils; and the best way to do this will be the
					way we enjoin. <milestone n="1109b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/></p>
				<p>The second rule is to notice what are the errors to which we are ourselves most prone
					&lpar;as different men are inclined by nature to different
					faults&rpar;&mdash;and we shall discover what these are by observing the pleasure
					or pain that we experience&mdash;; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>then we must drag
					ourselves away in the opposite direction, for by steering wide of our besetting error we
					shall make a middle course. This is the method adopted by carpenters to straighten warped
					timber<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thirdly, we must in everything be most of all on our guard against what is pleasant and
					against pleasure; for when pleasure is on her trial we are not impartial judges. The right
					course is therefore to feel towards pleasure as the elders of the people felt towards
					Helen,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.156">Hom. Il.
						3.156-160</bibl>.</note> and to apply<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or
							&lsquo;repeat&rsquo;.</note> their words to her on every occasion; for if we
					roundly bid her be gone, we shall be less likely to err.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These then, to sum up the matter, are the precautions that will best enable us to hit the
					mean. But no doubt it is a difficult thing to do, and especially in particular cases: for
					instance, it is not easy to define in what manner and with what people and on what sort of
					grounds and how long one ought to be angry; and in fact we sometimes praise men who err on
					the side of defect in this matter and call them gentle, sometimes those who are quick to a
					anger and style them manly. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>However, we do not blame one
					who diverges a little from the right course, whether on the side of the too much or of the
					too little, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> but one who diverges more widely, for
					his error is noticed. Yet to what degree and how seriously a man must err to be blamed is
					not easy to define on principle. For in fact no object of perception is easy to define;
					and such questions of degree depend on particular circumstances, and the decision lies
					with perception.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus much then is clear, that it is the middle disposition in each department of conduct
					that is to be praised, but that one should lean sometimes to the side of excess and
					sometimes to that of deficiency, since this is the easiest way of hitting the mean and the
					right course.</p>

				<p>Virtue however is concerned with emotions and actions, and it is only voluntary feelings
					and actions for which praise and blame are given; those that are involuntary are condoned,
					and sometimes even pitied. Hence it seems to be necessary for the student of ethics to
					define the difference between the Voluntary and the Involuntary<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">e(kou/sion</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/sion</foreign> are most conveniently rendered &lsquo;voluntary&rsquo;
						and &lsquo;involuntary&rsquo;; but the word <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/sion</foreign> suggests &lsquo;unwilling&rsquo; or &lsquo;against the
						will,&rsquo; and to this meaning Aristotle limits it in 1.13. There he introduces a
						third term, <foreign lang="greek">ou)x e(kou/sion</foreign>, &lsquo;not
						voluntary&rsquo; or &lsquo;not willing,&rsquo; to describe acts done in
						ignorance of their full circumstances and consequences, and so not willed in the full
						sense; but such acts when subsequently regretted by the agent are included in the class
						of <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/sia</foreign> or unwilling acts, because had the agent
						not been in ignorance he would not have done them.</note>; and this will also be of
					service to the legislator in assigning rewards and punishments. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is then generally held that actions are involuntary when done &lpar;a&rpar;
					under compulsion or &lpar;b&rpar; through ignorance; <milestone n="1110a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>and that &lpar;a&rpar; an act is compulsory
					when its origin is from without, being of such a nature that the agent, who is really
					passive, contributes nothing to it: for example, when a ship's captain is carried
					somewhere by stress of weather, or by people who have him in their power. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But there is some doubt about actions
					done through fear of a worse alternative, or for some noble object&mdash; as for
					instance if a tyrant having a man's parents and children in his power commands him to do
					something base, when if he complies their lives will be spared but if he refuses they will
					be put to death. It is open to question whether such actions are voluntary or involuntary.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>A somewhat similar
					case is when cargo is jettisoned in a storm; apart from circumstances, no one voluntarily
					throws away his property, but to save his own life and that of his shipmates any sane man
					would do so. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Acts of
					this kind, then, are &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; or composite<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., partly voluntary, partly involuntary.</note>; but they approximate
					rather to the voluntary class. For at the actual time when they are done they are chosen
					or willed; and the end or motive of an act varies with the occasion, so that the terms
					&lsquo;voluntary&rsquo; and &lsquo;involuntary&rsquo; should be used with
					reference to the time of action; now the actual deed in the cases in question is done
					voluntarily, for the origin of the movement of the parts of the body instrumental to the
					act lies in the agent; and when the origin of an action is in oneself, it is in one's own
					power to do it or not. Such acts therefore are voluntary, though perhaps involuntary apart
					from circumstances&mdash;for no one would choose to do any such action in and for
					itself. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Sometimes indeed men are actually praised<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Which shows
					that the acts are regarded as voluntary &lpar;
					Peters&rpar;.</note> for deeds of this &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;
					class, namely when they submit to some disgrace or pain as the price of some great and
					noble object; though if they do so without any such motive they are blamed, since it is
					contemptible to submit to a great disgrace with no advantage or only a trifling one in
					view. In some cases again, such submission though not praised is condoned, when a man does
					something wrong through fear of penalties that impose too great a strain on human nature,
					and that no one could endure. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Yet there seem to be some acts which a man cannot be compelled to
					do,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., some acts are so repulsive that a man's
						abhorrence of them must be stronger than any pressure that can be put on him to commit
						them; so that if he commits them he must be held to have chosen to do so.</note> and
					rather than do them he ought to submit to the most terrible death: for instance, we think
					it ridiculous that Alcmaeon in Euripides' play<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In a
						play now lost, Eriphyle was bribed with a necklace to induce her husband Amphiaraus,
						king of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, to join the expedition of the
						Seven against <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>. Foreseeing he would lose
						his life, he charged his sons to avenge his death upon their mother, invoking on them
						famine and childlessness if they disobeyed. The verse in question is preserved: <foreign lang="greek">ma/lista me\n m' e)ph=r' e)piskh/yas path/r</foreign>. Alcmaeon, fr. 69
						&lpar;Nauck&rpar;.</note> is compelled by certain threats to murder his mother!
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But it is sometimes
					difficult to decide how far we ought to go in choosing to do a given act rather than
					suffer a given penalty, or in enduring a given penalty rather than commit a given action;
					and it is still more difficult to abide by our decision when made, since in most of such
					dilemmas the penalty threatened is painful and the deed forced upon us dishonorable, which
					is why praise and blame are bestowed according as we do or do not yield to such
					compulsion. <milestone n="1110b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>What kind of actions then are to be called &lsquo;compulsory&rsquo;? Used without
					qualification, perhaps this term applies to any case where the cause of the action lies in
					things outside the agent, and when the agent contributes nothing. But when actions
					intrinsically involuntary are yet in given circumstances deliberately chosen in preference
					to a given alternative, and when their origin lies in the agent, these actions are to be
					pronounced intrinsically involuntary but voluntary in the circumstances, and in preference
					to the alternative. They approximate however rather to the voluntary class, since conduct
					consists of particular things done,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">There is no such
						thing as an act which is not this particular act in these particular circumstances
						&lpar;Burnet&rpar;.</note> and the
					particular things done in the cases in question are voluntary. But it is not easy to lay
					down rules for deciding which of two alternatives is to be chosen, for particular cases
					differ widely.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>To apply the term &lsquo;compulsory&rsquo; to acts done for the sake of pleasure
					or for noble objects, on the plea that these exercise constraint on us from without, is to
					make every action compulsory. For &lpar;1&rpar; pleasure and nobility between them
					supply the motives of all actions whatsoever. Also &lpar;2&rpar; to act under
					compulsion and involuntarily is painful, but actions aiming at something pleasant or noble
					are done with pleasure. And &lpar;3&rpar; it is absurd to blame external things,
					instead of blaming ourselves for falling an easy prey to their attractions; or to take the
					credit of our noble deeds to ourselves, while putting the blame for our disgraceful ones
					upon the temptations of pleasure. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>It appears therefore that an act is compulsory when its origin is from

				<p>&lpar;b&rpar; An act done through ignorance is in every case not voluntary,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 1.1 above.</note> but it is involuntary only
					when it causes the agent pain and regret: since a man who has acted <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> through ignorance and feels no compunction at all for what he has
					done, cannot indeed be said to have acted voluntarily, as he was not aware of his action,
					yet cannot be said to have acted involuntarily, as he is not sorry for it. Acts done
					through ignorance therefore fall into two classes: if the agent regrets the act, we think
					that he has acted involuntarily; if he does not regret it, to mark the distinction we may
					call him a &lsquo;non-voluntary&rsquo; agent&mdash;for as the case is
					different it is better to give it a special name. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/>Acting <emph>through</emph> ignorance however seems
					to be different from acting <emph>in</emph> ignorance; for when a man is drunk or in a
					rage, his actions are not thought to be done through ignorance but owing to one or other
					of the conditions mentioned, though he does act without knowing, and <emph>in</emph>
					ignorance. Now it is true that all wicked men are ignorant of what they ought to do and
					refrain from doing, and that this error is the cause of injustice and of vice in general.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/>But the term
					&lsquo;involuntary&rsquo; does not really apply to an action when the agent is
					ignorant of his true interests. The ignorance that makes an act blameworthy is not
					ignorance displayed in moral choice<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., choice of
						Ends: see 3.2.1 note.</note> &lpar;that sort of ignorance constitutes
					vice&rpar;&mdash;that is to say, they result not from general ignorance
					&lpar;because that is held to be blameworthy&rpar;, but from particular ignorance,
					ignorance of the circumstances of the act and of the things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Things&rsquo; seems to include persons, see example
						&lpar;3&rpar; below.</note> affected by it; <milestone n="1111a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for in this case the act is
					pitied and forgiven, because he who acts in ignorance of any of these circumstances is an
					involuntary agent.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Perhaps then it will be as well to specify the nature and number of these circumstances.
					They are &lpar;1&rpar; the agent, &lpar;2&rpar; the act,
					&lpar;3&rpar; the thing<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Things&rsquo; seems to include persons, see example
						&lpar;3&rpar; below.</note> that is affected by or is the sphere of<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">e)n ti/ni</foreign> seems to bear a
							more limited sense than <foreign lang="greek">e)n oi(=s</foreign> ll. 1, 16, 19, 24,
							which covers the circumstances of all sorts.</note> the act; and sometimes also
					&lpar;4&rpar; the instrument, for instance, a tool with which the act is done,
					&lpar;5&rpar; the effect, for instance, saving a man's life, and
					&lpar;6&rpar; the manner, for instance, gently or violently.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now no one, unless mad, could be ignorant of all these circumstances together; nor yet,
					obviously, of &lpar;l&rpar; the agent&mdash;for a man must know who he is
					himself. But a man may be ignorant of &lpar;2&rpar; what he is doing, as for
					instance when people say &lsquo;it slipped out while they were speaking,&rsquo; or
					&lsquo;they were not aware that the matter was a secret,&rsquo; as Aeschylus said
					of the Mysteries<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aeschylus was accused before the
						Areopagus of having divulged the Mysteries of Demeter in certain of his tragedies, but
						was acquitted. A phrase of his, &lsquo;It came to my mouth,&rsquo; became
						proverbial &lpar;<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 563c">Plat. Rep. 563c</bibl>, etc.&rpar;,
						and he may have used it on this occasion.</note>; or that &lsquo;they let it off
					when they only meant to show how it worked&rsquo; as the prisoner pleaded in the
					catapult case. Again &lpar;3&rpar; a person might mistake his son for an enemy, as
					Merope does<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the lost <title>Cresphontes</title> of
						Euripides.</note>; or &lpar;4&rpar; mistake a sharp spear for one with a button
					on it, or a heavy stone for a pumice-stone; or &lpar;5&rpar; one might kill a man
					by giving him medicine with the intention of saving his life; or &lpar;6&rpar; in
					loose wrestling<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A style of wrestling in which the
						adversaries only gripped each other's hands without closing.</note> hit him a blow when
					meaning only to grip his hand. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>Ignorance therefore being possible in respect of all these circumstances
					of the act, one who has acted in ignorance of any of them is held to have acted
					involuntarily, and especially so if ignorant of the most important of them; and the most
					important of the circumstances seem to be the nature of the act itself and the effect it
					will produce.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such then is the nature of the ignorance that justifies our speaking of an act as
					involuntary, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> given the further condition that the
					agent feels sorrow and regret for having committed it.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>An involuntary action being one done under compulsion or through ignorance, a voluntary
					act would seem to be an act of which the origin lies in the agent, who knows the
					particular circumstances in which he is acting. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/>For it is probably a mistake to say<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 683b">Plat. Laws 683b ff.</bibl>,
						coupled anger and appetite with ignorance as sources of wrong action.</note> that acts
					caused by anger or by desire are involuntary. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/>In the first place, &lpar;1&rpar; if we do so, we can no
					longer say that any of the lower animals act voluntarily, or children either. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="23" unit="section"/>Then &lpar;2&rpar; are
					none of our actions that are caused by desire or anger voluntary, or are the noble ones
					voluntary and the base involuntary? Surely this is an absurd distinction when one person
					is the author of both. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/>Yet perhaps it is strange to speak of acts aiming at things which it is right to aim at
					as involuntary; and it is right to feel anger at some things, and also to feel desire for
					some things, for instance health, knowledge. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="25" unit="section"/>Also &lpar;3&rpar; we think that involuntary actions are
					painful and actions that gratify desire pleasant. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/>And again &lpar;4&rpar; what difference is
					there in respect of their involuntary character between wrong acts committed deliberately
					and wrong acts done in anger? <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27" unit="section"/>Both are to be avoided; <milestone n="1111b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and also we think that the irrational feelings
					are just as much a part of human nature as the reason, so that the actions done from anger
					or desire also belong to the human being who does them. It is therefore strange to class
					these actions as involuntary.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Having defined voluntary and involuntary action, we next have to examine the nature of
					Choice.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer here examines the operation of the
						Will, which is regarded as essentially an act of choosing between alternatives of
						conduct. The technical term employed, &lsquo;choice&rsquo; or
						&lsquo;preference,&rsquo; has appeared in the formal definition of virtue
						&lpar;2.6.15&rpar;. In the present passage, cf. 2.9, it is viewed as directed to
						means: at the moment of action we select from among the alternative acts possible
						&lpar;or expressing it more loosely, among the various things here and now
						obtainable by our action&rpar; the one which we think will conduce to the end we
						wish. Elsewhere however &lpar;3.1.15 and 6.12.8&rpar; it is used of the
						selection of ends, and it is almost equivalent to &lsquo;purpose&rsquo;; while
						at 6.13.8 it includes both ends and means &lpar;see also 7.9.1&rpar;. The writer
						returns to the subject in Bk. 6.2.</note> For this appears to be intimately connected
					with virtue, and to afford a surer test of character than do our actions.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Choice is manifestly a voluntary act. But the two terms are not synonymous, the latter
					being the wider. Children and the lower animals as well as men are capable of voluntary
					action, but not of choice. Also sudden acts may be termed voluntary, but they cannot be
					said to be done by choice.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Some identify Choice with &lpar;1&rpar; Desire, or &lpar;2&rpar; Passion,
					or &lpar;3&rpar; Wish, or &lpar;4&rpar; some form of Opinion. These views
					however appear to be mistaken.</p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; The irrational animals do not exercise choice, but they do feel
					desire, and also passion. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Also a man of defective self-restraint acts from desire but not from choice; and on the
					contrary a self-restrained man acts from choice and not from desire. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Again, desire can run counter to
					choice, but not desire to desire.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., you cannot feel
						two contradictory desires at once &lpar;though you can of course desire two
						incompatible things: you may want to eat your cake and have it; but you cannot strictly
						speaking at the same time both desire to eat the cake and desire not to eat
						it&rpar;. But you can desire to do a thing and choose not to do it.</note> And
					desire has regard to an object as pleasant or painful, choice has not.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">But as good or bad.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Still less is choice the same as passion. Acts done from passion
					seem very far from being done of deliberate choice. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; Again, choice is certainly not a wish, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> though they appear closely akin. Choice cannot have for its object
					impossibilities: if a man were to say he chose something impossible he would be thought a
					fool; but we can wish for things that are impossible, for instance immortality. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Also we may wish for what cannot
					be secured by our own agency, for instance, that a particular actor<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Greek dramas were produced in competitions &lpar;and it is noteworthy
						that in the Old Comedy at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the play
						itself dramatized a contest or debate&rpar;.</note> or athlete may win; but no one
					chooses what does not rest with himself, but only what he thinks can be attained by his
					own act. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Again, we wish
					rather for ends than for means, but choose the means to our end; for example we wish to be
					healthy, but choose things to make us healthy; we wish to be happy, and that is the word
					we use in this connection, but it would not be proper to say that we choose to be happy;
					since, speaking generally, choice seems to be concerned with things within our own
					control.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;4&rpar; Nor yet again can it be opinion. It seems that anything may be
					matter of opinion&mdash;we form opinions about what is eternal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.3 and note.</note> or impossible, just as much as about what is
					within our power. Also we distinguish opinion by its truth or falsehood, not by its being
					good or bad, but choice is distinguished rather as being good or bad. <milestone n="1112a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Probably therefore nobody actually identifies choice
					with opinion in general. But neither is it the same as some particular opinion.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., an opinion or belief that so-and-so is good, and is
						within our power to obtain.</note> For it is our choice of good or evil that determines
					our character, not our opinion about good or evil. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>And we choose to take or avoid some good or evil
					thing, but we opine what a thing is, or for whom it is advantageous, or how it is so:<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps to be emended &lsquo;how it is to be
						achieved.&rsquo;</note> we do not exactly form an opinion to take or avoid a thing.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Also we praise a
					choice rather for choosing the right thing, but an opinion for opining in the right way.
					And we choose only things that we absolutely know to be good, we opine things we do not
					quite certainly know to be true. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/>Nor do the same persons appear to excel both at choosing and at forming
					opinions: some people seem to form opinions better, but yet to choose the wrong things
					from wickedness. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/>That
					choice is preceded or accompanied by the formation of an opinion is immaterial, for that
					is not the point we are considering, but whether choice is the same thing as some form of
					opinion.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>What then are the genus and differentia of Choice, inasmuch as it is not any of the
					things above mentioned? It manifestly belongs to the genus voluntary action; but not every
					voluntary act is chosen. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/>Perhaps we may define it as voluntary action preceded by deliberation, since choice
					involves reasoning and some process of thought. Indeed previous deliberation seems to be
					implied by the very term <foreign lang="xgreek">proaireton</foreign>, which denotes
					something <emph>chosen before</emph> other things.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As for Deliberation, do people deliberate about everything&mdash;are all things
					possible objects of deliberation&mdash;, or are there some things about which
					deliberation is impossible? <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The term
					&lsquo;object of deliberation&rsquo; presumably must not be taken to include
					things about which a fool or a madman might deliberate, but to mean what a sensible person
					would deliberate about.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Well then, nobody deliberates about things eternal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term includes the notion if immutability.</note> such as the order of the universe,
					or the incommensurability of the diagonal and the side, of a square. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Nor yet about things that change but
					follow a regular process, whether from necessity or by nature<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here and in 3.7 &lsquo;necessity&rsquo; denotes natural law in
						the inanimate world, while &lsquo;nature&rsquo; or &lsquo;growth&rsquo;
						means natural law as governing animate creatures. Aristotle held that these agencies,
						and with them the operation of human intelligence and art, beside their designed
						results, produced by their interplay certain by-products in the shape of undesigned and
						irregular occurrences, which are referred to in the next section. These in the natural
						world he spoke of as due to <foreign lang="greek">to\ au)to/maton</foreign>, or
						&lsquo;spontaneous&rsquo;; when due to the activity of man he ascribed them to
						fortune or chance. In 3.7 chance is made to include &lsquo;the
						spontaneous.&rsquo;</note> or through some other cause: such phenomena for instance
					as the solstices and the sunrise. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Nor about irregular occurrences, such as droughts and rains. Nor about
					the results of chance, such as finding a hidden treasure. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The reason<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the
						mss. the words &lsquo;The reason why . . . list of causes&rsquo; come after
						&lsquo;But we do not deliberate . . . <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>.&rsquo;</note> why we do not deliberate about these things is
					that none of them can be effected by our agency. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>We deliberate about things that are in our control
					and are attainable by action &lpar;which are in fact the only things that still remain
					to be considered; for Nature, Necessity, and Chance, with the addition of Intelligence and
					human agency generally, exhaust the generally accepted list of causes&rpar;. But we do
					not deliberate about all human affairs without exception either: for example, no
					Lacedaemonian deliberates about the best form of government<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, &lsquo;the best line of policy.&rsquo;</note> for <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>; but any particular set of men deliberates about
					the things attainable by their own actions. <milestone n="1112b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Also there is no room for deliberation about matters fully ascertained
					and completely formulated as sciences; such for instance as orthography, for we have no
					uncertainty as to how a word ought to be spelt. We deliberate about things in which our
					agency operates, but does not always produce uniform results; for instance about questions
					of medicine and of business; and we deliberate about navigation more than about athletic
					training, because it has been less completely reduced to a science; and similarly with
					other pursuits also. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>And
					we deliberate more about the arts<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A less well attested
						reading gives &lsquo;more about our opinions,&rsquo; and Aristotle does not
						usually distinguish sharply between the arts and crafts and the practical sciences
						&lpar;the theoretic sciences cannot here be meant, see 3.3,4&rpar;.</note> than
					about the sciences, because we are more uncertain about them.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Deliberation then is employed in matters which, though subject to rules that generally
					hold good, are uncertain in their issue; or where the issue is indeterminate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text is probably corrupt, and perhaps should be
						altered to run &lsquo;and in which the right means to take are not definitely
						determined.&rsquo;</note> and where, when the matter is important, we take others
					into our deliberations, distrusting our own capacity to decide.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And we deliberate not about ends, but about means. A doctor does not deliberate whether
					he is to cure his patient, nor an orator whether he is to convince his audience, nor a
					statesman whether he is to secure good government, nor does anyone else debate about the
					end of his profession or calling; they take some end for granted, and consider how and by
					what means it can be achieved. If they find that there are several means of achieving it,
					they proceed to consider which of these will attain it most easily and best. If there is
					only one means by which it can be accomplished, they ask how it is to be accomplished by
					that means, and by what means that means can itself be achieved, until they reach the
					first link in the chain of causes, which is the last in the order of discovery. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> &lpar;For when deliberating one seems in the procedure
					described to be pursuing an investigation or analysis that resembles the analysis of a
					figure in geometry<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is to the analytical
						method of solving a problem: the figure required to be drawn is assumed to have been
						drawn, and then we analyse it and ask what conditions it implies, until we come down to
						something that we know how to draw already.</note> &mdash;<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>indeed it appears that though not all
					investigation is deliberation, for example, mathematical investigation is not, yet all
					deliberation is investigation&mdash;and the last step in the analysis seems to be the
					first step in the execution of the design.&rpar; <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Then, if they have come up against an impossibility,
					they abandon the project&mdash;for instance, if it requires money and money cannot be
					procured; but if on the other hand it proves to be something possible, they begin to act.
					By possible, I mean able to be performed by our agency&mdash;things we do through the
					agency of our friends counting in a sense as done by ourselves, since the origin of their
					action is in us.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;In practising an art<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause seems
					implied by the context.</note>&rpar; the question is at one moment what tools to
					use, and at another how to use them; and similarly in other spheres, we have to consider
					sometimes what means to employ, and sometimes how exactly given means are to be
					employed.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It appears therefore, as has been said, that a man is the origin of his actions, and that
					the province of deliberation is to discover actions within one's own power to perform; and
					all our actions aim at ends other than themselves. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>It follows that we do not deliberate about ends, but
					about means. Nor yet do we deliberate about particular facts, <milestone n="1113a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for instance, Is this object a
					loaf? or, Is this loaf properly baked? for these are matters of direct perception.
					Deliberation must stop at the particular fact, or it will embark on a process <foreign lang="la">ad infinitum.</foreign><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The object of deliberation and the object of choice are the same, except that when a
					thing is chosen it has already been determined, since it is the thing already selected as
					the result of our deliberation that is chosen. For a man stops enquiring how he shall act
					as soon as he has carried back the origin of action to himself, and to the dominant
					part<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the intellect or reason, which chooses a
						line of action for the individual, as the Homeric monarch chose a policy for his
						kingdom.</note> of himself, for it is this part that chooses. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>This maybe illustrated by the ancient
					constitutions represented in Homer: the kings used to proclaim to the people the measures
					they had chosen to adopt.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As then the object of choice is something within our power which after deliberation we
					desire, Choice will be a deliberate desire of things in our power; for we first
					deliberate, then select, and finally fix our desire according to the result of our
					deliberation.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let this serve as a description in outline of Choice, and of the nature of its objects,
					and the fact that it deals with means to ends.<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Wishes, on the contrary, as was said above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
					2.9.</note> are for ends. But while some hold that what is wished for<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The inherent ambiguity of the Greek verbal adjective form causes some
						confusion in this chapter between what is and what ought to be wished for, the desired
						and the desirable.</note> is the good, others think it is what appears to be good.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Those however who say that what is wished for is the
					really good, are faced by the conclusion, that what a man who chooses his end wrongly
					wishes for is not really wished for at all; since if it is to be wished for, it must on
					their showing be good, whereas in the case assumed it may so happen that the man wishes
					for something bad. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And those on the other hand who say that what appears
					good is wished for, are forced to admit that there is no such thing as that which is by
					nature wished for, but that what each man thinks to be good is wished for in his case; yet
					different, and it may be opposite, things appear good to different people.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If therefore neither of these views is satisfactory, perhaps we should say that what is
					wished for in the true and unqualified sense is the good, but that what appears good to
					each person is wished for by him; and accordingly that the good man wishes for what is
					truly wished for, the bad man for anything as it may happen &lpar;just as in the case
					of our bodies, a man of sound constitution finds really healthy food best for his health,
					but some other diet may be healthy for one who is delicate; and so with things bitter<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., things really bitter, etc. seem so to a healthy man,
						but not in some cases to an invalid.</note> and sweet, hot, heavy, etc.&rpar;. For
					the good man judges everything correctly; what things truly are, that they seem to him to
					be, in every department<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in each department of
						character and conduct.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>for the noble and the pleasant have a special form
					corresponding to each of the faculties of our nature, and perhaps what chiefly
					distinguishes the good man is that he sees the truth in each kind, being himself as it
					were the standard and measure of the noble and pleasant. It appears to be pleasure that
					misleads the mass of mankind; for it seems to them to be a good, though it is not,
					<milestone n="1113b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>so they choose what is pleasant as good and shun pain as
					evil.<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If then whereas we wish for our end, the means to our end are matters of deliberation and
					choice, it follows that actions dealing with these means are done by choice, and
					voluntary. But the activities in which the virtues are exercised deal with means.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Therefore virtue also depends on ourselves. And so also
					does vice. For where we are free to act we are also free to refrain from acting, and where
					we are able to say No we are also able to say Yes; if therefore we are responsible for
					doing a thing when to do it is right, we are also responsible for not doing it when not to
					do it is wrong, and if we are responsible for rightly not doing a thing, we are also
					responsible for wrongly doing it. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But if it is in our
					power to do and to refrain from doing right and wrong, and if, as we saw,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.11.</note> being good or bad is doing right or wrong, it
					consequently depends on us whether we are virtuous or vicious. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>To say that <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">

					asserted, and say that man is not the originator and begetter of his actions as he is of
					his children. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But if it is manifest that a man is the

					trace our conduct back to many other origins than those within ourselves, then actions of
					which the origins are within us, themselves depend upon us, and are voluntary.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This conclusion seems to be attested both by men's behavior in private life and by the
					practice of lawgivers; for they punish and exact redress from those who do evil
					&lpar;except when it is done under compulsion, or through ignorance for which the
					agent himself is not responsible&rpar;, and honor those who do noble deeds, in order
					to encourage the one sort and to repress the other; but nobody tries to encourage us to do
					things that do not depend upon ourselves and are not voluntary, since it is no good our
					being persuaded not to feel heat or pain or hunger or the like, because we shall feel them
					all the same.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Indeed the fact that an offence was committed in ignorance is itself made a ground for
					punishment, in cases where the offender is held to be responsible for his ignorance; for
					instance, the penalty is doubled if the offender was drunk,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">An enactment of Pittacus, tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Mitylene">Mitylene</placeName>, <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1274b.19">Aristot. Pol. 1274b
						19</bibl>.</note> because the origin of the offence was in the man himself, as he might
					have avoided getting drunk, which was the cause of his not knowing what he was doing. Also
					men are punished for offences committed through ignorance of some provision of the law
					which they ought to have known, <milestone n="1114a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and might have known without difficulty; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>and so in other cases where ignorance is held to be due to negligence,
					on the ground that the offender need not have been ignorant, as he could have taken the
					trouble to ascertain the facts.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It may be objected that perhaps he is not the sort of man to take the trouble. Well, but
					men are themselves responsible for having become careless through living carelessly, as
					they are for being unjust or profligate if they do wrong or pass their time in drinking
					and dissipation. They acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular
					way. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>This is shown by the way in which men train
					themselves for some contest or pursuit: they practice continually. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Therefore only an utterly senseless person can fail to know that our
					characters are the result of our conduct;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words,
						&lsquo;but if a man . . . unjust&rsquo; in the mss. come after 5.13,
						&lsquo;unjust or dissolute.&rsquo;</note> but if a man knowingly acts in a way
					that will result in his becoming unjust, he must be said to be voluntarily
					unjust.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, though it is unreasonable to say that a man who acts unjustly or dissolutely does
					not wish to be unjust or dissolute, <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>nevertheless this by
					no means implies that he can stop being unjust and become just merely by wishing to do so;
					any more than a sick man can get well by wishing, although it may be the case that his
					illness is voluntary, in the sense of being due to intemperate living and neglect of the
					doctors' advice. At the outset then, it is true, he might have avoided the illness, but
					once he has let himself go he can do so no longer. When you have thrown a stone, you
					cannot afterwards bring it back again, but nevertheless you are responsible for having
					taken up the stone and flung it, for the origin of the act was within you. Similarly the
					unjust <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and profligate might at the outset have
					avoided becoming so, and therefore they are so voluntarily, although having become unjust
					and profligate it is no longer open to them not to be so.<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And not only are vices of the soul voluntary, but in some cases bodily defects are so as
					well, and we blame them accordingly. Though no one blames a man for being born ugly, we
					censure uncomeliness that is due to neglecting exercise and the care of the person. And so
					with infirmities and mutilations: though nobody would reproach, but rather pity, a person
					blind from birth, or owing to disease or accident, yet all would blame one who had lost
					his sight from tippling or debauchery. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>We see then that
					bodily defects for which we are ourselves responsible are blamed, while those for which we
					are not responsible are not. This being so, it follows that we are responsible for
					blameworthy moral defects also.<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But suppose somebody says: &ldquo;All men seek what seems to them good, but they are
					not responsible for its seeming good: <milestone n="1114b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>each man's conception of his end is determined by his
					character, whatever that may be. Although therefore, on the hypothesis<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This is Aristotle's view, which the imaginary objector challenges. It is
						not quite certain that his objection is meant to go as far as the point indicated by the
						inverted commas.</note> that each man is in a sense responsible for his moral
					disposition, he will in a sense be responsible for his conception of the good, if on the
					contrary this hypothesis be untrue, no man is responsible for his own wrongdoing. He does
					wrong through ignorance of the right end, thinking that wrongdoing will procure him his
					greatest Good; and his aim at his end<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the end he
						aims at.</note> is not of his own choosing. A man needs to be born with moral vision, so
					to speak, whereby to discern correctly and choose what is truly good. A man of good
					natural disposition is a man well endowed by nature in this respect; for if a thing is the
					greatest and noblest of gifts, and is something which cannot be acquired or learnt from
					another, but which a man will possess in such form as it has been bestowed on him at
					birth, a good and noble natural endowment in this respect will constitute a good
					disposition in the full and true meaning of the term.&rdquo;<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now if this theory be true, how will virtue be voluntary any more than vice? Both for the
					good man and the bad man alike, their view of their end is determined in the same manner,
					by nature or however it may be; and all their actions of whatever sort are guided by
					reference to their end as thus determined. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>Whether then
					a man's view of his end, whatever it may be, is not given by nature but is partly due to
					himself, or whether, although his end is determined by nature, yet virtue is voluntary
					because the good man's actions to gain his end are voluntary, in either case <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> vice will be just as much voluntary as virtue; for the bad
					man equally with the good possesses spontaneity in his actions, even if not in his choice
					of an end. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>If then, as is said, our virtues are
					voluntary &lpar;and in fact we are in a sense ourselves partly the cause of our moral
					dispositions, and it is our having a certain character that makes us set up an end of a
					certain kind&rpar;, it follows that our vices are voluntary also; they are voluntary
					in the same manner as our virtues.<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have then now discussed in outline the virtues in general, having indicated their
					genus &lsqb;namely, that it is a mean, and a disposition<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause looks like an interpolation: <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> is the <foreign lang="xgreek">genus</foreign> of virtue, Bk. 2.5 fin.,
						6 init., <foreign lang="greek">meso/ths</foreign> its <foreign lang="la">differentia</foreign>, 2.6.5,17.</note>&rsqb; and having shown that they render us
					apt to do the same actions as those by which they are produced,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 2.2.8.</note> and to do them in the way in which right reason may
					enjoin<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 2.2.2. This clause in the mss. follows the
						next one.</note>; and that they depend on ourselves and are voluntary.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 5.2 and 20.</note><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This section some editors place before 5.21, but it is rather a footnote to 5.14; and
							the opening words of 5.23 imply that a digression has been made.</note>
					<milestone n="22" unit="section"/>But our dispositions are not voluntary in the same way
					as are our actions. Our actions we can control from beginning to end, and we are
					conscious, of them at each stage.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">ta\ kaq' e(/kasta</foreign> seems to bear a somewhat different sense here from 1.15,
						<foreign lang="greek">h( kaq' e(/kasta</foreign> &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">a)/gnoia</foreign>&rpar;.</note> With our dispositions on the other hand, though
					we can control their beginnings, <milestone n="1115a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>each separate addition to them is imperceptible, as is the case with
					the growth of a disease; though they are voluntary in that we were free to employ our
					capacities in the one way or the other.<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But to resume, let us now discuss the virtues severally, defining the nature of each, the
					class of objects to which it is related, and the way in which it is related to them. In so
					doing we shall also make it clear how many virtues there are.<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let us first take Courage. We have already seen<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.7.2.</note> that Courage is the observance of the mean in respect of fear and
					confidence. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now it is clear that the things we fear are
					fearful things, which means, broadly speaking, evil things; so that fear is sometimes
					defined as the anticipation of evil. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>It is true then that
					we fear all evil things, for example, disgrace, poverty, disease, lack of friends, death;
					but it is not thought that Courage is related to all these things, for there are some
					evils which it is right and noble to fear and base not to fear, for instance, disgrace.
					One who fears disgrace is an honorable man, with a due sense of shame; one who does not
					fear it is shameless: though some people apply the term courageous to such a man by
					analogy, because he bears some resemblance to the courageous man in that the courageous
					man also is a fearless person.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, it is no doubt right not to fear poverty, disease, or in general any evil not
					caused by vice and not due to ourselves. But one who is fearless in regard to these things
					is not courageous either &lpar;although the term is applied to him, too, by
					analogy&rpar;; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> since some men who are cowards
					in war are liberal with money, and face loss of fortune boldly.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nor yet is a man cowardly if he fears insult to his wife and children, or envy, or the
					like; nor courageous if he shows a bold face when about to undergo a flogging.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>What then are the fearful things in respect of which Courage is displayed? I suppose
					those which are the greatest, since there is no one more brave in enduring danger than the
					courageous man. Now the most terrible thing of all is death; for it is the end, and when a
					man is dead, nothing, we think, either good or evil can befall him any more. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But even death, we should hold, does not in all circumstances give
					an opportunity for Courage: for instance we do not call a man courageous for facing death
					by drowning or disease. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>What form of death then is a test
					of Courage? Presumably that which is the noblest. Now the noblest form of death is death
					in battle, for it is encountered in the midst of the greatest and most noble of dangers.
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>And this conclusion is borne out by the principle on
					which public honors are bestowed in republics and under monarchies.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The courageous man, therefore, in the proper sense of the term, will be he who fearlessly
					confronts a noble death, or some sudden<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps
						&lsquo;imminent,&rsquo; but cf. 8.15.</note> peril that threatens death; and the
					perils of war answer this description most fully. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Not
					that the courageous man is not also fearless in a storm at sea &lpar;as also in
					illness&rpar;, <milestone n="1115b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>though not in the same way as sailors are fearless, for he thinks
					there is no hope of safety, and to die by drowning is revolting to him,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., he resents it as inglorious.</note> whereas sailors
					keep up heart because of their experience. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Also Courage
					is shown in dangers where a man can defend himself by valor or die nobly, but neither is
					possible in disasters like shipwreck.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now although the same things are not fearful to everybody, there are some terrors which
					we pronounce beyond human endurance, and these of course are fearful to everyone in his
					senses. And the terrors that man can endure differ in magnitude and degree; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>as also do the situations inspiring confidence.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In using <foreign lang="greek">ta\ qarrale/a</foreign> as
						the opposite of <foreign lang="greek">ta\ fobera/</foreign> Aristotle follows Plato,
						<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 450e">Plat. Rep. 450e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 359c">Plat.
							Prot. 359c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Lach. 195b">Plat. Lach. 195b</bibl>, etc.: but he is
						original in distinguishing confidence as regards the former from fearlessness as regards
						the latter, and so considering excessive fearlessness in grave dangers as a different
						vice from excessive confidence in dangers not really formidable.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the courageous man is proof against fear so far as
					man may be. Hence although he will sometimes fear even terrors not beyond man's endurance,
					he will do so in the right way, and he will endure them as principle dictates, for the
					sake of what is noble<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the rightness and fineness
						of the act itself, cf. 7.13; 8.5,14; 9.4; and see note on 1.3.2. This amplification of
						the conception of virtue as aiming at the mean here appears for the first time: we now
						have the final as well as the formal cause of virtuous action.</note>; for that is the
					end at which virtue aims. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>On the other hand it is
					possible to fear such terrors too much, and too little; and also to fear things that are
					not fearful as if they were fearful. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Error arises either
					from fearing what one ought not to fear, or from fearing in the wrong manner, or at the
					wrong time, or the like; and similarly with regard to occasions for confidence.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The courageous man then is he that endures or fears the right things and for the right
					purpose and in the right manner and at the right time, and who shows confidence in a
					similar way. &lpar;For the courageous man feels and acts as the circumstances merit,
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and as principle may dictate. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And every activity aims at the end that corresponds to the disposition
					of which it is the manifestation. So it is therefore with the activity of the courageous
					man: his courage is noble; therefore its end is nobility, for a thing is defined by its
					end; therefore the courageous man endures the terrors and dares the deeds that manifest
					courage, for the sake of that which is noble.&rpar;<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Of the characters that run to excess, on the other hand, he who exceeds in fearlessness
					has no name &lpar;this, as we remarked before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.7.2.</note> is the case with many qualities&rpar;, but we should call a man mad,
					or else insensitive to pain, if he feared nothing, &lsquo;earthquake nor
					billows,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently a verse quotation. Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 3.1229b.28">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1229b 28</bibl>,
						&lsquo;As the Kelts take up arms and march against the waves&rsquo;; and <bibl n="Strab. 7.2.1">Strab. 7.2.1</bibl> gives similar stories, partly on the authority of
						the fourth-century historian Ephorus. An echo survives in
						Shakespeare's simile &lsquo;to take arms against a sea of
						troubles.&rsquo;</note> as they say of the Kelts; he who exceeds in confidence
					&lsqb;in the face of fearful things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words
						seem to be an interpolation: confidence is shown in face of <foreign lang="greek">qarrale/a</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">fobera/</foreign>.</note>&rsqb; is
					rash. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>The rash man is generally thought to be an
					impostor, who pretends to courage which he does not possess; at least, he wishes to appear
					to feel towards fearful things as the courageous man actually does feel, and therefore he
					imitates him in the things in which he can.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.,
						<foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s qarrale/ois</foreign>, in situations not really
						formidable.</note>
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Hence most rash men really are cowards at heart, for they
					make a bold show in situations that inspire confidence, but do not endure
					terrors.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>He that exceeds in fear<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For symmetry this should have
					been &lsquo;he that is deficient in fearlessness.&rsquo;</note> is a coward, for
					he fears the wrong things, and in the wrong manner, and soon with the rest of the list.
					<milestone n="1116a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>He is also
					deficient in confidence; but his excessive fear in face of pain is more apparent.
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/>The coward is therefore a despondent person, being
					afraid of everything; but the courageous man is just the opposite, for confidence belongs
					to a sanguine temperament.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The coward, the rash man, and the courageous man are therefore concerned with the same
					objects, but are differently disposed towards them: the two former exceed and fall short,
					the last keeps the mean and the right disposition. The rash, moreover, are impetuous, and
					though eager before the danger comes they hang back at the critical moment; whereas the
					courageous are keen at the time of action but calm beforehand.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As has been said then, Courage is the observance of the mean in relation to things that
					inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances stated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.10.</note>; and it is confident and endures<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The mss. have &lsquo;it chooses and endures.&rsquo;</note> because it is noble
					to do so or base not to do so. But to seek death in order to escape from poverty, or the
					pangs of love, or from pain or sorrow, is not the act of a courageous man, but rather of a
					coward; for it is weakness to fly from troubles, and the suicide does not endure death
					because it is noble to do so, but to escape evil.<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such is the nature of Courage; but the name is also applied to five divergent types of
					character.</p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; First, as most closely resembling true Courage comes the citizen's
					courage.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Political courage&rsquo;:
						Plato uses this phrase &lpar;<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 430c">Plat. Rep.
							430c</bibl>&rpar; of patriotic courage, based on training and &lsquo;right
						opinion about what is terrible and what is not,&rsquo; and in contrast with the
						undisciplined courage of slaves and brute beasts. Elsewhere, on the other hand, he
						contrasts &lsquo;popular and citizen virtue&rsquo; in general with the
						philosopher's virtue, which is based on knowledge.</note> Citizen troops appear to
					endure dangers because of the legal penalties and the reproach attaching to cowardice, and
					the honors awarded to bravery; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> hence those races
					appear to be the bravest among which cowards are degraded and brave men held in honor.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It is this citizen courage which inspires the heroes
					portrayed by Homer, like Diomede and Hector: <quote>
						<lg type="free">
							<l>Polydamas will be the first to flout me;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.100">Hom. Il. 22.100</bibl> &lpar;
								Hector&rpar;&mdash;&lsquo;Alas, should
								I retire within the gates, Polydamas, . . .&rsquo;</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> and Diomede says <quote>
						<lg type="free">
							<l>Hector will make his boast at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> hereafter:</l>
							<l>&ldquo;By me was Tydeus' son . . .&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.148">Hom. Il.
								8.148</bibl>&mdash;&lsquo;By me was Tydeus's son routed in flight Back to
								the ships.&rsquo;</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This type of courage most closely resembles the one described before, because it is
					prompted by a virtue, namely the sense of shame,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For
						this emotion see 2.7.14, 4.9.1, where it is said not to be, strictly speaking, a
						virtue.</note> and by the desire for something noble, namely honor, and the wish to avoid
					the disgrace of being reproached.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The courage of troops forced into battle by their officers may be classed as of the same
					type, though they are inferior inasmuch as their motive is not a sense of shame but fear,
					and the desire to avoid not disgrace but pain. Their masters compel them to be brave,
					after Hector's fashion: <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>Let me see any skulking off the field&mdash;</l>
							<l>He shall not save his carcase from the dogs!<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.391">Hom. Il. 2.391</bibl>, but the words are Agamemnon's,
								and are slightly different in our Homer.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The same is done by commanders who draw up their troops in front of them and beat them if
					they give ground, <milestone n="1116b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>or who form them in line with a trench or some other obstacle in the
					rear; all these are using compulsion. A man ought not to be brave because he is compelled
					to be, but because courage is noble.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Again, experience of some particular form of danger is taken for a
					sort of Courage; hence arose Socrates' notion
					that Courage is Knowledge.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., knowledge of what is
						truly formidable and what is not &lpar;cf. note on 8.1&rpar;; but
						Socrates went on to show that this depended on knowledge
						of the good, with which he identified all virtue: see Plato's
						<title>Laches</title>.</note> This type of bravery is displayed in various circumstances,
					and particularly in war by professional soldiers.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.,
						<foreign lang="greek">ce/noi</foreign>, foreign mercenary troops, much employed in
						Greek warfare in Aristotle's time.</note> For
					war &lpar;as the saying is&rpar; is full of false alarms, a fact which these men
					have had most opportunity of observing; thus they appear courageous owing to others'
					ignorance of the true situation. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Also experience renders
					them the most efficient in inflicting loss on the enemy without sustaining it themselves,
					as they are skilled in the use of arms, and equipped with the best ones both for attack
					and defence. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>So that they are like armed men fighting
					against unarmed, or trained athletes against amateurs; for even in athletic contests it is
					not the bravest men who are the best fighters, but those who are strongest and in the best
					training. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But professional soldiers prove cowards when
					the danger imposes too great a strain, and when they are at a disadvantage in numbers and
					equipment; for they are the first to run away, while citizen troops stand their ground and
					die fighting, as happened in the battle at the temple of Hermes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>, <date value="-353">353</date> B.C.; the Acropolis had been seized by Onomarchus the Phocian, and
						mercenaries, brought in by the Boeotarchs to aid the citizens, ran away at the beginning
						of the battle &lpar;schol.&rpar;.</note> This is because citizens think it
					disgraceful to run away, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and prefer death to safety
					so procured; whereas professional soldiers were relying from the outset on superior
					strength, and when they discover they are outnumbered they take to flight, fearing death
					more than disgrace. But this is not true courage.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; Spirit or anger<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> means both &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; or
					&lsquo;high spirit&rsquo; and also its manifestation in anger.</note> is also
					classed with Courage. Men emboldened by anger, like wild beasts which rush upon the hunter
					that has wounded them, are supposed to be courageous, because the courageous also are
					high-spirited; for spirit is very impetuous in encountering danger. Hence Homer
					writes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in describing courageous men, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.151">Hom. Il. 14.151</bibl> or <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.529">Hom. Il.
						16.529</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.470">Hom. Il.5.470</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.318">Hom. Od. 24.318</bibl>. The fourth phrase is not in our Homer, but occurs in <bibl n="Theoc. 20">Theocritus 20.15</bibl>.</note> &lsquo;he put strength in
					their spirit,&rsquo; and &lsquo;roused their might and their spirit,&rsquo;
					and &lsquo;bitter wrath up through his nostrils welled,&rsquo; and &lsquo;his
					blood boiled&rsquo;; for all such symptoms seem to indicate an excitement and impulse
					of the spirit. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Thus the real motive of courageous men is
					the nobility of courage, although spirit operates in them as well; but wild animals are
					emboldened by pain, for they turn to bay because they are wounded, or
					frightened&mdash;since if they are in a forest or a swamp<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in a place where they can escape. The words &lsquo;or a
						swamp,&rsquo; are probably interpolated.</note> they do not attack. Therefore they
					are not to be considered courageous for rushing upon danger when spurred by pain and
					anger, and blind to the dangers that await them; since on that reckoning even asses would
					be brave, when they are hungry, for no blows will make them stop grazing!<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.558">Hom. Il. 11.558</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="1117a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>&lpar;And adulterers also are led to do many daring things by lust.&rpar;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthetical note does not bear on the context.</note>
					<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence should apparently come at the end of
					the section, &lsquo;but&rsquo; being amended to
					&lsquo;for.&rsquo;</note> the form of courage that is inspired by spirit seems to
					be the most natural, and when reinforced by deliberate choice and purpose it appears to be
					true Courage. And human beings also feel pain when angry, and take pleasure in revenge.
					But those who fight for these motives, though valiant fighters, are not courageous; for
					the motive of their confidence is not honor, nor is it guided by principle, but it springs
					from feeling. However, they show some affinity to true Courage.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;4&rpar; Nor yet again is the boldness of the sanguine the same thing as
					Courage. The sanguine are confident in face of danger because they have won many victories
					over many foes before. They resemble the courageous, because both are confident, but
					whereas the courageous are confident for the reasons already explained,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 7.2-6</note> the sanguine are so because they think
					they are stronger than the enemy, and not likely told come to any harm. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>&lpar;A similar boldness is shown by men who get drunk, for this
					makes them sanguine for the time being.&rpar; When however things do not turn out as
					they expect, the merely sanguine run away, whereas the mark of the courageous man, as we
					have seen,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 7.2-6.</note> is to endure things that
					are terrible to a human being and that seem so to him, because it is noble to do so and
					base not to do so. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Hence it is thought a sign of still
					greater courage to be fearless and undismayed in sudden alarms than in dangers that were
					foreseen. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Bravery in unforeseen danger springs more
					from character, as there is less time for preparation; one might resolve to face a danger
					one can foresee, from calculation and on principle, but only a fixed disposition of
					Courage will enable one to face sudden peril.<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;5&rpar; Those who face danger in ignorance also appear courageous; and they
					come very near to those whose bravery rests on a sanguine temperament, though inferior to
					them inasmuch as they lack self-confidence, which the sanguine possess. Hence the sanguine
					stand firm for a time; whereas those who have been deceived as to the danger, if they
					learn or suspect the true state of affairs, take to flight, as the Argives did when they
					encountered the Lacedaemonians and thought they were Sicyonians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This occurred in the battle at the Long Walls of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, <date value="-392">392</date> B.C.

					<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have now described the characteristics both of the courageous and of those who are
					thought to be courageous.<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Courage is displayed with respect to confidence and fear, but not with respect to both
					equally: it is more particularly displayed in regard to objects of fear; for one who is
					unperturbed in the presence of terrors and comports himself rightly towards these is
					courageous in a fuller sense than one who does so in situations that inspire confidence.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In fact, as has been said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4.4.</note> men are sometimes called courageous for enduring pain.
					Hence Courage itself is painful; and it is justly praised, because it is harder to endure
					pain than to abstain from pleasure. <milestone n="1117b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Not but what it would appear
					that the end corresponding<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 7.6.</note> to the
					virtue of Courage is really pleasant, only its pleasantness is obscured by the attendant
					circumstances. This is illustrated by the case of athletic contests: to boxers, for
					example, their end&mdash;the object they box for, the wreath and the honors of
					victory&mdash;is pleasant, but the blows they receive must hurt them, being men of
					flesh and blood, and all the labor of training is painful; and these painful incidentals
					are so numerous that the final object, being a small thing, appears not to contain any
					pleasure at all. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>If then the same is true of Courage, the
					death or wounds that it may bring will be painful to the courageous man, and he will
					suffer them unwillingly; but he will endure them because it is noble to do so, or because
					it is base not to do so. And the more complete his virtue, and the fuller the happiness he
					has attained, the more pain will death cause him; for to such a man life is worth most,
					and he stands to lose the greatest goods, and knows that this is so, and this must be
					painful. But he is none the less courageous on that account, perhaps indeed he is more so,
					because he prefers glory in war to the greatest prizes of life.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is not true therefore of every virtue that its active exercise is essentially
					pleasant, save in so far as it attains its end.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						qualifies what was said in 2.3.1.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>No doubt it is possible that such men as these do not make the best professional
					soldiers, but men who are less courageous, and have nothing of value besides life to lose;
					for these face danger readily, and <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> will barter
					their lives for trifling gains.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let this suffice as an account of Courage: from what has been said it will not be
					difficult to form at all events a rough conception of its nature.<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>After Courage let us speak of Temperance; for these appear to be the virtues of the
					irrational parts of the soul.</p>
				<p>Now we have said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.7.3.</note> that Temperance is the
					observance of the mean in relation to pleasures &lpar;for it is concerned only in a
					lesser degree and in a different way with pains&rpar;; and Profligacy also is
					displayed in the same matters. Let us then now define the sort of pleasures to which these
					qualities are related.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now we must make a distinction between pleasures of the body and pleasures of the soul:
					Take for instance ambition, or love of learning: the lover of honor or of learning takes
					pleasure in the thing he loves without his body being affected at all; the experience is
					purely mental. But we do not speak of men as either temperate or profligate in relation to
					the pleasures of ambition and of learning. Nor similarly can these terms be applied to the
					enjoyment of any of the other pleasures that are not bodily pleasures: those who love
					hearing marvellous tales and telling anecdotes, and who spend their days in trivial
					gossip, we call idle chatterers, but not profligates; <milestone n="1118a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>nor do we call men profligate
					who feel excessive pain for the loss of fortune or friends. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Temperance therefore has to do with the pleasures of the body. But not with all even of
					these; for men who delight in the pleasures of the eye, in colors, forms and paintings,
					are not termed either temperate or profligate, although it would be held that these things
					also can be enjoyed in the right manner, or too much, or too little. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Similarly with the objects of hearing: no one would term profligate
					those who take an excessive pleasure in music, or the theater, nor temperate those who
					enjoy them as is right. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Nor yet does Temperance apply to
					enjoyment of the sense of smell, unless accidentally<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., by association.</note>; we do not call those who are fond of the scent of fruit
					or robes or incense profligate, though we may be inclined so to style those who love
					perfumes and the smell of savory dishes, for the profligate take pleasure in these odors
					because they remind them of the objects of their desires. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>One may notice that other persons too like the smell of food when they are hungry; but
					to delight in things of this kind is a mark of the profligate, since they are the things
					on which the profligate's desires are set.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text
						here is doubtful, and possibly the whole of 10.6 is an interpolation.</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nor do the lower animals derive any pleasure from these senses, except accidentally.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., by association.</note> Hounds do not take pleasure
					in scenting hares, but in eating them; the scent merely made them aware of the hare.
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> The lion does not care about the lowing of the
					ox, but about devouring it, though the lowing tells him that the ox is near, and
					consequently he appears to take pleasure in the sound. Similarly he is not pleased by the
					sight of &lsquo;or stag or mountain goat,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.24">Hom. Il. 3.24</bibl>
					</note> but by the prospect of a meal.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Temperance and Profligacy are therefore concerned with those pleasures which man shares
					with the lower animals, and which consequently appear slavish and bestial. These are the
					pleasures of touch and taste. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But even taste appears to
					play but a small part, if any, in Temperance. For taste is concerned with discriminating
					flavors, as is done by wine-tasters, and cooks preparing savory dishes; but it is not
					exactly the flavors that give pleasure, or at all events not to the profligate: it is
					actually enjoying the object that is pleasant, and this is done solely through the sense
					of touch, alike in eating and drinking and in what are called the pleasures of sex.
					<milestone n="10" unit="section"/>This is why a certain gourmand<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently a character of comedy, though later writers speak of him as a
						real person. Some mss. here insert his name, &lsquo;Hospitable, the son of
						Belch,&rsquo; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 3.1231a.16">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1231a
							16</bibl>, where the story recurs, and <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 934">Aristoph. Frogs
								934</bibl>.</note> wished that his throat might be longer than a crane's, showing that
					his pleasure lay in the sensation of contact. <milestone n="1118b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence the sense to which Profligacy is related is the most universal of the senses; and
					there appears to be good ground for the disrepute in which it is held, because it belongs
					to us not as human beings but as animals. Therefore it is bestial to revel in such
					pleasures, and to like them better than any others. We do not refer to the most refined of
					the pleasures of touch, such as the enjoyment of friction and warm baths in the gymnasia;
					the tactual pleasures of the profligate have to do with certain parts only, not with the
					whole of the body.<milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Desires seem to be of two kinds, one common to all men, the other peculiar to special
					peoples, and adventitious. For instance, the desire for food is natural, since everyone
					desires solid or liquid nourishment, and sometimes both, when in need of them; and also
					sexual intercourse, as Homer says,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A reminiscence of
						<bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.130">Hom. Il. 24.130</bibl>.</note> when young and lusty. But not
					everybody desires this or that particular sort of nourishment, any more than everyone
					desires the same particular portion of food;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text
						should perhaps be amended to run &lsquo;nor desires the same food
						always.&rsquo;</note> hence a taste for this or that sort of food seems to be an
					individual peculiarity. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Not but what there is also
					something natural in such tastes; for different things are pleasant to different people,
					and there are some special delicacies which all men like better than ordinary food.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Preferences are natural because &lpar;1&rpar;
						men's natures vary and therefore their tastes vary, &lpar;2&rpar; some
						preferences are universal.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In the case of the natural desires, then, few men err, and in one way only, that of
					excess in quantity; for to eat or drink to repletion of ordinary food and drink is to
					exceed what is natural in amount, since the natural desire is only to satisfy one's wants.
					Hence people who over-eat are called &lsquo;mad-bellies,&rsquo; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> meaning that they fill that organ beyond the right measure; it is
					persons of especially slavish nature that are liable to this form of excess.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But in regard to the pleasures peculiar to particular people, many men err, and err in
					many ways. For when people are said to be &lsquo;very fond of&rsquo; so-and-so, it
					is either because they like things that it is not right to like, or like them more than
					most people do, or like them in a wrong manner; and the profligate exceed in all these
					ways. For they like some things that are wrong, and indeed abominable, and any such things
					that it is right to like they like more than is right, and more than most
					people.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is clear then that excess in relation to pleasures is Profligacy, and that it is
					blameworthy. As regards pains on the other hand, it is not with Temperance as it is with
					Courage: a man is not termed temperate for enduring pain and profligate for not enduring
					it, but profligate for feeling more pain than is right when he fails to get pleasures
					&lpar;in his case pleasure actually causing pain&rpar;, and temperate for not
					feeling pain at the absence of pleasure &lsqb;or at abstaining from it&rsqb;.
					<milestone n="1119a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The profligate therefore desires all pleasures, or those that are the most pleasant, and
					is led by his desire to pursue these in preference to everything else. He consequently
					feels pain not only when he fails to get them, but also from his desire for them, since
					desire is accompanied by pain; paradoxical though it seems that pain should be caused by
					pleasure.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Men erring on the side of deficiency as regards pleasures, and taking less than a proper
					amount of enjoyment in them, scarcely occur; such insensibility is not human. Indeed, even
					the lower animals discriminate in food, and like some kinds and not others; and if there
					be a creature that finds nothing pleasant, and sees no difference between one thing and
					another, it must be very far removed from humanity. As men of this type scarcely occur, we
					have no special name for them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The temperate man keeps a middle course in these matters. He takes no pleasure at all in
					the things that the profligate enjoys most, on the contrary, he positively dislikes them;
					nor in general does he find pleasure in wrong things, nor excessive pleasure in anything
					of this sort; nor does he feel pain or desire when they are lacking, or only in a moderate
					degree, not more than is right, nor at the wrong time, <foreign lang="la">et
						cetera.</foreign> But such pleasures as conduce to health and fitness he will try to
					obtain in a moderate and right degree; as also other pleasures so far as they are not
					detrimental to health and fitness, and not ignoble, nor beyond his means. The man who
					exceeds these limits cares more for such pleasures than they are worth. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Not so the temperate man; he only cares for them as right principle
					enjoins.<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Profligacy seems to be more voluntary than Cowardice. For the former is caused by
					pleasure, the latter by pain, and pleasure is a thing we choose, pain a thing we avoid.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Also pain makes us beside ourselves: it destroys the
					sufferer's nature; whereas pleasure has no such effect. Therefore Profligacy is the more
					voluntary vice. And consequently it is the more reprehensible; since moreover it is easier
					to train oneself to resist the temptations of pleasure, because these occur frequently in
					life, and to practise resistance to them involves no danger, whereas the reverse is the
					case with the objects of fear.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>On the other hand, the possession of a cowardly character would seem to be more voluntary
					than particular manifestations of cowardice: for cowardliness in itself is not painful,
					but particular accesses of cowardice are so painful as to make a man beside himself, and
					cause him to throw away his arms or otherwise behave in an unseemly manner; so that
					cowardly actions actually seem to be done under compulsion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But with the profligate on the contrary the particular acts are
					voluntary, for they are done with desire and appetite, but the character in general is
					less so, since no one desires to be a profligate.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The word Profligacy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign>, literally &lsquo;the result of not being punished,&rsquo;
					seems to have been used of spoiled children as well as of vicious adults.</note> or
					wantonness we also apply to the naughtiness of children, <milestone n="1119b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>which has some resemblance to
					the licentiousness of adults. Which of the two takes its name from the other is of no
					importance for the present enquiry, but it would seem clear that the state which comes
					later in life must be named from the one which comes earlier. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The metaphor appears apt enough, since it is that which desires what is
					disgraceful and whose appetites grow apace that needs chastisement or pruning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The primary meaning of <foreign lang="greek">kola/zein</foreign>, &lsquo;to punish.&rsquo;</note> and this description
					applies in the fullest degree to desire, as it does to the child. For children, like
					profligates, live at the prompting of desire; and the appetite for pleasure is strongest
					in childhood, so that if it be not disciplined and made obedient to authority, it will
					make great headway. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>In an irrational being the appetite
					for pleasure is insatiable and undiscriminating, and the innate tendency is fostered by
					active gratification; indeed, if such gratification be great and intense it actually
					overpowers the reason. Hence our indulgences should be moderate and few, and never opposed
					to principle&mdash;<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>this is what we mean by
					&lsquo;well-disciplined&rsquo; and &lsquo;chastened&mdash;; and the
					appetitive part of us should be ruled by principle, just as a boy should live in obedience
					to his tutor. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Hence in the temperate man the appetitive
					element must be in harmony with principle. For &lpar;1&rpar; the aim of both
					Temperance and principle is that which is noble; and &lpar;2&rpar; the temperate
					man desires the right thing in the right way at the right time, which is what principle
					ordains.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>

				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>Next let us speak of Liberality. This virtue seems to be the observance of the mean in
					relation to wealth: we praise a man as liberal not in war, nor in matters in which we
					praise him as temperate nor in judicial decisions, but in relation to giving and
					getting<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word <foreign lang="greek">lamba/nein</foreign>, the antithesis of &lsquo;give,&rsquo; varies in meaning
						with the context between &lsquo;get,&rsquo; &lsquo;receive&rsquo; and
						&lsquo;take.&rsquo;</note> wealth, and especially in giving; wealth meaning all
					those things whose value is measured by money.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Prodigality and Meanness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 2.7.4.</note> on
					the other hand are both of them modes of excess and of deficiency in relation to wealth.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Meanness is always
					applied to those who care more than is proper about wealth, but Prodigality is sometimes
					used with a wider connotation, <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>since we call the unrestrained and those who squander money on
					debauchery prodigal; and therefore prodigality is thought to be extremely wicked, because
					it is a combination of vices. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But this is not the proper application of the word: really it denotes
					the possessor of one particular vice, <milestone n="1120a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>that of wasting one's substance; for he who is ruined by his
					own agency is a hopeless case indeed,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">a)/swtos</foreign>, &lsquo;prodigal,&rsquo; means literally
						&lsquo;not saved,&rsquo; &lsquo;in desperate case.&rsquo;</note> and to
					waste one's substance seems to be in a way to ruin oneself, inasmuch as wealth is the
					means of life. This then is the sense in which the term Prodigality is here
					understood.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now riches are an article of use; but articles of use can be used either well or ill, and
					he who uses a thing best is he who possesses the virtue related to that thing; therefore
					that man will use riches best who possesses the virtue related to wealth; and this is the
					liberal man. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But the use
					of wealth seems to consist in spending and in giving; getting wealth and keeping it are
					modes of acquisition rather than of use. Hence the liberal man is more concerned with
					giving to the right recipients than with getting wealth from the right sources and not
					getting it from the wrong ones. Virtue is displayed in doing good rather than in having
					good done to one, and in performing noble acts rather than in avoiding base ones;
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>but manifestly doing
					good and acting nobly go with giving, while having good done to one and avoiding base
					actions go with getting. Again, gratitude is bestowed on a giver, not on one who refrains
					from taking; and still more is this true of praise. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Also it is easier not to take than to give: men are
					more reluctant to give away what belongs to them than to refrain from taking what belongs
					to someone else. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Again,
					it is those who give whom we call liberal; those who refrain from taking<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., those who refrain from taking more than their
						due.</note> are not <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> praised for Liberality but
					rather for Justice, and those who take<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., those who
						take what is their due.</note> are not praised at all. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>And of all virtuous people the liberal are perhaps
					the most beloved, because they are beneficial to others; and they are so in that they
					give.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Acts of virtue are noble, and are performed for the sake of their nobility; the liberal
					man therefore will give for the nobility of giving. And he will give rightly, for he will
					give to the right people, and the right amount, and at the right time, and fulfil all the
					other conditions of right giving. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Also he will give with pleasure, or at all events without pain; for
					virtuous action is pleasant, or painless&mdash;it certainly cannot be painful.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/> One who gives to the
					wrong people,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The ms. text gives &lsquo;to the
						wrong people,&rsquo; but cf. 1.12, l.25 <foreign lang="greek">o)rqw=s</foreign>.</note> or not for the nobility of giving but from some other motive,
					will not be called liberal, but by some different title; nor will he who gives with pain,
					for he would prefer the money to the noble deed, which is not the mark of a liberal
					man.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Consequently the liberal man will not take money from a wrong source either, since one
					who holds wealth in low esteem is not the man to make improper gains. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Nor yet will he be fond of asking
					favors, for one who confers benefits does not readily accept them. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/>But he will acquire wealth from the
					proper source, <milestone n="1120b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>that is, from his own possessions, not because he thinks it is a
					noble thing to do, but because it is a necessary condition of having the means to give. He
					will not be careless of his property, inasmuch as he wishes to employ it for the
					assistance of others. He will not give indiscriminately, in order that he may be able to
					give to the right persons and at the right time, and where it is noble to do so.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>But the liberal man
					is certainly prone to go to excess in giving, so as to leave himself the smaller share;
					for it is a mark of a liberal nature to be regardless of self.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In crediting people with Liberality their resources must be taken into account; for the
					liberality of a gift does not depend on its amount, but on the disposition of the giver,
					and a liberal disposition gives according to its substance.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lpar;accepting Bywater's emendation&rpar; &lsquo;and this
						is relative to his substance.&rsquo;</note> It is therefore possible that the
					smaller giver may be the more liberal, if he give from smaller means. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/>Men who have inherited a fortune are
					reputed to be more liberal than those who have made one, since they have never known what
					it is to want; moreover everybody is specially fond of a thing that is his own creation:
					parents and poets show this. But it is not easy for a liberal man to be rich, since he is
					not good either at getting money or at keeping it, while he is profuse in spending it and
					values wealth not for its own sake but as a means of giving. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/>Hence people blame fortune because the
					most deserving men are the least wealthy. But this is really perfectly natural: you cannot
					have money, any more than anything else, without taking pains to have it. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>On the other hand, the liberal man will not give to the wrong people, nor at the wrong
					time, and so forth, for this would not be an act of Liberality at all; and if he spent his
					money on the wrong objects he would not have any to spend on the right ones. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="23" unit="section"/>In fact, as was said before, the
					liberal man is one who spends in proportion to his means as well as on the right objects;
					while he that exceeds his means is prodigal. This is why we do not call the lavishness of
					princes Prodigality; because we feel that however much they spend and give away they can
					hardly exceed the limit of their resources.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Liberality then being the observance of the mean in the giving and getting of wealth, the
					liberal man will not only give and spend the right amounts on the right objects alike in
					small matters and in great, and feel pleasure in so doing, but will also take the right
					amounts, and from the right sources. For as this virtue is a mean both in giving and in
					getting, he will do both in the right way. Right getting goes with right giving, wrong
					getting is opposed to right giving; the two concordant practices therefore may be found in
					the same person, but the two opposite ones clearly cannot be. <milestone n="1121a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If the liberal man should happen to spend in a manner contrary to what is right and
					noble, he will feel pain, though in a moderate degree and in the right manner; for it is a
					mark of virtue to feel both pleasure and pain on the right occasions and in the right
					manner. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/>Also the
					liberal man is an easy person to deal with in money matters; <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27" unit="section"/>he can be cheated, because he does not
					value money, and is more distressed if he has paid less than he ought than he is annoyed
					if he has paid more: he does not agree with the saying of Simonides.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Several parsimonious aphorisms, sincere or ironical, are ascribed to
						Simonides, but none exactly fits this allusion.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The prodigal on the other hand errs in his feelings with regard to money as well as in
					his actions; he feels neither pleasure nor pain on the right occasions nor in the right
					manner. This will become clearer as we proceed.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.2.</note> then that Prodigality and
					Meanness are modes of excess and of deficiency, and this in two things, giving and
					getting&mdash;giving being taken to include spending. Prodigality exceeds in giving
					&lsqb;without getting<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words seem to be
						interpolated.</note>&rsqb;, and is deficient in getting; Meanness falls short in
					giving and goes to excess in getting, only not on the great scale. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Now the two forms of Prodigality are
					very seldom found united in the same person, because it is not easy to give to everyone
					without receiving from anyone: the giver's means are soon exhausted, if he is a private
					citizen, and only such persons are considered prodigal.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1.23 above.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="31" unit="section"/>In fact, a man who is
					prodigal in both ways may be thought considerably superior <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> to the mean man; for he is easily cured by age or by poverty, and
					is able to be brought to the due mean, because he possesses the essentials of the liberal
					character&mdash;he gives, and he refrains from taking, though he does neither in the
					proper way or rightly. Correct this by training, or otherwise reform him, and he will be
					liberal, for he will now give his money to the right objects, while he will not get it
					from the wrong sources. This is why he is felt to be not really bad in character; for to
					exceed in giving without getting is foolish rather than evil or ignoble. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/>The prodigal of this type therefore
					seems to be much superior to the mean man, both for the reasons stated, and because the
					former benefits many people, but the latter benefits nobody, not even himself.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the majority of prodigal people, as has been said, besides giving wrongly, take from
					wrong sources; in respect of getting they are in fact mean. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="34" unit="section"/>And what makes them grasping is that
					they want to spend, but cannot do so freely because they soon come to the end of their
					resources, and so are compelled to obtain supplies from others. <milestone n="1121b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Moreover, being indifferent to
					nobility of conduct, they are careless how they get their money, and take it from
					anywhere; their desire is to give, and they do not mind how or where they get the means of
					giving. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/>Hence even
					their giving is not really liberal: their gifts are not noble, nor given for the nobility
					of giving, nor in the right way; on the contrary, sometimes they make men rich who ought
					to be poor, and will not give anything to the worthy, while heaping gifts on flatterers
					and others who minister to their pleasures. Hence most prodigal men are also profligate;
					for as they spend their money freely, some of it is squandered in debauchery; and having
					no high moral standard they readily yield to the temptation of pleasure.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This then is what the prodigal comes to if he is not brought under discipline; but if he
					is taken in hand, he may attain the due mean and the right scale of liberality. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="37" unit="section"/>Meanness on the contrary is
					incurable; for we see that it can be caused by old age or any form of weakness. Also it is
					more ingrained in man's nature than Prodigality; the mass of mankind are avaricious rather
					than open-handed. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38" unit="section"/>Moreover Meanness is a far-reaching vice, and one of varied aspect: it appears to take
					several shapes. For as it consists in two things, deficiency in giving and excess in
					getting, it is not found in its entirety in every case, but sometimes the two forms occur
					separately, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> some men going too far in getting,
					while others fall short in giving. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="39" unit="section"/>The characters described by such names as niggardly, close-fisted, and
					stingy all fall short in giving, but they do not covet the goods of others nor wish to
					take them. With some of them this is due to an honorable motive of a sort, namely a
					shrinking from base conduct&mdash;since some persons are thought, or at all events
					profess, to be careful of their money because they wish to avoid being forced at some time
					or other to do something base; to this class belong the skinflint<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">kuminopri/sths</foreign> means literally
						&lsquo;one who saws cumminseed in half.&rsquo;</note> and similar characters,
					who get their names from an excessive reluctance to give. But some keep their hands off
					their neighbors' goods from fear; they calculate that it is not easy to take what belongs
					to others without others taking what belongs to oneself, and so they &lsquo;prefer
					&lpar;as they say&rpar; neither to take nor to give.&rsquo; <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="40" unit="section"/>The other sort of people are those who
					exceed in respect of getting, taking from every source and all they can; such are those
					who follow degrading trades, brothel-keepers and all people of that sort, and petty
					usurers who lend money in small sums at a high rate of interest; <milestone n="1122a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>all these take from wrong
					sources, and more than their due. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="41" unit="section"/>The common characteristic of all these seems to be sordid greed, since
					they all endure reproach for gain, and for a small gain. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="42" unit="section"/>Those who make improper gains from improper sources
					on a great scale, for instance princes who sack cities and rob temples, are not termed
					mean, but rather wicked or impious or unjust. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="43" unit="section"/>But the dicer and the foot-pad or brigand are to be classed as
					mean, as showing sordid greed, for both ply their trade and endure reproach for gain, the
					robber risking his life for plunder, and the dicer making gain out of his friends, to whom
					one ought to give; hence both are guilty of sordid greed, trying as they do to get gain
					from wrong sources. And all similar modes of getting wealth are mean for the same
					reasons.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="44" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Meanness is naturally spoken of as the opposite of Liberality; for not only is it a
					greater evil than Prodigality, but also men more often err on the side of Meanness than on
					that of Prodigality as we defined it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.5.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="45" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let this suffice as an account of Liberality and of the vices which are opposed to
					it.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Next it would seem proper to discuss Magnificence,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">megalopre/peia</foreign> denotes Munificence of a magnificent
					kind, the spending of money on a grand scale from the motive of public spirit. In
					discussing it Aristotle is thinking especially of the <foreign lang="greek">lh|tourgi/ai</foreign> or public services discharged at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and in other Greek cities, by wealthy individuals; such as the
					refitting of a naval trireme, the equipment of a dramatic chorus, and the defraying of
					the cost of a <foreign lang="greek">qewri/a</foreign> or delegation representing the
					State at one of the great Hellenic festivals. The word literally means &lsquo;great
					conspicuousness&rsquo; or splendor, but in eliciting its connotation Aristotle
					brings in another meaning of the verb <foreign lang="greek">pre/pein</foreign>, viz.
					&lsquo;to be fitting,&rsquo; and takes the noun to signify
					&lsquo;suitability on a great scale&rsquo;; and also he feels that the element
					&lsquo;great&rsquo; denotes grandeur as well as mere magnitude.</note> for this
					also appears to be a virtue concerned with wealth. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					It does not however, like Liberality, extend to all actions dealing with wealth, but only
					refers to the spending of wealth; and in this sphere it surpasses Liberality in point of
					magnitude, for, as its name itself implies, it consists in suitable expenditure on a great
					scale.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But this greatness of scale is relative. An amount of outlay that would be great for a
					person fitting out a galley for the navy would not be great for one equipping a state
					pilgrimage. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The
					suitability of the expenditure therefore is relative to the spender himself, and to the
					occasion or object. At the same time the term magnificent is not applied to one who spends
					adequate sums on objects of only small or moderate importance, like the man who said
					&lsquo;Oft gave I alms to homeless wayfarers&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.420">Hom. Od. 17.420</bibl>; said by Odysseus
						pretending to be a beggar who formerly was well-to-do.</note>; it denotes someone who
					spends suitably on great objects. For though the magnificent man is liberal, the liberal
					man is not necessarily magnificent.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The defect corresponding to the magnificent disposition is called Paltriness, and the
					excess Vulgarity, Want of Taste or the like. The latter vices do not exceed by spending
					too great an amount on proper objects, but by making a great display on the wrong
					occasions and in the wrong way. We will however speak of them later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.20-22.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The magnificent man is an artist in expenditure: he can discern what is suitable, and
					spend great sums with good taste. <milestone n="1122b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>&lpar;For as we said at the outset,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.1.7 fin., chap. 2.8.</note> a disposition is defined by the
					activities in which it is displayed, and by the objects to which it is related.&rpar;
					So the magnificent man's expenditure is suitable as well as great. And consequently the
					objects he produces must also be great and suitable; for so only will a great expenditure
					be suitable &lsqb;to the result<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words are
						better omitted: &lsquo;suitable to the occasion&rsquo; seems to be
						meant.</note>&rsqb; as well. Hence, as the object produced must be worthy of the
					expenditure, so also must the expenditure be worthy of or even exceed the object produced.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Again, the motive of
					the munificent man in such expenditure will be the nobility of the action, this motive
					being characteristic of all the virtues. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Moreover he will spend gladly and lavishly, since nice calculation is
					shabby; <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>and he will
					think how he can carry out his project most nobly and splendidly, rather than how much it
					will cost and how it can be done most cheaply. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/>The magnificent man will therefore necessarily be also a liberal
					man. For the liberal man too will spend the right amount in the right manner; and it is in
					the amount and manner of his expenditure that the element &lsquo;great&rsquo; in
					the magnificent or &lsquo;greatly splendid&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 2.1.</note> man, that is to say his greatness, is shown,
					these being the things in which Liberality is displayed. And the magnificent man from an
					equal outlay will achieve a more magnificent result<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc.
						than the vulgar man or the shabby man.</note>; for the same standard of excellence does
					not apply to an achievement as to a possession: with possessions the thing worth the
					highest price is the most honored, for instance gold, but the achievement most honored is
					one that is great and noble &lpar;since a great achievement arouses the admiration of
					the spectator, and the quality of causing admiration belongs to magnificence&rpar;;
					and excellence in an achievement involves greatness. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Now there are some forms of expenditure definitely
					entitled honorable, for instance expenditure on the service of the gods&mdash;
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> votive offerings, public buildings,
					sacrifices&mdash;and the offices of religion generally; and those public benefactions
					which are favorite objects of ambition, for instance the duty, as it is esteemed in
					certain states, of equipping a chorus splendidly or fitting out a ship of war, or even of
					giving a banquet to the public. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>But in all these matters, as has been said, the scale of expenditure
					must be judged with reference to the person spending, that is, to his position and his
					resources; for expenditure should be proportionate to means, and suitable not only to the
					occasion but to the giver. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Hence a poor man cannot be magnificent, since he has not the means to
					make a great outlay suitably; the poor man who attempts Magnificence is foolish, for he
					spends out of proportion to his means, and beyond what he ought, whereas an act displays
					virtue only when it is done in the right way. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/>But great public benefactions are suitable for those who have
					adequate resources derived from their own exertions or from their ancestors or
					connections, and for the high-born and famous and the like, since birth, fame and so on
					all have an element of greatness and distinction. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/>The magnificent man therefore is especially of this
					sort, and Magnificence mostly finds an outlet in these public benefactions, as we have
					said, since these are the greatest forms of expenditure and the ones most honored. But
					Magnificence is also shown on those private occasions for expenditure which only happen
					once, <milestone n="1123a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for
					instance, a wedding or the like, and which arouse the interest of the general public, or
					of people of position; and also in welcoming foreign guests and in celebrating their
					departure, and in the complimentary interchange of presents; for the magnificent man does
					not spend money on himself but on public objects, and his gifts have some resemblance to
					votive offerings. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>It is
					also characteristic of the magnificent man to furnish his house in a manner suitable to
					his wealth, since a fine house is a sort of distinction; and to prefer spending on
					permanent objects, because these are the most noble; <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/>and to spend an amount that is appropriate to the
					particular occasion, for the same gifts are not suitable for the gods and for men, and the
					same expenditure is not appropriate to a sacrifice and a funeral. In fact, inasmuch as the
					greatness of any form of expenditure varies with its particular kind, and, although the
					most magnificent expenditure absolutely is great expenditure on a great object, the most
					magnificent in a particular case is the amount that is great in that case, <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>and since the greatness of the
					result achieved is not the same as the greatness of the expenditure &lpar;for the
					finest ball or oil-flask does not cost much or involve a very liberal outlay, though it
					makes a magnificent present in the case of a child&rpar;, <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/>it follows that it is the mark of the
					magnificent man, in expenditure of whatever kind, to produce a magnificent result
					&lpar;for that is a standard not easily exceeded&rpar;, and a result proportionate
					to the cost.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such then is the character of the magnificent man. His counterpart on the side of excess,
					the vulgar man, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> exceeds, as has been said, by
					spending beyond what is right. He spends a great deal and makes a tasteless display on
					unimportant occasions: for instance, he gives a dinner to his club on the scale of a
					wedding banquet, and when equipping a chorus at the comedies he brings it on in purple at
					its first entrance, as is done at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the earlier scenes of the comedies of Aristophanes, the
						chorus appear in character as charcoal-burners, cavalrymen, wasps, clouds, etc., and
						take part in the action of the play as such. They seem to have stripped off their outer
						dress for the Parabasis, or interlude, in which they address the audience on behalf of
						the author &lpar;<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 627">Aristoph. Ach. 627</bibl>,<bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 730">Aristoph. Peace 730</bibl>&rpar;. In the later scenes they
						tend to fall more into the position of spectators, like the chorus of tragedy; and the
						play usually ends with something in the nature of a triumphal procession, when purple
						robes &lpar;like the scarlet worn by the chorus at the end of the
						<title>Eumenides</title> of Aeschylus&rpar; would not be inappropriate, as they
						would be in the opening scenes. Megarian comedy is elsewhere associated with coarse
						buffoonery.</note> Moreover, he does all this not from a noble motive but to show off
					his wealth, and with the idea that this sort of thing makes people admire him; and he
					spends little where he ought to spend much and much where he ought to spend little.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/>The paltry man on the
					other hand will err on the side of deficiency in everything; even when he is spending a
					great deal, he will spoil the effect for a trifle, and by hesitating at every stage and
					considering how he can spend least, and even so grudging what he spends and always
					thinking he is doing things on a greater scale than is necessary. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/>These dispositions then are vices, but
					they do not bring serious discredit, since they are not injurious to others, nor are they
					excessively unseemly.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Greatness of Soul,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">megaloyuxi/a</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">magnanimitas</foreign>, means lofty pride
					and self-esteem rather than magnanimity or high-mindedness &lpar;in the modern sense
					of the word&rpar;.</note> as the word itself implies, seems to be related to great
					objects; let us first ascertain what sort of objects these are. <milestone n="1123b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It will make no difference whether we examine the
					quality itself or the person that displays the quality. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much and deserves much; he who
					claims much without deserving it is foolish, but no one of moral excellence is foolish or
					senseless. The great-souled man is then as we have described. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>He who deserves little and claims
					little is modest or temperate, but not great-souled, <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>since to be great-souled involves greatness just as
					handsomeness involves size: small people may be neat and well-made, but not handsome.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>He that claims much
					but does not deserve much is vain; though not everybody who claims more than he deserves
					is vain.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term <foreign lang="greek">xau=nos</foreign> does not apply to a man who deserves much but claims even more, nor
						to one who claims little but deserves even less.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>He that claims less than
					he deserves is small-souled, whether his deserts be great or only moderate, or even though
					he deserves little, if he claims still less. The most small-souled of all would seem to be
					the man who claims less than he deserves when his deserts are great; for what would he
					have done had he not deserved so much?<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Though therefore in regard to the greatness of his claim the great-souled man is an
					extreme,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.6.17.</note> by reason of its
					rightness he stands at the mean point, for he claims what he deserves; while the vain and
					the small-souled err by excess and defect respectively.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If then the great-souled man claims and is worthy of great things and most of all the
					greatest things, Greatness of Soul must be concerned with some one object especially.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/>&lsquo;Worthy&rsquo; is a term of relation: it denotes having a claim to goods
					external to oneself. Now the greatest external good we should assume to be the thing which
					we offer as a tribute to the gods, and which is most coveted by men of high station, and
					is the prize awarded for the noblest deeds; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and
					such a thing is honor, for honor is clearly the greatest of external goods. Therefore the
					great-souled man is he who has the right disposition in relation to honors and disgraces.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>And even without
					argument it is evident that honor is the object with which the great-souled are concerned,
					since it is honor above all else which great men claim and deserve.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The small-souled man<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">3.12,13 should properly follow
					3.8.</note> falls short both as judged by his own deserts and in comparison with the
					claim of the great-souled man; <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>the vain man on the other hand exceeds as judged by his own standard,
					but does not however exceed the great-souled man.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That
						is, the small-souled man claims less than he deserves and less than the great-souled man
						deserves and claims; the vain man claims more than he deserves, but not more than the
						great-souled man deserves and claims.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And inasmuch as the great-souled man deserves most, he must be the best of men; for the
					better a man is the more he deserves, and he that is best deserves most. Therefore the
					truly great-souled man must be a good man. Indeed greatness in each of the virtues would
					seem to go with greatness of soul. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/>For instance, one cannot imagine the great-souled man running at full
					speed when retreating in battle,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally,
						&lsquo;fleeing swinging his arms at his side,&rsquo; i.e. deficient in the
						virtue of Courage. If this be the meaning, the phrase recalls by contrast the leisurely
						retirement of Socrates from the stricken field of <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName> &lpar;Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 221a">Plat. Sym.
							221a</bibl>&rpar;. But the words have been taken with what follows, as illustrating
						the lack of Justice or Honesty, and the whole translated either &lsquo;outstripping
						an opponent in a race by flinging the arms backward &lsqb;which was considered
						unsportsmanlike&rsqb;, nor fouling,&rsquo; or else &lsquo;being prosecuted
						on a charge of blackmailing, nor cheating in business.&rsquo; Emendation would give
						a buried verse-quotation, &lsquo;To swing his arms in flight, nor in
						pursuit.&rsquo;</note> nor acting dishonestly; since what motive for base conduct
					has a man to whom nothing is great?<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., nothing is of
						much value in his eyes &lpar;cf. 3.30,34&rpar;, so that gain, which is a motive
						to dishonesty with others, is no temptation to him.</note> Considering all the virtues
					in turn, we shall feel it quite ridiculous to picture the great-souled man as other than a
					good man. Moreover, if he were bad, he would not be worthy of honor, since honor is the
					prize of virtue, and the tribute that we pay to the good. <milestone n="1124a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Greatness of Soul seems therefore to be as it were a
					crowning ornament of the virtues: it enhances their greatness, and it cannot exist without
					them. Hence it is hard to be truly great souled,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">An
						echo of a line of Simonides, <foreign lang="greek">a)ndr' a)gaqo\n me\n a)laqe/ws
							gene/sqai xalepo/n</foreign>, cf. 1.10.11 note.</note> for greatness of soul is
					impossible without moral nobility.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Honor and dishonor then are the objects with which the great-souled man is especially
					concerned. Great honors accorded by persons of worth will afford him pleasure in a
					moderate degree: he will feel he is receiving only what belongs to him, or even less, for
					no honor can be adequate to the merits of perfect virtue, yet all the same he will deign
					to accept their honors, because they have no greater tribute to offer him. Honor rendered
					by common people and on trivial grounds he will utterly despise, for this is not what he
					merits. He will also despise dishonor, for no dishonor can justly attach to him.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>The great-souled man
					then, as has been said, is especially concerned with honor; but he will also observe due
					measure in respect to wealth, power, and good and bad fortune in general, as they may
					befall him; he will not rejoice overmuch in prosperity, nor grieve overmuch at adversity.
					For he does not care much even about honor, which is the greatest of external goods<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The ms. reading gives &lsquo;For even honor he does
						not feel to be of the greatest importance.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;since power and
					wealth are desirable only for the honor they bring, at least their possessors wish to be
					honored for their sake&rpar;; he therefore to whom even honor is a small thing will be
					indifferent to other things as well. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Hence
					great-souled men are thought to be haughty.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it is thought that the gifts of fortune also conduce to greatness of soul; for the
					high-born and those who are powerful or wealthy are esteemed worthy of honor, because they
					are superior to their fellows, and that which is superior in something good is always held
					in higher honor; so that even these gifts of fortune make men more great-souled, because
					their possessors are honored by some people. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/>But in reality only the good man ought to be honored, although he
					that has both virtue and fortune is esteemed still more worthy of honor; whereas those who
					possess the goods of fortune without virtue are not justified in claiming high worth, and
					cannot correctly be styled great-souled, since true worth and greatness of soul cannot
					exist without complete virtue. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="21" unit="section"/>It is true that even those who merely possess the goods of fortune may
					be haughty and insolent; because without virtue it is not easy to bear good fortune
					becomingly, <milestone n="1124b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and such men, being unable to carry their prosperity, and thinking themselves superior
					to the rest of mankind, despise other people, although their own conduct is no better than
					another's. The fact is that they try to imitate the great-souled man without being really
					like him, and only copy him in what they can, reproducing his contempt for others but not
					his virtuous conduct. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="22" unit="section"/>For the great-souled man is justified in despising other people&mdash;his estimates
					are correct; but most proud men have no good ground for their pride.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The great-souled man does not run into danger for trifling reasons, and is not a lover of
					danger, because there are few things he values; but he will face danger in a great cause,
					and when so doing will be ready to sacrifice his life, since he holds that life is not
					worth having at every price.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>He is fond of conferring benefits, but ashamed to receive them, because the former is a
					mark of superiority and the latter of inferiority. He returns a service done to him with
					interest, since this will put the original benefactor into his debt in turn, and make him
					the party benefited. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="25" unit="section"/>The great-souled are thought to have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred,
					but a bad memory for those which they have received &lpar;since the recipient of a
					benefit is the inferior of his benefactor, whereas they desire to be superior&rpar;;
					and to enjoy being reminded of the former but to dislike being reminded of the latter:
					this is why the poet makes Thetis<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">An incorrect
						recollection of <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.393">Hom. Il. 1.393 ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.503">Hom. Il. 1.503 f.</bibl>; there Achilles says that his mother
						has often reminded Zeus how she rescued him when the other gods wished to put him in
						chains; and Thetis goes to Zeus and reminds him of her services in general terms.</note>
					not specify her services to Zeus; nor did the Spartans treating with the Athenians<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is uncertain.</note> recall the occasions
					when <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> had aided <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but those on which <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had aided <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only
					with reluctance, but to render aid willingly; and to be haughty towards men of position
					and fortune, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> but courteous towards those of
					moderate station, because it is difficult and distinguished to be superior to the great,
					but easy to outdo the lowly, and to adopt a high manner with the former is not ill-bred,
					but it is vulgar to lord it over humble people: it is like putting forth one's strength
					against the weak. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="27" unit="section"/>He
					will not compete for the common objects of ambition, or go where other people take the
					first place; and he will be idle and slow to act, except when pursuing some high honor or
					achievement; and will not engage in many undertakings, but only in such as are important
					and distinguished. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="28" unit="section"/>He
					must be open both in love and in hate, since concealment shows timidity; and care more for
					the truth than for what people will think; and speak and act openly, since as he despises
					other men he is outspoken and frank, except when speaking with ironical
					self-depreciation,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 2.7.12.</note> as he
					does to common people. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="29" unit="section"/>He will be incapable of living at the will of another, unless a friend, <milestone n="1125a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since to do so is
					slavish, and hence flatterers are always servile, and humble people flatterers. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="30" unit="section"/>He is not prone to admiration,
					since nothing is great to him. He does not bear a grudge, for it is not a mark of
					greatness of soul to recall things against people, especially the wrongs they have done
					you, but rather to overlook them. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="31" unit="section"/>He is no gossip, for he will not talk either about himself or about
					another, as he neither wants to receive compliments nor to hear other people run down
					&lpar;nor is he lavish of praise either&rpar;; and so he is not given to speaking
					evil himself, even of his enemies, except when he deliberately intends to give offence.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="32" unit="section"/>In troubles that
					cannot be avoided or trifling mishaps he will never cry out or ask for help, since to do
					so would imply that he took them to heart. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="33" unit="section"/>He likes to own beautiful and useless things, rather than useful
					things that bring in a return, since the former show his independence more.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Other traits generally attributed to the great-souled man are a slow gait, a deep voice,
					and a deliberate utterance; to speak in shrill tones and walk fast denotes an excitable
					and nervous temperament, which does not belong to one who cares for few things and thinks
					nothing great.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such then being the Great-souled man, the corresponding character on the side of
					deficiency is the Small-souled man, and on that of excess the Vain man. These also<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.22.</note> are not thought to be actually vicious,
					since they do no harm, but rather mistaken. The small-souled man <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> deprives himself of the good things that he deserves; and his
					failure to claim good things makes it seem that he has something bad about him
					&lsqb;and also that he does not know himself&rsqb;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words seem to be interpolated. The small-souled man does not claim
						his deserts, but he may know what they are; he is not charged with ignorance of self, as
						is the vain man, 3.36.</note> for &lpar;people argue&rpar;, if he deserved any
					good, he would try to obtain it. Not that such persons are considered foolish, but rather
					too retiring; yet this estimate of them is thought to make them still worse, for men's
					ambitions show what they are worth, and if they hold aloof from noble enterprises and
					pursuits, and for go the good things of life, presumably they think they are not worthy of
					them.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The vain on the other hand are foolish persons, who are deficient in self-knowledge and
					expose their defect: they undertake honorable responsibilities of which they are not
					worthy, and then are found out. They are ostentatious in dress, manner and so on. They
					want people to know how well off they are, and talk about it,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A variant reading is &lsquo;talk about themselves.&rsquo;</note>
					imagining that this will make them respected.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Smallness of Soul is more opposed than Vanity to Greatness of Soul, being both more
					prevalent and worse.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Greatness of Soul then, as we have said, is concerned with great honors. <milestone n="1125b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It appears however that honor also,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., honor as
					well as wealth is the object of both a major and a minor virtue: see 2.7.8.</note> as
					was said in the first part of this work, has a certain virtue concerned with it, which may
					be held to bear the same relation to Greatness of Soul that Liberality bears to
					Magnificence. This virtue as well as Liberality is without the element of greatness, but
					causes us to be rightly disposed towards moderate and small honors as Liberality does
					towards moderate and small amounts of money; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>and just as
					there is a mean and also excess and deficiency in getting and in giving money, so also it
					is possible to pursue honor more or less than is right and also to seek it from the right
					source and in the right way. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>We blame a man as ambitious
					if he seeks honor more than is right, or from wrong sources; we blame him as unambitious
					if he does not care about receiving honor even on noble grounds. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But at another time we praise the ambitious man as manly and a lover of
					what is noble, or praise the unambitious man as modest and temperate, as we said in the
					first part of this work.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 2.7.8.</note> The fact is
					that the expression &lsquo;fond of&rsquo; so-and-so is ambiguous, and we do not
					always apply the word &lsquo;fond of honor&rsquo; &lpar;ambitious&rpar; to
					the same thing; when we use it as a term of praise, we mean &lsquo;more fond of honor
					than most men,&rsquo; but when as a reproach, &lsquo;more than is
					right.&rsquo; As the observance of the mean has no name, the two extremes dispute as
					it were for the unclaimed estate. But where there is excess and deficiency there must also
					be a mean. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Now men do seek honor both more and <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> less than is right; it must therefore be possible also to do
					so rightly. It is therefore this nameless middle disposition in regard to honor that we
					really praise. Compared with ambition it appears unambitiousness, and compared with
					unambitiousness it appears ambition: compared with both, it a appears in a sense to be
					both. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>This seems to be true of the other virtues also;
					but in the present case the extremes appear to be opposed only to one another, because the
					middle character has no name.<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Gentleness is the observance of the mean in relation to anger. There is as a matter of
					fact no recognized name for the mean in this respect&mdash;indeed there can hardly be
					said to be names for the extremes either&mdash;, so we apply the word Gentleness to
					the mean though really it inclines to the side of the defect. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This has no name, but the excess may be called a sort of Irascibility,
					for the emotion concerned is anger, though the causes producing it are many and
					various.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now we praise a man who feels anger on the right grounds and against the right persons,
					and also in the right manner and at the right moment and for the right length of time. He
					may then be called gentle-tempered, if we take gentleness to be a praiseworthy quality
					&lpar;for &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; really denotes a calm temper, not led by
					emotion but only becoming angry in such a manner, for such causes and for such a length of
					time as principle may ordain; <milestone n="1126a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>although the quality is thought
					rather to err on the side of defect, since the gentle-tempered man is not prompt to seek
					redress for injuries, but rather inclined to forgive them&rpar;.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The defect, on the other hand, call it a sort of Lack of Spirit or what not, is blamed;
					since those who do not get angry at things at which it is right to be angry are considered
					foolish, and so are those who do not get angry in the right manner, at the a right time,
					and with the right people. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>It is thought that they do not
					feel or resent an injury, and that if a man is never angry he will not stand up for him
					self; and it is considered servile to put up with an insult to oneself or suffer one's
					friends to be insulted.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Excess also is possible in each of these ways, for one can be angry with the wrong
					people, for wrong things, or more violently or more quickly or longer than is right; but
					not all these excesses of temper are found in the same person. This would be impossible,
					since evil destroys even itself, and when present in its entirety becomes unbearable.
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>There are then first the Irascible, who get angry
					quickly and with the wrong people and for the wrong things and too violently, but whose
					anger is soon over. This last is the best point in their character, and it is due to the
					fact that they do not keep their anger in, but being quick-tempered display it openly by
					retaliating, and then have done with it. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>The excessively
					quick-tempered are Passionate; they fly into a passion at everything and on all occasions:
					hence their name. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>The Bitter-tempered on the other hand
					are <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> implacable, and remain angry a long time,
					because they keep their wrath in; whereas when a man retaliates there is an end of the
					matter: the pain of resentment is replaced by the pleasure of obtaining redress, and so
					his anger ceases. But if they do not retaliate, men continue to labour under a sense of
					resentment&mdash;for as their anger is concealed no one else tries to placate them
					either, and it takes a long time to digest one's wrath within one. Bitterness is the most
					trouble some form of bad temper both to a man himself and to his nearest friends.
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Those who lose their temper at the wrong things, and
					more and longer than they ought, and who refuse to be reconciled without obtaining redress
					or retaliating, we call Harsh-tempered.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We consider the excess to be more opposed to Gentleness than the defect, because it
					occurs more frequently, human nature being more prone to seek redress than to forgive; and
					because the harsh-tempered are worse to live with than the unduly placable.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But what was said above<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.9.7-9, a passage closely
					repeated here.</note> is also clear from what we are now saying; it is not easy to
					define in what manner and with whom and on what grounds and how long one ought to be
					angry, and up to what point one does right in so doing and where error begins. For he who
					transgresses the limit only a little is not held blameworthy, whether he errs on the side
					of excess or defect; in fact, we sometimes praise those deficient in anger and call them
					gentle-tempered, <milestone n="1126b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and we sometimes praise those who are harsh-tempered as manly, and
					fitted to command. It is therefore not easy to pronounce on principle what degree and
					manner of error is blameworthy, since this is a matter of the particular circumstances,
					and judgement rests with the faculty of perception. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>But
					thus much at all events is clear, that the middle disposition is praiseworthy, which leads
					us to be angry with the right people for the right things in the right manner and so on,
					while the various forms of excess and defect are blameworthy&mdash;when of slight
					extent, but little so, when greater, more, and when extreme, very blameworthy indeed. It
					is clear therefore that we should strive to attain the middle disposition.<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let this be our account of the dispositions related to anger.<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In society and the common life and intercourse of conversation and business, some men are
					considered to be Obsequious; these are people who complaisantly approve of everything and
					never raise objections, but think it a duty to avoid giving pain to those which whom they
					come in contact. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Those on the contrary who object to
					everything and do not care in the least what pain they cause, are called Surly or
					Quarrelsome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now it is clear that the dispositions
					described are blameworthy, and that the middle disposition between them is
					praiseworthy&mdash;that is, the tendency to acquiesce in the right things, and
					likewise to disapprove of the right things, in the right manner. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But to this no special name has been assigned, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> though it very closely resembles friendship<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At 2.7.13 it was actually termed <foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign>,
						Friendliness.</note>; for he who exemplifies this middle disposition is the sort of man
					we mean by the expression &lsquo;a good friend,&rsquo; only that includes an
					element of affection. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It differs from friendship in not
					possessing the emotional factor of affection for one's associates; since a man of this
					character takes everything in the right way not from personal liking or dislike, but from
					natural amiability. He will behave with the same propriety towards strangers and
					acquaintances alike, towards people with whom he is familiar and those with whom he is
					not&mdash;though preserving the shades of distinction proper to each class, since it
					is not appropriate to show the same regard or disregard for the feelings of friends and of
					strangers.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have said then in general terms that he will behave in the right manner in society. We
					mean that in designing either to give pain or to contribute pleasure he will be guided by
					considerations of honor and of expediency. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>For he seems
					to be concerned with pleasure and pain in social intercourse. He will disapprove of
					pleasures in which it is dishonorable or harmful to himself for him to join, preferring to
					give pain<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc. by refusing to participate.</note>; and
					he will also disapprove of and refuse to acquiesce in a pleasure that brings any
					considerable discredit or harm to the agent, if his opposition will not cause much pain.
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>And he will comport himself differently with men of
					high position and with ordinary people, <milestone n="1127a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>with persons more and less well known to him, and
					similarly as regards other distinctions, assigning to each class the proper degree of
					deference, and, other things apart, preferring to join in the pleasures of his companions
					and being reluctant to give pain; but being guided by the consequences, that is to say,
					the effects on his and his friends' credit or interest, if these outweigh the pleasure he
					will give by compliance. Also he will give a small amount of pain at the moment for the
					sake of a large amount of pleasure in the future.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such is the middle character, although it has no name. The man who always joins in the
					pleasures of his companions, if he sets out to be pleasant for no ulterior motive, is
					Obsequious; if he does so for the sake of getting something by it in the shape of money or
					money's worth, he is a Flatterer. He that disapproves of everything is, as we said, Surly
					or Quarrelsome. As the mean has no name, the extremes appear to be opposite to each
					other.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The observance of the mean<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 2.7.12.</note>
					in relation to Boastfulness has to do with almost the same things. It also is without a
					name; but it will be as well to discuss these unnamed excellences with the rest, since we
					shall the better understand the nature of the moral character if we examine its qualities
					one by one; and we shall also confirm our belief that the virtues are modes of observing
					the mean, if we notice how this holds good in every instance. Now we have treated of
					behavior in Society with relation to giving pleasure and pain. Let us now discuss
					truthfulness and falsehood <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> similarly displayed in
					word and deed, and in one's personal pretensions.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As generally understood then, the boaster is a man who pretends to creditable qualities
					that he does not possess, or possesses in a lesser degree than he makes out, <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>while conversely the self depreciator disclaims or disparages good
					qualities that he does possess; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>midway between them is
					the straightforward sort of man who is sincere both in behavior and in speech, and admits
					the truth about his own qualifications without either exaggeration or understatement.
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Each of these things may be done with or without an
					ulterior motive; but when a man is acting without ulterior motive, his words, actions, and
					conduct always represent a his true character.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						oddly contradicts the preceding words.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Falsehood is in itself base and reprehensible, and truth
					noble and praiseworthy; and similarly the sincere man who stands between the two extremes
					is praised, and the insincere of both kinds are blamed, more especially the boaster. Let
					us discuss each of the two, beginning with the truthful man.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We are speaking not of truthfulness in business relations, nor in matters where honesty
					and dishonesty are concerned <milestone n="1127b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>&lpar;for these matters would come under a different virtue<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. Justice, Book 5.</note>&rpar;, but of cases where
					a man is truthful both in speech and conduct when no considerations of honesty come in,
					from an habitual sincerity of disposition. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Such sincerity
					may be esteemed a moral excellence; for the lover of truth, who is truthful even when
					nothing depends on it, will <foreign lang="la">a fortiori</foreign> be truthful when some
					interest is at stake, since having all along avoided falsehood for its own sake, he will
					assuredly avoid it when it is morally base; and this is a disposition that we praise.
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>The sincere man will diverge from the truth, if at all,
					in the direction of understatement rather than exaggeration; since this appears in better
					taste, as all excess is offensive.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The man who pretends to more merit than he possesses for no ulterior object seems, it is
					true, to be a person of inferior character, since otherwise he would not take pleasure in
					falsehood; but he appears to be more foolish than vicious. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>When, on the other hand, a man exaggerates his own merits to gain some
					object, if that object is glory or honor he is not very much to be blamed &lsqb;as is
					the boaster&rsqb;, but if he boasts to get money or things that fetch money, this is
					more unseemly. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>&lpar;Boastfulness is not a matter of
					potential capacity but of deliberate purpose; a man is a boaster if he has a fixed
					disposition to boast&mdash;a boastful character.&rpar; Similarly liars are divided
					into those who like lying for its own sake and those who lie to get reputation or profit.
					<milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Those then who boast for the sake of reputation
					pretend to possess such qualities as are praised and admired; those who do so for profit
					pretend to accomplishments that are useful to their fellows and also can be counterfeited
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> without detection; for instance,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The true text very probably is &lsquo;for example
						&ldquo;physician or seer sage,&rdquo;&rsquo; a verse quotation.</note>
					proficiency in prophecy, philosophy, or medicine. Because these arts have the two
					qualities specified they are the commonest fields of pretence and bragging.<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Self-depreciators, who understate their own merits, seem of a more refined character, for
					we feel that the motive underlying this form of insincerity is not gain but dislike of
					ostentation. These also<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Just as boastfulness is chiefly
						shown in pretending to qualities of value.</note> mostly disown qualities held in high
					esteem, as Socrates used to do. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Those who disclaim
					merely trifling or obvious distinctions are called affected humbugs, and are decidedly
					contemptible; and sometimes such mock humility seems to be really boastfulness, like the
					dress of the Spartans,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle regards the cheapness
						and simplicity of the Spartans' dress as an affectation; or perhaps the reference is to
						&lsquo;Laconizers&rsquo; at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						who affected Spartan manners.</note> for extreme negligence in dress, as well as
					excessive attention to it, has a touch of ostentation. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>But a moderate use of self-depreciation in matters not too commonplace and obvious has a
					not ungraceful air.<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The boaster seems to be the opposite of the sincere man, because Boastfulness is worse
					than Self-depreciation.<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But life also includes relaxation, and one form of relaxation is playful conversation.
					Here, too, we feel that there is a certain standard of good taste in social behavior,
					<milestone n="1128a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and a
					certain propriety in the sort of things we say and in our manner of saying them, and also
					in the sort of things we allow to be said to us; and it will also concern us whether those
					in whose company we speak or to whom we listen conform to the same rules of propriety.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And it is clear that in these matters too it is
					possible either to exceed or to fall short of the mean.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Those then who go to excess in ridicule are thought to be buffoons and vulgar fellows,
					who itch to have their joke at all costs, and are more concerned to raise a laugh than to
					keep within the bounds of decorum and avoid giving pain to the object of their raillery.
					Those on the other hand who never by any chance say anything funny themselves and take
					offence at those who do, are considered boorish and morose. Those who jest with good taste
					are called witty<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">eu)tra/peloi</foreign>, lit. &lsquo;turning well,&rsquo; nimble-witted.</note>
					or versatile&mdash;that is to say, full of good turns; for such sallies seem to spring
					from the character, and we judge men's characters, like their bodies, by their movements.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But as matter for ridicule is always ready to hand, and
					as most men are only too fond of fun and raillery, even buffoons are called witty and pass
					for clever fellows; though it is clear from what has been said that Wit is different, and
					widely different, from Buffoonery. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The middle disposition
					is further characterized by the quality of tact, the possessor of which will say, and
					allow to be said to him, only the sort of things that are suitable to a virtuous man and a
					gentleman: since there is a certain propriety in what such a man will say <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and hear in jest, and the jesting of a gentleman differs
					from that of a person of servile nature, as does that of an educated from that of an
					uneducated man. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The difference may be seen by comparing
					the old and the modern comedies; the earlier dramatists found their fun in obscenity, the
					moderns prefer innuendo, which marks a great advance in decorum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Can we then define proper raillery by saying that its jests are never
					unbecoming to gentlemen, or that it avoids giving pain or indeed actually gives pleasure
					to its object? Or is it impossible to define anything so elusive? for tastes differ as to
					what is offensive and what amusing. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Whatever rule we lay
					down, the same will apply to the things that a man should allow to be said to him, since
					we feel that deeds which a man permits to be ascribed to him he would not stop at actually
					doing. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Hence a man will draw the line at some jokes; for
					raillery is a sort of vilification, and some forms of vilification are forbidden by law;
					perhaps some forms of raillery ought to be prohibited also. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>The cultivated gentleman will therefore regulate his wit, and will be as
					it were a law to himself.</p>
				<p>Such then is the middle character, whether he be called &lsquo;tactful&rsquo; or
					&lsquo;witty.&rsquo; The buffoon is one who cannot resist a joke; he will not keep
					his tongue off himself or anyone else, if he can raise a laugh, and will say things
					<milestone n="1128b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>which a
					man of refinement would never say, and some of which he would not even allow to be said to
					him. The boor is of no use in playful conversation: he contributes nothing and takes
					offence at everything; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>yet relaxation and amusement seem
					to be a necessary element in life.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have now discussed three modes of observing the mean in our behavior, all of which are
					concerned with conversation or with common occupations of some sort. They differ in that
					one is concerned with truthfulness and the others with being pleasant. Of the two that
					deal with pleasure, one is displayed in our amusements, and the other in the general
					intercourse of life.<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Modesty cannot properly be described as a virtue, for it seems to be a feeling rather
					than a disposition; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>at least it is defined as a kind of
					fear of disrepute, and indeed in its effects it is akin to the fear of danger; for people
					who are ashamed blush, while those in fear of their lives turn pale; both therefore appear
					to be in a sense bodily affections, and this indicates a feeling rather than a
					disposition.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The feeling of modesty is not suitable to every age, but only to the young. We think it
					proper for the young to be modest, because as they live by feeling they often err, and
					modesty may keep them in check; and we praise young people when they are modest,
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> though no one would praise an older man for being
					shamefaced, since we think he ought not to do anything of which he need be ashamed.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For indeed the virtuous man does not feel shame, if
					shame is the feeling caused by base actions; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>since one
					ought not to do base actions &lpar;the distinction between acts really shameful and
					those reputed to be so is immaterial, since one ought not to do either&rpar;, and so
					one never ought to feel shame. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Shame is a mark of a base
					man, and springs from a character capable of doing a shameful act. And it is absurd that,
					because a man is of such a nature that he is ashamed if he does a shameful act, he should
					therefore think himself virtuous, since actions to cause shame must be voluntary, but a
					virtuous man will never voluntarily do a base action. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Modesty can only be virtuous conditionally&mdash;in the sense that a good man would
					be ashamed <emph>if</emph> he were to do so and so; but the virtues are not conditional.
					And though shamelessness and not shrinking from shameful actions is base, this does not
					prove that to be ashamed when one a does shameful acts is virtuous&mdash;<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>any more than Self-restraint is a virtue, and not rather a mixture
					of virtue and vice. But this will be explained later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In Bk. 7.</note> Let us now speak of Justice.</p>

				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>In regard to Justice<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In what follows <foreign lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign> is found to possess both the wider meaning of
					Righteousness in general, covering all right conduct in relation to others, and the
					narrower sense of the virtue of right conduct in relation to others where gain or loss
					&lpar;whether to the agent or to other parties&rpar; is involved. <foreign lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign> in this narrower sense is the special Moral Virtue
					which is the subject of Book 5; it would be described in English sometimes as Justice,
					sometimes as Honesty or uprightness. The related adjectives and verbs have various
					connotations connected with the various meanings of <foreign lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign> both in its wider and in its narrower usage. For instance,
					<foreign lang="greek">ta\ di/kaia</foreign> means sometimes &lsquo;just
					acts&rsquo; in the English sense, sometimes any acts in conformity with the law,
					sometimes &lsquo;rights&rsquo; or &lsquo;claims,&rsquo; i.e., any
					consideration which by law, equity, or custom, certain persons have a right to expect
					from certain others. Or again <foreign lang="greek">a)dikei=n</foreign> means not only
					to act unjustly, or dishonestly, but also to do, or have done, any wrongful injury to
					another, or any wrongful or illegal act, and so, as a legal term, to be guilty of a
					breach of the law. In translating however, if the connection of all these various
					meanings in the writer's mind is to be represented, it seems necessary to keep the words
					&lsquo;justice,&rsquo; &lsquo;injustice,&rsquo; etc., throughout, in
					spite of their occasional unsuitability to the context.</note> and Injustice, we have to
					enquire what sort of actions precisely they are concerned with, in what sense Justice is
					the observance of a mean, and what are the extremes between which that which is just is a
					mean. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Our enquiry may
					follow the same procedure as our preceding investigations.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now we observe that everybody means by Justice that moral disposition which renders men
					apt to do just things, and which causes them to act justly and to wish what is just; and
					similarly by Injustice that disposition which makes men act unjustly and wish what is
					unjust. Let us then assume this definition to start with as broadly correct.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The fact is that it is not the same with dispositions as with sciences and faculties. It
					seems that the same faculty or science deals with opposite things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For instance, medicine studies both health and disease. Cf. 9.16.</note>;
					but a disposition or condition which produces a certain result does not also produce the
					opposite results; for example, health does not give rise to unhealthy actions, but only to
					healthy ones: healthy walking means walking as a healthy man would walk.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., it does not also mean walking lame.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Because a faculty or science is the same for
					opposite things.</note> sometimes the nature of one of two opposite dispositions is
					inferred from the other, sometimes dispositions are known from the things in which they
					are found; for instance, if we know what good bodily condition is, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> we know from this what bad condition is as well, but we also know
					what good condition is from bodies in good condition, and know what bodies are in good
					condition from knowing what good condition is. Thus, supposing good condition is firmness
					of flesh, bad condition must be flabbiness of flesh, and a diet productive of good
					condition<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;that which has to do
						with good condition&rsquo;: the word here slightly shifts its meaning, for just
						above it meant &lsquo;that which is in good condition.&rsquo;</note> must be a
					diet producing firmness of flesh.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also, if one of two correlative groups of words is used in several senses, it follows as
					a rule that the other is used in several senses too: for example, if
					&lsquo;just&rsquo; has more than one meaning, so also has
					&lsquo;unjust&rsquo; and &lsquo;Injustice.&rsquo; <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Now it appears that the terms Justice
					and Injustice are used in several senses, but as the equivocal uses are closely connected,
					the equivocation is not detected; whereas in the case of widely different things called by
					a common name, the equivocation is comparatively obvious: for example &lpar;the
					difference being considerable when it is one of external form&rpar;, the equivocal use
					of the word <foreign lang="xgreek">kleis</foreign> &lpar;key&rpar; to denote both
					the bone<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The clavicle &lpar;<foreign lang="la">clavis</foreign>, a key&rpar;, or collar-bone.</note> at the base of the neck and
					the instrument with which we lock our doors.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let us then ascertain in how many senses a man is said to be
					&lsquo;unjust.&rsquo; Now the term &lsquo;unjust&rsquo; is held to apply
					both to the man who breaks the law and the man who takes more than his due, the
					unfair<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word <foreign lang="greek">i)/sos</foreign> means both &lsquo;equal&rsquo; and
						&lsquo;equitable&rsquo; or &lsquo;fair.&rsquo;</note> man. Hence it is
					clear that the law-abiding man and the fair man will both be just. &lsquo;The
					just&rsquo; therefore means that which is lawful and that which is equal or fair, and
					&lsquo;the unjust&rsquo; means that which is illegal and that which is unequal or
					unfair. <milestone n="1129b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, as the unjust man is one who takes the larger share, he will be unjust in respect
					of good things; not all good things, but those on which good and bad fortune depend. These
					though always good in the absolute sense, are not always good for a particular person. Yet
					these are the goods men pray for and pursue, although they ought not to do so; they ought,
					while choosing the things that are good for them, to pray that what is good absolutely may
					also be good for them.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The unjust man does not however always choose the larger share: of things that, speaking
					absolutely, are bad he chooses the smaller share; but nevertheless he is thought to take
					more than his due, because the lesser of two evils seems in a sense to be a good, and
					taking more than one's due means taking more than one's due of good. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Let us call him
					&lsquo;unfair,&rsquo; for that is a comprehensive term, and includes both taking
					too much of good things and too little of bad things.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here some mss. add &lsquo;Also a law-breaker, for this, law-breaking or else
						unfairness, includes all injustice and is a common term for all injustice.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, we saw that the law-breaker is unjust and the law-abiding man just. It is
					therefore clear that all lawful things are just in one sense of the word, for what is
					lawful is decided by legislature, and the several decisions of the legislature we call
					rules of justice. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Now
					all the various pronouncements of the law aim either at the common interest of all, or at
					the interest of a ruling class determined either by excellence or in some other similar
					way; so that in one of its senses the term &lsquo;just&rsquo; is applied to
					anything that produces and preserves the happiness, or the component parts of the
					happiness, of the political community.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the law also prescribes certain conduct: the conduct <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> of a brave man, for example not to desert one's post, not to run
					away, not to throw down one's arms; that of a temperate man, for example not to commit
					adultery or outrage; that of a gentle man, for example not to strike, not to speak evil;
					and so with actions exemplifying the rest of the virtues and vices, commanding these and
					forbidding those&mdash;rightly if the law has been rightly enacted, not so well if it
					has been made at random.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Justice then in this sense is perfect Virtue, though with a qualification, namely that it
					is displayed towards others. This is why Justice is often thought to be the chief of the
					virtues, and more sublime &lsquo;or than the evening or the morning
					star&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">According to a scholiast, this is a
						quotation, slightly altered, from the lost play <title>Melanippe</title> of Euripides

						</quote> And Justice is perfect virtue because it is the practice of perfect virtue; and
					perfect in a special degree,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the mss. the words
						&lsquo;in a special degree&rsquo; follow &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; in the
						line before.</note> because its possessor can practise his virtue towards others and not
					merely by himself; for there are many who can practise virtue in their own private affairs
					but cannot do so in their relations with another. <milestone n="1130a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>This is why we approve the saying of Bias, &lsquo;Office will
					show a man&rsquo;; for in office one is brought into relation with others and becomes
					a member of a community.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The same reason, namely that it involves relationship with someone else, accounts for the
					view<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Put into the mouth of the sophist Thrasymachus
						in Plato's <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 343c">Plat. Rep. 343c</bibl>.</note> that Justice alone
					of the virtues is &lsquo;the good of others,&rsquo; because it does what is for
					the advantage of another, either a ruler or an associate. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="18" unit="section"/>As then the worst man is he who practises vice
					towards his friends as well as in regard to himself, so the best is not he who practises
					virtue in regard to himself but he who practises it towards others; for that is a
					difficult task.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Justice in this sense then is not a part of Virtue, but the whole of Virtue; and its
					opposite Injustice is not a part of Vice but the whole of Vice <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="20" unit="section"/>&lpar;the distinction between
					Virtue and Justice in this sense being clear from what has been said: they are the same
					quality of mind, but their essence is different<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						6.8.1.</note>; what as displayed in relation to others is Justice, as being simply a
					disposition of a certain kind is Virtue&rpar;.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>What we are investigating, however, is the Justice which is a part of Virtue, since we
					hold that there is such a thing as Justice in this sense; and similarly we are
					investigating Injustice in the particular sense. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The existence of the latter is proved by the
					following considerations: &lpar;1&rpar; When a man displays the other
					vices&mdash;for instance, throws away his shield, from Cowardice, or uses abusive
					language, from Bad Temper, or refuses to assist a friend with money, from
					Meanness&mdash;though he acts unjustly, he is not taking more than his share of
					anything; whereas <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> when a man takes more than his
					share, it is frequently not due to any of these vices, and certainly not to all of them,
					yet nevertheless the action does display some vice, since we blame it; in fact it displays
					the vice of Injustice. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Therefore there is another sort of Injustice, which is a part of Injustice in the
					universal sense, and there is something unjust which is a part of the unjust in general,
					or illegal. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>&lpar;2&rpar; Again, suppose two men to commit adultery, one for profit, and
					gaining by the act, the other from desire, and having to pay, and so losing by it: then
					the latter would be deemed to be a profligate rather than a man who takes more than his
					due, while the former would be deemed unjust, but not profligate; clearly therefore it is
					being done for profit that makes the action unjust. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>&lpar;3&rpar; Again, whereas all other unjust
					acts are invariably ascribed to some particular vice&mdash;for example, adultery is
					put down to Profligacy, desertion from the ranks to Cowardice, assault to
					Anger&mdash;an unjust act by which a man has profited is not attributed to any vice
					except Injustice.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence it is manifest that there is another sort of Injustice besides universal Injustice,
					the former being a part of the latter. It is called by the same name because its
					definition falls in the same genus, <milestone n="1130b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>both sorts of Injustice being exhibited in a man's relation to
					others; but whereas Injustice in the particular sense is concerned with honor or money or
					security, or whatever term we may employ to include all these things, its motive being the
					pleasure of gain, Injustice in the universal sense is concerned with all the things that
					are the sphere of Virtue.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus it is clear that there are more kinds of Justice than one, and that the term has
					another meaning besides Virtue as a whole. We have then to ascertain the nature and
					attributes of Justice in this special sense.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now we have distinguished two meanings of &lsquo;the unjust,&rsquo; namely the
					unlawful and the unequal or unfair, and two meanings of &lsquo;the just,&rsquo;
					namely the lawful and the equal or fair. Injustice then, in the sense previously
					mentioned, corresponds to the meaning &lsquo;unlawful&rsquo;; <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>but since the unfair is not the same as
					the unlawful, but different from it, and related to it as part to whole &lpar;for not
					everything unlawful is unfair, though everything unfair is unlawful&rpar;, so also the
					unjust and Injustice in the particular sense are not the same as the unjust and Injustice
					in the universal sense, but different from them, and related to them as part to whole; for
					Injustice in this sense is a part of universal Injustice, and similarly the Justice we are
					now considering is a part of universal Justice. We have therefore to discuss Justice and
					Injustice, and the just and unjust, in the particular sense.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We may then set aside that Justice which is coextensive with virtue in general, being the
					practice of virtue in general towards someone else, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					and that Injustice which is the practice of vice in general towards someone else. It is
					also clear how we should define what is just and unjust in the corresponding senses. For
					the actions that spring from virtue in general are in the main identical with the actions
					that are according to law, since the law enjoins conduct displaying the various particular
					virtues and forbids conduct displaying the various particular vices. Also the regulations
					laid down for the education that fits a man for social life are the rules productive of
					virtue in general. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>As
					for the education of the individual as such, that makes a man simply a good man, the
					question whether this is the business of Political Science or of some other science must
					be determined later: for it would seem that to be a good man is not in every case the same
					thing as to be a good citizen.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This topic is discussed
						in <title>Politics</title> 3. Under certain forms of government the good man in the
						moral sense may not be a good citizen, that is, a citizen who will help to maintain the
						constitution.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Particular Justice on the other hand, and that which is just in the sense corresponding
					to it, is divided into two kinds. One kind is exercised in the distribution of honor,
					wealth, and the other divisible assets of the community, which may be allotted among its
					members in equal or unequal shares. <milestone n="1131a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>The other kind is that which supplies a corrective principle
					in private transactions.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/>This Corrective Justice again has two sub-divisions, corresponding to the two classes of
					private transactions, those which are voluntary and those which are involuntary.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Involuntary&rsquo; here means lacking the
						consent of one of the parties.</note> Examples of voluntary transactions are selling,
					buying, lending at interest, pledging, lending without interest, depositing, letting for
					hire; these transactions being termed voluntary because they are voluntarily entered
					upon.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In chap. 4 below, the writer gives no
						illustration of the operation of Corrective Justice in Voluntary Transactions, but he is
						clearly thinking of actions at law for damages resulting from breach of contract. See
						4.13 note.</note> Of involuntary transactions some are furtive, for instance, theft,
					adultery, poisoning, procuring, enticement of slaves, assassination, false witness; others
					are violent, for instance, assault, imprisonment, murder, robbery with violence, maiming,
					abusive language, contumelious treatment.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now since an unjust man is one who is unfair, and the unjust is the unequal, it is clear
					that corresponding to the unequal there is a mean, namely that which is equal; <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>for every action admitting of
					more and less admits of the equal also. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If then the unjust is the unequal, the just is the equal&mdash;a
					view that commends itself to all without proof; and since the equal is a mean, the just
					will be a sort of mean too. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Again, equality involves two terms at least. It accordingly follows not
					only &lpar;a&rpar; that the just is a mean and equal &lsqb;and relative to
					something and just for certain persons<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words
						appear to be an interpolation.</note>&rsqb;, but also &lpar;b&rpar; that, as
					a mean, it implies certain extremes between which it lies, namely the more and the less;
					&lpar;c&rpar; that, as equal, it implies two shares that are equal; and
					&lpar;d&rpar; that, as just, it implies certain persons for whom it is just.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It follows therefore
					that justice involves at least four terms, namely, two persons <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for whom it is just and two shares which are just. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And there will be the same equality
					between the shares as between the persons, since the ratio between the shares will be
					equal to the ratio between the persons; for if the persons are not equal, they will not
					have equal shares; it is when equals possess or are allotted unequal shares, or persons
					not equal equal shares, that quarrels and complaints arise.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This is also clear from the principle of &lsquo;assignment by desert.&rsquo; All
					are agreed that justice in distributions must be based on desert of some sort, although
					they do not all mean the same sort of desert; democrats make the criterion free birth;
					those of oligarchical sympathies wealth, or in other cases birth; upholders of aristocracy
					make it virtue. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Justice
					is therefore a sort of proportion; for proportion is not a property of numerical quantity
					only, but of quantity in general, proportion being equality of ratios, and involving four
					terms at least.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;That a discrete proportion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A
					&lsquo;discrete proportion&rsquo; means one in which the two ratios are
					disconnected, being between different terms, whereas in a &lsquo;continuous
					proportion&rsquo; they have one term in common.</note> has four terms is plain, but
					so also has a continuous proportion, since it treats one term as two, and repeats it:
					<milestone n="1131b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for
					example,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here the lecturer displayed a
						diagram.</note> as the line representing term one is to the line representing term two, so
					is the line representing term two to the line representing term three; here the line
					representing term two is mentioned twice, so that if it be counted twice, there will be
					four proportionals.&rpar;<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus the just also involves four terms at least, and the ratio between the first pair of
					terms is the same as that between the second pair. For the two lines representing the
					persons and shares are similarly divided<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here was
						another diagram &lpar;one would expect the sentence to run &lsquo;Let two lines
						representing . . . have been similarly divided&rsquo;&rpar;. Two segments, A and
						B, of one line represented two persons, two segments, C and D, of another their shares.
						It is shown that, if A:B::C:D, then A+C:B+D::A:B, i.e., if the shares are proportioned
						to the persons, their relative condition after receiving them will be the same as it was
						before.</note>; <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>then,
					as the first term is to the second, so is the third to the fourth; and hence, by
					alternation, as the first is to the third, so is the second to the fourth; and therefore
					also, as the first is to the second, so is the sum of the first and third to the sum of
					the second and fourth. Now this is the combination effected by a distribution of shares,
					and the combination is a just one, if persons and shares are added together in this way.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>The principle of
					Distributive Justice, therefore, is the conjunction of the first term of a proportion with
					the third and of the second with the fourth; and the just in this sense is a mean between
					two extremes that are disproportionate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., A's just
						share lies between too large a share and too small a one, too large and too small here
						meaning more or less than is proportionate to A's claim. Cf. Bk. 2.6.4, third note, and
						6.7.</note> since the proportionate is a mean, and the just is the
					proportionate.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;This kind of proportion is termed by mathematicians geometrical proportion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">We call this a proportion simply: cf. 4.3 and
					note.</note>; for a geometrical proportion is one in which the sum of the first and third
					terms will bear the same ratio to the sum of the second and fourth as one term of either
					pair bears to the other term.&mdash;<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="14" unit="section"/>Distributive justice is not a continuous proportion, for its second and
					third terms, a person and a share, do not constitute a single term.&rpar;</p>
				<p>The just in this sense is therefore the proportionate, and the unjust is that which
					violates proportion. The unjust may therefore be either too much or too little; and this
					is what we find in fact, for when injustice is done, the doer has too much and the
					sufferer <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> too little of the good in question;
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="15" unit="section"/>though vice versa in
					the case of an evil, because a lesser evil in comparison with a greater counts as a good,
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="16" unit="section"/>since the lesser of
					two evils is more desirable than the greater, but what is desirable is good, and the more
					desirable it is, the greater good it is.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This then is one kind of Justice.<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The remaining kind is Corrective Justice, which operates in private transactions, both
					voluntary and involuntary. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This justice is of a different
					sort from the preceding. For justice in distributing common property always conforms with
					the proportion we have described &lpar;since when a distribution is made from the
					common stock, it will follow the same ratio as that between the amounts which the several
					persons have contributed to the common stock&rpar;; and the injustice opposed to
					justice of this a kind is a violation of this proportion. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But the just in private transactions, although it is the equal in a sense &lpar;and
					the unjust the unequal&rpar;, <milestone n="1132a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>is not the equal according to geometrical but according to
					arithmetical proportion.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, two pairs of terms
						&lpar;e.g. 1, 3; 7, 9&rpar;, of which the second term exceeds the first by the
						same amount as the fourth exceeds the third. We do not call this a proportion at all,
						but, if also the third term exceeds the second by the same amount &lpar;e.g. 1, 3,
						5, 7&rpar;, an arithmetical progression.</note> For it makes no difference<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For Corrective Justice the merits of the parties are
							immaterial.</note> whether a good man has defrauded a bad man or a bad one a good one,
					nor whether it is a good or a bad man that has committed adultery; the law looks only at

					done and the other suffered injustice, whether one inflicted and the other has sustained
					damage. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Hence the unjust being here the unequal, the
					judge endeavors to equalize it: inasmuch as when one man has received and the other has
					inflicted a blow, or one has killed and the other been killed, the line<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Again a diagram is employed, cf. 3.9,10, and <foreign lang="la">infra</foreign> 4.8.</note> representing the suffering and doing of the deed
					is divided into unequal parts, but the judge endeavors to make them equal by the penalty
					or loss<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">zhmi/a</foreign> has both
						senses.</note> he imposes, taking away the gain. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>&lpar;For the term &lsquo;gain&rsquo; is used in a general way to apply to
					such cases, even though it is not strictly appropriate to some of them, for example to a
					person who strikes another, nor is &lsquo;loss&rsquo; appropriate to the victim in
					this case; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>but at all events the results are called
					&lsquo;loss&rsquo; and &lsquo;gain&rsquo; respectively when the amount of
					the damage sustained comes to be estimated.&rpar; Thus, while the equal is a mean
					between more and less, gain and loss are at once both more and less in contrary ways, more
					good and less evil being gain and more evil and less good loss; and as the equal, which we
					pronounce to be just, is, as we said, a mean between them, it follows that Justice in
					Rectification<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A slightly different term is here
						introduced, but apparently without difference of meaning.</note> will be the mean
					between loss and gain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This is why when disputes occur <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> men have recourse
					to a judge. To go to a judge is to go to justice, for the ideal judge is so to speak
					justice personified. Also, men require a judge to be a middle term or
					<emph>medium</emph>&mdash;indeed in some places judges are called
					<emph>mediators</emph>&mdash;, for they think that if they get the mean they will get
					what is just. Thus the just is a sort of mean, inasmuch as the judge is a medium between
					the litigants.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the judge restores equality: if we represent the matter by a line divided into two
					unequal parts, he takes away from the greater segment that portion by which it exceeds
					one-half of the whole line, and adds it to the lesser segment. When the whole has been
					divided into two halves, people then say that they &lsquo;have their own,&rsquo;
					having got what is equal.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>

				<p>The terms &lsquo;loss&rsquo; and &lsquo;gain&rsquo; in these cases are
					borrowed from the operations of voluntary exchange. There, to have more than one's own is
					called gaining, and to have less than one had at the outset is called losing, as for
					instance in buying and selling, and all other transactions sanctioned by law;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;where the law gives
						immunity,&rsquo; that is, does not give redress for inequality resulting from the

						be a case for the intervention of Corrective Justice in Voluntary Transactions
						&lpar;chap. 2 fin.&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="14" unit="section"/>while if the result of the transaction is neither an
					increase nor a decrease, but exactly what the parties had of themselves, they say they
					&lsquo;have their own&rsquo; and have neither lost nor gained. Hence Justice in

					the transaction an amount <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> equal to the amount one
					had before it. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The view is also held by some that simple Reciprocity is Justice. This was the doctrine
					of the Pythagoreans, who defined the just simply as &lsquo;suffering reciprocally with
					another.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, retaliation: A shall
						have done to him what he has done to B.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Reciprocity however does not coincide either with Distributive or with Corrective Justice
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>&lpar;although people mean to identify it with the
					latter when they quote the rule of Rhadamanthys&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>An a man suffer even that which he did,</l>
							<l>Right justice will be done&rpar;.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For in many cases Reciprocity is at variance with
					Justice: for example, if an officer strikes a man, it is wrong for the man to strike him
					back; and if a man strikes an officer, it is not enough for the officer to strike him, but
					he ought to be punished as well. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Again, it makes a great
					difference whether an act was done with or without the consent of the other party.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;whether the act was voluntary or
						involuntary&rsquo;; see first note on 2.13.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But in the interchange of services Justice in the form of
					Reciprocity is the bond that maintains the association: reciprocity, that is, on the basis
					of proportion, not on the basis of equality. The very existence of the state depends on
					proportionate reciprocity; for men demand that they shall be able to requite evil with
					evil&mdash; <milestone n="1133a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>if they cannot, they feel they are in the position of
					slaves&mdash;and to repay good with good&mdash; failing which, no exchange takes
					place, and it is exchange that binds them together. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>This
					is why we set up a shrine of the Graces in a public place, to remind men to return a
					kindness; for that is a special characteristic of grace, since it is a duty not only to
					repay a service done one, but another time to take the initiative in doing a service
					oneself.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now proportionate requital is effected by diagonal conjunction. For example, let A be a
					builder, B a shoemaker, C a house, and D a shoe. It is required that the builder shall
					receive from the shoemaker a portion of the product of his labor, and give him a portion
					of the product of his own. Now<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The relative value of
						the units of the two products must be ascertained, say one house must be taken as worth
						<emph>n</emph>. Then the four terms are and cross-conjunction gives totals
						A+<emph>n</emph>D, B+C, which are in &lsquo;arithmetical proportion&rsquo;
						&lpar;see first note on 5.4.3&rpar; with the two first terms, i.e. the
						differentce between each pair is the same; the builder and the shoemaker after the
						transaction are by an equal amount richer than they were before they began to make the
						articles.</note> if proportionate equality between the products be first established,
					and then reciprocation take place, the requirement indicated will have been achieved; but
					if this is not done, the bargain is not equal, and intercourse does not continue. For it
					may happen that the product of one of the parties is worth more than that of the other,
					and in that case therefore they have to be equalized. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>This holds good with the other arts as well; for they would have passed out of existence
					if the active element did not produce, and did not receive the equivalent in quantity and
					quality of what the passive element receives.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						sentence also appeared in the mss. above, at 4.12, where it made no sense. If genuine
						here, the phrases &lsquo;active element&rsquo; and &lsquo;passive
						element&rsquo; seem to mean producer and consumer. Even so, it is probable that
						there is some corruption; Jackson's insertion
						gives &lsquo;unless the passive element produced the same in quantity and quality as
						the active, and the latter received the same in quantity and quality as the
						former.&rsquo;</note> For an association for interchange of services is not formed
					between two physicians, but between a physician and a farmer, and generally between
					persons who are different, and who may be unequal, though in that case they have to be
					equalized. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Hence all commodities exchanged must be able
					to be compared in some way. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> It is to meet this
					requirement that men have introduced money; money constitutes in a manner a middle term,
					for it is a measure of all things, and so of their superior or inferior value, that is to
					say, how many shoes are equivalent to a house or to a given quantity of food. As therefore
					a builder is to a shoemaker,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is uncertain whether
						this merely refers to the difference in value &lpar;or perhaps in labor used in
						production&rpar; between the unit products of different trades, or whether it
						introduces the further conception that different kinds of producers have different
						social values and deserve different rates of reward.</note> so must such and such a
					number of shoes be to a house, &lsqb;or to a given quantity of food&rsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently interpolated from the last sentence.</note>;
					for without this reciprocal proportion, there can be no exchange and no association; and
					it cannot be secured unless the commodities in question be equal in a sense.<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is therefore necessary that all commodities shall be measured by some one standard, as
					was said before. And this standard is in reality demand, which is what holds everything
					together, since if men cease to have wants or if their wants alter, exchange will go on no
					longer, or will be on different lines. But demand has come to be conventionally
					represented by money; this is why money is called <foreign lang="xgreek">nomisma</foreign>
					&lpar;customary currency&rpar;, because it does not exist by nature but by custom
					&lpar;<foreign lang="xgreek">nomos</foreign>&rpar;, and can be altered and
					rendered useless<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">a)/xrhston</foreign> also connotes &lsquo;worthless,&rsquo; but an obsolete
						coin retains some value as metal.</note> at will.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There will therefore be reciprocal proportion when the products have been equated, so
					that as farmer is to shoemaker,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 5.10, first
						note.</note> so may the shoemaker's product be to the farmer's product. <milestone n="1133b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>And when they
					exchange their products they must reduce them to the form of a proportion, otherwise one
					of the two extremes will have both the excesses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is
						&lsquo;after any unfair exchange one party has too much by just the amount by which
						the other has too little. I ought to have given you ten shillings more or something
						worth that. Then I have ten shillings too much, and you have ten too little; these two
						tens are my two &ldquo;excesses&rdquo;; in respect of the exchange. I am better
						off then you by twice ten&rsquo; &lpar;Richards&rpar;. Cf. 4.10-12.</note>;
					whereas when they have their own,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For this proverbial
						phrase see 4.8,14.</note> they then are equal, and can form an association together,
					because equality in this sense can be established in their case &lpar;farmer A, food
					C, shoemaker B, shoemaker's product equalized D<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or
						&lsquo;shoemaker's product D multiplied to equivalence with C&rsquo;
						&lpar;Blunt&rpar;.</note>&rpar;; whereas if it were impossible for
					reciprocal proportion to be effected in this way, there could be no association between
					them.<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>That it is demand which, by serving as a single standard, holds such an association
					together, is shown by the fact that, when there is no demand for mutual service on the
					part of both or at least of one of the parties, no exchange takes place between them
					&lsqb;as when someone needs something that one has oneself, for instance the state
					offering a license to export corn in exchange for wine&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The clauses bracketed make neither grammar nor sense, and have justly
						been suspected as interpolated. Munscher inserts a negative: &lsquo;Just as there is
						no exchange when the producer wants what the consumer has &lt;not&gt; got, for
						example, when one state needs wine while another can only offer corn for
						export.&rsquo; But there seems to be no question here of foreign commerce.</note>
					This inequality of demand has therefore to be equalized.<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now money serves us as a guarantee of exchange in the future: supposing we need nothing
					at the moment, it ensures that exchange shall be possible when a need arises, for it meets
					the requirement of something we can produce in payment so as to obtain the thing we need.
					Money, it is true, is liable to the same fluctuation of demand as other commodities, for
					its purchasing power varies at different times; but it tends to be comparatively constant.
					Hence the proper thing is for all commodities to have their prices fixed; this will ensure
					that exchange, and consequently association, shall always be possible. Money then serves
					as a measure which makes things commensurable and so reduces them to equality. If there
					were no exchange there would be no association, and there can be no exchange without
					equality, and no equality without commensurability. Though therefore it is impossible for
					things so different to become commensurable in the strict sense, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> our demand furnishes a sufficiently accurate common measure for
					practical purposes. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>There must therefore be some one
					standard, and this accepted by agreement &lpar;which is why it is called <foreign lang="xgreek">nomisma</foreign>, customary currency&rpar;; for such a standard makes
					all things commensurable, since all things can be measured by money. Let A be a house, B
					ten minae and C a bedstead. Then A=B/2 &lpar;supposing the house to be worth, or equal
					to, five minae&rpar;, and C &lpar;the bedstead&rpar; =B/10; it is now clear
					how many bedsteads are equal to one house, namely five. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>It is clear that before money existed this is how the rate of exchange was actually
					stated&mdash;five beds for a house&mdash;since there is no real difference between
					that and the price of five beds for a house.<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have now stated what Justice and Injustice are in principle. From the definition
					given, it is plain that just conduct is a mean between doing and suffering injustice, for
					the former is to have too much and the latter to have too little. And Justice is a mode of
					observing the mean, though not in the same way as the other virtues are, but because it is
					related to a mean, while Injustice is related to the extremes. <milestone n="1134a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Also, Justice is that quality
					in virtue of which a man is said to be disposed to do by deliberate choice that which is
					just, and, when distributing things between himself and another, or between two others,
					not to give too much to himself and too little to his neighbor of what is desirable, and
					too little to himself and too much to his neighbor of what is harmful, but to each what is
					proportionately equal; and similarly when he is distributing between two other persons.
					<milestone n="18" unit="section"/>Injustice on the contrary is similarly related to that
					which is unjust, which is a disproportionate excess or deficiency of something beneficial
					or harmful. Hence Injustice is excess and defect, in the sense that it results in excess
					and defect: namely, in the offender's own case, an excess of anything that is generally
					speaking beneficial and a deficiency of anything harmful, and in the case of others,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, when A distributes unjustly not between himself
						and B but between B and C, the result for either B or C may be either excess or defect,
						either too large a share or too small of something beneficial &lpar;and either too
						small a share or too large of something harmful&rpar;.</note> though the result as a
					whole is the same, the deviation from proportion may be in either direction as the case
					may be.</p>
				<p>Of the injustice done, the smaller part is the suffering and the larger part the doing of
					injustice.<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>So much may be said about the nature of Justice and Injustice, and of the Just and the
					Unjust regarded universally.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">6.1-2 are an irrelevant
						fragment which Jackson would insert in 8.8
						after <foreign lang="greek">blabh/</foreign>; 6.3 he would transpose to the beginning of
						chap. 10; 6.4 continues the end of chap. 5.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>But seeing that a man
					may commit injustice without actually being unjust, what is it that distinguishes those
					unjust acts the commission of which renders a man actually unjust under one of the various
					forms of injustice, for example, a thief or an adulterer or a brigand? Or shall we rather
					say that the distinction does not lie in the quality of the act? <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> For a man may have intercourse with a woman knowing who she is, yet
					not from the motive of deliberate choice, but under the influence of passion; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>in such a case, though he has committed injustice, he is not an
					unjust man: for instance, he is not a thief, though guilty of theft, not an adulterer,
					though he has committed adultery, and so forth.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The relation of Reciprocity to Justice has been stated already.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But we must not forget that the subject of our investigation is at once Justice in the
					absolute sense and Political Justice. Political Justice means justice as between free and
					&lpar;actually or proportionately&rpar; equal persons, living a common life for
					the purpose of satisfying their needs. Hence between people not free and equal political
					justice cannot exist, but only a sort of justice in a metaphorical sense. For justice can
					only exist between those whose mutual relations are regulated by law, and law exists among
					those between whom there is a possibility of injustice, for the administration of the law
					means the discrimination of what is just and what is unjust. Persons therefore between
					whom injustice can exist can act unjustly towards each other &lpar;although unjust
					action does not necessarily involve injustice&rpar;: to act unjustly meaning to assign
					oneself too large a share of things generally good and too small a share of things
					generally evil. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>This is why we do not permit a man to
					rule, but the law, because a man rules in his own interest, <milestone n="1134b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and becomes a tyrant; but the
					function of a ruler is to be the guardian of justice, and if of justice, then of equality.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>A just ruler seems to make nothing out of his office;
					for he does not allot to himself a larger share of things generally good, unless it be
					proportionate to his merits; so that he labors for others, which accounts for the saying
					mentioned above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.17 note.</note> that
					&lsquo;Justice is the good of others.&rsquo; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Consequently some recompense has to be given him, in the shape of honor and dignity. It
					is those whom such rewards do not satisfy who make themselves tyrants.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Justice between master and slave and between father and child is not the same as absolute
					and political justice, but only analogous to them. For there is no such thing as injustice
					in the absolute sense towards what is one's own; and a chattel,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., a slave.</note> or a child till it reaches a certain age and
					becomes independent, is, as it were, a part of oneself, and no one chooses to harm
					himself; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>hence there can be no injustice towards them,
					and therefore nothing just or unjust in the political sense. For these, as we saw, are
					embodied in law, and exist between persons whose relations are naturally regulated by law,
					that is, persons who share equally in ruling and being ruled. Hence Justice exists in a
					fuller degree between husband and wife than between father and children, or master and
					slaves; in fact, justice between husband and wife is Domestic Justice in the real sense,
					though this too is different from Political Justice.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Political Justice is of two kinds, one natural, the other conventional. A rule of justice
					is natural that has the same validity everywhere, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					and does not depend on our accepting it or not. A rule is conventional that in the first
					instance may be settled in one way or the other indifferently, though having once been
					settled it is not indifferent: for example, that the ransom for a prisoner shall be a
					mina, that a sacrifice shall consist of a goat and not of two sheep; and any regulations
					enacted for particular cases, for instance the sacrifice in honor of Brasidas,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Spartan Brasidas detached <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> from the Athenian empire <date value="-424">424</date> B.C.,
						and fell defending it against Cleon 422. He was worshipped as a hero by the city,
						&lsquo;with games and yearly sacrifices&rsquo; &lpar;<bibl n="Thuc. 5.11">Thuc. 5.11</bibl>&rpar;.</note> and ordinances in the nature of special decrees.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Some people think that all rules of justice are merely
					conventional, because whereas a law of nature is immutable and has the same validity
					everywhere, as fire burns both here and in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, rules of justice are seen to vary. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>That rules of justice vary is not absolutely true, but only with qualifications. Among
					the gods indeed it is perhaps not true at all; but in our world,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The order of the following sentences seems confused. With the
						transpositions suggested by Richards, and the emendations given in the critical notes,
						they will run: &lsquo;But in our world, although there is such a thing as natural
						law, yet everything is capable of change. For example, the right hand is naturally
						stronger than the left, yet it is possible for some persons to be born ambidextrous; and
						the same distinction will hold good in all matters; though what sort of things that
						admit of variation are as they are by nature, and what are merely customary and
						conventional, it is not easy to see, inasmuch as both alike are capable of change. But
						nevertheless some things are ordained by nature and others not.&rsquo;</note>
					although there is such a thing as Natural Justice, all rules of justice are variable. But
					nevertheless there is such a thing as Natural Justice as well as justice not ordained by
					nature; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>and it is easy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps Aristotle wrote &lsquo;though is is not easy.&rsquo;</note> to see
					which rules of justice, though not absolute, are natural, and which are not natural but
					legal and conventional, both sorts alike being variable. The same distinction will hold
					good in all other matters; for instance, the right hand is naturally stronger than the
					left, yet it is possible for any man to make himself ambidextrous.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The rules of justice based on convention and expediency <milestone n="1135a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>are like standard measures.
					Corn and wine measures are not equal in all places, but are larger in wholesale and
					smaller in retail markets. Similarly the rules of justice ordained not by nature but by
					man are not the same in all places, since forms of government are not the same, though in
					all places there is only one form of government that is natural, namely, the best
					form.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The several rules of justice and of law are related to the actions conforming with them
					as universals to particulars, for the actions done are many, while each rule or law is
					one, being universal.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There is a difference between &lsquo;that which is unjust&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;unjust conduct,&rsquo; and between &lsquo;that which is just&rsquo;
					and &lsquo;just conduct.&rsquo; Nature or ordinance pronounces a thing unjust:
					when that thing is done, it is &lsquo;unjust conduct&rsquo;; till it is done, it
					is only &lsquo;unjust.&rsquo; And similarly with &lsquo;just
					conduct,&rsquo; a <foreign lang="xgreek">dikaioma</foreign> &lpar;or more
					correctly, the general term is <foreign lang="xgreek">dikaiopragema</foreign>, <foreign lang="xgreek">dikaioma</foreign> denoting the rectification of an act of
					injustice&rpar;.</p>
				<p>We shall have later<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Possibly a reference to an
					intended &lpar;or now lost&rpar; book of the <title>Politics</title> on laws
					&lpar;Ross&rpar;.</note> to consider
					the several rules of justice and of law, and to enumerate their various kinds and describe
					them and the things with which they deal.<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such being an account of just and unjust actions, it is their voluntary performance that
					constitutes just and unjust conduct. If a man does them involuntarily, he cannot be said
					to act justly, or unjustly, except incidentally, in the sense that he does an act which
					happens to be just or unjust. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Whether therefore an action
					is or is not an act of injustice, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> or of justice,
					depends on its voluntary or involuntary character. When it is involuntary, the agent is
					blamed, and only in that case is the action an act of injustice; so that it is possible
					for an act to be unjust without being an act of injustice, if the qualification of
					voluntariness be absent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>By a voluntary action, as has
					been said before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">3.1.19.</note> I mean any action
					within the agent's own control which he performs knowingly, that is, without being in

					blow&rpar;; and in each of these respects both accident<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., mistake, ignorance: as in the illustration, it is an accident that
						the person struck is the striker's father.</note> and compulsion must be excluded. For
					instance, if A took hold of B's hand and with it struck C, B would not be a voluntary
					agent, since the act would not be in his own control. Or again, a man may strike his
					father without knowing that it is his father, though aware that he is striking some
					person, and perhaps that it is one or other of the persons present<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc., of whom he knows his father to be one.</note>; and ignorance may be
					similarly defined with reference to the result, and to the circumstances of the action
					generally. An involuntary act is therefore an act done in ignorance, or else one that
					though not done in ignorance is not in the agent's control, or is done under compulsion;
					since there are many natural processes too <milestone n="1135b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>that we perform or undergo knowingly, though none
					of them is either voluntary or involuntary<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Involuntary&rsquo; is certainly corrupt: perhaps Aristotle wrote
						&lsquo;in our control.&rsquo;</note>; for example, growing old, and
					dying.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also an act may be either just or unjust incidentally. A man may restore a deposit
					unwillingly and from fear of consequences, and we must not then say that he does a just
					act, nor that he acts justly, except incidentally; and similarly a man who under
					compulsion and against his will fails to restore a deposit can only be said to act
					unjustly or do what is unjust incidentally. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again voluntary acts are divided into acts done by choice and those done not by choice,
					the former being those done after deliberation and the latter those done without previous
					deliberation.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are then three ways<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The three sorts of injury
					are <foreign lang="greek">a)tu/xhma, a(ma/rthma</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign>. The second term is introduced first, in its wider sense of a
					mistake which leads to an offense against someone else &lpar;the word connotes both
					things&rpar;. It is then subdivided into two; <foreign lang="greek">a)tu/xhma</foreign>, accident or misadventure, and offense due to mistake and not
					reasonably to be expected, and <foreign lang="greek">a(ma/rthma</foreign> in the narrow
					sense, a similar offense that ought to have been foreseen. The third term, <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign>, a wrong, is subdivided into wrongs done in a
					passion, which do not prove wickedness, and wrongs done deliberately, which do.</note>
					in which a man may injure his fellow. An injury done in ignorance is an error, the person
					affected or the act or the instrument or the result being other than the agent supposed;
					for example, he did not think to hit, or not with this missile, or not this person, or not
					with this result, but it happened that either the result was other than he expected
					&lpar;for instance he did not mean to inflict a wound but only a prick&rpar;, or
					the person, or the missile. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>When then the injury happens
					contrary to reasonable expectation, it is &lpar;1&rpar; a misadventure. When,
					though not contrary to reasonable expectation, it is done without evil intent, it is
					&lpar;2&rpar; a culpable error; for an error is culpable when the cause of one's
					ignorance lies in oneself, but only a misadventure when the cause lies outside oneself.
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>When an injury is done knowingly but not deliberately, it
					is &lpar;3&rpar; an act of injustice or wrong; such, for instance, are injuries
					done through anger, or any other unavoidable or natural passion to which men are liable;
					since in committing these injuries and errors a man acts unjustly, and his action is an
					act of injustice, but he is not <foreign lang="la">ipso facto</foreign> unjust or wicked,
					for the injury was not done out of wickedness. When however an injury is done from choice,
					the doer is unjust and wicked. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Hence acts due to sudden
					anger are rightly held not to be done of malice aforethought, for it is the man who gave
					the provocation that began it, not he who does the deed in a fit of passion. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>And moreover the issue is not one of fact, but of justification
					&lpar;since it is apparent injustice that arouses anger&rpar;; the fact of the
					injury is not disputed &lpar;as it is in cases of contract, where one or the other of
					the parties must be a knave, unless they dispute the facts out of forgetfulness&rpar;.
					They agree as to the facts but dispute on which side justice lies so that one thinks he
					has been unjustly treated and the other does not. On the other hand, one who has planned
					an injury is not acting in ignorance;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the mss. this
						clause stands before the preceding one.</note>
					<milestone n="1136a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="11" unit="section"/>but if a man does an injury of set purpose, he is guilty of
					injustice, and injustice of the sort that renders the doer an unjust man, if it be an act
					that violates proportion or equality. Similarly one who acts justly on purpose is a just
					man; but he acts justly only if he acts voluntarily.<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Of involuntary actions some are pardonable and some are not. Errors not merely committed
					in ignorance but caused by ignorance are pardonable; those committed in ignorance, but
					caused not by that ignorance but by unnatural or inhuman passion, are
					unpardonable.<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it may perhaps be doubted whether our discussion of suffering and doing injustice has
					been sufficiently definite; and in the first place, whether the matter really is as
					Euripides has put it in the strange lines<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently
						from a dialogue between Alcmaeon and &lpar;possibly&rpar; Phegeus in the lost

							see 1.1, note.</note> voluntarily, or on the contrary is suffering injustice always
					involuntary, just as acting unjustly is always voluntary? And again, is suffering
					injustice always voluntary, or always involuntary, or sometimes one and sometimes the
					other? <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And similarly with being treated justly
					&lpar;acting justly being always voluntary&rpar;. Thus it would be reasonable to
					suppose that <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> both being treated unjustly and being
					treated justly are similarly opposed to acting unjustly and acting justly respectively:
					that either both are voluntary or both involuntary. But it would seem paradoxical to
					assert that even being treated justly is always voluntary; for people are sometimes
					treated justly against their will. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The fact is that the
					further question might be raised, must a man who has had an unjust thing done to him
					always be said to have been treated unjustly, or does the same thing hold good of
					suffering as of doing something unjust? One may be a party to a just act, whether as its
					agent or its object, incidentally.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.1.</note> And
					the same clearly is true of an unjust act: doing what is unjust is not identical with
					acting unjustly, nor yet is suffering what is unjust identical with being treated
					unjustly, and the same is true of acting and being treated justly; for to be treated
					unjustly requires someone who acts unjustly, and to be treated justly requires someone who
					acts justly.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But if to act unjustly is simply to do harm voluntarily, and voluntarily means knowing
					the person affected, the instrument, and the manner of injury, it will follow both that
					the man of defective self-restraint, inasmuch as he voluntarily harms himself, voluntarily
					suffers injustice, and also that it is possible for a man to act unjustly towards himself
					<milestone n="1136b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>&lpar;for the possibility of this is also a debated question&rpar;. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Moreover, lack of self-restraint may make a person voluntarily
					submit to being harmed by another; which again would prove that it is possible to suffer
					injustice voluntarily. But perhaps this definition of acting unjustly is incorrect, and we
					should add to the words &lsquo;to do harm knowing the person affected, the instrument
					and the manner&rsquo; the further qualification &lsquo;against that person's
					wish.&rsquo; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>If so, though a man can be harmed and
					can have an unjust thing done to him voluntarily, no one can suffer injustice voluntarily,
					because no one can wish to be harmed: even the unrestrained man does not, but acts
					contrary to his wish, since no one wishes for a thing that he does not think to be good,
					and the unrestrained man does what he thinks he ought not to do. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>One who gives away what is his own&mdash;as Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.236">Hom. Il. 6.236</bibl>.</note>
					says that Glaucus gave to Diomede <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>golden arms for bronze,</l>
							<l>An hundred beeves' worth for the worth of nine&mdash;</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> cannot be said to suffer injustice; for giving rests with oneself, suffering
					injustice does not&mdash;there has to be another person who acts unjustly.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is clear then that it is not possible to suffer injustice voluntarily.</p>
				<p>There still remain two of the questions that we proposed to discuss:
					&lpar;1&rpar; Is it ever he who gives the unduly large share, or is it always he
					who receives it, that is guilty of the injustice? and &lpar;2&rpar; Can one act
					unjustly towards oneself?<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If the former alternative is possible, that is, if it may be the giver and not the
					receiver of too large a share who acts unjustly, then when a man knowingly and voluntarily
					assigns a larger share to another than to himself&mdash; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> as modest people are thought to do, for an equitable man is apt to
					take less than his due&mdash;this is a case of acting unjustly towards oneself. But
					perhaps this also requires qualification. For the man who gave himself the smaller share
					may possibly have got a larger share of some other good thing, for instance glory, or
					intrinsic moral nobility. Also the inference may be refuted by referring to our definition
					of acting unjustly: in the case supposed, the distributor has nothing done to him against
					his wish; therefore he does not suffer injustice merely because he gets the smaller share:
					at most he only suffers damage.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And it is clear that the giver as well as the receiver of an undue share may be acting
					unjustly, and that the receiver is not doing so in all cases. For the charge of injustice
					attaches, not to a man of whom it can be said that he does what is unjust, but to one of
					whom it can be said that he does this voluntarily, that is to say one from whom the action
					originates; and the origin of the act in this case lies in the giver and not in the
					receiver of the share.<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p> Again, &lsquo;to do a thing&rsquo; has more than one meaning. In a certain sense
					a murder is done by the inanimate instrument, or by the murderer's hand, or by a slave
					acting under orders. But though these do what is unjust, they cannot be said to act
					unjustly.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is not clear whether this is meant to
						apply, in certain circumstances, to the distributor, or to the receiver, or to both.</note>
					<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, although if a judge has given an unfair judgement in ignorance, he is not guilty
					of injustice, nor is the judgement unjust, in the legal sense of justice &lpar;though
					the judgement is unjust in one sense, for legal justice is different from justice in the
					primary sense&rpar;, yet if he knowingly gives an unjust judgement, <milestone n="1137a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>he is himself taking
					more than his share, either of favor or of vengeance. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>Hence a judge who gives an unjust judgement for these motives takes more than his due
					just as much as if he shared the proceeds of the injustice; for even a judge who assigns a
					piece of land on that condition does not receive land but money.<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Men think that it is in their power to act unjustly and therefore that it is easy to be
					just. But really this is not so. It is easy to lie with one's neighbor's wife or strike a
					bystander or slip some money into a man's hand, and it is in one's power to do these
					things or not; but to do them as a result of a certain disposition of mind is not easy,
					and is not in one's power. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Similarly men suppose it
					requires no special wisdom to know what is just and what is unjust, because it is not
					difficult to understand the pronouncements of the law. But the actions prescribed by law
					are only accidentally just actions. <emph>How</emph> an action must be performed,
					<emph>how</emph> a distribution must be made to be a just action or a just
					distribution&mdash;to know this is a harder task than to know what medical treatment
					will produce health. Even in medicine, though it is easy to know what honey, wine and
					hellebore, cautery and surgery are, to know how and to whom and when to apply them so as
					to effect a cure is no less an undertaking than to be a physician. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>And for this very reason<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., that
						acting unjustly is in our own power, 9.14.</note> men think that the just man will act
					unjustly no less than justly, because the just man is not less but rather more able than
					another to do any particular unjust thing: for example, he <emph>can</emph>
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> lie with a woman, or strike a blow, and a brave man
					<emph>can</emph> throw away his shield, and <emph>can</emph> wheel to the right or left
					and run away. But to be a coward and to be guilty of injustice consists not in doing these
					things &lpar;except accidentally&rpar;, but in doing them from a certain
					disposition of mind; just as to be a physician and cure one's patients is not a matter of
					employing or not employing surgery or drugs, but of doing so in a certain
					manner.<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Claims of justice exist between persons who share in things generally speaking good, and
					who can have too large a share or too small a share of them. There are persons who cannot
					have too large a share of these goods: doubtless, for example, the gods. And there are
					those who can derive no benefit from any share of them: namely, the incurably vicious; to
					them all the things generally good are harmful. But for others they are beneficial within
					limits; and this is the case with ordinary mortals.<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have next to speak of Equity and the equitable, and of their relation to Justice and
					to what is just respectively. For upon examination it appears that Justice and Equity are
					neither absolutely identical nor generically different. Sometimes, it is true, we praise
					equity and the equitable man, so much so that we even apply the word
					&lsquo;equitable&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">e)pieike/s</foreign> in some contexts means &lsquo;suitable&rsquo; or
						&lsquo;reasonable.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1137b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>as a term of
					approval to other things besides what is just, and use it as the equivalent of
					&lsquo;good,&rsquo; denoting by &lsquo;more equitable&rsquo; merely that a
					thing is better. Yet at other times, when we think the matter out, it seems strange that
					the equitable should be praiseworthy if it is something other than the just. If they are
					different, either the just or the equitable is not good; if both are good, they are the
					same thing.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These then are the considerations, more or less, from which the difficulty as to the
					equitable arises. Yet they are all in a manner correct, and not really inconsistent. For
					equity, while superior to one sort of justice, is itself just: it is not superior to
					justice as being generically different from it. Justice and equity are therefore the same
					thing, and both are good, though equity is the better.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The source of the difficulty is that equity, though just, is not legal justice, but a
					rectification of legal justice. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The reason for this is
					that law is always a general statement, yet there are cases which it is not possible to
					cover in a general statement. In matters therefore where, while it is necessary to speak
					in general terms, it is not possible to do so correctly, the law takes into consideration
					the majority of cases, although it is not unaware of the error this involves. And this
					does not make it a wrong law; for the error is not in the law nor in the lawgiver, but in
					the nature of the case: the material of conduct is essentially irregular. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When therefore the law lays down a general rule, and
					thereafter a case arises which is an exception to the rule, it is then right, where the
					Iawgiver's pronouncement because of its absoluteness is defective and erroneous, to
					rectify the defect by deciding as the lawgiver would himself decide if he were present on
					the occasion, and would have enacted if he had been cognizant of the case in question.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Hence, while the equitable is just, and is superior to
					one sort of justice, it is not superior to absolute justice, but only to the error due to
					its absolute statement. This is the essential nature of the equitable: it is a
					rectification of law where law is defective because of its generality. In fact this is the
					reason why things are not all determined by law: it is because there are some cases for
					which it is impossible to lay down a law, so that a special ordinance becomes necessary.
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>For what is itself indefinite can only be measured by
					an indefinite standard, like the leaden rule<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Explained
						either as used in building with polygonal stones &lpar;but this was not peculiar to
						<placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>&rpar;, or in making the Lesbian
						form of moulding, which had a double curve.</note> used by Lesbian builders; just as
					that rule is not rigid but can be bent to the shape of the stone, so a special ordinance
					is made to fit the circumstances of the case.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is now plain what the equitable is, and that it is just, and that it is superior to
					one sort of justice. And from this it is clear what the equitable man is: he is one who by
					choice and habit does what is equitable, and <milestone n="1138a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>who does not stand on his rights unduly, but is
					content to receive a smaller share although he has the law on his side. And the
					disposition described is Equity; it is a special kind of Justice, not a different quality
					altogether.<milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The foregoing discussion has indicated the answer to the question, Is it possible or not
					for a man to commit injustice against himself? &lpar;1&rpar; One class of just
					actions consists of those acts, in accordance with any virtue, which are ordained by
					law.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The argument seems to be, that suicide does not
						prove the possibility of a man's committing &lsquo;injustice,&rsquo; in the
						wider sense of any illegal injury, against himself. Suicide is an act of injustice in
						this sense, since it is the voluntary infliction of bodily harm not in retaliation and
						therefore contrary to law; but it is an offense not against oneself but against the
						State, since it is punished as such.</note> For instance, the law does not sanction
					suicide &lpar;and what<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;and
						any form of homicide that it does not expressly permit.&rsquo;</note> it does not
					expressly sanction, it forbids&rpar;. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Further, when a
					man voluntarily &lpar;which means with knowledge of the person affected and the
					instrument employed&rpar; does an injury &lpar;not in retaliation&rpar; that
					is against the law, he commits injustice. But he who kills himself in a fit of passion,
					voluntarily does an injury &lpar;against the right principle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the principle of retaliation.</note>&rpar; which the law does
					not allow. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Therefore the suicide commits injustice; but
					against whom? It seems to be against the state rather than against himself; for he suffers
					voluntarily, and nobody suffers injustice voluntarily. This is why the state exacts a
					penalty; suicide is punished by certain marks of dishonor,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> a suicide's hand was
						buried apart from the body; <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.244">Aeschin. 3.244</bibl>.</note> as
					being an offense against the state.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Moreover, it is not possible to act unjustly towards oneself in the
					sense in which a man is unjust who is a doer of injustice only and not universally wicked.
					&lpar;This case is distinct from the former, because Injustice in one sense is a
					special form of wickedness, like Cowardice, and does not imply universal wickedness; hence
					it is necessary further to show that a man cannot commit injustice against himself in this
					sense either.&rpar; For &lpar;a&rpar; if it were, it would be possible for the
					same thing to have been taken away from and added to the same thing at the same time. But
					this is impossible: <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> justice and injustice always
					necessarily imply more than one person. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Again
					&lpar;b&rpar; an act of injustice must be voluntary and done from choice, and also
					unprovoked; we do not think that a man acts unjustly if having suffered he retaliates, and
					gives what he got. But when a man injures himself, he both does and suffers the same thing
					at the same time. Again &lpar;c&rpar; if a man could act unjustly towards himself,
					it would be possible to suffer injustice voluntarily. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Furthermore &lpar;d&rpar; no one is guilty of injustice without committing some
					particular unjust act; but a man cannot commit adultery with his own wife, or burglary on
					his own premises, or theft of his own property.</p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; And generally, the question, Can a man act unjustly towards
					himself? is solved by our decision upon the question, Can a man suffer injustice
					voluntarily?<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;It is further manifest that, though both to suffer and to do injustice are
					evils&mdash;for the former is to have less and the latter to have more than the mean,
					corresponding<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause has no grammatical
						connection with the rest of the sentence; Ramsauer brackets it, Rassow supplies before
						it <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ dikaiopragei=n me/son</foreign>, &lsquo;whereas
						just conduct is a mean.&rsquo;</note> to what is health-giving in medicine and
					conducive to fitness in athletic training&mdash;nevertheless to do injustice is the
					worse evil, for it is reprehensible, implying vice in the agent, and vice utter and
					absolute&mdash;or nearly so, for it is true that not every unjust act voluntarily
					committed implies vice&mdash;, whereas to suffer injustice does not necessarily imply
					vice or injustice in the victim. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Thus in itself to suffer
					injustice is the lesser evil, <milestone n="1138b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>though accidentally it may be the greater. With this however science
					is not concerned; science pronounces pIeurisy a more serious disorder than a sprain, in
					spite of the fact that in certain circumstances a sprain may be accidentally worse than
					pleurisy, as for instance if it should happen that owing to a sprain you fell and in
					consequence of falling were taken by the enemy and killed.&rpar; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In a metaphorical and analogical sense however there is such a thing as justice, not
					towards oneself but between different parts of one's nature; not, it is true, justice in
					the full sense of the term, but such justice as subsists between master and slave, or
					between the head of a household and his wife and children. For in the discourses on this
					question<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Plato's <title>Republic</title> and the
						writings of Plato's followers: cf. 1.13.9.</note> a distinction is set up between the
					rational and irrational parts of the soul; and this is what leads people to suppose that
					there is such a thing as injustice towards oneself, because these parts of the self may be
					thwarted in their respective desires, so that there may be a sort of justice between them,
					such as exists between ruler and subject.<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>So much may be said in description of Justice and of the other Moral Virtues.</p>

				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>We have already said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. Bk. 2.6 esp. 6.15.</note>
					that it is right to choose the mean and to avoid excess and deficiency, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and that the mean is prescribed by the right principle. Let us now
					analyze the latter notion.</p>
				<p>In the case of each of the moral qualities or dispositions that have been discussed, as
					with all the other virtues also, there is a certain mark to aim at, on which the man who
					knows the principle involved fixes his gaze, and increases or relaxes the tension<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words denote tightening and loosening a bowstring, and
						also tuning a lyre. The former image is suggested by the preceding words, but the latter
						perhaps is a better metaphor for that avoidance of the too much and the too little
						which, according to Aristotle, constitutes right conduct.</note> accordingly; there is a
					certain standard determining those modes of observing the mean which we define as lying
					between excess and defect, being in conformity with the right principle. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This bare statement however, although
					true, is not at all enlightening. In all departments of human endeavor that have been
					reduced to a science, it is true to say that effort ought to be exerted and relaxed
					neither too much nor too little, but to the medium amount, and as the right principle
					decides. Yet a person knowing this truth will be no wiser than before: for example, he
					will not know what medicines to take merely from being told to take everything that
					medical science or a medical expert would prescribe. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Hence with respect to the qualities of the soul also,
					it is not enough merely to have established the truth of the above formula; we also have
					to define exactly what the right principle is, and what is the standard that determines
					it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 6 thus purports to explain further the
						definition of Moral Virtue &lpar;2.615&rpar;, while at the same time

				<p>Now we have divided the Virtues of the Soul into two groups, <milestone n="1139a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>the Virtues of the Character
					and the Virtues of the Intellect. The former, the Moral Virtues, we have already
					discussed. Our account of the latter must be prefaced by some remarks about
					psychology.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It has been said before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.13.9.</note> that the soul
					has two parts, one rational and the other irrational. Let us now similarly divide the
					rational part, and let it be assumed that there are two rational faculties, one whereby we
					contemplate those things whose first principles are invariable, and one whereby we
					contemplate those things which admit of variation: since, on the assumption that knowledge
					is based on a likeness or affinity of some sort between subject and object, the parts of
					the soul adapted to the cognition of objects that are of different kinds must themselves
					differ in kind. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>These
					two rational faculties may be designated the Scientific Faculty and the Calculative
					Faculty respectively; since calculation is the same as deliberation, and deliberation is
					never exercised about things that are invariable, so that the Calculative Faculty is a
					separate part of the rational half of the soul.<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have therefore to ascertain what disposition of each of these faculties is the best,
					for that will be the special virtue of each.</p>
				<p>But the virtue of a faculty is related to the special function which that faculty
					performs. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Now there are
					three elements in the soul which control action and the attainment of truth: namely,
					Sensation, Intellect,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> here bears its usual philosophic sense of the intellect, or rational
						part of the &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; as a whole, whose function is <foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>, thought in general. In chap. 6 it is given a special
						and restricted meaning, and this in chap. 9 is related to the popular use of the word to
						denote &lsquo;good sense&rsquo; or practical intelligence.</note> and
					Desire.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Of these, Sensation never originates action, as is shown by the fact that <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> animals have sensation but are not capable of action.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">pra=cis</foreign> means rational
					action, conduct. The movements of animals, Aristotle appears to think, are mere
					reactions to the stimuli of sensation.</note>
				</p>
				<p><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Greenwood
					points out that the passage would be clearer if 2.2 mid.-3, &lsquo;Pursuit . . .
					right desire,&rsquo; and 2.5, &lsquo;Thought by itself . . . desire
					aims,&rsquo; came lower down, after the verse-quotation in 2.6. The earlier part of
					6 is a parenthetical note.</note>Pursuit and avoidance in the sphere of Desire
					correspond to affirmation and denial in the sphere of the Intellect. Hence inasmuch as
					moral virtue is a disposition of the mind in regard to choice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.6.15.</note> and choice is deliberate desire,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">3.3.19.</note> it follows that, if the choice is to be good, both the
					principle must be true and the desire right, and that desire must pursue the same things
					as principle affirms. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>We
					are here speaking of practical thinking, and of the attainment of truth in regard to
					action; with speculative thought, which is not concerned with action or production, right
					and wrong functioning consist in the attainment of truth and falsehood respectively. The
					attainment of truth is indeed the function of every part of the intellect, but that of the
					practical intelligence is the attainment of truth corresponding to right desire.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., truth about the means to the attainment of the
						rightly desired End.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the cause of action &lpar;the efficient, not the final cause&rpar; is
					choice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.2.1 note. Here again <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> seems to mean choice of means, not of ends.</note>
					and the cause of choice is desire and reasoning directed to some end. Hence choice
					necessarily involves both intellect or thought and a certain disposition of character
					&lsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause must be rejected as
						superfluous and logically unsound: the nature of action is explained by that of
						&lsquo;choice,&rsquo; not <foreign lang="la">vice versa.</foreign></note> for
					doing well and the reverse in the sphere of action necessarily involve thought and
					character&rsqb;.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thought by itself however moves nothing, but only thought directed to an end, and dealing
					with action. <milestone n="1139b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>This indeed is the moving cause of productive activity<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For this distinction between making and doing, production and action or
						conduct, see 1.1.2, 5.</note> also, since he who makes some thing always has some
					further end in view: the act of making is not an end in itself, it is only a means, and
					belongs to something else. Whereas a thing done is an end in itself: since doing well
					&lpar;welfare<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See second note on 1.4.
						2.</note>&rpar; is the End, and it is at this that desire aims.</p>
				<p>Hence Choice may be called either thought related to desire or desire related to thought;
					and man, as an originator of action, is a union of desire and intellect.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;Choice is not concerned with what has happened already: for example, no one
					chooses to have sacked <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; for neither does one
					deliberate about what has happened in the past, but about what still lies in the future
					and may happen or not; what has happened cannot be made not to have happened. Hence
					Agathon is right in saying <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>This only is denied even to God,</l>
							<l>The power to make what has been done undone.&rpar;</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> The attainment of truth is then the function of both the intellectual parts of
					the soul. Therefore their respective virtues are those dispositions which will best
					qualify them to attain truth.<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let us then discuss these virtues afresh, going more deeply into the matter.</p>
				<p>Let it be assumed that there are five qualities through which the mind achieves truth in
					affirmation or denial, namely Art or technical skill,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>, Art, as appears below, stands for <foreign lang="greek">eu)texni/a</foreign> and means here craftsmanship of any kind; it
						includes skill in fine art, but is not limited to it.</note> Scientific Knowledge,
					Prudence, Wisdom, and Intelligence. Conception and Opinion are capable of error.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The nature of Scientific Knowledge &lpar;employing the term in its exact sense and
					disregarding its analogous uses&rpar; may be made clear as follows. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> We all conceive that a thing which we know scientifically cannot
					vary; when a thing that can vary is beyond the range of our observation, we do not know
					whether it exists or not. An object of Scientific Knowledge, therefore, exists of
					necessity. It is therefore eternal, for everything existing of absolute necessity is
					eternal; and what is eternal does not come into existence or perish. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Again, it is held that all Scientific
					Knowledge can be communicated by teaching, and that what is scientifically known must be
					learnt. But all teaching starts from facts previously known, as we state in the
					<title>Analytics</title>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.71a.1">Aristot. Post. Anal. 1, 71a 1 ff.</bibl></note> since it
					proceeds either by way of induction, or else by way of deduction. Now induction supplies a
					first principle or universal, deduction works <emph>from</emph> universals; therefore
					there are first principles from which deduction starts, which cannot be proved by
					deduction; therefore they are reached by induction. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Scientific Knowledge, therefore, is the quality
					whereby we demonstrate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Demonstration in
						Aristotle means proof by deduction.</note> with the
					further qualifications included in our definition of it in the
					<title>Analytics</title>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.71b.9">Aristot. Post. Anal. 1, 71b 9 ff.</bibl></note> namely, that
					a man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain
					way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with
					certainty&mdash;for unless he is more certain of his first principles than of the
					conclusion drawn from them he will only possess the knowledge in question
					accidentally.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the conviction may happen to be
						true, but he will not hold it as Scientific Knowledge in the proper sense of the
						term.</note> Let this stand as our definition of Scientific Knowledge. <milestone n="1140a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The class of things that admit of variation includes both things made and actions done.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But making is different from doing &lpar;a
					distinction we may accept from extraneous discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 1.13.9.</note>&rpar;. Hence the rational quality concerned with doing
					is different from the rational quality concerned with making; nor is one of them a part of
					the other, for doing is not a form of making, nor making a form of doing. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now architectural skill, for instance, is an art, and it is also a
					rational quality concerned with making; nor is there any art which is not a rational
					quality concerned with making, nor any such quality which is not an art. It follows that
					an art is the same thing as a rational quality, concerned with making, that reasons truly.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>All Art deals with bringing some thing into existence;
					and to pursue an art means to study how to bring into existence a thing which may either
					exist or not, and the efficient cause of which lies in the maker and not in the thing
					made; for Art does not deal with things that exist or come into existence of necessity, or
					according to nature, since these have their efficient cause in themselves. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But as doing and making are distinct, it follows that Art, being
					concerned with making, is not concerned with doing. And in a sense Art deals with the same
					objects as chance, as Agathon says: <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>Chance is beloved of Art, and Art of Chance.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Art, therefore, as has been said, is a rational quality, concerned with making, that
					reasons truly. Its opposite, Lack of Art, is a rational quality, concerned with making,
					that reasons falsely. Both deal with that which admits of variation.<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We may arrive at a definition of Prudence by considering who are the persons whom we call
					prudent. Now it is held to be the mark of a prudent man to be able to deliberate well
					about what is good and advantageous for himself, not in some one department, for instance
					what is good for his health or strength, but what is advantageous as a means to the good
					life in general. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This is proved by the fact that we also
					speak of people as prudent or wise in some particular thing, when they calculate well with
					a view to attaining some particular end of value &lpar;other than those ends which are
					the object of an art&rpar;; so that the prudent man in general will be the man who is
					good at deliberating in general.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But no one deliberates about things that cannot vary, nor about things not within his
					power to do. Hence inasmuch as scientific knowledge involves demonstration, whereas things
					whose fundamental principles are variable are not capable of demonstration, because
					everything about them is variable, <milestone n="1140b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and inasmuch as one cannot deliberate about things that are of
					necessity, it follows that Prudence is not the same as Science. Nor can it be the same as
					Art. It is not Science, because matters of conduct admit of variation; and not Art,
					because doing and making are generically different,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						words &lsquo;since . . . itself the end&rsquo; in the mss. follow 5.4
						&lsquo;for human beings.&rsquo;</note> since making aims at an end distinct from
					the act of making, whereas in doing the end cannot be other than the act itself: doing
					well<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 1.4.2.</note> is in itself the end.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>It remains therefore that it is a truth-attaining
					rational quality, concerned with action in relation to things that are good and bad for
					human beings.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence men like Pericles are deemed prudent, because they possess a faculty of discerning
					what things are good for themselves and for mankind and that is our conception of an
					expert in Domestic Economy or Political Science.</p>
				<p>&lpar;This also accounts for the word Temperance,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, the quality of the <foreign lang="greek">sw/frwn</foreign> &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">sw=s-frh/n</foreign>&rpar; or
					&lsquo;sound-minded&rsquo; man, Aristotle derives from <foreign lang="greek">sw/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign>. Cf. 8.8.4.</note>
					which signifies &lsquo;preserving prudence.&rsquo; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And Temperance does in fact preserve our belief as to our own good; for pleasure and
					pain do not destroy or pervert all beliefs, for instance, the belief that the three angles
					of a triangle are, or are not, together equal to two right angles, but only beliefs
					concerning action. The first principles of action are the end to which our acts are means;
					but a man corrupted by a love of pleasure or fear of pain, entirely fails to discern any
					first principle,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;to one corrupted by
						pleasure or pain this end does not seem to be a first principle at
						all.&rsquo;</note> and cannot see that he ought to choose and do everything as a means
					to this end, and for its sake; for vice tends to destroy <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the sense of principle.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., to
						destroy our perception of the true end of life, which constitutes the major premise of
						the practical syllogism.</note>&rpar; </p>
				<p>It therefore follows that Prudence is a truth-attaining rational quality, concerned with
					action in relation to the things that are good for human beings.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Moreover, we can speak of excellence in Art,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>, Art, is here &lpar;as in 7.1&rpar; used in a
					neutral sense of a systematic procedure for making something, or a body of principles
					for such a procedure&mdash;one may be good at it or bad; whereas <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign>, Prudence or practical wisdom, itself denotes an
					excellence, not a neutral sphere in which one may excel or the reverse. Elsewhere in the
					book <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign> has the positive sense of artistic
					excellence or technical skill.</note> but not of excellence in Prudence. Also in Art
					voluntary error is not so bad as involuntary, whereas in the sphere of Prudence it is
					worse, as it is in the sphere of the virtues. It is therefore clear that Prudence is an
					excellence or virtue, and not an Art.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Of the two parts of the soul possessed of reason, Prudence must be the virtue of one,
					namely, the part that forms opinions<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Called in 1.6 the
						Calculative Faculty.</note>; for Opinion deals with that which can vary, and so does
					Prudence. But yet Prudence is not a rational quality merely, as shown by the fact that a
					purely rational faculty can be forgotten, whereas a failure in Prudence is not a mere
					lapse of memory.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A loss of Prudence is felt to involve
						a moral lapse, which shows that it is not a purely intellectual quality.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Scientific Knowledge is a mode of conception dealing with universals and things that are
					of necessity; and demonstrated truths and all scientific knowledge &lpar;since this
					involves reasoning&rpar; are derived from first principles. Consequently the first
					principles from which scientific truths are derived cannot themselves be reached by
					Science; nor yet are they apprehended by Art, nor by Prudence. To be matter of Scientific
					Knowledge a truth must be demonstrated by deduction from other truths; <milestone n="1141a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>while Art and
					Prudence are concerned only with things that admit of variation. Nor is Wisdom the
					knowledge of first principles either<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., not
						exclusively: see 7.3.</note>: for the philosopher has to arrive at some things by
					demonstration.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 3.4, first note.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If then the qualities whereby we attain truth,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
					3.1. Art is here omitted from the list.</note> and are never led into falsehood, whether
					about things invariable or things variable, are scientific Knowledge, Prudence, Wisdom,
					and Intelligence, and if the quality which enables us to apprehend first principles cannot
					be any one among three of these, namely Scientific Knowledge, Prudence, and Wisdom, it
					remains that first principles must be apprehended by Intelligence.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> now receives its special sense
						&lpar;see 2.1, note&rpar; of a particular virtue of the intellect, viz. that
						faculty of rational intuition whereby it correctly apprehends &lpar;by process of
						induction, see 3.3&rpar; undemonstrable first principles. It is thus a part of
						<foreign lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign> &lpar;7.3,5&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The term Wisdom is employed in the arts to denote those men who are the most perfect
					masters of their art, for instance, it is applied to Pheidias as a sculptor and to
					Polycleitus as a statuary. In this use then Wisdom merely signifies artistic excellence.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But we also think that some people are wise in general
					and not in one department, not &lsquo;wise in something else,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The sense rather requires &lsquo;wise in some
						particular thing,&rsquo; but the expression is assimilated to the quotation.</note>
					as Homer says in the <title>Margites</title>: <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>Neither a delver nor a ploughman him</l>
							<l>The Gods had made, nor wise in aught beside.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Hence it is clear that Wisdom must be the most perfect of the modes of knowledge.
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The wise man therefore must not only know the
					conclusions that follow from his first principles, but also have a true conception of
					those principles themselves. Hence Wisdom must be a combination of Intelligence and
					Scientific Knowledge<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.1, 2.</note>: it must be a
					consummated knowledge<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;knowledge
						having as it were a head,&rsquo; a phrase copied from Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 505d">Plat. Gorg. 505d</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> of the most exalted<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 7.4, 5, and, for the technical sense of <foreign lang="greek">ti/mios</foreign>, Bk. 1.12.</note> objects. For it is absurd to think that Political
					Science or Prudence is the loftiest kind of knowledge, inasmuch as man is not the highest
					thing in the world. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And as
					&lsquo;wholesome&rsquo; and &lsquo;good&rsquo; mean one thing for men and
					another for fishes, whereas &lsquo;white&rsquo; and &lsquo;straight&rsquo;
					mean the same thing always, so everybody would denote the same thing by
					&lsquo;wise,&rsquo; but not by &lsquo;prudent&rsquo;; for each kind of
					beings will describe as prudent, and will entrust itself to, one who can discern its own
					particular welfare; hence even some of the lower animals are said to be prudent, namely
					those which display a capacity for forethought as regards their own lives.</p>
				<p>It is also clear that Wisdom cannot be the same thing as Political Science; for if we are
					to call knowledge of our own interests wisdom, there will be a number of different kinds
					of wisdom, one for each species: there cannot be a single such wisdom dealing with the
					good of all living things, any more than there is one art of medicine for all existing
					things. It may be argued that man is superior to the other animals, but this makes no
					difference: since there exist other things far more divine in their nature than man,
					<milestone n="1141b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for
					instance, to mention the most visible, the things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						means apparently the sun, stars, and planets, elsewhere referred to by Aristotle as
						&lsquo;the divine bodies that move through the heaven,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
						visible divine things,&rsquo; &lsquo;the heaven and the most divine of visible
						things&rsquo; &lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1074a.30">Aristot. Met. 1074a
							30</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 6.1026a.18">Aristot. Met. 1026a 18</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 196a.33">Aristot. Phys. 196a 33</bibl>&rpar;.</note> of which the
					celestial system is composed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These considerations therefore show that Wisdom is both Scientific Knowledge and
					Intuitive Intelligence as regards the things of the most exalted<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 7.3, third note.</note> nature. This is why people say that men like
					Anaxagoras and Thales<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Thales was the first of the
						Seven Wise Men: Anaxagoras belonged to a later generation.</note> &lsquo;may be wise
					but are not prudent,&rsquo; when they see them display ignorance of their own
					interests; and while admitting them to possess a knowledge that is rare, marvellous,
					difficult and even superhuman, they yet declare this knowledge to be useless, because
					these sages do not seek to know the things that are good for human beings. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Prudence on the other hand is concerned with the affairs of men,
					and with things that can be the object of deliberation. For we say that to deliberate well
					is the most characteristic function of the prudent man; but no one deliberates about
					things that cannot vary nor yet about variable things that are not a means to some end,
					and that end a good attainable by action; and a good deliberator in general is a man who
					can arrive by calculation at the best of the goods attainable by man.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nor is Prudence a knowledge of general principles only: it must also take account of
					particular facts, since it is concerned with action, and action deals with particular
					things. This is why men who are ignorant of general principles are sometimes more
					successful in action than others who know them: <note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						words &lsquo;for instance . . . chicken is wholesome&rsquo; in the mss. come
						after &lsquo;theorists.&rsquo;</note> for instance, if a man knows that light
					meat is easily digested and therefore wholesome, but does not know what kinds of meat are
					light, he will not be so likely to restore you to health <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> as a man who merely knows that chicken is wholesome; and in other
					matters men of experience are more successful than theorists. And Prudence is concerned
					with action, so one requires both forms of it, or indeed knowledge of particular facts
					even more than knowledge of general principles. Though here too there must be some supreme
					directing faculty.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., <foreign lang="greek">politikh/</foreign>, Political Science or Statesmanship &lpar;cf. Bk. 1.1,
						2&rpar;, the relation of which to Prudence is next considered.</note>
					<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Prudence is indeed the same quality of mind as Political Science, though their essence is
					different.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 5.1.20. Political Wisdom is not a
						special sort of Prudence but a special application of it, for though the term
						&lsquo;Prudence&rsquo; is in ordinary usage confined to practical wisdom in
						one's private affairs, it really extends to the affairs of one's family and of the
						community.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Of Prudence as regards the state, one kind, as supreme
					and directive, is called Legislative Science<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the
						Greek city-state legislature was not regarded as the normal function of parliament, but
						of a founder or reformer of the constitution, or of a special legislative
						commission.</note>; the other, as dealing with particular occurrences, has the name,
					Political Science, that really belongs to both kinds. The latter is concerned with action
					and deliberation &lpar;for a parliamentary enactment is a thing to be done, being the
					last step<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.3.12.</note> in a deliberative
					process&rpar;, and this is why it is only those persons who deal with particular facts
					who are spoken of as &lsquo;taking part in politics,&rsquo; because it is only
					they who perform actions, like the workmen in an industry.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In contrast with the law-giver and the master-craftsman respectively.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Prudence also is commonly understood to mean especially
					that kind of wisdom which is concerned with oneself, the individual; and this is given the
					name, Prudence, which really belongs to all the kinds, while the others are distinguished
					as Domestic Economy, Legislature, and Political Science, the latter being subdivided into
					Deliberative Science and Judicial Science. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now knowledge
					of one's own interest will certainly be one kind of Prudence; though it is very different
					from the other kinds, <milestone n="1142a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and people think that the man who knows and minds his own business
					is prudent, and that politicians are busybodies: thus Euripides writes&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>Would that be prudent? when I might have lived</l>

					probably as a matter of fact a man cannot pursue his own welfare without Domestic Economy
					and even Politics. Moreover, even the proper conduct of one's own affairs is a difficult
					problem, and requires consideration.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>A further proof of what has been said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference
					seems to be to 7.7, where it is stated that Prudence takes cognizance of particular
					facts. The intervening passage, examining the relation of Prudence to Political Science,
					emphasizes its other aspect, the apprehension of general principles.</note> is, that
					although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of
					knowledge, we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence. The reason is that
					Prudence includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience,
					which a young man does not a possess; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>for experience is
					the fruit of years.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek looks like a buried verse

						Wisdom.</note> Perhaps the answer is that Mathematics deals with abstractions, whereas the
					first principles of Metaphysics and Natural Philosophy are derived from experience: the

					their truth,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Immelmann's emendation gives
						&lsquo;can only take them on credit from others.&rsquo;</note> whereas the
					formal concepts of Mathematics are easily understood.&rpar; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Again, in deliberation there is a double possibility of error: you may
					go wrong either in your general principle or in your particular fact: for instance, either
					in asserting that all heavy water is unwholesome, or that the particular water in question

				<p>And it is clear that Prudence is not the same as Scientific Knowledge: for as has been
					said, it apprehends ultimate particular things, since the thing to be done is an ultimate
					particular thing.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.2 above, 7.7, and 3.3.12.</note>
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Prudence then stands opposite to Intelligence; for Intelligence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See notes on 6.2 and 11.4. Definitions are the first principles of
					science.</note> apprehends definitions, which cannot be proved by reasoning, while
					Prudence deals with the ultimate particular thing, which cannot be apprehended by
					Scientific Knowledge, but only by perception: not the perception of the special
					senses,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;of the objects peculiar
						to the special senses.&rsquo; Shape was one of the &lsquo;common
						sensibles,&rsquo; perceived through the medium of more than one of the special
						senses, by the &lsquo;common sense.&rsquo;</note> but the sort of intuition
					whereby we perceive that the ultimate figure in mathematics is a triangle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A triangle is the last form into which a rectilinear
						figure can be divided: two straight lines cannot enclose a space. Or the words may
						possibly mean &lsquo;whereby we perceive that a particular mathematical figure is

					<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>We ought also to

				<p>Now it is not Knowledge: for men do not investigate matters about which they know,
					<milestone n="1142b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>whereas
					Deliberative Excellence is one form of deliberation, and deliberating implies
					investigating and calculating. But deliberation is not the same as investigation: it is
					the investigation of a particular subject.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz.,
						matters of conduct.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Nor yet is it skill in Conjecture: for this operates without conscious calculation, and
					rapidly, whereas deliberating takes a long time, and there is a proverb that execution
					should be swift but deliberation slow. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Again,
					Deliberative Excellence is not the same as Quickness of mind,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">a)gxi/noia</foreign> appears from <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.33">Aristot. Post. Anal. 1.33, 89b 10</bibl>, to denote the faculty
						of guessing immediately the &lsquo;middle term&rsquo; or fact which explains the
						relation observed between two objects.</note> which is a form of skill in Conjecture.</p>
				<p>Nor yet is Deliberative Excellence any form of Opinion.</p>
				<p>But inasmuch as a bad deliberator makes mistakes and a good deliberator deliberates
					correctly,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be emended to read
						`inasmuch as one who deliberates badly goes wrong and one who deliberates well acts
						rightly.&rsquo;</note> it is clear that Deliberative Excellence is some form of
					correctness; though it is not correctness of Knowledge, nor of Opinion. Correctness cannot
					be predicated of Knowledge,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., correct knowledge is
						a redundant expression; knowledge <emph>means</emph> correct notions; erroneous notions
						are not knowledge.</note> any more than can error, and correctness of Opinion is truth;
					and also any matter about which one has an opinion has been settled already;
					&lsqb;then again Deliberative Excellence necessarily involves conscious calculation.
					It remains therefore that Deliberative Excellence is correctness in thinking, for thought
					has not reached the stage of affirmation;&rsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						two sentences bracketed interrupt the argument. The rest seems to belong to 9.2, though
						it does not fit in there exactly. The second is altogether irrelevant, and employs the
						term <foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign> of the intellect as enquiring, not as
						contemplating the results of enquiry, a Platonic use not found elsewhere in
						Aristotle: &lsquo;correctness in thinking&rsquo;
						here is in fact equivalent to &lsquo;correctness in deliberation&rsquo; in
						9.4.</note> for Opinion has passed beyond the stage of investigation and is a form of
					affirmation, whereas a man deliberating, whether he deliberates well or badly, is
					investigating and calculating something.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But Deliberative Excellence is a form of correctness in deliberation &lsqb;so that we
					have first to investigate what deliberation is, and what object it deals
					with&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The sentence bracketed interrupts the
						argument; and no examination of deliberation follows.</note> However,
					&lsquo;correctness&rsquo; in this connection is ambiguous, and plainly it is not
					every kind of correctness in deliberation that constitutes Deliberative Excellence. A man
					of deficient self-restraint or a bad man may as a result of calculation arrive at the
					object he proposes as the right thing to do, so that he will have deliberated correctly,
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> although he will have gained something extremely
					evil; whereas to have deliberated well is felt to be a good thing. Therefore it is this
					kind of correctness in deliberation that is Deliberative Excellence, namely being correct
					in the sense of arriving at something good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No
						distinction seems to be made between arriving at the right conclusion of a practical
						syllogism, i.e., inferring correctly what is to be done as a means to some End, and
						actually achieving that End by action.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it is possible to arrive at a good conclusion, as well as at a bad one, by a false
					process of reasoning; one may arrive at what is the right thing to do, but not arrive at
					it on the right grounds, but by means of a wrong middle term. This quality then, which
					leads one to arrive at the right conclusion, but not on the right grounds, is still not
					Deliberative Excellence.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, one man may arrive at the right conclusion by prolonged deliberation, while
					another may do so quickly. The former case also then does not amount to Deliberative
					Excellence; this is correctness of deliberation as regards what is advantageous, arriving
					at the right conclusion on the right grounds at the right time.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At the right time, because deliberation must neither be so prolonged as
						to miss the opportunity for action, not so rapid as to be merely skillful conjecture;
						see 9.2.</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, a man can be said to have deliberated well<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., to be well-counselled, to know what steps to take: cf. 9.4.</note> either
					generally, or in reference to a particular end. Deliberative Excellence in general is
					therefore that which leads to correct results with reference to the end in general, while
					correctness of deliberation with a view to some particular end is Deliberative Excellence
					of some special kind.</p>
				<p>If therefore to have deliberated well is a characteristic of prudent men, Deliberative
					Excellence must be correctness of deliberation with regard to what is expedient as a means
					to the end, a true conception of which<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The antecedent
						of &lsquo;which&rsquo; is probably not &lsquo;the end&rsquo; but
						&lsquo;what is expedient as a means to the end,&rsquo; since it is indicated
						below that Prudence deals with means, not ends. The difference therefore between
						Deliberative Excellence and Prudence seems to that the former is the intellectual
						quality displayed in the process of correctly investigation a problem of conduct, the
						later the more permanent and fixed quality of the mind possessing and contemplating the
						results of such investigations. Or perhaps more strictly both these qualities are
						included in Prudence, of which Deliberative Excellence is therefore one aspect or
						species.</note> constitutes Prudence.<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Understanding, or Good Understanding, <milestone n="1143a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>the quality in virtue of which we call men &lsquo;persons
					of understanding&rsquo; or &lsquo;of good understanding,&rsquo; is not the
					same thing as Scientific Knowledge in general &lpar;nor yet is it the same as Opinion,
					for in that case everybody would have understanding&rpar;, nor is it any one of the
					particular sciences, as medicine is the science of what pertains to health and geometry
					the science concerned with magnitudes. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For Understanding
					does not deal with the things that exist for ever and are immutable, nor yet with all of
					the things that come into existence, but with those about which one may be in doubt and
					may deliberate. Hence it is concerned with the same objects as Prudence. Understanding is
					not however the same thing as Prudence; for Prudence issues commands, since its end is a
					statement of what we ought to do or not to do, whereas Understanding merely makes
					judgements. &lpar;For Understanding is the same as Good Understanding; a
					&lsquo;man of understanding&rsquo; means a man of good
					understanding.&rpar;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthesis would come
						better in the first section, after the words &lsquo;of good
						understanding.&rsquo; It merely points out that the qualification
						&lsquo;good&rsquo; need not be repeated.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus Understanding does not mean either the possession or the acquisition of Prudence;
					but when we employ the faculty of Opinion to <emph>judge</emph> what another person says
					about matters that are in the sphere of Prudence, we are said to <emph>understand</emph>
					&lpar;that is, to judge rightly for <emph>right</emph> judgement is the same as
					<emph>good</emph> understanding&rpar;, in the same way as learning a thing is termed
					<emph>understanding</emph> it when we are employing the faculty of Scientific Knowledge.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>In fact, the use of the term Understanding to denote
					the quality that makes men &lsquo;persons of good understanding&rsquo; is derived
					from understanding as shown in learning; in fact we often use &lsquo;to
					learn&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;to understand.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">manqa/nein</foreign> is idiomatically used of
						understanding what another person says.</note>
					<milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The quality termed Consideration,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer here
					strains the meaning of words by connecting under one sense &lpar;1&rpar;
					<foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, judgement in general or good judgement in
					particular, and its derivatives &lpar;2&rpar; <foreign lang="greek">eu)gnw/mwn</foreign>, &lsquo;well-judging&rsquo; in the sense of considerate
					and kindly, and &lpar;3&rpar; <foreign lang="greek">suggnw/mh</foreign>,
					literally &lsquo;judgement with&rsquo; or on the side of others, and hence,
					sympathy, lenience, forgiveness.</note> in virtue of which men are said to be
					considerate, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> or to show consideration for others
					&lpar;forgiveness&rpar;, is the faculty of judging correctly what is equitable.
					This is indicated by our saying that the equitable man is specially considerate for others
					&lpar;forgiving&rpar;, and that it is equitable to show consideration for others
					&lpar;forgiveness&rpar; in certain cases; but consideration for others is that
					consideration which judges rightly what is equitable, judging <emph>rightly</emph> meaning
					judging what is <emph>truly</emph> equitable.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>All these qualities, it is reasonable to say, refer to the same thing; indeed we
					attribute Considerateness, Understanding, Prudence, and Intelligence to the same persons
					when we say of people that they &lsquo;are old enough to show consideration and
					intelligence,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., &lsquo;have
						reached years of discretion&rsquo;; cf. 11.6 and 8.12.2.</note> and are prudent and
					understanding persons. For all these faculties deal with ultimate and particular things;
					and a man has understanding and is considerate, or considerate for others, when he is a
					good judge of the matters in regard to which Prudence is displayed<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This has been proved for &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; and
						&lsquo;the sensible man&rsquo; in chap. 10; it is extended to
						&lsquo;considerateness&rsquo; in the words that follow: considerateness judges
						correctly what is equitable, equity is an element in all virtuous conduct towards
						others, and all virtuous conduct is determined by Prudence.</note>; because equitable
					actions are common to all good men<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the possessors
						of each of the moral virtues.</note> in their behavior towards others, <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>while on the other hand all matters of conduct belong to the class of
					particular and ultimate things &lpar;since the prudent man admittedly has to take
					cognizance of these things&rpar;, and Understanding and Consideration deal with
					matters of conduct, which are ultimate.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Also Intelligence
					apprehends the ultimates in both aspects&mdash;since ultimates as well as primary
					definitions<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 8.9.</note>
					<milestone n="1143b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>are grasped
					by Intelligence and not reached by reasoning: in demonstrations, Intelligence apprehends
					the immutable and primary definitions, in practical inferences,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The substantive to be understood may be <foreign lang="greek">prota/sesi</foreign>, &lsquo;propositions&rsquo;; but the reference seems to be
						not to the practical syllogism in the ordinary sense &lpar;see 7.3.9&rpar;, but
						to the establishment of ethical <foreign lang="greek">a)rxai/</foreign> by induction,
						which is the proper method of Ethics &lpar;1.4.5-7&rpar;. This induction is
						conceived as a syllogism &lpar;cf. <bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.23">Aristot. Pr. Anal.
							2.23</bibl>.&rpar;: Actions A, B, C . . . are desirable; Actions A, B, C . .
						.possess the quality Z; therefore all actions possessing the quality Z are desirable.
						Here both the major and the minor premise are sets of particular propositions
						intuitively seen to be true: <foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">tw=n e)sxa/twn e)p' a)mfo/tera</foreign>.</note> it apprehends the
					ultimate and contingent fact, and the minor, premise, since these are the first principles
					from which the end is inferred, as general rules are based on particular cases; hence we
					must have perception of particulars, and this immediate perception is Intelligence.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here the intuitive element in Prudence, as well as in
						Wisdom &lpar;chaps. 5, 6.&rpar;, is termed Intelligence: at 8.9 it was called
						merely Prudence, in contrast with Intelligence, which was limited to intuition of the
						first principles of science. Here then <foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>
						approximates to its popular sense &lpar;see 12.3, note&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This is why it is thought that these qualities are a natural gift, and that a man is
					considerate, understanding and intelligent by nature, though no one is a wise man by
					nature. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>That this is so is indicated by our thinking of
					them as going with certain ages: we say that at such and such an age a man must have got
					intelligence and considerateness, which implies that they come by nature.</p>
				<p>&lsqb;Hence Intelligence is both a beginning and an end, for these things are both
					the starting-point and the subject matter of demonstration.&rsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence seems irrelevant here. It might come in after 11.4.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Consequently the unproved assertions and opinions of experienced and elderly people, or
					of prudent men,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This addition is auspicious: no one can
						become prudent merely by getting old &lpar;
						Burnet&rpar;.</note> are as much deserving of attention as those which
					they support by proof; for experience has given them an eye for things, and so they see
					correctly.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have now discussed the nature and respective spheres of Prudence and Wisdom, and have
					shown that each is the virtue of a different part of the soul.<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the further question may be raised, What is the use of these intellectual virtues?
					Wisdom does not consider the means to human happiness at all, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for it does not ask how anything comes into existence. Prudence, it
					must be granted, does do this; but what do we need it for? seeing that it studies that
					which is just and noble and good for man, but these are the things that a good man does by
					nature. Knowing about them does not make us any more capable of doing them, since the
					virtues are qualities of character; just as is the case with the knowledge of what is
					healthy and vigorous&mdash;using these words to mean not productive of health and
					vigor but resulting from them: we are not rendered any more capable of healthy and
					vigorous action by knowing the science of medicine or of physical training.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If on the other hand we are to say that Prudence is useful not in helping us to act
					virtuously but in helping us to become virtuous, then it is of no use to those who are
					virtuous already. Nor is it of any use either to those who are not, since we may just as
					well take the advice of others who possess Prudence as possess Prudence ourselves. We may
					be content to do as we do in regard to our health; we want to be healthy, yet we do not
					learn medicine.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Moreover it would seem strange if Prudence, which is inferior to Wisdom, is nevertheless
					to have greater authority than Wisdom: yet the faculty that creates a thing<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 13.8, where it is implied that Prudence stands in the
						same relation to Wisdom as medicine to health: it provides the conditions for its
						development.</note> governs and gives orders to it.</p>
				<p>Let us now therefore discuss these difficulties, which so far have only been stated.
					<milestone n="1144a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/></p>
				<p><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>First then let us assert that Wisdom and Prudence, being
					as they are the virtues of the two parts of the intellect respectively, are necessarily
					desirable in themselves, even if neither produces any effect.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Secondly, they do in fact produce an effect: Wisdom produces Happiness, not in the sense
					in which medicine produces health, but in the sense in which healthiness is the cause of
					health. For Wisdom is a part of Virtue as a whole, and therefore by its possession, or
					rather by its exercise, renders a man happy.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also Prudence as well as Moral Virtue determines the complete performance of man's proper
					function: Virtue ensures the rightness of the end we aim at, Prudence ensures the
					rightness of the means we adopt to gain that end.</p>
				<p>&lpar;The fourth part<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The other three are the
					scientific, calculative, and appetitive parts, see 1.5,6, whose virtues have now been
					considered in Books 2-6. Sensation is here omitted, since it is not peculiar to man: cf.
					1.7.12.</note> of the soul on the other hand, the nutritive faculty, has no virtue
					contributing to the proper function of man, since it has no power to act or not to
					act.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Digestion and growth function automatically, not
						voluntarily; so they form no part of conduct.</note>&rpar;<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But we must go a little deeper into the objection that Prudence does not render men more
					capable of performing noble and just actions. Let us start with the following
					consideration. As some people, we maintain, perform just acts and yet are not just men
					&lpar;for instance, those who do what the law enjoins but do it unwillingly, or in
					ignorance, or for some ulterior object, and not for the sake of the actions themselves,
					although they are as a matter of fact doing what they ought to do and all that a good man
					should&rpar;, on the other hand it appears, there is a state of mind in which a man
					may do these various acts with the result that he really is a good man: I mean when he
					does them from choice, and for the sake <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> of the acts
					themselves. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Now rightness in our choice of an end is
					secured by Virtue<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., Moral Virtue.</note>; but to do
					the actions that must in the nature of things be done in order to attain the end we have
					chosen, is not a matter for Virtue but for a different faculty.</p>
				<p>We must dwell on this point to make it more clear. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>There
					is a certain faculty called Cleverness, which is the capacity for doing the things
					aforesaid that conduce to the aim we propose, and so attaining that aim. If the aim is
					noble, this is a praiseworthy faculty: if base, it is mere knavery; this is how we come to
					speak of both prudent men and knaves as clever. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Now this
					faculty is not identical with Prudence, but Prudence implies it. But that eye of the soul
					of which we spoke<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 11.6 and cf. 1.6.12.</note>
					cannot acquire the quality of Prudence without possessing Virtue. This we have said
					before, and it is manifestly true. For deductive inferences about matters of conduct
					always have a major premise of the form &lsquo;Since the End or Supreme Good is so and
					so&rsquo; &lpar;whatever it may be, since we may take it as anything we like for
					the sake of the argument&rpar;; but the Supreme Good only appears good to the good
					man: vice perverts the mind and causes it to hold false views about the first principles
					of conduct. Hence it is clear that we cannot be prudent without being good. <milestone n="1144b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/></p>
				<p><milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>We have therefore also
					to reconsider the nature of Virtue. The fact is that the case of Virtue is closely
					analogous to that of Prudence in relation to Cleverness. Prudence and Cleverness are not
					the same, but they are similar; and natural virtue is related in the same way to Virtue in
					the true sense. All are agreed that the various moral qualities are in a sense bestowed by
					nature: we are just, and capable of temperance, and brave, and possessed of the other
					virtues from the moment of our birth. But nevertheless we expect to find that true
					goodness is something different, and that the virtues in the true sense come to belong to
					us in another way. For even children and wild animals possess the natural dispositions,
					yet without Intelligence these may manifestly be harmful. This at all events appears to be
					a matter of observation, that just as a man of powerful frame who has lost his sight meets
					with heavy falls when he moves about, because he cannot see, so it also happens in the
					moral sphere; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>whereas if a man of good natural
					disposition acquires Intelligence,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> here means <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign> as a
						whole: see 11.4, third note.</note> then he excels in conduct, and the disposition which
					previously only resembled Virtue will now be Virtue in the true sense. Hence just as with
					the faculty of forming opinions<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See first note on
						5.8.</note> there are two qualities, Cleverness and Prudence, so also in the moral part of
					the soul there are two qualities, natural virtue and true Virtue; and true Virtue cannot
					exist without Prudence. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Hence some people maintain that
					all the virtues are forms of Prudence; and
					Socrates' line of enquiry was right in one way though wrong in another; he
					was mistaken in thinking that <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> all the virtues are
					forms of Prudence, but right in saying that they cannot exist without Prudence. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>A proof of this is that everyone, even at the present day, in
					defining Virtue, after saying what disposition it is<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., that it is a <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis proairetikh/</foreign>: see the
						definition of Moral Virtue, 2.6.15.</note> and specifying the things with which it is
					concerned, adds that it is a disposition determined by the right principle; and the right
					principle is the principle determined by Prudence. It appears therefore that everybody in
					some sense, divines that Virtue is a disposition of this nature, namely regulated by
					Prudence. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>This formula however requires a slight
					modification. Virtue is not merely a disposition conforming to right principle, but one
					cooperating with right principle; and Prudence is right principle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., prudence is the knowledge of right principle, the presence of the
						<foreign lang="greek">o)rqo\s lo/gos</foreign> in the <foreign lang="greek">yuxh/</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">fro/nimos</foreign> &lpar;see 2.2.2,
						2.6.15&rpar;.</note> in matters of conduct.
					Socrates then thought that the virtues <emph>are</emph> principles, for he
					said that they are all of them forms of knowledge. We on the other hand say that the
					virtues <emph>cooperate with</emph> principle.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>These considerations therefore show that it is not possible to be good in the true sense
					without Prudence, nor to be prudent without Moral Virtue.</p>
				<p>&lpar;Moreover, this might supply an answer to the dialectical argument that might be
					put forward to prove that the virtues can exist in isolation from each other, on the
					ground that the same man does not possess the greatest natural capacity for all of them,
					so that he may have already attained one when he has not yet attained another. In regard
					to the natural virtues this is possible; <milestone n="1145a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>but it is not possible in regard to those virtues
					which entitle a man to be called good without qualification. For if a man have the one
					virtue of Prudence he will also have all the Moral Virtues together with
					it.&rpar;<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is therefore clear<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer recapitulates the
					solution reached in the last two chapters of the difficulty stated in 12.1.</note> that,
					even if Prudence had no bearing on conduct, it would still be needed, because it is the
					virtue of<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text should probably be emended
						&lsquo;of one of the two parts of the intellect&rsquo;: see 12.4.</note> that
					part of the intellect to which it belongs; and also that our choice of actions will not be
					right without Prudence any more than without Moral Virtue, since, while Moral Virtue
					enables us to achieve<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At 12.6 Aristotle says more
						precisely that Virtue &lsquo;makes the End right,&rsquo; i.e., makes us choose
						the right End; strictly speaking, to <emph>achieve</emph> the End requires also Prudence
						in the choice of the right means.</note> the end, Prudence makes us adopt the right
					means to the end.<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But nevertheless it is not really the case that Prudence is in authority<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This is the solution of the difficulty stated in
					12.3.</note> over Wisdom, or over the higher part of the intellect, any more than medical
					science is in authority over health. Medical science does not control health, but studies
					how to procure it; hence it issues orders <emph>in the interests of</emph> health, but not
					to health. And again, one might as well say that Political Science governs the gods,
					because it gives orders about everything<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Including
						religious observances.</note> in the State.</p>

				<p>Let us next begin a fresh part of the subject by laying down that the states of moral
					character to be avoided are of three kinds&mdash;Vice, Unrestraint, and
					Bestiality.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or Brutality: the two English words have
						acquired slightly different shades of meaning, which are combined in the Greek.</note>
					The opposite dispositions in the case of two of the three are obvious: one we call Virtue,
					the other Self-restraint. As the opposite of Bestiality it will be most suitable to speak
					of Superhuman Virtue, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> or goodness on a heroic or
					divine scale; just as Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.258">Hom. Il. 24.258</bibl>. The preceding words are, &lsquo;
						Hector, who was a god.&rsquo;</note> has represented
					Priam as saying of Hector, on account of his surpassing valor&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>nor seemed to be</l>
							<l>The son of mortal man, but of a god.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence if, as men say, surpassing virtue changes men into gods, the disposition opposed to
					Bestiality will clearly be some quality more than human; for there is no such thing as
					Virtue in the case of a god, any more than there is Vice or Virtue in the case of a beast:
					divine goodness is something more exalted than Virtue, and bestial badness is different in
					kind from Vice. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And
					inasmuch as it is rare for a man to be divine, in the sense in which that word is commonly
					used by the Lacedaemonians as a term of extreme admiration&mdash;&lsquo;Yon mon's
					divine,&rsquo;they say&mdash;, so a bestial character is rare among human beings;
					it is found most frequently among barbarians, and some cases also occur as a result of
					disease or arrested development. We sometimes also use &lsquo;bestial&rsquo; as a
					term of opprobrium for a surpassing degree of human vice.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit. &lsquo;for those who surpass &lpar;the rest of&rpar; men
						in Vice&rsquo; &lpar;i.e., human, not bestial wickedness&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the nature of the bestial disposition will have to be touched on later; and of Vice
					we have spoken already. We must however discuss Unrestraint and Softness or Luxury, and
					also Self-restraint and Endurance. <milestone n="1145b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Neither of these two classes of character is to be conceived
					as identical with Virtue and Vice, nor yet as different in kind from them.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Our proper course with this subject as with others will be to present the various views
					about it, and then, after first reviewing the difficulties they involve, finally to
					establish if possible all or, if not all, the greater part and the most important of the
					opinions generally held with respect to these states of mind; since if the discrepancies
					can be solved, and a residuum of current opinion left standing, the true view will have
					been sufficiently established.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle holds
						&lpar;1.8.7&rpar; that the opinions of the mass of mankind, and of philosophers,
						on matters of conduct are likely to be substantially true; although being stated from
						different points of view, and sometimes in ambiguous language, they often seem mutually
						contradictory. The business of Ethics is to state them clearly, examine their apparent
						contradictions, discard such parts of them as really refute each other, and elicit the
						common residuum of truth: see infra, 2.12.</note>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now the following opinions are held: &lpar;a&rpar; that Self-restraint and
					Endurance are good and praiseworthy dispositions, Unrestraint and Softness bad and
					blameworthy; &lpar;b&rpar; that the self-restrained man is the man who abides by
					the results of his calculations, the unrestrained, one who readily abandons the conclusion
					he has reached; &lpar;c&rpar; that the unrestrained man does things that he knows
					to be evil, under the influence of passion, whereas the self-restrained man, knowing that
					his desires are evil, refuses to follow them on principle; &lpar;d&rpar; that the
					temperate man is always self-restrained and enduring; but that the converse is invariably
					the case some deny, although others affirm it: the latter identify the unrestrained with
					the profligate and the profligate with the unrestrained promiscuously, the former
					distinguish between them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>&lpar;e&rpar; Sometimes it is said that the prudent man cannot be unrestrained,
					sometimes that some prudent and clever men are unrestrained. &lpar;f&rpar;Again,
					men are spoken of as unrestrained <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> in anger, and in
					the pursuit of honor and of gain. These then are the opinions advanced.<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The difficulties that may be raised are the following. &lpar;c&rpar; How can a
					man fail in self-restraint when believing correctly that what he does is wrong? Some
					people say that he cannot do so when he knows the act to be wrong; since, as
					Socrates held, it would be strange if, when a man
					possessed Knowledge, some other thing should overpower it, and &lsquo;drag it about
					like a slave.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A quotation from <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 352b">Plat. Prot. 352b</bibl></note> In fact
					Socrates used to combat the view<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz., that a man may know the right and do the wrong.</note> altogether,
					implying that there is no such thing as Unrestraint, since no one, he held, acts contrary
					to what is best, believing what he does to be bad, but only through ignorance. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now this theory is manifestly at
					variance with plain facts; and we ought to investigate the state of mind in question more
					closely. If failure of self-restraint is caused by ignorance, we must examine what sort of
					ignorance it is. For it is clear that the man who fails in self-restraint does not think
					the action right before he comes under the influence of passion.&mdash; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But some thinkers accept the
					doctrine in a modified form. They allow that nothing is more powerful than knowledge, but
					they do not allow that no one acts contrary to what he opines to be the better course; and
					they therefore maintain that the unrestrained man when he succumbs to the temptations of
					pleasure possesses not Knowledge but only Opinion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And yet if it is really Opinion and not
					Knowledge&mdash;not a strong belief <milestone n="1146a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>that offers resistance but only a weak one
					&lpar;like that of persons in two minds about something&rpar;&mdash;, we could
					forgive a man for not keeping to his opinions in opposition to strong desires; but we do
					not forgive vice, nor any other blameworthy quality.&mdash;&lpar;e&rpar; Is it
					then when desire is opposed by Prudence that we blame a man for yielding? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>for Prudence is extremely strong. But
					this is strange, for it means that the same person can be at once prudent and
					unrestrained; yet no one could possibly maintain that the prudent man is capable of doing
					voluntarily the basest actions. And furthermore it has already been shown<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.7. 7, 6.12.10.</note> that Prudence displays itself
					in action &lpar;for it is concerned with ultimate particulars&rpar;, and implies
					the possession of the other Virtues as well. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;d&rpar; if Self-restraint implies having strong and evil desires, the
					temperate man cannot be self-restrained, nor the self-restrained man temperate; for the
					temperate man does not have excessive or evil desires. But a self-restrained man must
					necessarily have strong and evil desires; since if a man's desires are good, the
					disposition that prevents him from obeying them will be evil, and so Self-restraint will
					not always be good; while if his desires are weak and not evil, there is nothing to be
					proud of in resisting them; nor is it anything remarkable if they are evil and weak.
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;a, b&rpar; if Self-restraint makes a man steadfast in
					<emph>all</emph> his opinions, it may be bad, namely, if it makes him persist even in a
					false opinion. And if Unrestraint makes him liable to abandon <emph>any</emph> opinion, in
					some cases Unrestraint will be good. Take the instance of Neoptolemus in the
					<title>Philoctetes</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Soph. Phil. 895-916">Soph. Phil. 895-916</bibl>. See further, 9.4.</note> of
					Sophocles. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Neoptolemus abandons a resolution that
					he has been persuaded by Odysseus to adopt, because of the pain that it gives him to tell
					a lie: in this case inconstancy is praiseworthy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;a, c&rpar; there is the difficulty raised by the argument of the
					sophists. The sophists wish to show their cleverness by entrapping their adversary into a
					paradox, and when they are successful, the resultant chain of reasoning ends in a
					deadlock: the mind is fettered, being unwilling to stand still because it cannot approve
					the conclusion reached, yet unable to go forward because it cannot untie the knot of the
					argument.  <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Now one of
					their arguments proves that Folly combined with Unrestraint is a virtue. It runs as
					follows: if a man is foolish and also unrestrained, owing to his unrestraint he does the
					opposite of what he believes that he ought to do; but he believes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc., because he is foolish.</note> that good things are bad, and that he
					ought not to do them; therefore he will do good things and not bad ones. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;b, d&rpar; one who does and pursues what is pleasant from conviction
					and choice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., a profligate. This is another
						sophistic paradox based on the contradiction between &lpar;1&rpar; the
						identification of the unrestrained man with the profligate, and &lpar;2&rpar;
						the view &lpar;2.6&rpar; that the former acts contrary to his deliberate
						conviction &lpar;so
						Burnet&rpar;.</note> might be held to be a better man than one who acts
					in the same way not from calculation but from unrestraint, because he is more easy to
					cure, since he may be persuaded to alter his conviction; whereas the unrestrained man
					comes under the proverb that says &lsquo;when water chokes you, what are you to drink
					to wash it down?&rsquo; Had he been convinced that what he does is right, <milestone n="1146b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>a change of
					conviction might have caused him to desist; but as it is he is convinced that he ought to
					do one thing and nevertheless does another thing.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A
						variant <foreign lang="greek">ou) pepeisme/nos . . .
							&lsqb;a)lla\&rsqb;</foreign> gives &lsquo;but as it is he is convinced it is
						wrong but nevertheless does it.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;f&rpar; if Self-restraint and Unrestraint can be displayed with
					reference to anything, what is the meaning of the epithet
					&lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; without qualification? No one has every form of
					unrestraint, yet we speak of some men as simply &lsquo;unrestrained.&rsquo;
					<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such, more or less, are the difficulties that arise. Part of the conflicting opinions we
					have to clear out of the way, but part to leave standing; for to solve a difficulty is to
					find the answer to a problem.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.5, note.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have then to consider, first &lpar;i&rpar; whether men fail in self-restraint
					knowing what they do is wrong, or not knowing, and if knowing, knowing in what sense; and
					next &lpar;ii&rpar; what are to be set down as the objects with which
					Self-restraint and Unrestraint are concerned: I mean, are they concerned with pleasure and
					pain of all sorts, or only with certain special pleasures and pains? and
					&lpar;iii&rpar; is Self-restraint the same as Endurance or distinct from it? and
					so on with &lpar;iv&rpar; the other questions akin to this subject. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>A starting-point for our investigation is to ask<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
					question is not pursued below; indeed the contents of the following chapters are
					correctly outlined in 3.1, and 3.2 is superfluous.</note> whether the <foreign lang="la">differentia</foreign><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not the difference between the
						two, since of course they are concerned with the same objects, but the difference
						between both of them and other similar characters; see 1.4.</note> of the
					self-restrained man and the unrestrained is constituted by their objects, or by their
					dispositions: I mean, whether a man is called unrestrained solely because he fails to
					restrain himself with reference to certain things, or rather because he has a certain
					disposition, or rather for both reasons combined. A second question is, can Self-restraint
					and Unrestraint be displayed in regard to everything, or not? When a man is said to be
					&lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; without further qualification, it does not mean that he
					is so in relation to everything, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> but to those
					things in regard to which a man can be profligate; and also it does not mean merely that
					he is concerned with these things &lpar;for in that case Unrestraint would be the same
					thing as Profligacy&rpar;, but that he is concerned with them in a particular manner.
					The profligate yields to his appetites from choice, considering it right always to pursue
					the pleasure that offers, whereas the man of defective self-restraint does not think so,
					but pursues it all the same. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;i&rpar; Now the suggestion that it is not Knowledge, but True Opinion,
					against which unrestrained men act, is of no importance for our argument. Some men hold
					their opinions with absolute certainty, and take them for positive knowledge;  <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>so that if weakness of conviction
					be the criterion for deciding that men who act against their conception of what is right
					must be said to opine rather than to know the right, there will really be no difference in
					this respect between Opinion and Knowledge; since some men are just as firmly convinced of
					what they opine as others are of what they know: witness Heracleitus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to refer to the dogmatic tone of Heracleitus's teaching in
						general.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; But the word <emph>know</emph> is used in two senses. A man who has
					knowledge but is not exercising it is said to know, and so is a man who is actually
					exercising his knowledge. It will make a difference whether a man does wrong having the
					knowledge that it is wrong but not consciously thinking of his knowledge, or with the
					knowledge consciously present to his mind. The latter would be felt to be surprising; but
					it is not surprising that a man should do what he knows to be wrong if he is not conscious
					of the knowledge at the time. <milestone n="1147a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/> <milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Again, reasoning on matters of conduct employs premises of two
					forms.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The major premise of a practical syllogism is
						universal, a general rule; the minor is particular, the application of the rule to the
						case in hand. The next sentence points out that this application really requires two
						syllogisms; in the first, the personal term of the major premise is predicated in the
						minor of the particular person concerned &lpar;Dry food is good for all men: I am a
						man: therefore dry food is good for me&rpar; ; in the second, the other universal
						term is predicated in the minor of a particular thing about which the person is
						deliberating &lpar;Dry food is good for me: this stale loaf is dry food: therefore
						this stale loaf is good for me&rpar;. It is the minor premise of the second
						syllogism, viz. the application of the general rule not to himself but to the thing in
						question, that the unrestrained man seems not to know, or not to think of, at the time.
						This illustration is confused in the text by the insertion of another minor premise
						<foreign lang="greek">h)\ o(/ti chro\n to\ toio/nde</foreign>, &lsquo;or that food
						of a certain kind &lsqb;e.g. stale bread&rsqb; is dry.&rsquo; It would have
						been enough to write <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ei) to/de chro/n</foreign>,
						&lsquo;but whether this &lsqb;stale loaf&rsqb; is dry.&rsquo;</note> Now
					it is quite possible for a man to act against knowledge when he knows both premises but is
					only exercising his knowledge of the universal premise and not of the particular; for
					action has to do with particular things. Moreover, there is a distinction as regards the
					universal term: one universal is predicated of the man himself, the other of the thing;
					for example, he may know and be conscious of the knowledge that dry food is good for every
					man and that he himself is a man, or even that food of a certain kind is dry, but either
					not possess or not be actualizing the knowledge whether the particular food before him is
					food of that kind. Now clearly the distinction between these two ways of knowing will make
					all the difference in the world. It will not seem at all strange that the unrestrained man
					should &lsquo;know&rsquo; in one way, but it would be astonishing if he knew in
					another way. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; Again, it is possible for men to &lsquo;have
					knowledge&rsquo; in yet another way besides those just discussed; for even in the
					state of having knowledge without exercising it we can observe a distinction: a man may in
					a sense both have it and not have it; for instance, when he is asleep, or mad, or drunk.
					But persons under the influence of passion are in the same condition; for it is evident
					that anger, sexual desire, and certain other passions, actually alter the state of the
					body, and in some cases even cause madness. It is clear therefore that we must pronounce
					the unrestrained to &lsquo;have knowledge&rsquo; only in the same way as men who
					are asleep or mad or drunk.  <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Their using the language of knowledge<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is to persons of weak will uttering sound moral maxims almost at the very
						moment of yielding to temptation.</note> is no proof that they possess it. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Persons in the states mentioned<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz., asleep or drunk. It may have been some Falstaff of Attic comedy
							that quoted the moral maxims of Empedocles in his cups.</note> repeat propositions of
					geometry and verses of Empedocles; students who have just begun a subject reel off its
					formulae, though they do not yet know their meaning, for knowledge has to become part of
					the tissue of the mind, and this takes time. Hence we must conceive that men who fail in
					self-restraint talk in the same way as actors speaking a part. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;4&rpar; Again, one may also study the cause of Unrestraint
					scientifically,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in this case, psychologically:
						lit. &lsquo;with reference to its nature.&rsquo; Cf. 8.1.6, 9.7.2, 9.9.7.</note>
					thus: In a practical syllogism, the major premise is an opinion, while the minor premise
					deals with particular things, which are the province of perception. Now when the two
					premises are combined, just as in theoretic reasoning the mind is compelled to affirm the
					resulting conclusion, so in the case of practical premises you are forced at once to do
					it. For example, given the premises &lsquo;All sweet things ought to be
					tasted&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yonder thing is sweet&rsquo;&mdash;a particular
					instance of the general class&mdash;, you are bound, if able and not prevented,
					immediately to taste the thing.  <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>When therefore there is present in the mind on the one hand a universal
					judgement forbidding you to taste and on the other hand a universal judgement saying
					&lsquo;All sweet things are pleasant,&rsquo; and a minor premise &lsquo;Yonder
					thing is sweet&rsquo; &lpar;and it is this minor premise that is active<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., determines action &lpar;
						Ross&rpar;.</note>&rpar; , and when desire is
					present at the same time, then, though the former universal judgement says
					&lsquo;Avoid that thing,&rsquo; the desire leads you to it &lpar;since desire
					can put the various parts of the body in motion&rpar;. <milestone n="1147b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Thus it comes about that when
					men fail in self-restraint, they act in a sense under the influence of a principle or
					opinion, but an opinion not in itself but only accidentally opposed to the right principle
					 <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> &lpar;for it is
					the desire, and not the opinion, that is really opposed&rpar;. Hence the lower animals
					cannot be called unrestrained, if only for the reason that they have no power of forming
					universal concepts, but only mental images and memories of particular things. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If we ask how the unrestrained man's ignorance is dissipated and he returns to a state of
					knowledge, the explanation is the same as in the case of drunkenness and sleep, and is not
					peculiar to failure of self-restraint. We must go for it to physiology. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But inasmuch as the last premise, which originates action, is an opinion as to some
					object of sense, and it is this opinion which the unrestrained man when under the
					influence of passion either does not possess, or only possesses in a way which as we saw
					does not amount to knowing it but only makes him repeat it as the drunken man repeats the
					maxims of Empedocles, and since the ultimate term is not a universal, and is not deemed to
					be an object of Scientific Knowledge in the same way as a universal term is, we do seem to
					be led to the conclusion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.1.</note> which
					Socrates sought to establish.  <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>For the knowledge which is present
					when failure of self-restraint<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here <foreign lang="greek">to\ pa/qos</foreign> means <foreign lang="greek">a)krateu/esqai</foreign>, cf. 2.2, 3.12, 4.6; but in the following line &lpar;cf.
						2.1&rpar; it probably means <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign>, as 3.7, 5.5, 7.8.</note> occurs is not what is held to
					be Knowledge in the true sense, nor is it true Knowledge which is dragged about by
					passion, but knowledge derived from sense-perception.</p>
				<p>So much for the question whether failure of self-restraint can go with knowledge or not,
					and with knowledge in what sense. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;ii&rpar; We must next discuss whether any man can be called
					&lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; without qualification, or whether it must always be in
					relation to certain particular things, and if so, to what sort of things. Now it is plain
					that men are self-restrained and enduring, unrestrained and soft, in regard to Pleasures
					and Pains. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the things that give pleasure are of two
					kinds: some are necessary,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 4.5, first note.</note>
					others are desirable in themselves but admit of excess. The necessary sources of pleasures
					are those connected with the body: I mean such as the functions of nutrition and sex, in
					fact those bodily functions which we have indicated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						Bk. 3.10</note> as the sphere of Profligacy and Temperance. The other sources of
					pleasure are not necessary, but are desirable in themselves: I mean for example victory,
					honor, wealth, and the other good and pleasant things of the same sort. Now those who
					against the right principle within them exceed in regard to the latter class of pleasant
					things, we do not call unrestrained simply, but with a
					qualification&mdash;unrestrained as to money, gain, honor or anger<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1.7: <foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign>,
						&lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; aims at victory, and so is brought into this discussion of
						&lsquo;pleasures and desires&rsquo; &lpar; 4.5&rpar;; but in chap. 6 it
						is contrasted with desire, and its indulgence in the form of anger is seen to be painful
						rather than pleasant &lpar;6.4&rpar;.</note> &mdash;not merely
					&lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; ; because we regard them as distinct from the
					unrestrained in the strict sense, and only so called by analogy, like our familiar
					example<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to be the meaning of the imperfect
						tenses. An inscription records that a boxer named <foreign lang="greek">*)/anqrwpos</foreign> won at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> in <date value="-456">456</date> B.C. and the Greek commentators say that he is referred to
						here. His name would appear to have been used in the Peripatetic school as an example of
						the analogical use of words.</note> of Man the Olympic winner, <milestone n="1148a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>whose special definition is not
					very different<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., it requires the addition of three
						words. Strictly speaking, however, it is impossible to define an individual; moreover,
						the Olympic victor &lpar;a&rpar; was a man not merely by analogy but as a member
						of the species, and &lpar;b&rpar; was named Man not even by analogy but only
						homonymously. But a humorous illustration need not be precise.</note> from the general
					definition of &lsquo;man,&rsquo; though nevertheless he is really quite distinct
					from men in general.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps Man had some personal
						peculiarity which somewhat belied his name.</note> &lpar;That such persons are only
					called unrestrained by analogy is proved by our blaming unrestraint, whether unqualified
					or with reference to some particular bodily pleasure, as a vice and not merely an error,
					whereas we do not regard those unrestrained in regard to money, etc. as guilty of
					vice.&rpar; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But of those who exceed in relation to
					the bodily enjoyments with regard to which we speak of men as temperate or profligate, he
					who pursues excessive pleasure, and avoids the extremes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably this should be amended to &lsquo;moderate bodily pains,&rsquo; cf.
						4.4.</note> of bodily pains such as hunger, heat, cold, and the various pains of touch
					and taste, not from choice but against his own choice and reason, is described as
					unrestrained not with a qualification&mdash;unrestrained as regards these pleasures
					and pains&mdash;as is one who yields to anger, but just simply as unrestrained.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/> &lpar;A proof that
					&lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; unqualified denotes unrestraint as regards bodily
					pleasures and pains, is that we speak of men as &lsquo;soft&rsquo; who yield to
					these, but not those who yield to anger or the like.&rpar; And hence we class the
					unrestrained man with the profligate &lpar;and the self-restrained with the
					temperate&rpar;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthesis may be an
						interpolation.</note> , but not those who yield to anger or the like, because
					Unrestraint and Profligacy are related to the same pleasures and pains. But as a matter of
					fact, although they are related to the same things, they are not related to them in the
					same way; the profligate acts from choice, the unrestrained man does not. Hence we should
					pronounce a man who pursues excessive pleasures and avoids moderate pains when he feels
					only weak desires or none at all, to be more profligate than one who does so owing to
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> intense desires; for what would the former do if
					he possessed the ardent desires of youth, and felt violent pain when debarred from the
					&lsquo;necessary&rsquo; pleasures?<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And inasmuch as some desires and pleasures relate to things that are noble and good in
					kind &lpar;for some pleasant things are desirable by nature, others the opposite,
					while others again are neutral&mdash;compare the classification we gave above<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 4.2: a third class is now added, pleasures bad in

					money, gain, victory, honor: and inasmuch as in relation to all these naturally desirable

					desiring or liking them, but for doing so in a certain way, namely to excess
					&lpar;hence those<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This subject is left without its

					their case to go to excess, by vying even with the gods like Niobe,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Niobe vaunted her children as more beautiful than those of Leto.</note>
					or as Satyrus did,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek commentators tell stories
						of a certain Satyrus who, when his father died, committed suicide for grief. But
						Heliodorus appears to have read <foreign lang="greek">e)pikalou/menos to\n

					<milestone n="1148b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>who was
					nicknamed the filial for his devotion to his father, for he was thought to carry it to the
					point of infatuation&mdash;&rpar; : well then, there cannot be any actual Vice in
					relation to these things, because, as has been said, each of them is in itself desirable
					by nature, although excessive devotion to them is bad and to be avoided. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>And similarly there cannot be Unrestraint either, since that is not
					merely to be avoided, but actually blameworthy; though people do use the term in these
					matters with a qualification&mdash; &lsquo;unrestraint in&rsquo; whatever it
					may be&mdash;because the affection does resemble Unrestraint proper; just as they
					speak of someone as a bad doctor or bad actor whom they would not call simply
					&lsquo;bad.&rsquo; As therefore we do not call bad doctors and actors bad men,
					because neither kind of incapacity is actually a vice, but only resembles Vice by analogy,
					so in the former case it is clear that only self-restraint and lack of restraint in regard
					to the same things as are the objects of Temperance and Profligacy are to be deemed
					Self-restraint and Unrestraint proper, and that these terms are applied to anger only by
					analogy; and so we add a qualification, &lsquo;unrestrained in anger,&rsquo; just
					as we say &lsquo;unrestrained in the pursuit of honor&rsquo; or
					&lsquo;gain.&rsquo; <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Besides those things however which are naturally pleasant, of which some are pleasant
					generally and others pleasant to particular races of animals and of men, there are other
					things, not naturally pleasant, which become pleasant either as a result of arrested
					development or from habit, or in some cases owing to natural depravity. Now corresponding
					to each of these kinds of unnatural pleasures we may observe a related disposition of
					character. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>I mean bestial characters, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> like the creature in woman's form<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">So Peters. Perhaps there is a
						reference to the Lamia of folk-lore.</note>
					that is said to rip up pregnant females and devour their offspring, or certain savage
					tribes on the coasts of the Black Sea, who are alleged to delight in raw meat or in human
					flesh, and others among whom each in turn provides a child for the common banquet<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The version follows
						Williams, and seems to require the emendation given in the critical note.
						The mss. give &lsquo;who lend their children to each other for
						feasting.&rsquo;</note>; or the reported depravity of Phalaris.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See below, 5.7, note.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These are instances of Bestiality. Other unnatural
					propensities are due to disease, and sometimes to insanity, as in the case of the madman
					that offered up his mother to the gods and partook of the sacrifice, or the one that ate
					his fellow slave's liver. Other morbid propensities are acquired by habit, for instance,
					plucking out the hair, biting the nails, eating cinders and earth, and also sexual
					perversion. These practices result in some cases from natural disposition, and in others
					from habit, as with those who have been abused from childhood. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>When nature is responsible, no one would describe such persons as
					showing Unrestraint, any more than one would apply that term to women because they are
					passive and not active in sexual intercourse; nor should we class as Unrestraint a morbid
					state brought about by habitual indulgence.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now these various morbid dispositions in themselves <milestone n="1149a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>do not fall within the limits
					of Vice, nor yet does Bestiality; and to conquer or yield to them does not constitute
					Unrestraint<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">We must understand &lsquo;does not
						constitute restraint or unrestraint&rsquo; unless we amend &lsquo;and to fail to
						conquer, or to be conquered by, them does not constitute unrestraint.&rsquo;</note>
					in the strict sense, but only the state so called by analogy; just as a man who cannot
					control his anger must be described as &lsquo;unrestrained in&rsquo; that passion,
					not &lsquo;unrestrained.&rsquo; </p>
				<p>&lpar;Indeed folly, cowardice, profligacy, and ill-temper, whenever they run to
					excess, are either bestial or morbid conditions. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>One so
					constituted by nature as to be frightened by everything, even the sound of a mouse, shows
					the cowardice of a lower animal; the man who was afraid of a weasel was a case of disease.
					So with folly: people irrational by nature and living solely by sensation, like certain
					remote tribes of barbarians, belong to the bestial class; those who lose their reason
					owing to some disease, such as epilepsy, or through insanity, to the morbid.&rpar;
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>With these unnatural propensities it is possible in some cases merely to have the
					disposition and not to yield to it: I mean, for instance, Phalaris<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No such stories about Phalaris are alluded to elsewhere; so
						Burnet here brackets the name, supposing the subject of
						<foreign lang="greek">katei=xen</foreign> to be unexpressed, and taking 5.2 to refer
						to Phalaris's well-known practice of burning human victims in a bronze bull. But that
						was hardly an instance of Bestiality.</note> might have had the desire to eat a child,
					or to practise unnatural vice, and refrained; or it is possible not merely to possess but
					to yield to the propensity. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>As therefore with Vice, that
					natural to man is called simply vice, whereas the other kind<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., inhuman vice.</note> is termed not simply vice, but vice with the
					qualifying epithet bestial or morbid, similarly with Unrestraint, it is clear that the
					bestial and morbid kinds are distinct from unrestraint proper, and that the name without
					qualification belongs only <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> to that kind of
					unrestraint which is co-extensive with Profligacy of the human sort.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is clear then that Self-restraint and Unrestraint relate only to the objects to which
					Temperance and Profligacy are related, and that unrestraint in relation to anything else
					is of another kind, which is only so called metaphorically and with a
					qualification. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Let us now consider the point that Unrestraint in anger<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"> &lsquo;Lack of control of the spirit&rsquo; : see 4.2, third
					note</note> is less disgraceful than Unrestraint in the desires.</p>
				<p>Now it appears that anger does to some extent hear reason, but hears it wrong, just as
					hasty servants hurry out of the room before they have heard the whole of what you are
					saying, and so mistake your order, and as watch-dogs bark at a mere knock at the door,
					without waiting to see if it is a friend. Similarly anger, owing to the heat and swiftness
					of its nature, hears, but does not hear the order given, and rushes off to take vengeance.
					When reason or imagination suggests that an insult or slight has been received, anger
					flares up at once, but after reasoning as it were that you ought to make war on anybody
					who insults you. Desire on the other hand, at a mere hint from &lsqb;the reason
					or<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words are surely an
						interpolation.</note>&rsqb; the senses that a thing is pleasant, rushes off to enjoy
					it. <milestone n="1149b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Hence
					anger follows reason in a manner, but desire does not. Therefore yielding to desire is
					more disgraceful than yielding to anger, for he that fails to restrain his anger is in a
					way controlled by reason, but the other<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz., the man
						who is &lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; in the strict sense, i.e., cannot restrain his
						desires.</note> is controlled not by reason but by desire.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, when impulses are natural, it is more excusable to follow them, since even with
					the desires it is more excusable to follow those that are common to all men, and in so far
					as they are common. But anger and bad temper are more natural than desire for excessive
					and unnecessary pleasures; witness the man who was had up for beating his father and who
					said in his defence, &ldquo;Well, my father used to beat his father, and he used to
					beat his, and &lpar;pointing to his little boy&rpar; so will my son here beat me
					when he grows up; it runs in our family&rdquo;; and the man who, when his son was
					throwing him out of the house, used to beg him to stop when he got to the door,
					&lsquo;because he only used to drag his father as far as that.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This story is developed in Robert Browning's poem
						&lsquo;Halbert and Hob&rsquo; ; it is said also to occur in a German
						Volkslied.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Again, the craftier men are, the more Unjust they are. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now the hot-tempered man is not crafty, nor is anger, but open; whereas desire is
					crafty, as they say of Aphrodite: <quote>

				</p>
				<p>As therefore unrestraint in desire is more unjust as well as more disgraceful than
					unrestraint as regards anger, unrestraint in desire is Unrestraint in the strict sense,
					and <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> is even in a certain sense Vice. </p>
				<p><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Again, a wanton outrage<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> means any injury that is
					insulting to the victim, but here the writer is thinking specially of outrage prompted
					by lust. The argument is based on the feelings of both agent and victim. Anger, being a
					painful feeling, does not show wantonness or insolence, for wanton acts are pleasant to
					the doer. An injury done in anger therefore arouses less anger in return, less
					resentment in the victim, than does wanton outrage due to unrestrained desire. Therefore
					it is less &lsquo;unjust,&rsquo; less of an injury. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1380a">Aristot. Rh. 1380a 34</bibl>&lpar;anger is not so much
					resented, because it does not show contempt for its victim&rpar;.</note> gives
					pleasure to the doer, never pain, whereas an act done in anger always causes him a feeling
					of pain. If then things are unjust in proportion to the justice of the anger they arouse
					in the victim, unrestraint arising from desire is more unjust than that arising from
					anger; for anger contains no element of wanton insolence.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is clear therefore that unrestraint in one's desires is more disgraceful than
					unrestraint in anger, and that it is in relation to bodily desires and pleasures that
					Self-restraint and Unrestraint are really manifested.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But we must distinguish among the bodily desires and pleasures themselves. As was said at
					the beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 5.1, and also 1.3.</note> some of
					these are human and natural both in kind and degree, some bestial, and some due to
					arrested development or disease. Now it is only with the first class that Temperance and
					Profligacy are concerned; hence we do not use the terms temperate or profligate of the
					lower animals, except metaphorically, of certain entire species distinguished from the
					rest by their exceptionally lascivious, mischievous, or omnivorous habits; for animals
					have neither the faculty of choice nor of calculation: they are aberrations from
					nature,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer here seems to regard all animals
						as unnatural, in the sense of imperfectly developed, because irrational. The order
						precludes our taking this clause of the exceptional species &lpar;asses, wild boars,
						and pigs according to Greek zoology&rpar; just alluded to; moreover, as the
						excessive appetites of these are analogous to Profligacy in men, they are not
						aberrations from animal nature any more than profligates are from human nature.</note>
					like men who are insane. <milestone n="1150a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Bestiality<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No two commentators read the same sense into this section, which is
						&lsquo;little more than a series of jottings&rsquo; &lpar;
						Burnet&rpar;. The version given largely follows
						Peters. The insertions in brackets indicate
						what may possibly have been in the writer's mind.</note> is less &lt;evil&gt;
					than vice, though more horrible: for &lt;in a bestial man as in an animal&gt; the
					highest part &lt;i.e. the intellect&gt; is not corrupted, as it is in a man
					&lt;who is wicked in a human way&gt;, but entirely lacking. So that it is like
					comparing an inanimate with an animate thing, and asking which is the more evil; for the
					badness of a thing which has no originating principle&mdash;and intelligence is such a
					principle&mdash;is always less capable of mischief.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The relevance of this parenthesis is obscure; its meaning, in the light of other
						passages in Aristotle, may be that injustice is worse in the sense that it is evil
						<foreign lang="la">per se</foreign> &lpar;whereas the unjust man is evil <foreign lang="la">per accidens</foreign>&rpar; , but the unjust man is worse in the sense
						that he is productive of evil.</note> &lpar;It is therefore like comparing Injustice
					with an unjust man: one is worse in one way and the other in another&rpar;. For a bad
					man can do ten thousand times more harm than an animal &lt;or a bestial
					man&gt;.<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;iii&rpar; But in relation to the pleasures and pains of touch and taste,
					and the corresponding desires and acts of avoidance, which have already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Bk. 3.10.</note> been defined as the sphere in which
					Profligacy and Temperance are displayed, it is possible on the one hand to have such a
					disposition as to succumb even to those temptations to which most men are superior, or on
					the other hand to conquer even those to which most men succumb. These two dispositions,
					when manifested in relation to pleasure, constitute Unrestraint and Restraint
					respectively; when in relation to pain, Softness and Endurance. The disposition of the
					great majority of men lies between the two, though they incline rather to the worse
					extremes.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And inasmuch as some pleasures are necessary and others not, and the former are only
					necessary within certain limits, excessive indulgence in them not being necessary, nor yet
					deficient indulgence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This addition is illogically
						expressed, but it is a reminder that to take too little of certain
						&lsquo;necessary&rsquo; pleasures is as wrong as to take too much: see 4.5,
						first note.</note> either, and inasmuch as the same holds good also of desires and of
					pains, one who pursues excessive pleasures, or pursues things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., necessary things; see the tripartite classification of 4.5.</note>
					to excess <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and from choice, for their own sakes and
					not for the sake of some ulterior consequence, is a profligate; for a man of this
					character is certain to feel no regret for his excesses afterwards, and this being so, he
					is incurable,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Incurable, and therefore profligate,
						<foreign lang="greek">a)ko/lastos</foreign>, which means literally either
						&lsquo;incorrigible&rsquo; or &lsquo;unchastized&rsquo; : see note on
						3.12.5.</note> since there is no cure for one who does not regret his error. The man
					deficient in the enjoyment of pleasures is the opposite of the profligate; and the middle
					character is the temperate man. And similarly, he who avoids bodily pains not because his
					will is overpowered but of deliberate choice, is also profligate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> &lpar;Those on the other hand who yield not from choice, are
					prompted either by the pleasure of indulgence, or by the impulse to avoid the pain of
					unsatisfied desire. Hence there is a difference between deliberate and non-deliberate
					indulgence. Everyone would think a man worse if he did something disgraceful when he felt
					only a slight desire, or none at all, than if he acted from a strong desire, or if he
					struck another in cold blood than if he did so in anger; for what would he have done had
					his passions been aroused? Hence the profligate man is worse than the
					unrestrained.&rpar; </p>
				<p>Of the dispositions described above, the deliberate avoidance of pain is rather a
					kind<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Not Softness strictly, which ranges with
						Unrestraint and is not deliberate.</note> of Softness; the deliberate pursuit of
					pleasure is Profligacy in the strict sense.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Self-restraint is the opposite of Unrestraint, Endurance of Softness; for Endurance means
					only successful resistance, whereas Restraint implies mastery, which is a different
					matter: victory is more glorious than the mere avoidance of defeat. Hence self-restraint
					is a more valuable quality than Endurance. <milestone n="1150b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>One who is
					deficient in resistance to pains that most men withstand with success, is soft or
					luxurious &lpar;for Luxury is a kind of Softness&rpar; : such a man lets his cloak
					trail on the ground to escape the fatigue and trouble of lifting it, or feigns sickness,
					not seeing that to counterfeit misery is to be miserable. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The same holds good of Self-restraint and Unrestraint. It is not surprising that a man
					should be overcome by violent and excessive pleasures or pains: indeed it is excusable if
					he succumbs after a struggle, like Philoctetes in Theodectes when bitten by the viper, or
					Kerkyon in the <title>Alope</title> of Karkinos, or as men who try to restrain their
					laughter explode in one great guffaw, as happened to Xenophantus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Seneca, <title>De ira</title>,

						Dryden, <title>Alexander's
							Feast</title>&rpar; ; apparently Alexander's music had a different effect on
						Xenophantus!</note> But we are surprised when a man is overcome by pleasures and pains
					which most men are able to withstand, except when his failure to resist is due to some
					innate tendency, or to disease: instances of the former being the hereditary
					effeminacy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hdt. 1.105">Hdt. 1.105</bibl>,

				<p>People too fond of amusement are thought to be profligate, but really they are soft; for
					amusement is rest, and therefore a slackening of effort, and addiction to amusement is a
					form of excessive slackness.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., it is not an
						excessive proneness to pursue pleasure, and therefore is not profligacy.</note>
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But there are two forms of Unrestraint, Impetuousness and Weakness. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> The weak deliberate, but then are prevented by passion from keeping
					to their resolution; the impetuous are led by passion because they do not stop to
					deliberate: since some people withstand the attacks of passion, whether pleasant or
					painful, by feeling or seeing them coming, and rousing themselves, that is, their
					reasoning faculty, in advance, just as one is proof against tickling if one has just been
					tickled already.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The variant &lsquo;can avoid being
						tickled by tickling the other person first&rsquo; seems less likely, but either
						reading may be doubted: see critical note. Aristotle elsewhere &lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. Pr. 965a.11">Aristot. Prob. 965a 11</bibl>&rpar; remarks that one is
						less sensitive to tickling if one is not taken unawares, and that is why one cannot
						tickle oneself.</note> It is the quick and the excitable who are most liable to the
					impetuous form of Unrestraint, because the former are too hasty and the latter too
					vehement to wait for reason, being prone to follow their imagination.<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The profligate, as we said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">7.2.</note> does not feel
					remorse, for he abides by his choice; the unrestrained man on the other hand invariably
					repents his excesses afterwards. Hence the objection that we stated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.10.</note> does not hold good; on the contrary, it is the profligate
					who cannot be cured, whereas the unrestrained man can; for Vice resembles diseases like
					dropsy and consumption, whereas Unrestraint is like epilepsy, Vice being a chronic,
					Unrestraint an intermittent evil. Indeed Unrestraint and Vice are entirely different in
					kind, for Vice is unconscious, whereas the unrestrained man is aware of his infirmity.
					<milestone n="1151a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Among the unrestrained themselves, the impulsive<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">e)kstatiko/s</foreign> is here used as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">propeth/s</foreign>, &lsquo;impetuous,&rsquo; in 7.8; whereas
					below, 8.5, as in 1.6 and 2.7, it denotes the quality with which it is here
					contrasted.</note> sort are better than those who know the right principle but do not keep
					to it; for these succumb to smaller temptations, and they do not yield without
					deliberation, as do the impulsive; the unrestrained<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the feeble sort who stop to think and yet succumb; the impulsive man is not the
						typical unrestrained man.</note> man is like people who get drunk quickly, and with a
					small amount of wine, or with less than most men. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>That
					Unrestraint is not strictly a vice &lpar;though it is perhaps vice in a
					sense&rpar;, is clear; for Unrestraint acts against deliberate choice, Vice in
					accordance with it. But nevertheless in the actions that result from it it resembles Vice:
					just as Demodocus wrote of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="couplet">
							<l>Milesians are no fools, 'tis true</l>
							<l>But yet they act as fools would do.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Similarly the unrestrained are not unjust, but they do unjust things.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The argument is here resumed from 8.1.</note>
					the unrestrained man is so constituted as to pursue bodily pleasures that are excessive
					and contrary to right principle without any belief that he ought to do so, whereas the
					profligate, because he is so constituted as to pursue them, is convinced that he ought to
					pursue them. Therefore the former can easily be persuaded to change,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., to change his conduct. The unrestrained man's belief is right
						already and he needs only to be induced to act up to it; whereas the profligate must be
						persuaded to change his belief before he will alter his conduct.</note> but the latter
					cannot. For virtue preserves the fundamental principle,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.5.6.</note> vice destroys it, and the first principle or starting-point in
					matters of conduct is the end proposed, which corresponds to the hypotheses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The context might indicate that the definitions are meant,
						which, themselves apprehended intuitively, are the starting-points of mathematical
						deductions. But these are ordinarily distinguished by Arisotle from hypotheses, which
						are assertions of the existence of things, not of their nature. It is therefore
						suggested that the term here means the propositions of mathematics, which are assumed as
						the starting-point of the analytical process by which a proof of a theorem or solution
						of a problem may be discovered: cf. 3.3.12.</note> of mathematics; hence no more in
					ethics than in mathematics are the first principles imparted by process of reasoning, but
					by virtue, whether natural or acquired by training in right opinion as to the first
					principle. The man of principle therefore is temperate, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the man who has lost all principle, profligate. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But there is a person who abandons his choice, against right principle,
					under the influence of passion, who is mastered by passion sufficiently for him not to act
					in accordance with right principle, but not so completely as to be of such a character as
					to believe that the reckless pursuit of pleasure is right. This is the unrestrained man:
					he is better than the profligate, and not absolutely bad, for in him the highest part of
					man, the fundamental principle, is still preserved. Opposed to the unrestrained man is
					another, who stands firm by his choice, and does not abandon it under the mere impulse of
					passion.</p>
				<p>It is clear then from these considerations that Self-restraint is a good quality and
					Unrestraint a bad one.<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Is then a man self-restrained if he stands by a principle or choice of any sort, or must
					it be the right choice? and is a man unrestrained if he fails to stand by a choice or
					principle of any sort, or only if he fails to stand by the true principle and the right
					choice? This difficulty was raised before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.7.</note>
					Perhaps the answer is, that though accidentally it may be any principle or choice,
					essentially it is the true principle and the right choice that the one stands by and the
					other does not; in the sense that if a man chooses or pursues <emph>b</emph> as a means to
					<emph>a</emph>, <milestone n="1151b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><emph>a</emph> is essentially, <emph>b</emph> only accidentally, his
					object and his choice. And by &lsquo;essentially&rsquo; we mean
					&lsquo;absolutely&rsquo; ; hence while in a sense it is any sort of opinion,
					speaking absolutely it is the true opinion that the one stands by and the other
					abandons.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But there are some persons who stand by their opinion whom we call
					&lsquo;obstinate,&rsquo; meaning that they are hard to convince, and not easily
					persuaded to change their convictions. These bear some resemblance to the self-restrained
					man, as the prodigal does to the liberal, and the reckless to the brave; but they are
					really different in many respects. The self-restrained man stands firm against passion and
					desire: he will be ready on occasion to yield to persuasion; but the obstinate stand firm
					against reason: they are not proof against desire, and are often led by pleasure.
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Types of obstinacy are the opinionated, the stupid, and
					the boorish. The motives of the opinionated are pleasure and pain: the agreeable sense of
					victory in not being persuaded to change their minds, and the annoyance of having the
					decrees of their sovereign will and pleasure annulled. Hence they really resemble the
					unrestrained more than the restrained.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And there are some who fail to abide by their resolves from some other cause than lack of
					self-restraint, for instance, Neoptolemus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						2.7.</note> in the<title>PhiIoctetes</title>of Sophocles. It is true that his motive for
					changing was pleasure, though a noble pleasure, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					since it was pleasant<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The mss., instead of
						&lsquo;pleasant,&rsquo; repeat &lsquo;noble&rsquo; by a slip.</note> for
					him to speak the truth, and he had only told a lie at the instigation of Odysseus. In
					fact, not everyone whose conduct is guided by pleasure is either profligate and base, or
					unrestrained, but only those who yield to disgraceful pleasures.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There is also a character<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. I3.9.7.</note> that
					takes less than the proper amount of pleasure in the things of the body, and that fails to
					stand by principle in that sense. The self-restrained man therefore is really intermediate
					between the unrestrained man and the type described. The unrestrained man departs from
					principle because he enjoys bodily pleasures too much, the person described does so
					because he enjoys them too little; while the self-restrained man stands by principle and
					does not change from either cause. And inasmuch as Self-restraint is good, it follows that
					both the dispositions opposed to it are bad, as indeed they appear to be; but because one
					of the two is found only in a few people, and is rarely displayed, Unrestraint is thought
					to be the sole opposite of Self-restraint, just as Profligacy is thought to be the sole
					opposite of Temperance.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Many terms are used in an analogical sense, and so we have come to speak by analogy of
					the &lsquo;self-restraint&rsquo; of the temperate man, because the temperate man,
					as well as the self-restrained, is so constituted as never to be led by the pleasures of
					the body to act against principle. <milestone n="1152a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>But whereas the self-restrained man has evil desires,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Though he conquers them.</note> the temperate man has
					none; he is so constituted as to take no pleasure in things that are contrary to
					principle, whereas the self-restrained man does feel pleasure in such things, but does not
					yield to it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>There is also a resemblance between the
					unrestrained man and the profligate, though they are really distinct: both pursue bodily
					pleasures, but the profligate thinks it right to do so, the man who lacks self-restraint
					does not.<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, the same person cannot be at once unrestrained and prudent, for it has been
					shown<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.13.6.</note> that Prudence is inseparable
					from Moral Virtue. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Also, Prudence does not consist only
					in knowing what is right, but also in doing it; but the unrestrained man does not do the
					right.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthesis would come better before the
						preceding sentence.</note> &lpar;Cleverness on the other hand is not incompatible
					with Unrestraint&mdash;which is why it is sometimes thought that some people are
					prudent and yet unrestrained&mdash;because Cleverness differs from Prudence in the
					manner explained in our first discourse<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						6.12.9.</note>: as being intellectual faculties<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or
							perhaps, with the Aldine scholiast,
							&lsquo;in definition.&rsquo;</note> they are closely akin, but they differ in
					that Prudence involves deliberate choice.&rpar; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Nor
					indeed does the unrestrained man even know the right in the sense of one who consciously
					exercises his knowledge, but only as a man asleep or drunk can be said to know something.
					Also, although he errs willingly &lpar;for he knows in a sense both what he is doing
					and what end he is aiming at&rpar; , yet he is not wicked, for his moral choice is
					sound, so that he is only half-wicked. And he is not unjust, for he does not deliberately
					design to do harm,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.3.</note> since the one type
					of unrestrained person does not keep to the resolve he has formed after deliberation, and
					the other, the excitable type, does not deliberate at all. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> In fact the unrestrained man resembles a state which passes all the
					proper enactments, and has good laws, but which never keeps its laws: the condition of
					things satirized by Anaxandrides&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>The state, that recks not of the laws, would fain . . </l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>whereas the bad man is like a state which keeps its laws but whose laws are bad. </p>
				<p>Both Self-restraint and Unrestraint are a matter of extremes as compared with the
					character of the mass of mankind; the restrained man shows more and the unrestrained man
					less steadfastness than most men are capable of.</p>
				<p>Reformation is more possible with that type of Unrestraint which is displayed by persons
					of an excitable temperament than it is with those who deliberate as to what they ought to
					do, but do not keep to the resolution they form. And those who have become unrestrained
					through habit are more easily cured than those who are unrestrained by nature, since habit
					is easier to change than nature; for even habit is hard to change, precisely because it is
					a sort of nature, as Evenus says: <quote>

				<p><milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>It is also the

				<p>Now &lpar;1&rpar; some people think that no pleasure is a good thing, whether

				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Others hold that though some pleasures are good, most are bad.</p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; There is also a third view, that even if all pleasures are good,

				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; To prove that pleasure is not a good at all, it is argued that</p>
				<p>&lpar;a&rpar; Every pleasure is a conscious process towards a natural state; but
					a process can in no case belong to the same order of things as its end; for example, the
					process of building cannot be a thing of the same sort as the house built.</p>
				<p>&lpar;b&rpar; The temperate man avoids pleasures.</p>
				<p>&lpar;c&rpar; The prudent man pursues freedom from pain, not pleasure.</p>
				<p>&lpar;d&rpar; Pleasures are a hindrance to prudent deliberation, and the more so
					the more enjoyable they are; for instance, sexual pleasure: no one could think of anything
					while indulging in it.</p>
				<p>&lpar;e&rpar; There is no art of pleasure; yet with every good thing there is an
					art which produces it. </p>
				<p>&lpar;f&rpar; Children <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and animals pursue
					pleasures.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; To prove that not all pleasures are good, it is argued that</p>
				<p>&lpar;a&rpar; Some pleasures are disgraceful, and discredit the man who indulges
					in them.</p>
				<p>&lpar;b&rpar; Some pleasures are harmful, for certain pleasant things cause
					disease.</p>
				<p>&lpar;3&rpar; To prove that pleasure is not the Supreme Good, it is argued that
					it is not an end but a process.</p>
				<p>These then, more or less, are the current views.<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the following considerations will show that these arguments are not conclusive to
					prove &lpar;1&rpar; that pleasure is not a good at all, nor &lpar;3&rpar;
					that it is not the Supreme Good.</p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;a&rpar; In the first place &lpar;i.&rpar;
					&lsquo;the good&rsquo; has two meanings: it means both that which is good
					absolutely, and that which is good for somebody, or relatively. Consequently the term
					&lsquo;good&rsquo; has the same double meaning when applied to men's natures and
					dispositions; and therefore also when applied to movements and to processes. Also those
					processes which are thought to be bad will in some cases, though bad absolutely, be not
					bad relatively, but in fact desirable for a particular person, or in other cases, though
					not even desirable generally for the particular person, nevertheless desirable for him in
					particular circumstances and for a short time, although not really desirable. And some
					such processes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Certain &lsquo;felt processes
						towards a natural state&rsquo; &lpar;9.4&rpar; , which are obviously not
						good, are not really pleasant either.</note> are not really pleasures at all, but only
					seem to be so: I mean the painful processes that are undergone for their curative effects,
					for instance, treatment applied to the sick.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;ii.&rpar; , the good is either an <emph>activity</emph> or a
					<emph>state</emph>. Now the pleasures that restore us to our natural <emph>state</emph>
					are only accidentally pleasant; while the <emph>activity</emph> of desire is the activity
					of that part of us which has remained in the natural state<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 14.7.</note>: for that matter, there are some pleasures which do not
					involve pain or desire at all <milestone n="1153a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>&lpar;for instance, the pleasure of contemplation&rpar;,
					being experienced without any deficiency from the normal having occurred. That restorative
					pleasures are only accidentally pleasant is indicated by the fact that we do not enjoy the
					same things while the natural state is being replenished as we do after it has been
					restored to the normal; in the normal state we enjoy things that are absolutely pleasant,
					but during the process of replenishment we enjoy even their opposites; for instance, sour
					and bitter things, none of which are naturally or absolutely pleasant, so that the
					pleasures we get from them are not naturally or absolutely pleasant either, since there is
					the same distinction between various pleasures as there is between the pleasant things
					from which they arise.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again &lpar;iii.&rpar; , it does not follow, as some argue, that as the end is
					better than the process towards it, so there must be something better than pleasure. For
					pleasures are not really processes, nor are they all incidental to a process: they are
					activities, and therefore an end; nor do they result from the process of acquiring our
					faculties, but from their exercise; nor have they all of them some end other than
					themselves: this is only true of the pleasures of progress towards the perfection of our
					nature. Hence it is not correct to define pleasure as a &lsquo;conscious
					process&rsquo; ; the term should rather be &lsquo;activity of our natural
					state,&rsquo; and for &lsquo;conscious&rsquo; we must substitute
					&lsquo;unimpeded.&rsquo; Some thinkers hold that pleasure is a process on the
					ground that it is good in the fullest sense, because in their view an activity is a
					process; but really an activity is different from a process.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>To argue &lpar;2&rpar; &lpar;b&rpar; that pleasures are bad because some
					pleasant things are detrimental to health is the same as to argue that health is bad
					because some healthy things are bad for the pocket. Both pleasant things and healthy
					things can be bad in a relative sense, but that does not make them really bad; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> even contemplation may on occasion be injurious to
					health.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;d&rpar; Neither prudence nor any other quality is
					hampered by its own pleasure, but only by alien pleasures<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the pleasures arising from the exercise of other qualities.</note>;
					the pleasures of contemplation and study will enable us to contemplate and study
					better.<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;e&rpar; That there should be no art devoted to the
					production of any form of pleasure is only natural; an art never produces an activity, but
					the capacity for an activity. Though in point of fact the arts of perfumery and cookery
					are generally considered to be arts of pleasure.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The arguments &lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;b&rpar; that the temperate man avoids
					pleasure, and &lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;c&rpar; that the prudent man pursues
					freedom from pain, and &lpar;1&rpar; &lpar;f&rpar; that animals and
					children pursue pleasure, are all met by the same reply. It has been explained<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4.5.</note> how some pleasures are absolutely good,
					and how not all pleasures are good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., not good
						absolutely or in themselves, though good &lpar;in moderation&rpar; as means to
						life: the &lsquo;necessary&rsquo; and &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; pleasures of
						4.2,5.</note> Now it is those pleasures which are not absolutely good that both animals
					and children pursue, and it is freedom from pain arising from the want of those pleasures
					that the prudent man pursues<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the prudent man both
						satisfies his natural desire for the bodily pleasures in moderation, and trains himself
						not to mind their absence; but does both not for the sake of pleasure, but to avoid the
						disturbance of pain.</note>: that is, the pleasures that involve desire and pain, namely
					the bodily pleasures &lpar;for these are of that nature&rpar; , or their excessive
					forms, in regard to which Profligacy is displayed. That is why the temperate man avoids
					excessive bodily pleasures: for even the temperate man has pleasures. <milestone n="1153b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/></p>
				<p><milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>That pain moreover is
					an evil and to be avoided is admitted; since all pain is either absolutely evil, or evil
					as being some way an impediment to activity. But that which is the opposite of something
					to be avoided&mdash;opposed to it as a thing to be avoided and evil&mdash;must be
					good. It follows therefore that pleasure is a good. Speusippus attempted to refute this
					argument<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See more fully, 10.2.5.</note> by saying
					that, as the greater is opposed to the equal as well as to the less, so pleasure is
					opposed to a neutral state of feeling as well as to pain. But this refutation does not
					hold good; for Speusippus would not maintain that pleasure is essentially evil.<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But granting &lpar;2&rpar; that some pleasures are bad, it does not therefore
					follow &lpar;3&rpar; that a certain pleasure may not nevertheless be the Supreme
					Good; just as a certain form of knowledge may be supremely good, although some forms of
					knowledge are bad. On the contrary &lpar;i&rpar; since every faculty has its
					unimpeded activity, the activity of all the faculties, or of one of them
					&lpar;whichever constitutes Happiness&rpar; , when unimpeded, must probably be the
					most desirable thing there is; but an unimpeded activity is a pleasure; so that on this
					showing the Supreme Good will be a particular kind of pleasure, even though most pleasures
					are bad, and, it may be, bad absolutely. This is why everybody thinks that the happy life
					must be a pleasant life, and regards pleasure as a necessary ingredient of happiness; and
					with good reason, since no impeded activity is perfect, whereas Happiness is essentially
					perfect; so that the happy man requires in addition the goods of the body, external goods
					and the gifts of fortune, in order that his activity may not be impeded through lack of
					them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> &lpar;Consequently those who say<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably the Cynics.</note> that, if a man be good,
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> he will be happy even when on the rack, or when
					fallen into the direst misfortune, are intentionally or unintentionally talking
					nonsense.&rpar; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But because Happiness requires the
					gifts of fortune in addition, some people think that it is the same thing as good fortune;
					but this is not so, since even good fortune itself when excessive is an impediment to
					activity, and perhaps indeed no longer deserves to be called good fortune, since good
					fortune can only be defined in relation to Happiness.<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;ii.&rpar; Moreover, that all animals and all human beings pursue pleasure
					is some indication that it is in a sense the Supreme Good: <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>No rumor noised abroad by many peoples</l>

				<p>But they do not all pursue the same pleasure, since the natural state and the best state
					neither is nor seems to be the same for them all; yet still they all pursue pleasure.

					would say they do, but all the same pleasure; for nature has implanted in all things
					something divine.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 10.2.4.</note> But as the
					pleasures of the body are the ones which we most often meet with, and as all men are
					capable of these, these have usurped the family title; and so men think these are the only

				<p><milestone n="7" unit="section"/> &lpar;iii.&rpar; Moreover, it is clear that if
					pleasure is not good and activity is not pleasure,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						mss. give &lsquo;if pleasure and activity are not good.&rsquo;</note> the life
					of the happy man will not necessarily be pleasant. For why should he need pleasure if it
					is not good? On the contrary, his life may even be painful; for if pleasure is neither
					good nor evil, no more is pain either, so why should he avoid it? And if the good man's
					activities are not pleasanter than those of others, his life will not be pleasanter
					either.<milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>On the subject of the bodily pleasures, we must examine the view of those who say that
					though it is true that some pleasures, which they call the noble pleasures, are highly
					desirable, yet bodily pleasures and those which are the objects of the profligate are not
					desirable. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If so, why are the pains opposed to them evil?
					since the opposite of evil is good. Perhaps the true view is, that the necessary pleasures
					are good in the sense that what is not evil is good; or that they are good up to a point:
					for though you cannot have excessive pleasure from states and movements which cannot
					themselves be in excess of what is good, you can have excessive pleasure from those which
					themselves admit of excess. Now you can have an excess of the bodily goods; and it is
					pursuing this excess that makes a bad man, not pursuing the necessary pleasures, for
					everybody enjoys savory food, wine, and sexual pleasure in some degree, though not
					everybody to the right degree. With pain it is the other way about<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Whereas bodily pleasure is good in moderation and bad only in excess, all
						pain is bad; but this does not mean that the absence of excessive pleasure is bad, for
						it is not painful to the good man.</note>: one avoids not merely excessive pain, but all
					pain; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for the opposite of excessive pleasure is not
					pain at all, except to the man who pursues excessive pleasure.<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We ought however not only to state the true view, but also to account for the false one,
					since to do so helps to confirm the true; for when we have found a probable explanation
					why something appears to be true though it is not true, this increases our belief in the
					truth.</p>
				<p>We have then to explain why it is that bodily pleasures appear to be more desirable than
					others.<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;1&rpar; Now the first reason is that pleasure drives out pain; and
					excessive pain leads men to seek excessive pleasure, and bodily pleasure generally, as a
					restorative. And these restorative pleasures are intense, and therefore sought for,
					because they are seen in contrast with their opposite. &lpar;The view that pleasure is
					not a good at all is also due to these two facts, as has been said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is presumably to 12.1, but the two passages do not
						correspond very closely.</note> &lpar;a&rpar; that some pleasures are actions
					indicative of an evil nature, whether it be depraved from birth, like the nature of an
					animal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.6, second note.</note> or corrupted by
					habit, as is the case with evil men, and &lpar;b&rpar; that others are
					restoratives of a defective state,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly
						&lsquo;that the restorative pleasures imply a defective state.&rsquo;</note> and
					to be in the natural state is better than to be in process of returning to it. <milestone n="1154b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>But as a matter of
					fact the latter sort of pleasures accompany a process towards perfection, so that
					accidentally they are good.&rpar; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;2&rpar; Another reason is that bodily pleasures are sought for, just
					because of their intensity, by people who are incapable of enjoying others &lpar;for
					instance, some deliberately take steps to make themselves thirsty&rpar; : not that
					there is any objection to this if the pleasures are innocuous, but it is bad if they are
					productive of harmful results. The fact is that some men have no other sources of
					enjoyment; and also many are so constituted that a neutral state of feeling is to them
					positively painful. &lpar;This is because a state of strain is the normal condition of
					an animal organism, as physiology testifies; it tells us that sight and hearing are in
					fact painful, but we have got used to them in course of time&mdash;such is the
					theory.&rpar; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Similarly the young are in a condition
					resembling intoxication, because they are growing, and youth is pleasant in itself; but
					persons of an excitable nature need a restorative perpetually, because their temperament
					keeps their bodies in a constant state of irritation, and their appetites are continually
					active; and any pleasure, if strong, drives out pain, not only the opposite pleasure. This
					is why excitable men become profligate and vicious.<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Pleasures unaccompanied by pain, on the other hand&mdash;and these are those derived
					from things naturally and not accidentally pleasant&mdash;do not admit of excess. By
					things accidentally pleasant I mean things taken as restoratives; really their restorative
					effect is produced by the operation<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is this which is
						really pleasant: see 12.2.</note> of that part of the system which has remained sound,
					and hence the remedy itself is thought to be pleasant. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Those things on the contrary are naturally pleasant which stimulate
					the activity of a given nature.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., which stimulate
						the activity of any <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>, disposition or faculty,
						which is in its natural state, in contrast with those pleasures which stimulate the
						restoration of a faculty to its natural state.</note>
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Nothing however can continue to give us pleasure always, because our nature is not
					simple, but contains a second element &lpar;which is what makes us perishable
					beings&rpar;, and consequently, whenever one of these two elements is active, its
					activity runs counter to the nature of the other, while when the two are balanced, their
					action feels neither painful nor pleasant. Since if any man had a simple nature, the same
					activity would afford him the greatest pleasure always. Hence God enjoys a single simple
					pleasure perpetually. For there is not only an activity of motion: but also an activity of
					immobility, and there is essentially a truer pleasure in rest than in motion. But change
					in all things is sweet, as the poet says,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Eur. Orest. 234">Eur. Orest. 234</bibl>
					</note> owing to some badness in us; since just as a changeable man is bad, so also is a
					nature that needs change; for it is not simple nor good.<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We have now discussed the nature of Self-restraint and Unrestraint, and of Pleasure and
					Pain, and have shown in either case in what sense one of the two is good and the other

				<p> Our next business after this will be to discuss Friendship.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign>, &lsquo;friendship,&rsquo;
					sometimes rises to the meaning of affection or love, but also includes any sort of
					kindly feeling, even that existing between business associates, or fellow-citizens. The
					corresponding verb means both &lsquo;to like&rsquo; and &lsquo;to
					love&rsquo;; the adjective is generally passive, &lsquo;loved,&rsquo;
					&lsquo;liked,&rsquo; &lsquo;dear,&rsquo; but sometimes active
					&lsquo;loving,&rsquo; &lsquo;liking,&rsquo; and so on, as a noun
					&lsquo;a friend.&rsquo;</note> For friendship is a virtue,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, the social grace of friendliness described in Bk. 4.6.; it is
						there said to be nameless, but it is called <foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign> at
						2.7.13.</note> or involves virtue; and also it is one of the most indispensable
					requirements of life. For no one would choose to live without friends, but possessing all
					other good things. In fact rich men, rulers and potentates are thought especially to
					require friends, since what would be the good of their prosperity without an outlet for
					beneficence, which is displayed in its fullest and most praiseworthy form towards friends?
					and how could such prosperity be safeguarded and preserved without friends? for the
					greater it is, the greater is its insecurity. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And in poverty or any other misfortune men think friends are their
					only resource. Friends are an aid to the young, to guard them from error; to the elderly,
					to tend them, and to supplement their failing powers of action; to those in the prime of
					life, to assist them in noble deeds&mdash; <quote>

					as friendship appears to be the bond of the state; and lawgivers seem to set more store by
					it than they do by justice, for to promote concord, which seems akin to friendship, is
					their chief aim, while faction, which is enmity, is what they are most anxious to banish.
					And if men are friends, there is no need of justice between them; whereas merely to be
					just is not enough&mdash;a feeling of friendship also is necessary. Indeed the highest
					form of justice seems to have an element of friendly feeling in it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly, &lsquo;And the just are thought to possess friendliness
						in its highest form.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And friendship is not only indispensable as a means, it is also noble in itself. We
					praise those who love their friends, and it is counted a noble thing to have many friends;
					and some people think that a true friend must be a good man. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But there is much difference of opinion as to the nature of friendship. Some define it as
					a matter of similarity; they say that we love those who are like ourselves: whence the
					proverbs &lsquo;Like finds his like,&rsquo; &lsquo;Birds of a feather flock
					together,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;Jackdaw to
						jackdaw.&rsquo;</note> and so on. Others on the contrary say that with men who are

						with potter contends, and joiner quarrels with joiner.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1155b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Some try to
					find a more profound and scientific explanation of the nature of affection. Euripides<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Fr. 890 Dindorf, from an unknown play.</note> writes that
					&lsquo;Earth yearneth for the rain&rsquo; when dried up, &lsquo;And the
					majestic Heaven when filled with rain Yearneth to fall to Earth.&rsquo; Heracleitus
					says, &lsquo;Opposition unites,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The fairest harmony springs
					from difference,&rsquo; and &lsquo;'Tis strife that makes the world go
					on.&rsquo; Others maintain the opposite view, notably Empedocles, who declares that
					&lsquo;Like seeks after like.&rsquo; <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Dismissing then these scientific speculations as not germane to our present enquiry, let
					us investigate the human aspect of the matter, and examine the questions that relate to
					man's character and emotions: for instance, whether all men are capable of friendship, or
					bad men cannot be friends; and whether there is only one sort of friendship or several.
					Those who hold that all friendship is of the same kind because friendship admits of
					degree, are relying on an insufficient proof, for things of different kinds also can
					differ in degree. But this has been discussed before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No passage in the <title>Ethics</title> answers exactly to this reference.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Perhaps the answer to these questions will appear if we ascertain what sort of things
					arouse liking or love. It seems that not everything is loved, but only what is lovable,
					and that this is either what is good, or pleasant, or useful. But useful may be taken to
					mean <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> productive of some good or of pleasure, so
					that the class of things lovable as ends is reduced to the good and the pleasant.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Then, do men like
					what is really good, or what is good for them? for sometimes the two may be at variance;
					and the same with what is pleasant. Now it appears that each person loves what is good for
					himself, and that while what is really good is lovable absolutely, what is good for a
					particular person is lovable for that person. Further, each person loves not what is
					really good for himself, but what appears to him to be so; however, this will not affect
					our argument, for &lsquo;lovable&rsquo; will mean &lsquo;what appears
					lovable.&rsquo; <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There being then three motives of love, the term Friendship is not applied to love for
					inanimate objects, since here there is no return of affection, and also no wish for the
					good of the object&mdash;for instance, it would be ridiculous to wish well to a bottle
					of wine: at the most one wishes that it may keep well in order that one may have it
					oneself; whereas we are told that we ought to wish our friend well for his own sake. But
					persons who wish another good for his own sake, if the feeling is not reciprocated, are
					merely said to feel goodwill for him: only when mutual is such goodwill termed friendship.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And perhaps we should
					also add the qualification that the feeling of goodwill must be known to its object. For a
					man often feels goodwill towards persons whom he has never seen, but whom he believes to
					be good or useful, <milestone n="1156a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and one of these persons may also entertain the same feeling towards
					him. Here then we have a case of two people mutually well-disposed, whom nevertheless we
					cannot speak of as friends, because they are not aware of each other's regard. To be
					friends therefore, men must &lpar;1&rpar; feel goodwill for each other, that is,
					wish each other's good, and &lpar;2&rpar; be aware of each other's goodwill, and
					&lpar;3&rpar; the cause of their goodwill must be one of the lovable qualities
					mentioned above. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now these qualities differ in kind; hence the affection or friendship they occasion may
					differ in kind also. There are accordingly three kinds of friendship, corresponding in
					number to the three lovable qualities; since a reciprocal affection, known to either
					party, can be based on each of the three, and when men love each other, they wish each
					other well in respect of the quality which is the ground of their friendship.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., they wish each other to become more virtuous,
						pleasant, or useful as the case may be; so that there is a different species of
						will-wishing in each case.</note> Thus friends whose affection is based on utility do
					not love each other in themselves, but in so far as some benefit accrues to them from each
					other. And similarly with those whose friendship is based on pleasure: for instance, we
					enjoy the society of witty people not because of what they are in themselves, but because
					they are agreeable to us. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Hence in a friendship based on utility or on pleasure men love their friend for their
					own good or their own pleasure, and not as being the person loved, but as useful or
					agreeable. And therefore these friendships are based on an accident, since the friend is
					not loved for being what he is, but as affording some benefit or pleasure as the case may
					be. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Consequently
					friendships of this kind are easily broken off, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> in
					the event of the parties themselves changing, for if no longer pleasant or useful to each
					other, they cease to love each other. And utility is not a permanent quality; it differs
					at different times. Hence when the motive of the friendship has passed away, the
					friendship itself is dissolved, having existed merely as a means to that end. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Friendships of Utility seem to occur most frequently between the old, as in old age men
					do not pursue pleasure but profit; and between those persons in the prime of life and
					young people whose object in life is gain. Friends of this kind do not indeed frequent
					each other's company much, for in some cases they are not even pleasing to each other, and
					therefore have no use for friendly intercourse unless they are mutually profitable; since
					their pleasure in each other goes no further than their expectations of advantage. </p>
				<p>With these friendships are classed family ties of hospitality with foreigners. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>With the young on the other hand the motive of friendship appears to be pleasure, since
					the young guide their lives by emotion, and for the most part pursue what is pleasant to
					themselves, and the object of the moment. And the things that please them change as their
					age alters; hence they both form friendships and drop them quickly, since their affections
					alter with what gives them pleasure, <milestone n="1156b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and the tastes of youth change quickly. Also the young are
					prone to fall in love, as love is chiefly guided by emotion, and grounded on pleasure;
					hence they form attachments quickly and give them up quickly, often changing before the
					day is out. </p>
				<p>The young do desire to pass their time in their friend's company, for that is how they
					get the enjoyment of their friendship. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The perfect form of friendship is that between the good, and those who resemble each
					other in virtue. For these friends wish each alike the other's good in respect of their
					goodness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 3.1 above, and note.</note> and they
					are good in themselves; but it is those who wish the good of their friends for their
					friends' sake who are friends in the fullest sense, since they love each other for
					themselves and not accidentally.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., for some
						accidental, i.e., temporary or not essential, quality: cf. sects. 2, 3.</note> Hence the
					friendship of these lasts as long as they continue to be good; and virtue is a permanent
					quality. And each is good relatively to his friend as well as absolutely, since the good
					are both good absolutely and profitable to each other. And each is pleasant in both ways
					also, since good men are pleasant both absolutely and to each other; for everyone is
					pleased by his own actions, and therefore by actions that resemble his own, and the
					actions of all good men are the same or similar.&mdash; <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Such friendship is naturally permanent,
					since it combines in itself all the attributes that friends ought to possess. All
					affection is based on good <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> or on pleasure, either
					absolute or relative to the person who feels it, and is prompted by similarity<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">There is some uncertainty here and elsewhere in these
						chapters whether &lsquo;similarity&rsquo; refers to resemblance between the
						friends &lpar;as 3.6, and cf. 1139a 10, <foreign lang="greek">kaq' o(moio/thta/
							tina</foreign>&rpar;, or between the different forms of friendship &lpar;as
						<foreign lang="greek">kaq' o(moio/thta</foreign>, 1157a 32, 1158b 6&rpar; ,
						friendships based on pleasure or profit being only so called &lsquo;by way of
						resemblance,&rsquo; i.e. in an analogical and secondary sense. But the latter
						consideration seems irrelevant here, and is first developed in the next chapter
						&lpar;sects. 1, 4&rpar;. It is true that whether similarity between the parties
						is an element in all friendship &lpar;although this is implied by the words
						&lsquo;who resemble each other in virtue&rsquo; in 3.6&rpar; is nowhere
						clearly decided, and it can hardly be predicated of some friendships considered
						below.</note> of some sort; but this friendship possesses all these attributes in the
					friends themselves, for they are alike, <foreign lang="la">et cetera</foreign>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., absolutely and relatively good and pleasant: cf.
						4.1.</note> in that way.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in themselves, and not
							accidentally.</note> Also the absolutely good is pleasant absolutely as well; but the
					absolutely good and pleasant are the chief objects of affection; therefore it is between
					good men that affection and friendship exist in their fullest and best form. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such friendships are of course rare, because such men are few. Moreover they require time
					and intimacy: as the saying goes, you cannot get to know a man till you have consumed the
					proverbial amount of salt<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Eud. Eth. 7.1238a.2">Aristot. Eud. Eth. 1238a 2</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">dio\ e)is paroimi/an e)lh/luqen o( me/dimnos tw=n a(lw=n</foreign>,
						&lsquo;hence &ldquo;the peck of salt&rdquo; has passed into a
						proverb.&rsquo;</note> in his company; and so you cannot admit him to friendship or
					really be friends, before each has shown the other that he is worthy of friendship and has
					won his confidence. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>People who enter into friendly relations quickly have the wish to be friends, but cannot
					really be friends without being worthy of friendship, and also knowing each other to be
					so; the wish to be friends is a quick growth, but friendship is not. <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This form of friendship is perfect both in point of duration and of the other
					attributes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.7.</note> of friendship; and in all
					respects either party receives from the other the same or similar benefits, as it is
					proper that friends should do. <milestone n="1157a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/></p>
				<p>Friendship based on pleasure has a similarity to friendship based on virtue, for good men
					are pleasant to one another; and the same is true of friendship based on utility, for good
					men are useful to each other. In these cases also the friendship is most lasting when each
					friend derives the same benefit, for instance pleasure, from the other, and not only so,
					but derives it from the same thing, as in a friendship between two witty people, and not
					as in one between a lover and his beloved. These do not find their pleasure in the same
					things: the lover's pleasure is in gazing at his beloved, the loved one's pleasure is in
					receiving the attentions of the lover; and when the loved one's beauty fades, the
					friendship sometimes fades too, as the lover no longer finds pleasure in the sight of his
					beloved, and the loved one no longer receives the attentions of the lover; though on the
					other hand many do remain friends if as a result of their intimacy they have come to love
					each other's characters, both being alike in character. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when a pair of lovers exchange not pleasure for pleasure but pleasure for gain, the
					friendship is less intense and less lasting. </p>
				<p>A friendship based on utility dissolves as soon as its profit ceases; for the friends did
					not love each other, but what they got out of each other. </p>
				<p>Friendships therefore based on pleasure and on and utility can exist between two bad men,
					between one bad man and one good, and between a man neither good nor bad and another
					either good, bad, or neither. But clearly only good men can be friends for what they are
					in themselves; since bad men do not take pleasure in each other, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> save as they get some advantage from each other. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also friendship between good men alone is proof against calumny; for a man is slow to
					believe anybody's word about a friend whom he has himself tried and tested for many years,
					and with them there is the mutual confidence, the incapacity ever to do each other wrong,
					and all the other characteristics that are required in true friendship. Whereas the other
					forms of friendship are liable to be dissolved by calumny and suspicion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But since people do apply the term &lsquo;friends&rsquo; to persons whose regard
					for each other is based on utility, just as states can be &lsquo;friends&rsquo;
					&lpar;since expediency is generally recognized as the motive of international
					alliances&rpar;, or on pleasure, as children make friends, perhaps we too must call
					such relationships friendships; but then we must say that there are several sorts of
					friendship, that between good men, as good, being friendship in the primary and proper
					meaning of the term, while the other kinds are friendships in an analogical sense,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally, &lsquo;by way of resemblance to true
						friendship&rsquo; : see 3.7, note.</note> since such friends are friends in virtue
					of a sort of goodness and of likeness<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the words
						&lsquo;and of likeness&rsquo; are interpolated; the following clause explains
						&lsquo;goodness&rsquo; only. That utility is &lsquo;a sort of
						goodness&rsquo; is assumed.</note> in them: insomuch as pleasure is good in the eyes
					of pleasure-lovers. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But these two secondary forms of
					friendship are not very likely to coincide: men do not make friends with each other both
					for utility and for pleasure at the same time, since accidental qualities are rarely found
					in combination. <milestone n="1157b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Friendship then being divided into these species, inferior people will make friends for
					pleasure or for use, if they are alike in that respect,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in being pleasant or useful to each other; or possibly &lsquo;since they are
						alike in loving pleasure or profit.&rsquo;</note> while good men will be friends for
					each other's own sake, since they are alike in being good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly &lsquo;since they like each other as being
						good.&rsquo;</note> The latter therefore are friends in an absolute sense, the
					former accidentally, and through their similarity to the latter. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is with friendship as it is with the virtues; men are called good in two senses,
					either as having a virtuous disposition or as realizing virtue in action, and similarly
					friends when in each other's company derive pleasure from and confer benefits on each
					other, whereas friends who are asleep or parted are not actively friendly, yet have the
					disposition to be so. For separation does not destroy friendship absolutely, though it
					prevents its active exercise. If however the absence be prolonged, it seems to cause the
					friendly feeling itself to be forgotten: hence the poet's remark<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The source of this is unknown.</note>

				<p>The old and the morose do not appear to be much given to friendship, for their capacity
					to please is small, and nobody can pass his days in the company of one who is distasteful
					to him, or not pleasing, since it seems to be one of the strongest instincts of nature to
					shun what is painful and seek what is pleasant. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And when
					persons approve of each other without seeking such other's society, this seems to be
					goodwill rather than friendship. Nothing is more characteristic of friends than that they
					seek each other's society: <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> poor men desire their
					friends' assistance, and even the most prosperous wish for their companionship
					&lpar;indeed they are the last people to adopt the life of a recluse&rpar;; but it
					is impossible for men to spend their time together unless they give each other pleasure,
					or have common tastes. The latter seems to be the bond between the members of a
					comradeship.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The <foreign lang="greek">e(tairei=ai</foreign>, or Comradeships, at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> were associations of men of the same age and social standing. In the
						fifth century they had a political character, and were oligarchical in tendency, but in

						more than social clubs, whose members were united by personal regard, and were felt to
						have claims on each other's resources. See chaps. 9.2, 11.5, 12.4, 6; 9.2.1, 3, 9; Bk.
						10.6.</note>
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Friendship between good men then is the truest friendship, as has been said several times
					before. For it is agreed that what is good and pleasant absolutely is lovable and
					desirable strictly, while what is good and pleasant for a particular person is lovable and
					desirable relatively to that person; but the friendship of good men for each other rests
					on both these grounds.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., good men love each other
						because they are both good and pleasant absolutely and good and pleasant for each other.</note>
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Liking<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence would come better after the
					following one.</note> seems to be an emotion, friendship a fixed disposition, for liking
					can be felt even for inanimate things, but reciprocal liking<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 2.3.</note> involves deliberate choice, and this springs from a fixed
					disposition. Also, when men wish the good of those they love for their own sakes, their
					goodwill does not depend on emotion but on a fixed disposition. And in loving their friend
					they love their own good, for the good man in becoming dear to another becomes that
					other's good. Each party therefore both loves his own good and also makes an equivalent
					return by wishing the other's good, and by affording him pleasure; for there is a saying,
					&lsquo;Amity is equality,&rsquo; <milestone n="1158a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and this is most fully realized in the
					friendships of the good. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Morose and elderly people rarely make friends, as they are inclined to be surly, and do
					not take much pleasure in society; good temper and sociability appear to be the chief
					constituents or causes of friendship. Hence the young make friends quickly, but the old do
					not, since they do not make friends with people if they do not enjoy their company; and
					the same applies to persons of a morose temper. It is true that the old or morose may feel
					goodwill for each other, since they may wish each other well and help each other in case
					of need; but they cannot properly be called friends, as they do not seek each other's
					society nor enjoy it, and these are thought to be the chief marks of friendship.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is not possible to have many friends in the full meaning of the word friendship, any
					more than it is to be in love with many people at once &lpar;love indeed seems to be
					an excessive state of emotion, such as is naturally felt towards one person
					only&rpar;; and it is not easy for the same person to like a number of people at once,
					nor indeed perhaps can good men be found in large numbers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Also for perfect friendship you must get to know a man thoroughly, and become intimate
					with him, which is a very difficult thing to do. But it is possible to like a number of
					persons for their utility and pleasantness, for useful and pleasant people are plentiful,
					and the benefits they confer can be enjoyed at once. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Of these two inferior kinds of friendship, the one that more closely resembles true
					friendship is that based on pleasure, in which the same benefit is conferred by both
					parties, and they enjoy each other's company, or have common tastes; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> as is the case with the friendships of young people. For in these
					there is more generosity of feeling, whereas the friendship of utility is a thing for
					sordid souls. Also those blessed with great prosperity have no need of useful friends, but
					do need pleasant ones, since they desire some society; and though they may put up with
					what is unpleasant for a short time, no one would stand it continually: you could not
					endure even the Absolute Good itself for ever, if it bored you; and therefore the rich
					seek for friends who will be pleasant. No doubt they ought to require them to be good as
					well as pleasant, and also good for them, since then they would possess all the proper
					qualifications for friendship. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But princes and rulers
					appear to keep their friends in separate compartments: they have some that are useful, and
					some that are pleasant, but rarely any that are both at once. For they do not seek for
					friends who are pleasant because they are good, or are useful for noble purposes, but look
					for witty people when they desire pleasure, and for the other sort seek men who are clever
					at executing their commissions; and these two qualities are rarely found in the same
					person. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The good man, as we have said, is both useful and
					pleasant, but the good man does not become the friend of a superior, unless his superior
					in rank be also his superior in virtue; otherwise the good man as the inferior party
					cannot make matters proportionally equal.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For this
						&lsquo;proportional equalization&rsquo; of the parties to an unequal friendship
						see 7.2, 13.1. It would appear that the meaning here is, that unless the great man is
						also better than the good man, the good man cannot give more love or respect to the
						great man than the great man gives to him, which is the only way in which the good man
						can compensate the great man for giving more benefits than he gets, and so be put on an
						equality; see further on 9.1.1.</note> But potentates of such superior excellence are
					scarcely common. <milestone n="1158b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But to resume: the forms of friendship of which we have spoken are friendships of
					equality, for both parties render the same benefit and wish the same good to each other,
					or else exchange<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., equivalent amounts of two
						different things.</note> two different benefits, for instance pleasure and profit.
					&lpar;These<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., friendships based on pleasure
						or utility or both, in contrast to those based on virtue; although the latter also are,
						of course, &lsquo;friendships of equality.&rsquo; The parenthesis breaks the
						flow of the argument.</note> are less truly friendships, and less permanent, as we have
					said; and opinions differ as to whether they are really friendships at all, owing to their
					being both like and unlike the same thing. In view of their likeness to friendship based
					on virtue they do appear to be friendships, for the one contains pleasure and the other
					utility, and these are attributes of that form of friendship too; but in that friendship
					based on virtue is proof against calumny, and permanent, while the others quickly change,
					besides differing in many other respects, they appear not to be real friendships, owing to
					their unlikeness to it.&rpar; <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But there is a different kind of friendship, which involves superiority of one party over
					the other, for example, the friendship between father and son, and generally between an
					older person and a younger, and that between husband and wife, and between any ruler and
					the persons ruled. These friendships also vary among themselves. The friendship between
					parents and children is not the same as that between ruler and ruled, nor indeed is the
					friendship of father for son the same as that of son for father, nor that of husband for
					wife as that of wife for husband; for each of these persons has a different excellence and
					function, and also different motives for their regard, and so the affection and friendship
					they feel are different. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now in these unequal friendships the benefits that one
					party receives and is entitled to claim from the other are not the same on either side;
					but the friendship between parents and children will be enduring and equitable, when the
					children render to the parents the services due to the authors of one's being, and the
					parents to the children those due to one's offspring. The affection rendered in these
					various unequal friendships should also be proportionate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., unequal, and proportionate to the benefits received.</note>: the
					better of the two parties, for instance, or the more useful or otherwise superior as the
					case may be, should receive more affection than he bestows; since when the affection
					rendered is proportionate to desert, this produces equality in a sense between the
					parties, and equality is felt to be an essential element of friendship. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Equality in friendship, however, does not seem to be like equality in matters of justice.
					In the sphere of justice, &lsquo;equal&rsquo; &lpar;fair&rpar; means
					primarily proportionate to desert, and &lsquo;equal in quantity&rsquo; is only a
					secondary sense; whereas in friendship &lsquo;equal in quantity&rsquo; is the
					primary meaning, and &lsquo;proportionate to desert&rsquo; only secondary.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This is clearly seen when a wide disparity arises
					between two friends in point of virtue or vice, or of wealth, or anything else; they no
					longer remain nor indeed expect to remain friends. This is most manifest in the case of
					the gods, whose superiority in every good attribute is pre-eminent; <milestone n="1159a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>but it is also seen with
					princes: in their case also men much below them in station do not expect to be their
					friends, nor do persons of no particular merit expect to be the friends of men of
					distinguished excellence or wisdom. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It is true that we
					cannot fix a precise limit in such cases, up to which two men can still be friends; the
					gap may go on widening and the friendship still remain<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit. &lsquo;though many things are taken away, &lpar;friendship&rpar; still
						remains&rsquo;; apparently an allusion to the Sorites fallacy &lpar;<foreign lang="la">ratio ruentis acervi</foreign>, <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 2.1.47">Hor. Ep.
							2.1.47</bibl>&rpar; , How many grains can be taken from a heap of corn for it still
						to be in a heap?</note>; but when one becomes very remote from the other, as God is
					remote from man, it can continue no longer. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>This gives
					rise to the question, is it not after all untrue that we wish our friends the greatest of
					goods? for instance, can we wish them to become gods? for then they will lose us as
					friends, and therefore lose certain goods, for friends are goods.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is a contradiction in terms to wish a friend a good that involves a
						loss of good.</note> If then it was rightly said above<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2.3.</note> that a true friend wishes his friend's good for that friend's
					own sake, the friend would have to remain himself, whatever that may be; so that he will
					really wish him only the greatest goods compatible with his remaining a human being. And
					perhaps not all of these, for everybody wishes good things for himself most of all.
					<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Most men however, because they love honor, seem to be more desirous of receiving than of
					bestowing affection. Hence most men like flattery, for a flatterer is a friend who is your
					inferior,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the party to the friendship who gets
						more than he gives, and redresses the balance by repaying more affection or esteem than
						he receives.</note> or pretends to be so, and to love you more than you love him; but to
					be loved is felt to be nearly the same as to be honored, which most people covet.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They do not however appear to value honor for its own
					sake, but for something incidental to it. Most people like receiving honor from men of
					high station, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> because they hope for something from
					them: they think that if they want something, the great man will be able to give it them;
					so they enjoy being honored by him as a token of benefits to come. Those on the other hand
					who covet being honored by good men, and by persons who know them, do so from a desire to
					confirm their own opinion of themselves; so<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly
						&lsquo;so what they really enjoy is being assured,&rsquo; etc.</note> these like
					honor because they are assured of their worth by their confidence in the judgement of
					those who assert it. Affection on the other hand men like for its own sake; from which we
					infer that it is more valuable than honor, and that friendship is desirable in itself.
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But in its essence friendship seems to consist more in giving than in receiving
					affection: witness the pleasure that mothers take in loving their children. Some mothers
					put their infants out to nurse, and though knowing and loving them, do not ask to be loved
					by them in return, if it be impossible to have this as well, but are content if they see
					them prospering; they retain their own love for them even though the children, not knowing
					them, cannot render them any part of what is due to a mother. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>As then friendship consists more especially in bestowing affection, and
					as we praise men for loving their friends, affection seems to be the mark of a good
					friend. Hence it is friends that love each other as each deserves <milestone n="1159b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>who continue friends and whose
					friendship is lasting. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also it is by rendering affection in proportion to desert that friends who are not equals
					may approach most nearly to true friendship, since this will make them equal. Amity
					consists in equality and similarity, especially the similarity of those who are alike in
					virtue; for being true to themselves, these also remain true to one another, and neither
					request nor render services that are morally degrading. Indeed they may be said actually
					to restrain each other from evil: since good men neither err themselves nor permit their
					friends to err. Bad men on the other hand have no constancy in friendship, for they do not
					even remain true to their own characters; but they can be friends for a short time, while
					they take pleasure in each other's wickedness. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The
					friendships of useful and pleasant people last longer, in fact as long as they give each
					other pleasure or benefit. It is friendship based on utility that seems most frequently to
					spring from opposites, for instance a friendship between a poor man and a rich one, or
					between an ignorant man and a learned; for a person desiring something which he happens to
					lack will give something else in return for it. One may bring under this class the
					friendship between a lover and the object of his affections, or between a plain person and
					a handsome one. This is why lovers sometimes appear ridiculous when they claim that their
					love should be equally reciprocated; no doubt if they are equally lovable this is a
					reasonable demand, but it is ridiculous if they have nothing attractive about them.
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But perhaps there is no real attraction between opposites <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> as such, but only accidentally, and what they actually desire is
					the mean between them &lpar;since this is the Good&rpar;; the dry for instance
					striving not to become wet, but to reach an intermediate state, and so with the hot, and
					everything else. Let us however dismiss this question, as being indeed somewhat foreign to
					our subject. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The objects and the personal relationships with which friendship is concerned appear, as
					was said at the outset,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.4.</note> to be the same as
					those which are the sphere of justice. For in every partnership we find mutual rights of
					some sort, and also friendly feeling: one notes that shipmates and fellow-soldiers speak
					of each other as &lsquo;my friend,&rsquo; and so in fact do the partners in any
					joint undertaking. But their friendship is limited to the extent of their association in
					their common business, for so also are their mutual rights as associates. Again, the
					proverb says &lsquo;Friends' goods are common property,&rsquo; and this is
					correct, since community is the essence of friendship. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Brothers have all things in common, and so do members of a comradeship<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 5.3, note.</note>; other friends hold special
					possessions in common, more or fewer in different cases, inasmuch as friendships vary in
					degree. The claims of justice also differ in different relationships. <milestone n="1160a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>The mutual rights of parents
					and children are not the same as those between brothers; the obligations of members of a
					comradeship not the same as those of fellow-citizens; and similarly with the other forms
					of friendship. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Injustice therefore also is differently
					constituted in each of these relationships: wrong is increasingly serious in proportion as
					it is done to a nearer friend. For example, it is more shocking to defraud a comrade of
					money than a fellow-citizen; or to refuse aid to a brother than to do so to a stranger; or
					to strike one's father than to strike anybody else. Similarly it is natural that the
					claims of justice also should increase with the nearness of the friendship, since
					friendship and justice exist between the same persons and are co-extensive in range.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But all associations are parts as it were of the association of the State. Travellers for
					instance associate together for some advantage, namely to procure some of their necessary
					supplies. But the political association too, it is believed, was originally formed, and
					continues to be maintained, for the advantage of its members: the aim of lawgivers is the
					good of the community, and justice is sometimes defined as that which is to the common
					advantage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Thus the other associations aim at some
					particular advantage; for example sailors combine to seek the profits of seafaring in the
					way of trade or the like, comrades in arms the gains of warfare, their aim being either
					plunder, or victory over the enemy or the capture of a city<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally &lsquo;plunder or victory or a city&rsquo;; the last
						words may refer either to colonists or exiles who obtain a new abode by conquest, or to
						civil war; but the expression is improbable, and perhaps should be emended to
						&lsquo;or to defend the city.&rsquo;</note>; and similarly the members of a
					tribe or parish<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The bracketed sentences, as Cook Wilson
						points out, look like an interpolated fragment of a parallel version.</note>
					&lsqb;And some associations appear to be formed for the sake of pleasure, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for example religious guilds and dining-clubs, which are
					unions for sacrifice and social intercourse. But all these associations seem to be
					subordinate to the association of the State, which aims not at a temporary advantage but
					at one covering the whole of life.&rsqb; combine to perform sacrifices and hold
					festivals in connection with them, thereby both paying honor to the gods and providing
					pleasant holidays for themselves. For it may be noticed that the sacrifices and festivals
					of ancient origin take place after harvest, being in fact harvest-festivals; this is
					because that was the season of the year at which people had most leisure. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>All these associations then appear to be parts of the association of the
					State; and the limited friendships which we reviewed will correspond to the limited
					associations from which they spring. <milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now there are three forms of constitution, and also an equal number of perversions or
					corruptions of those forms. The constitutions are Kingship, Aristocracy, and thirdly, a
					constitution based on a property classification, which it seems appropriate to describe as
					timocratic, although most people are accustomed to speak of it merely as a constitutional
					government or Republic. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The best of these constitutions
					is Kingship, and the worst Timocracy. The perversion of Kingship is Tyranny. <milestone n="1160b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Both are monarchies,
					but there is a very wide difference between them: a tyrant studies his own advantage, a
					king that of his subjects. For a monarch is not a king<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably the text should read &lsquo;a king is not a king at all
						unless&mdash;&rsquo;</note> if he does not possess independent resources, and is
					not better supplied with goods of every kind than his subjects; but a ruler so situated
					lacks nothing, and therefore will not study his own interests but those of his subjects.
					&lpar;A king who is not independent of his subjects will be merely a sort of titular
					king.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally, &lsquo;a king elected by
						lot,&rsquo; like the annual archon at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who had the title of king, but retained only certain religious
						functions from the primitive monarchy.</note>&rpar; Tyranny is the exact opposite in
					this respect, for the tyrant pursues his own good. The inferiority of Tyranny among the
					perversions is more evident than that of Timocracy among the constitutions, for the
					opposite of the best must be the worst. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>When a change of constitution takes place, Kingship passes into Tyranny, because Tyranny
					is the bad form of monarchy, so that a bad king becomes a tyrant. Aristocracy passes into
					Oligarchy owing to badness in the rulers, who do not distribute what the State has to
					offer according to desert, but give all or most of its benefits to themselves, and always
					assign the offices to the same persons, because they set supreme value upon riches; thus
					power is in the hands of a few bad men, instead of being in the hands of the best men.
					Timocracy passes into Democracy, there being an affinity between them, inasmuch as the
					ideal of Timocracy also is government by the mass of the citizens, and within the property
					qualification all are equal. Democracy is the least bad <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> of the perversions, for it is only a very small deviation from the
					constitutional form of government.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., timocracy: see
						10.1 fin.</note> These are the commonest ways in which revolutions occur in states,
					since they involve the smallest change, and come about most easily. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>One may find likenesses and so to speak models of these various forms of constitution in
					the household. The relationship of father to sons is regal in type, since a father's first
					care is for his children's welfare. This is why Homer styles Zeus
					&lsquo;father,&rsquo; for the ideal of kingship is paternal government. Among the
					Persians paternal rule is tyrannical, for the Persians use their sons as slaves. The
					relation of master to slaves is also tyrannic, since in it the master's interest is aimed
					at. The autocracy of a master appears to be right, that of the Persian father wrong; for
					different subjects should be under different forms of rule. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The relation of husband to wife seems to be in the nature of an
					aristocracy: the husband rules in virtue of fitness, and in matters that belong to a man's
					sphere; matters suited to a woman he hands over to his wife. When the husband controls
					everything, he transforms the relationship into an oligarchy, for he governs in violation
					of fitness, and not in virtue of superiority. <milestone n="1161a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>And sometimes when the wife is an heiress it is
					she who rules. In these cases then authority goes not by virtue but by wealth and power,
					as in an oligarchy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The relation between brothers
					constitutes a sort of timocracy; they are equals, save in so far as they differ in age;
					hence, if the divergence in age be great, the friendship between them cannot be of the
					fraternal type. Democracy appears most fully in households without a master, for in them
					all the members are equal; but it also prevails where the ruler of the house is weak, and
					everyone is allowed to do what he likes. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Under each of these forms of government we find friendship existing between ruler and
					ruled, to the same extent as justice. The friendship of a king for his subjects is one of
					superiority in beneficence; for a king does good to his subjects, inasmuch as being good
					he studies to promote their welfare, as a shepherd studies the welfare of his sheep; hence
					Homer called Agamemnon &lsquo;shepherd of the people.&rsquo; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The friendship of a father for his child is of the same kind
					&lpar;only here the benefits bestowed are greater, for the father is the source of the
					child's existence, which seems to be the greatest of all boons, and of its nurture and
					education; and we also ascribe the same benefits to our forefathers&rpar;. For it is
					as natural for a father to rule his children, and forefathers those descended from them,
					as for a king to rule his subjects. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These friendships then involve a superiority of benefits
					on one side, which is why parents receive honor as well as service.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc., because their children cannot fully repay their services in
						kind.</note> The claims of justice also, therefore, in these relations are not the same on
					both sides, but proportionate to desert, as is the affection bestowed. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The friendship between husband and wife again is the same as that which prevails between
					rulers and subjects in an aristocracy; for it is in proportion to excellence, and the
					better party receives the larger share &lsqb;of good&rsqb;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word &lsquo;good&rsquo; looks like an interpolation. The
						sense seems to require &lsquo;a larger share of affection&rsquo; &lpar;
						<foreign lang="greek">fili/as</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">filh/sews</foreign>,
						understood&rpar;; it is clear throughout that in an unequal friendship the superior
						party receives not more but less benefit &lpar;though more affection&rpar; than
						the inferior. In 10.5 the conjugal association is compared to the aristocratic polity in
						virtue of the fact that the superior party has more power, not more benefit; and from
						10.3 it appears that when the ruling class takes all or most of the benefits for itself,
						the government is no longer an aristocracy but an oligarchy.</note> whilst each party
					receives what is appropriate to each; and the same is true of the claims of justice on
					either side. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Friendship between brothers is like that between members of a comradeship: the two
					parties are equal in station and age, and this usually implies identity of feelings and of
					character. The counterpart of fraternal friendship is that which exists under the
					timocratic form of constitution; since the ideal of Timocracy is that all citizens shall
					be equal and shall be good, so that they all rule in turn, and all have an equal share of
					power; and therefore the friendship between them is also one of equality. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Under the perverted forms of constitution friendship like justice can have but little
					scope, and least of all in the worst: there is little or no friendship between ruler and
					subjects in a tyranny. For where there is nothing in common between ruler and ruled, there
					can be no friendship between them either, any more than there can be justice. It is like
					the relation between a craftsman and his tool, or between the soul and the body
					&lsqb;or between master and slave<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words are
						better omitted, as they anticipate what comes below.</note>&rsqb;: <milestone n="1161b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>all these instruments
					it is true are benefited by the persons who use them, but there can be no friendship, nor
					justice, towards inanimate things; indeed not even towards a horse or an ox, nor yet
					towards a slave as slave. For master and slave have nothing in common: a slave is a living
					tool, just as a tool is an inanimate slave. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Therefore
					there can be no friendship with a slave as slave, though there can be as human being: for
					there seems to be some room for justice in the relations of every human being with every
					other that is capable of participating in law and contract, and hence friendship also is
					possible with everyone so far as he is a human being. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Hence even in tyrannies there is but little scope for friendship and justice between
					ruler and subjects; but there is most room for them in democracies, where the citizens
					being equal have many things in common. <milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>All friendship, as we have said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">chap. 9.1.</note>
					involves community; but the friendship between relatives and between members of a
					comradeship may be set apart as being less in the nature of partnerships than are the
					friendships between fellow-citizens, fellow-tribesmen, shipmates, and the like; since
					these seem to be founded as it were on a definite compact. With the latter friendships may
					be classed family ties of hospitality between foreigners. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Friendship between relatives itself seems to include a variety of species, but all appear
					to derive from the affection of parent for child. For parents love their children as part
					of themselves, whereas children love their parents as the source of their being.
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Also parents know their offspring with more
					certainty than children know their parentage; and progenitor is more attached to progeny
					than progeny to progenitor, since that which springs from a thing belongs to the thing
					from which it springs&mdash;for instance, a tooth or hair or what not to its
					owner&mdash;whereas the thing it springs from does not belong to it at all, or only in
					a less degree. The affection of the parent exceeds that of the child in duration also;
					parents love their children as soon as they are born, children their parents only when
					time has elapsed and they have acquired understanding,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 6.11.2 and note.</note> or at least perception. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These considerations<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, greater certainty of
						parentage, closer affinity and earlier commencement of affection.</note> also explain
					why parental affection is stronger in the mother. Parents then love their children as
					themselves &lpar;one's offspring being as it were another self&mdash;other because
					separate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;a second self produced by
						separation from oneself.&rsquo;</note>&rpar;; children love their parents as the
					source of their being; brothers love each other as being from the same source, since the
					identity of their relations to that source identifies them with one another, which is why
					we speak of &lsquo;being of the same blood&rsquo; or &lsquo;of the same
					stock&rsquo; or the like; brothers are therefore in a manner the same being, though
					embodied in separate persons. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But friendship between
					brothers is also greatly fostered by their common upbringing and similarity of age;
					&lsquo;two of an age agree,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">h(=lic h(/lika</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">te/rpeI</foreign>,
						<bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1371b">Aristot. Rh. 1371b 15</bibl>. &lsquo;Crabbed age
						and youth cannot live together.&rsquo; In its fuller form the proverb continues,
						&lsquo;the old get on with the old,&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">h(=lic h(/lika
							te/rpe, ge/rwn de/ te te/rpe ge/ronta</foreign> schol. ad Plat. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 240c">Plat. Phaedrus 240c</bibl>. The next phrase appears to be a
						proverb as well.</note> and &lsquo;familiarity breeds fellowship,&rsquo; which
					is why the friendship between brothers resembles that between members of a comradeship.
					<milestone n="1162a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Cousins
					and other relatives derive their attachment from the fraternal relationship, since it is
					due to their descent from the same ancestor; and their sense of attachment is greater or
					less, according as the common ancestor is nearer or more remote. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The affection of children for their parents, like that of men for the gods, is the
					affection for what is good, and superior to oneself; for their parents have bestowed on
					them the greatest benefits in being the cause of their existence and rearing, and later of
					their education. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Also the friendship between parents and
					children affords a greater degree both of pleasure and of utility than that between
					persons unrelated to each other, inasmuch as they have more in common in their lives. </p>
				<p>Friendship between brothers has the same characteristics as that between members of a
					comradeship, and has them in a greater degree, provided they are virtuous, or resemble one
					another in any way<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc. not only when they are alike in
						virtue.</note>; inasmuch as brothers belong more closely to each other, and have loved
					each other from birth, and inasmuch as children of the same parents, who have been brought
					up together and educated alike, are more alike in character; also with brothers the test
					of time has been longest and most reliable. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>The degrees
					of friendship between other relatives vary correspondingly.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in proportion to the closeness of the relationship: cf. 12.4
						fin.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The friendship between husband and wife appears to be a natural instinct; since man is by
					nature a pairing creature even more than he is a political creature,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.7.6, note.</note> inasmuch as the family is an earlier and more
					fundamental institution than the State, and the procreation of offspring a more
					general<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">More universal than the gregarious instinct,
						which finds its highest expression in the state.</note> characteristic of the animal
					creation. So whereas with the other animals <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the
					association of the sexes aims only at continuing the species, human beings cohabit not
					only for the sake of begetting children but also to provide the needs of life; for with
					the human race division of labor begins at the outset, and man and woman have different
					functions; thus they supply each other's wants, putting their special capacities into the
					common stock. Hence the friendship of man and wife seems to be one of utility and pleasure
					combined. But it may also be based on virtue, if the partners be of high moral character;
					for either sex has its special virtue, and this may be the ground of attraction. Children,
					too, seem to be a bond of union, and therefore childless marriages are more easily
					dissolved; for children are a good possessed by both parents in common, and common
					property holds people together. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The question what rules of conduct should govern the relations between husband and wife,
					and generally between friend and friend, seems to be ultimately a question of justice.
					There are different claims of justice between friends and strangers, between members of a
					comradeship and schoolfellows. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>There are then, as we said at the outset, three kinds of friendship, and in each kind
					there are both friends who are on an equal footing and friends on a footing of disparity;
					for two equally good men may be friends, or one better man and one worse; <milestone n="1162b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and similarly with
					pleasant friends and with those who are friends for the sake of utility, who may be equal
					or may differ in the amount of the benefits<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the
						pleasure or utility as the case may be.</note> which they confer. Those who are equals
					must make matters equal by loving each other, etc.,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., &lsquo;and by being good or pleasant and useful.&rsquo;</note> equally;
					those who are unequal by making a return<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The one who is
						less good or pleasant or useful must give more affection: see 6.6, note, 7.2.</note>
					proportionate to the superiority of whatever kind on the one side. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Complaints and recriminations occur solely or chiefly in friendships of utility, as is to
					be expected. In a friendship based on virtue each party is eager to benefit the other, for
					this is characteristic of virtue and of friendship; and as they vie with each other in
					giving and not in getting benefit, no complaints nor quarrels can arise, since nobody is
					angry with one who loves him and benefits him, but on the contrary, if a person of good
					feeling, requites him with service in return; and the one who outdoes the other in
					beneficence will not have any complaint against his friend, since he gets what he desires,
					and what each man desires is the good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The last clause
						is suspected as an interpolation.</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Nor again are complaints likely to occur between friends
					whose motive is pleasure either; for if they enjoy each other's company, both alike get
					what they wish for; and indeed it would seem ridiculous to find fault with somebody for
					not being agreeable to you, when you need not associate with him if you do not want to do
					so. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But a friendship whose motive is utility is liable to
					give rise to complaints. For here the friends associate with each other for profit, and so
					each always wants more, and thinks he is getting less than his due; and they make it a
					grievance that they do not get as much as they want and deserve; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and the one who is doing a service can never supply all that the
					one receiving it wants. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It appears that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and the other defined by law,
					so the friendship based on utility may be either moral<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., either a &lsquo;moral obligation&rsquo; or a contract enforceable by law.
						It is noteworthy that the term &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; is stretched to include
						the latter.</note> or legal. Hence occasions for complaint chiefly occur when the type
					of friendship in view at the conclusion of the transaction is not the same as when the a
					relationship was formed. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Such a connection when on stated
					terms is one of the legal type, whether it be a purely business matter of exchange on the
					spot, or a more liberal accommodation for future repayment,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;more liberal in point of time.&rsquo;</note> though
					still with an agreement as to the <foreign lang="la">quid pro quo</foreign>; and in the
					latter case the obligation is clear and cannot cause dispute, though there is an element
					of friendliness in the delay allowed, for which reason in some states there is no action
					at law in these cases, it being held that the party to a contract involving credit must
					abide by the consequences. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>The moral type on the other
					hand is not based on stated terms, but the gift or other service is given as to a friend,
					although the giver expects to receive an equivalent or greater return, as though it had
					not been a free gift but a loan; and as he ends the relationship in a different spirit
					from that in which he began it, he will complain.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sc.,
						if disappointed of the return he expects.</note>
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>The reason of this is that all men, or most men, wish
					what is noble but choose what is profitable; and while it is noble to render a service not
					with an eye to receiving one in return, <milestone n="1163a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>it is profitable to receive one. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>One ought therefore, if one can, to return the equivalent of services
					received, and to do so willingly; for one ought not to make a man one's friend if one is
					unwilling to return his favors. Recognizing therefore that one has made a mistake at the
					beginning and accepted a service from a wrong person&mdash;that is, a person who was
					not a friend, and was not acting disinterestedly<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit.,
						&lsquo;was not doing the service for its own sake,&rsquo; or perhaps
						&lsquo;for the sake of friendship.&rsquo; But probably the text should be
						corrected to read &lsquo;was not doing the service for one's own sake&rsquo;:
						cf. 9.1.7, 10.6 fin.</note> &mdash;one should accordingly end the transaction as if
					one had accepted the service on stated terms. Also, one would agree<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., in any case of the sort, if at the outset the question of repayment
						were raised.</note> to repay a service if able to do so &lpar;and if one were not
					able, the giver on his side too would not have expected repayment&rpar;; hence, if
					possible, one ought to make a return. But one ought to consider at the beginning from whom
					one is receiving the service, and on what terms, so that one may accept it on those terms
					or else decline it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Dispute may arise however as to the value of the service rendered. Is it to be measured
					by the benefit to the recipient, and the return made on that basis, or by the cost to the
					doer? The recipient will say that what he received was only a trifle to his benefactor, or
					that he could have got it from someone else: he beats down the value. The other on the
					contrary will protest that it was the most valuable thing he had to give, or that it could
					not have been obtained from anybody else, or that it was bestowed at a time of danger or
					in some similar emergency. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Perhaps then we may say that,
					when the friendship is one of utility, the measure of the service should be its value to
					the recipient, since it is he who wants it, and the other comes to his aid in the
					expectation of an equivalent return; therefore the degree of assistance rendered has been
					the amount to which the recipient has benefited, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					and so he ought to pay back as much as he has got out of it; or even more, for that will
					be more noble. </p>
				<p>In friendships based on virtue, complaints do not arise, but the measure of the benefit
					seems to be the intention<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit.,
						&lsquo;choice&rsquo; in Aristotle's technical sense.</note> of the giver; for
					intention is the predominant factor in virtue and in character. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Differences also arise in friendships where there is disparity between the parties. Each
					claims to get more than the other, and this inevitably leads to a rupture. If one is a
					better man than the other, he thinks he has a right to more, for goodness deserves the
					larger share. And similarly when one is more useful than the other: if a man is of no use,
					they say, he ought not to have an equal share, for it becomes a charity and not a
					friendship at all, if what one gets out of it is not enough to repay one's trouble. For
					men think that it ought to be in a friendship as it is in a business partnership, where
					those who contribute more capital take more of the profits. On the other hand the needy or
					inferior person takes the opposite view: he maintains that it is the part of a good friend
					to assist those in need; what is the use &lpar;he argues&rpar; of being friends
					with the good and great if one is to get nothing out of it? <milestone n="1163b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now it appears that each of these rival claims is right. Both parties should receive a
					larger share from the friendship, but not a larger share of the same thing: the superior
					should receive the larger share of honor, the needy one the larger share of profit; for
					honor is the due reward of virtue and beneficence, while need obtains the aid it requires
					in pecuniary gain. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The same principle is seen to obtain in public life.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 5.2.12, 5.4.2.</note> A citizen who contributes nothing of value to the common
					stock is not held in honor, for the common property is given to those who benefit the
					community, and honor is a part of the common property. For a man cannot expect to make
					money out of the community and to receive honor as well. For<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This explains why a benefactor of the commonwealth must receive a reward
						in the shape of honor.</note> nobody is content to have the smaller share all round, and
					so we pay honor to the man who suffers money loss by holding office, and give money to the
					one who takes bribes; since requital in accordance with desert restores equality, and is
					the preservative of friendship,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the friendly
						feeling between the citizens as such, see 9.1. But that this is maintained by <foreign lang="greek">to\ kat' a)ci/an</foreign> has not been said before: indeed the phrase is
						an odd description of what precedes, and its applicability to private friendship is
						denied just below. Perhaps &lsquo;since requital . . . above&rsquo; is an
						interpolation.</note> as has been said above. </p>
				<p>This principle therefore should also regulate the intercourse of friends who are unequal:
					the one who is benefited in purse or character must repay what he can, namely honor.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For friendship exacts what is possible, not what is
					due; requital in accordance with desert is in fact sometimes impossible, for instance in
					honoring the gods, or one's parents: no one could ever render them the honor they deserve,
					and a man is deemed virtuous if he pays them all the regard that he can. Hence it would
					appear that a son never ought to disown his father, although a father may disown his son;
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for a debtor ought to pay what he owes, but
					nothing that a son can do comes up to the benefits he has received, so that a son is
					always in his father's debt. But a creditor may discharge his debtor, and therefore a
					father may disown his son. At the same time, no doubt it is unlikely that a father ever
					would abandon a son unless the son were excessively vicious; for natural affection apart,
					it is not in human nature to reject the assistance that a son will be able to render.
					Whereas a bad son will look on the duty of supporting his father as one to be avoided, or
					at all events not eagerly undertaken; for most people wish to receive benefits, but avoid
					bestowing them as unprofitable. </p>

				<p>In all dissimilar<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or
					&lsquo;heterogeneous,&rsquo; i.e., friendships between dissimilar people, e.g.
					one pleasant and the other useful, so that the benefits they confer on each other are
					different in kind. This class of friendship has not been named before, thought it has
					been recognized, e.g. 8.4.1, 2. It is however incorrectly stated here that the notion of
					proportion has been applied to it; for the benefits exchanged in such friendships,
					though different in kind, are not &lsquo;proportional,&rsquo; but actually equal
					in amount or value, just as much as in the friendships where they are the same in kind;
					see 8.6.7. The term &lsquo;proportion&rsquo; has hitherto been used of
					&lsquo;unequal&rsquo; friendships, where the superior party bestows more benefit
					&lpar;of whatever kind&rpar; than he receives, and equality is only restored by
					his receiving more affection than he bestows: see 8.7.2, 13.1 &lpar;and also 14.3,
					to which at first sight this passage might be taken to refer&rpar;. No doubt a
					friendship might be both &lsquo;dissimilar&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;unequal.&rsquo; That between a good man and a superior in rank who also
					surpasses him in goodness, which seems to be contemplated at 8.6.6, is a complex example
					of this nature; the great man confers both material benefit and moral edification, the
					good man returns moral edification only, but makes up the deficit by the greater regard
					which the great man's superior goodness enables him to feel.</note> friendships, it is
					proportion, as has been said, that establishes equality and preserves the friendship; just
					as, in the relations between fellow-citizens, the shoemaker receives payment for his
					shoes, and the weaver and the other craftsmen for their products, according to value
					rendered. <milestone n="1164a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In these business
					relationships then a common measure has been devised, namely money, and this is a standard
					to which all things are referred and by which they are measured. But in sentimental
					friendships, the lover sometimes complains that his warmest affection meets with no
					affection in return, it may be because there is nothing in him to arouse affection; while
					the person loved frequently complains that the lover who formerly promised everything now
					fulfils none of his promises. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Such disputes occur when pleasure is the motive of the friendship on the
					lover's side and profit on the side of the beloved, and when they no longer each possess
					the desired attribute. For in a friendship based on these motives, a rupture occurs as
					soon as the parties cease to obtain the things for the sake of which they were friends;
					seeing that neither loved the other in himself, but some attribute he possessed that was
					not permanent; so that these friendships are not permanent either. But friendship based on
					character is disinterested, and therefore lasting, as has been said.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">8.3.7.</note>
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Differences arise when the friends do not obtain what they desire, but something else;
					for not to get what you want is almost the same as not to get anything at all. For
					instance, there is the story of the man who hired a harper, and promised that the better
					he played the more he would pay him; but next morning, when the harper asked him to fulfil
					his promise, he said that he had already paid for the pleasure he had received by the
					pleasure he had given.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. De Alex. 2.1">Plut. De Alexandri fortuna 2.1</bibl>, tells the
						story of the tyrant Dionysius, who promised the musician a talent &lpar;there seems
						no particular point in the sliding scale of payment which Aristotle's version
						introduces&rpar; , but next day told him that he had already been sufficiently paid
						by the pleasure of anticipation.</note> This would have been all right if both had
					wanted pleasure; but when one wants amusement and the other gain, and one gets what he
					wants <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and the other does not, it would not be a
					fair bargain; for it is the thing that a man happens to need that he sets his heart on,
					and only to get that is he ready to give what he does. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Which party's business is it to decide the amount of the return due? Should it be
					assessed by the one who proffers the initial service? Or rather by the one who
					receives<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lit. &lsquo;the one who receives
						first,&rsquo; and now has to give a service in return.</note> it, since the other by
					proffering it seems to leave the matter to him? This we are told was the practice of
					Protagoras<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 328b">Plat. Prot.
						328b</bibl>.</note>; when he gave lessons in any subject, he used to tell his pupil to
					estimate the value he set upon his knowledge, and accepted a fee of that amount.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/>In such matters
					however some people prefer the principle of &lsquo;the wage stated.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hes. WD 370">Hes. WD 370</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">misqo\s d' a)ndri\ fi/lw| ei)rhme/nos a)/krios e)/stw</foreign>,
						&lsquo;let the wage stated to a friend stand good.&rsquo;</note> But people who
					take the money in advance, and then, having made extravagant professions, fail to perform
					what they undertook, naturally meet with complaints because they have not fulfilled their
					bargain. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Perhaps however
					the sophists are bound to demand their fees in advance, since nobody would pay money for
					the knowledge which they possess.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., after he has
						found out in the course of the lessons what the knowledge amounts to.</note> Persons
					paid in advance then naturally meet with complaints if they do not perform the service for
					which they have taken the pay. </p>
				<p>But in cases where no agreement is come to as to the value of the service, if it is
					proffered for the recipient's own sake, as has been said above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.13.2.</note> no complaint arises, for a friendship based on virtue
					does not give rise to quarrels; <milestone n="1164b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and the return made should be in proportion to the intention of the
					benefactor, since intention is the measure of a friend, and of virtue. This is the
					principle on which it would seem that payment ought to be made to those who have imparted
					instruction in philosophy; for the value of their service is not measurable in money, and
					no honor paid them could be an equivalent, but no doubt all that can be expected is that
					to them, as to the gods and to our parents, we should make such return as is in our Power.
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>When on the other hand the gift is not disinterested but made with a view to a
					recompense, it is no doubt the best thing that a return should be made such as both
					parties concur in thinking to be what is due. But failing such concurrence, it would seem
					to be not only inevitable but just that the amount of the return should be fixed by the
					party that received the initial service, since the donor will have recovered what the
					recipient really owes when he has been paid the value of the service to him, or the sum
					that he would have been willing to pay as the price of the pleasure. <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>For in buying and selling also this
					seems to be the practice<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The price is fixed by what the
						buyer is willing to pay.</note>; and in some countries the law does not allow actions
					for the enforcement of voluntary covenants,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.13.6.
						The phrase occurs in <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 556a">Plat. Rep. 556a</bibl>: cf. the
						&lsquo;voluntary private transactions&rsquo; of 5.2.13.</note> on the ground
					that when you have trusted a man you ought to conclude the transaction as you began it.
					For it is thought fairer for the price to be fixed by the person who received credit than
					by the one who gave credit.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence seems to come
						in better at the end of the chapter. The sentences immediately preceding and following
						have been plausibly rejected as interpolations.</note> For as a rule those who have a
					thing value it differently from those who want to get it. For one's own possessions and
					gifts always seem to one worth a great deal; but nevertheless the repayment is actually
					determined by the valuation <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> of the recipient. But
					he ought no doubt to estimate the gift not at what it seems to him to be worth now that he
					has received it, but at the value he put on it before he received it. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Other questions that may be raised are such as these: Does a man owe his father unlimited
					respect and obedience, or ought he when ill to take the advice of a physician, and when
					electing a general to vote for the best soldier? and similarly, ought he to do a service
					to a friend rather than to a virtuous man, and ought he to repay his obligation to a
					benefactor rather than make a present to a comrade, when he is not in a position to do
					both? <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now perhaps with all these matters it is not easy to lay down an exact rule, because the
					cases vary indefinitely in importance or unimportance, and in nobility or urgency.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But it is quite clear
					that no one person is entitled to unlimited consideration. As a general rule one ought to
					return services rendered rather than do favors to one's comrades, just as one ought to pay
					back a loan to a creditor rather than give the money to a friend. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Yet perhaps even this rule is not
					without exceptions. For example, &lpar;a&rpar; suppose one has been ransomed from
					brigands; ought one to ransom one's ransomer in turn, whoever he may be&mdash;or even
					if he has not been captured himself but asks for his money back, ought one to repay
					him&mdash; <milestone n="1165a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>or ought one to ransom one's own father? for it might be thought to
					be a man's duty to ransom his father even before himself. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>As a general rule then, as has been said, one ought
					to pay back a debt, but if the balance of nobility or urgency is on the side of employing
					the money for a gift, then one ought to decide in favor of the gift. For
					&lpar;b&rpar; there are occasions when it would be actually unfair to return the
					original service; as for instance when A has done B a service knowing him to be a good
					man, and B is called upon to return the service to A whom he believes to be a bad man. For
					even when A has lent B a loan, B is not always bound to lend A a loan in turn: A may have
					lent money to B, who is an honest man, expecting to get his money back, while B would have
					no hope of recovering from A, who is a rascal. If A is really a rascal, the return he asks
					for is not a fair one; and even if A is not a rascal, but people think<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be emended to &lsquo;but B thinks he
						is.&rsquo;</note> he is, it would not be deemed unreasonable for B to refuse.
					<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Hence, as has been frequently remarked already,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See.
					1.3.4, 2.2.3.</note> discussions about our emotions and actions only admit of such
					degree of definiteness as belongs to the matters with which they deal. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is quite clear therefore that all people have not the same claim upon us, and that
					even a father's claim is not unlimited, just as Zeus does not have all the sacrifices.
					Since the claims of parents and brothers, comrades and benefactors, are different, we
					ought to render to each that which is proper and suitable to each. This is in fact the
					principle on which men are observed to act. They invite their relatives to a wedding,
					because they are members of the family, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and
					therefore concerned in the family's affairs; also it is thought to be specially incumbent
					on relations to attend funerals, for the same reason. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="8" unit="section"/>It would be felt that our parents have the first
					claim on us for maintenance, since we owe it to them as a debt, and to support the authors
					of our being stands before self-preservation in moral nobility. Honor also is due to
					parents, as it is to the gods, though not indiscriminate honor: one does not owe to one's
					father the same honor as to one's mother, nor yet the honor due to a great philosopher or
					general, but one owes to one's father the honor appropriate to a father, and to one's
					mother that appropriate to her. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Again, we should pay to all our seniors the honor due to their age, by
					rising when they enter, offering them a seat, and so on. Towards comrades and brothers on
					the other hand we should use frankness of speech, and share all our possessions with them.
					Kinsmen also, fellow-tribesmen, fellow-citizens, and the rest&mdash;to all we must
					always endeavor to render their due, comparing their several claims in respect of
					relationship and of virtue or utility. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Between persons of the same kind discrimination is comparatively easy;
					but it is a harder matter when they are differently related to us. Nevertheless we must
					not shirk the task on that account, but must decide their claims as well as we are able.
					<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Another question is, whether a friendship should <milestone n="1165b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>or should not be broken off when the friends do
					not remain the same. It may be said that where the motive of the friendship is utility or
					pleasure, it is not unnatural that it should be broken off when our friends no longer
					possess the attribute of being useful or agreeable. It was those attributes that we loved,
					and when they have failed it is reasonable that love should cease. But a man might well
					complain, if, though we really liked him for the profit or pleasure he afforded, we had
					pretended to love him for his character. As was said at the outset,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.13.5.</note> differences between friends most frequently arise when
					the nature of their friendship is not what they think it is. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When therefore a man has made a
					mistake, and has fancied that he was loved for his character, without there having been
					anything in his friend's behavior to warrant the assumption, he has only himself to blame.
					But when he has been deceived by his friend's pretence, there is ground for complaint
					against the deceiver: in fact he is a worse malefactor than those who counterfeit the
					coinage,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the penalty for coining was death.</note> inasmuch as his offence
					touches something more precious than money. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, supposing we have admitted a person to our friendship as a good man, and he
					becomes, or we think he has become, a bad man: are we still bound to love him? Perhaps it
					is impossible to do so, since only what is good is lovable; and also wrong, for we ought
					not to be lovers of evil, nor let ourselves become like what is worthless; and, as has
					been said above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.1.6.</note> like is the friend
					of like. Should we therefore break off the friendship at once? Perhaps not in every case,
					but only when our friends have become incurably bad; for so long as they are capable of
					reform we are even more bound to help them morally than <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> we should be to assist them financially, since character is a more
					valuable thing than wealth and has more to do with friendship. However, one could not be
					held to be doing anything unnatural if one broke off the friendship; for it was not a man
					of that sort that one loved: he has altered, and if one cannot restore him, one gives him
					up. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>On the other hand, suppose one friend to have remained the same while the other has
					improved, and become greatly the superior in virtue: ought the latter to keep up the
					friendship? Perhaps it is out of the question; and this becomes especially clear when the
					gap between them is a wide one, as may happen with two people who were friends in boyhood.
					One may have remained a boy in mind, while the other is a man of the highest ability; how
					can they be friends, when they have different tastes and different likes and dislikes?
					They will no longer even enjoy each other's society; but without this, intercourse and
					therefore friendship are, as we saw,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.5.3.</note>
					impossible. But this has been discussed already. <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Are we then to behave towards a former friend in exactly the same way as if he had never
					been our friend at all? Perhaps we ought to remember our past intimacy, and just as we
					think it right to show more kindness to friends than to strangers, so likewise some
					attention should be paid, for the sake of old times, to those who were our friends in the
					past, that is, if the rupture was not caused by extreme wickedness on their part.
					<milestone n="1166a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>The forms which friendly feeling
					for our neighbors takes, and the marks by which the different forms of friendship are
					defined, seem to be derived from the feelings of regard which we entertain for ourselves.
					A friend is defined as &lpar;a&rpar; one who wishes, and promotes by action, the
					real or apparent good of another for that other's sake; or &lpar;b&rpar; one who
					wishes the existence and preservation of his friend for the friend's sake. &lpar;This
					is the feeling of mothers towards their children, and of former friends who have
					quarrelled.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., have had a difference which keeps
						them from meeting, but still leaves them well disposed to each other.</note>&rpar;
					Others say that a friend is &lpar;c&rpar; one who frequents another's society, and
					&lpar;d&rpar; who desires the same things as he does, or &lpar;e&rpar; one
					who shares his friend's joys and sorrows. &lpar;This too is very characteristic of
					mothers.&rpar; Friendship also is defined by one or other of these marks.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These five notes of friendship are taken seriatim in
						sects. 2-5, and again in sects. 8, 9, but in both cases the fourth is dealt with first.</note>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But each of them is also found in a good man's feelings
					towards himself &lpar;and in those of all other men as well, in so far as they believe
					themselves to be good; but, as has been said, virtue and the virtuous man seem to be the
					standard in everything&rpar;. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>For
					&lpar;d&rpar; the good man is of one mind with himself, and desires the same
					things with every part of his nature. Also &lpar;a&rpar; he wishes his own good,
					real as well as apparent, and seeks it by action &lpar;for it is a mark of a good man
					to exert himself actively for the good&rpar; ; and he does so for his own sake
					&lpar;for he does it on account of the intellectual part of himself, and this appears
					to be a man's real self&rpar;. Also &lpar;b&rpar; he desires his own life and
					security, and especially that of his rational part. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For
					existence is good for the virtuous man; and everyone <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> wishes his own good: no one would choose to possess every good in the world on
					condition of becoming somebody else &lpar;for God possesses the good even as it
					is&rpar;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The parenthesis seems to mean that as
						no one gains by God's now having the good, he would not gain if a new person which was
						no longer himself were to possess it &lpar;
						Ross&rpar;. But &lsquo;and every one . . . whatever he may
						be&rsquo; should perhaps be rejected as interpolated.</note> but only while
					remaining himself, whatever he may be; and it would appear that the thinking part is the
					real self, or is so more than anything else. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And
					&lpar;c&rpar; the good man desires his own company; for he enjoys being by
					himself, since he has agreeable memories of the past, and good hopes for the future, which
					are pleasant too; also his mind is stored with subjects for contemplation. And
					&lpar;e&rpar; he is keenly conscious of his own joys and sorrows; for the same
					things give him pleasure or pain at all times, and not different things at different
					times, since he is not apt to change his mind. </p>
				<p>It is therefore because the good man has these various feelings towards himself, and
					because he feels towards his friend in the same way as towards himself &lpar;for a
					friend is another self&rpar; , that friendship also is thought to consist in one or
					other of these feelings, and the possession of them is thought to be the test of a friend.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Whether a man can be said actually to feel friendship for himself is a question that may
					be dismissed for the present; though it may be held that he can do so in so far<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;in so far as two or more of the
						characteristics specified are present,&rsquo; which hardly gives a sense. The words
						&lsquo;though it may be held . . . self-regard,&rsquo; have been suspected as an
						interpolation.</note> as he is a dual or composite being, <milestone n="1166b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and because very intense
					friendship resembles self regard. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As a matter of fact, the feelings of self-regard described appear to be found in most
					people, even though they are of inferior moral worth. Perhaps men share them in so far as
					they have their own approval and believe in their own virtue; since the utterly worthless
					and criminal never possess them, or even have the appearance of doing so. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Indeed it may almost be said that no morally inferior persons possess
					them. For &lpar;d&rpar; such persons are at variance with themselves, desiring one
					thing and wishing another: this is the mark of the unrestrained, who choose what is
					pleasant but harmful instead of what they themselves think to be good.
					&lpar;a&rpar; Others again, out of cowardice and idleness, neglect to do what they
					think best for their own interests. And &lpar;b&rpar; men who have committed a
					number of crimes, and are hated for their wickedness, actually flee from life and make
					away with themselves. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Also &lpar;c&rpar; bad men
					constantly seek the society of others and shun their own company, because when they are by
					themselves they recall much that was unpleasant in the past and anticipate the same in the
					future, whereas with other people they can forget. Moreover they feel no affection for
					themselves, because they have no lovable qualities. Hence &lpar;e&rpar; such men
					do not enter into their own joys and sorrows, as there is civil war in their souls;
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> one part of their nature, owing to depravity, is
					pained by abstinence from certain indulgences while another part is pleased by it; one
					part pulls them one way and another the other, as if dragging them asunder. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Or if it be impossible to feel pain and pleasure at the same
					time, at all events after indulging in pleasure they regret it a little later, and wish
					they had never acquired a taste for such indulgences; since the bad are always changing
					their minds. </p>
				<p>Thus a bad man appears to be devoid even of affection for himself, because he has nothing
					lovable in his nature. If then such a state of mind is utterly miserable, we should do our
					utmost to shun wickedness and try to be virtuous. That is the way both to be friends with
					ourselves and to win the friendship of others. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Goodwill appears to be an element of friendly feeling, but it is not the same thing as
					friendship; for it can be felt towards strangers, and it can be unknown to its object,
					whereas friendship cannot. But that has been discussed already.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 8.2.3.</note>
				</p>
				<p>Neither is goodwill the same as affection. For it has no intensity, nor does it include
					desire, but these things are necessarily involved in affection. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Also affection requires intimate acquaintance, where as goodwill may
					spring up all of a sudden, as happens for instance in regard to the competitors in a
					contest; <milestone n="1167a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>the
					spectators conceive goodwill and sympathy for them, though they would not actively assist
					them, for as we said, their goodwill is a sudden growth, and the kindly feeling is only
					superficial. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Goodwill seems therefore to be the beginning of friendship, just as the pleasure of the
					eye is the beginning of love. No one falls in love without first being charmed by beauty,
					but one may delight in another's beauty without necessarily being in love: one is in love
					only if one longs for the beloved when absent, and eagerly desires his presence. Similarly
					men cannot be friends without having conceived mutual goodwill, though well-wishers are
					not necessarily friends: they merely desire the good of those whose well-wishers they are,
					and would not actively assist them to attain it, nor be put to any trouble on their
					behalf. Hence extending the meaning of the term friendship we may say that goodwill is
					inoperative friendship, which when it continues and reaches the point of intimacy may
					become friendship proper&mdash;not the sort of friendship whose motive is utility or
					pleasure, for these do not arouse goodwill. Goodwill is indeed rendered in return for
					favors received, but this is merely the payment of a due; and that desire for an other's
					welfare which springs from the anticipation of favors to come does not seem really to show
					goodwill for one's benefactor, but rather for oneself; just as to court a man for some
					interested motive is not friendship. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Speaking generally,
					true goodwill is aroused by some kind of excellence or moral goodness: it springs up when
					one person thinks another <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> beautiful or brave or the
					like, as in the case we mentioned of competitors in a contest. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Concord also seems to be a friendly feeling. Hence it is not merely agreement of opinion,
					for this might exist even between strangers. Nor yet is agreement in reasoned judgements
					about any subject whatever, for instance astronomy, termed concord; to agree about the
					facts of astronomy is not a bond of friendship. Concord is said to prevail in a state,
					when the citizens agree as to their interests, adopt the same policy, and carry their
					common resolves into execution. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Concord then refers to
					practical ends, and practical ends of importance, and able to be realized by both or all
					the parties: for instance, there is concord in the state when the citizens unanimously
					decree that the offices of state shall be elective, or that an alliance shall be made with
					<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, or that Pittacus shall be dictator
					&lpar;when Pittacus was himself willing to be dictator<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Pittacus was elected dictator of <placeName key="perseus,Mitylene">Mitylene</placeName> early in the sixth century B.C.; he ruled for fourteen years, and
						then laid down his office. All the citizens wished him to continue, but this was not
						strictly unanimity or Concord, since there was one dissentient, Pittacus
						himself.</note>&rpar;. When each of two persons wishes himself to rule, like the
					rivals<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Eteocles and Polyneices.</note> in the
					<title>Phoenissae</title>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 558">Eur. Phoen. 558 ff.</bibl>
					</note> there is discord; since men are not of one mind merely when each thinks the same
					thing &lpar;whatever this may be&rpar; , but when each thinks the same thing in
					relation to the same person: for instance, when both the common people <milestone n="1167b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and the upper classes
					wish that the best people shall rule; for only so can all parties get what they desire.</p>
				<p>Concord appears therefore to mean friendship between citizens, which indeed is the
					ordinary use of the term; for it refers to the interests and concerns of life. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now concord in this sense exists between good men, since these are of one mind both with
					themselves and with one another, as they always stand more or less on the same ground; for
					good men's wishes are steadfast, and do not ebb and flow like the tide, and they wish for
					just and expedient ends, which they strive to attain in common. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The base on the other hand are incapable of concord, except in some
					small degree, as they are of friendship, since they try to get more than their share of
					advantages, and take less than their share of labors and public burdens. And while each
					desires this for himself, he spies on his neighbor to prevent him from doing likewise; for
					unless they keep watch over one another, the common interests go to ruin. The result is
					discord, everybody trying to make others do their duty but refusing to do it themselves.
					<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Benefactors seem to love those whom they benefit more than those who have received
					benefits love those who have conferred them; and it is asked why this is so, as it seems
					to be unreasonable. The view most generally taken is <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> that it is because the one party is in the position of a debtor and the other of a
					creditor; just as therefore in the case of a loan, whereas the borrower would be glad to
					have his creditor out of the way, the lender actually watches over his debtor's safety, so
					it is thought that the conferrer of a benefit wishes the recipient to live in order that
					he may receive a return, but the recipient is not particularly anxious to make a return.
					Epicharmus no doubt would say that people who give this explanation are &lsquo;looking
					at the seamy side&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This half-line of verse
						&lpar;Epicharmus doubtless wrote <foreign lang="greek">qame/nous</foreign>&rpar;
						is otherwise unknown.</note> of life; but all the same it appears to be not untrue to
					human nature, for most men have short memories, and are more desirous of receiving
					benefits than of bestowing them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it might be held that the real reason lies deeper,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.3.9.</note> and that the case of the creditor is not really a parallel. With him
					it is not a matter of affection, but only of wishing his debtor's preservation for the
					sake of recovering his money; whereas a benefactor feels friendship and affection for the
					recipient of his bounty even though he is not getting anything out of him and is never
					likely to do so. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The same thing happens with the artist: every artist loves his own handiwork more than
					that handiwork if it were to come to life would love him. <milestone n="1168a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>This is perhaps especially true
					of poets, who have an exaggerated affection for their own poems and love them as parents
					love their children. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The position of the benefactor then
					resembles that of the artist; the recipient of his bounty is his handiwork, and he
					therefore loves him more than his handiwork loves its maker. The reason of this is that
					all things desire and love existence; but we exist in activity, since we exist by living
					and doing; and in a sense<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In a sense he exists
						&lsquo;actually&rsquo; as long as his work lasts, though strictly speaking he
						exists as an actual maker only while the act of making is going on. A possible variant
						rendering is &lsquo;and in a sense the work is its maker
						actualized.&rsquo;</note> one who has made something exists actively, and so he loves
					his handiwork because he loves existence. This is in fact a fundamental principle of
					nature: what a thing is potentially, that its work reveals in actuality. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Moreover for the benefactor there is an element of nobility in the act, and so he feels
					pleased with the person who is its object; but there is nothing noble for the recipient of
					the benefit in his relation to his benefactor: at most, it is profitable; and what is
					profitable is not so pleasant or lovable as what is noble. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The doer's achievement therefore remains, for nobility or beauty is long-lived, but its
					utility to the recipient passes away.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence in
						the MSS. follows the next.</note> But while the actuality of the present, the hope of
					the future, and the memory of the past are all pleasant, actuality is the most pleasant of
					the three, and the most loved. Also whereas the memory of noble things is pleasant, that
					of useful ones is hardly at all so, or at least less so; although with anticipation the
					reverse seems to be the case.</p>
				<p>Again, loving seems to be an active experience, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					being loved a passive one; hence affection and the various forms of friendly feeling are
					naturally found in the more active party to the relationship. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, everybody loves a thing more if it has cost him trouble: for instance those who
					have made money love money more than those who have inherited it. Now to receive a benefit
					seems to involve no labor, but to confer one is an effort. &lpar;This is why mothers
					love their children more than fathers, because parenthood costs the mother more trouble
					&lsqb;and the mother is more certain that the child is her own&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems an irrelevant insertion from 8.12.2
						f.</note>&rpar; This also then would seem to be a characteristic of benefactors.
					<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The question is also raised whether one ought to love oneself or someone else most. We
					censure those who put themselves first, and &lsquo;lover of self&rsquo; is used as
					a term of reproach. And it is thought that a bad man considers himself in all he does, and
					the more so the worse he is&mdash;so it is a complaint against him for instance that
					&lsquo;he never does a thing unless you make him&rsquo; &mdash;whereas a good
					man acts from a sense of what is noble, and the better he is the more he so acts, and he
					considers his friend's interest, disregarding his own. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the facts do not accord with these theories; nor is this surprising. <milestone n="1168b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>For we admit that one
					should love one's best friend most; but the best friend is he that, when he wishes a
					person's good, wishes it for that person's own sake, even though nobody will ever know of
					it. Now this condition is most fully realized in a man's regard for himself, as indeed are
					all the other attributes that make up the definition of a friend; for it has been said
					already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See chap. 4.</note> that all the feelings
					that constitute friendship for others are an extension of regard for self. Moreover, all
					the proverbs agree with this; for example, &lsquo;Friends have one soul between
					them,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1046">Eur.
						Orest. 1046</bibl>.</note> &lsquo;Friends' goods are common property,&rsquo;
					&lsquo;Amity is equality,&rsquo; &lsquo;The knee is nearer than the
					shin.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"> &lsquo;Charity begins at
						home&rsquo; &lpar;
						Ross&rpar;.</note> All of these sayings will apply most fully to oneself;
					for a man is his own best friend. Therefore he ought to love himself most.</p>
				<p>So it is naturally debated which of these two views we ought to adopt, since each of them
					has some plausibility. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now where there is a conflict of opinion the proper course is doubtless to get the two
					views clearly distinguished, and to define how far and in what way each of them is true.
					So probably the matter may become clear if we ascertain what meaning each side attaches to
					the term &lsquo;self-love.&rsquo; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Those then who make it a term of reproach call men lovers of self when they assign to
					themselves the larger share of money, honors, or bodily pleasures; since these are the
					things which most men desire and set their hearts on as being the greatest goods, and
					which accordingly they compete with each other to obtain. Now those who take more than
					their share of these things are men who indulge <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					their appetites, and generally their passions and the irrational part of their souls. But
					most men are of this kind. Accordingly the use of the term &lsquo;lover of
					self&rsquo; as a reproach has arisen from the fact that self-love of the ordinary kind
					is bad. Hence self-love is rightly censured in those who are lovers of self in this sense.
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And that it is those who take too large a share of
					things of this sort whom most people usually mean when they speak of lovers of self, is
					clear enough. For if a man were always bent on outdoing everybody else in acting justly or
					temperately or in displaying any other of the virtues, and in general were always trying
					to secure for himself moral nobility, no one will charge him with love of self nor find
					any fault with him. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Yet as a matter of fact such a man
					might be held to be a lover of self in an exceptional degree. At all events he takes for
					himself the things that are noblest and most truly good. Also it is the most dominant part
					of himself that he indulges and obeys in everything. But &lpar;a&rpar; as in the
					state it is the sovereign that is held in the fullest sense to be the state, and in any
					other composite whole it is the dominant part that is deemed especially to be that whole,
					so it is with man. He therefore who loves and indulges the dominant part of himself is a
					lover of self in the fullest degree. Again &lpar;b&rpar; , the terms
					&lsquo;self-restrained&rsquo; and &lsquo;unrestrained&rsquo; denote being
					restrained or not by one's intellect, and thus imply that the intellect is the man
					himself. <milestone n="1169a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Also &lpar;c&rpar; it is our reasoned acts that are felt to be in the fullest
					sense our own acts, voluntary acts. It is therefore clear that a man is or is chiefly the
					dominant part of himself, and that a good man values this part of himself most. Hence the
					good man will be a lover of self in the fullest degree, though in another sense than the
					lover of self so-called by way of reproach, from whom he differs as much as living by
					principle differs from living by passion, and aiming at what is noble from aiming at what
					seems expedient. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Persons therefore who are exceptionally
					zealous in noble actions are universally approved and commended; and if all men vied with
					each other in moral nobility and strove to perform the noblest deeds, the common welfare
					would be fully realized, while individuals also could enjoy the greatest of goods,
					inasmuch as virtue is the greatest good.</p>
				<p>Therefore the good man ought to be a lover of self, since he will then both benefit
					himself by acting nobly and aid his fellows; but the bad man ought not to be a lover of
					self, since he will follow his base passions, and so injure both himself and his
					neighbors. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>With the bad man therefore, what he does is
					not in accord with what he ought to do, but the good man does what he ought, since
					intelligence always chooses for itself that which is best, and the good man obeys his
					intelligence. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it is also true that the virtuous man's conduct is often guided by the interests of
					his friends and of his country, and that he will if necessary <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> lay down his life in their behalf. For he will surrender wealth and
					power and all the goods that men struggle to win, if he can secure nobility for himself;
					since he would prefer an hour of rapture to a long period of mild enjoyment, a year of
					noble life to many years of ordinary existence, one great and glorious exploit to many
					small successes. And this is doubtless the case with those who give their lives for
					others; thus they choose great nobility for themselves. Also the virtuous man is ready to
					forgo money if by that means his friends may gain more money; for thus, though his friend
					gets money, he himself achieves nobility, and so he assigns the greater good to his own
					share. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>And he behaves in the same manner as regards
					honors and offices also: all these things he will relinquish to his friend, for this is
					noble and praiseworthy for himself. He is naturally therefore thought to be virtuous, as
					he chooses moral nobility in preference to all other things. It may even happen that he
					will surrender to his friend the performance of some achievement, and that it may be
					nobler for him to be the cause of his friend's performing it than to perform it himself.
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Therefore in all spheres of praiseworthy conduct it is manifest that the good man takes
					the larger share of moral nobility for himself. <milestone n="1169b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>In this sense then, as we said above, it is right
					to be a lover of self, though self-love of the ordinary sort is wrong. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Another debated question is whether friends are necessary or not for happiness. People
					say that the supremely happy are self-sufficing, and so have no need of friends: for they
					have the good things of life already, and therefore, being complete in themselves, require
					nothing further; whereas the function of a friend, who is a second self, is to supply
					things we cannot procure for ourselves. Hence the saying<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 665">Eur. Orest. 665</bibl>.</note>
					<quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>When fortune favors us, what need of friends?</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But it seems strange that if we attribute all good things to the happy man we should not
					assign him friends, which we consider the greatest of external goods. Also if it be more
					the mark of a friend to give than to receive benefits, and if beneficence is a function of
					the good man and of virtue, and it is is nobler to benefit friends than strangers, the
					good man will need friends as the objects of his beneficence.Hence the further question is
					asked: Are friends more needed in prosperity or in adversity? It is argued that the
					unfortunate need people to be kind to them, but also that the prosperous need people to
					whom they may be kind. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also perhaps it would be strange to represent the supremely happy man as a recluse.
					Nobody would choose to have all possible good things on the condition that he must enjoy
					them alone; for man is a social being,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.7.6,
						note.</note> and designed by nature to live with others; accordingly the happy man must
					have society, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> for he has everything that is
					naturally good. And it is obviously preferable to associate with friends and with good men
					than with strangers and chance companions. Therefore the happy man requires friends.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>What then do the upholders of the former view mean, and in what sense is it true? Perhaps
					the explanation of it is that most men think of friends as being people who are useful to
					us. Now it is true that the supremely happy man will have no need of friends of that kind,
					inasmuch as he is supplied with good things already. Nor yet will he want friends of the
					pleasant sort, or only to a very small extent, for his life is intrinsically pleasant and
					has no need of adventitious pleasure. And as he does not need useful or pleasant friends,
					it is assumed that he does not require friends at all. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But perhaps this inference is really untrue. For as we said at the beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.7.15. The argument for friendship from the definition of
					happiness as virtuous and therefore pleasant activity is threefold: &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">a</foreign>&rpar; the virtuous actions of our friends give us
					&lpar;by sympathy&rpar; the same pleasure as our own; &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">b</foreign>&rpar; good activities &lpar;e.g. study&rpar; can
					be carried on longer &lpar;because less liable to fatigue&rpar; ; &lpar;
					<foreign lang="greek">g</foreign>&rpar; virtuous friends increase our own virtue
					&lpar;as we unconsciously imitate their acts&rpar;. Hence friends useful and
					pleasant because virtuous &lpar;though not useful or pleasant friends in the
					ordinary sense&rpar; are necessary adjuncts of happiness.</note> happiness is a form
					of activity, and an activity clearly is something that comes into being, not a thing that
					we possess all the time, like a piece of property. But if happiness consists in life and
					activity, and the activity of a good man, as was said at the beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.8.13.</note> is good and so pleasant in itself, and if
					the sense that a thing is our own is also pleasant, yet we are better able to contemplate
					our neighbors than ourselves, and their actions than our own, and thus good men find
					pleasure in the actions of other good men who are their friends, <milestone n="1170a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since those actions possess
					both these essentially pleasant qualities,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., they
						are good, and they are their own, i.e. like their own.</note> it therefore follows that
					the supremely happy man will require good friends, insomuch as he desires to contemplate
					actions that are good and that are his own, and the actions of a good man that is his
					friend are such. Also men think that the life of the happy man ought to be pleasant. Now a
					solitary man has a hard life, for it is not easy to keep up continuous activity by
					oneself; it is easier to do so with the aid of and in relation to other people. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The good man's activity therefore, which is pleasant in itself,
					will be more continuous if practised with friends<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						last four words are implied by the context.</note>; and the life of the supremely happy
					should be continuously pleasant<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This parenthesis comes
						better in 9.5 above, after the words, &lsquo;the activity of a good man . . . is
						good and pleasant in itself.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;for a good man, in virtue of
					his goodness, enjoys actions that conform with virtue and dislikes those that spring from
					wickedness, just as a skilled musician is pleased by good music and pained by
					bad&rpar;. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Moreover the society of the good may
					supply a sort of training in goodness, as Theognis<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Theognis 35 <foreign lang="greek">e)sqlw=n me\n ga\r a)/p' e)sqla\
						maqh/seai</foreign>.</note> remarks. </p>
				<p>Again, if we examine the matter more fundamentally, it appears that a virtuous friend is
					essentially desirable for a virtuous man. For as has been said above, that which is
					essentially good is good and pleasing in itself to the virtuous man. And life is defined,
					in the case of animals, by the capacity for sensation; in the case of man, by the capacity
					for sensation and thought. But a capacity is referred to its activity, and in this its
					full reality consists. It appears therefore that life in the full sense is sensation or
					thought.But life is a thing <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> good and pleasant in
					itself, for it is definite, and definiteness is a part of the essence of goodness, and
					what is essentially good is good for the good man, and hence appears to be pleasant to all
					men. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>We must not argue from a vicious and corrupt life,
					or one that is painful, for such a life is indefinite, like its attributes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., vice and pain.</note> &lpar;The point as to pain
					will be clearer in the sequel.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Bk.
						10.1-5.</note>&rpar; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But if life itself is good and
					pleasant &lpar;as it appears to be, because all men desire it, and virtuous and
					supremely happy men most of all, since their way of life is most desirable and their
					existence the most blissful&rpar; ; and if one who sees is conscious<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">ai)sqa/nesqai</foreign> is used
						throughout to denote &lsquo;consciousness&rsquo; &lpar;as well as, where
						needed, &lsquo;sensation&rpar;. At 1170b 11 <foreign lang="greek">sunaisqa/nesqai</foreign> expresses sympathetic consciousness of another's thoughts
						and feelings; it is probable therefore that in l.4 the compound verb is a copyist's
						mistake.</note> that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks,
					and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of
					their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and
					whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are
					perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist &lpar;for existence, as we
					saw, is sense-perception or thought&rpar;; <milestone n="1170b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>and if to be conscious one is alive is a pleasant
					thing in itself &lpar;for life is a thing essentially good, and to be conscious that
					one possesses a good thing is pleasant&rpar; ; and if life is desirable, and
					especially so for good men, because existence is good for them, and so pleasant
					&lpar;because they are pleased by the perception of what is intrinsically
					good&rpar; ; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>and if the virtuous man feels towards
					his friend in the same way as he feels towards himself &lpar;for his friend is a
					second self&rpar; &mdash;then, just as a man's own existence is desirable for him,
					so, or nearly so, is his friend's existence also desirable. But, as we saw, it is the
					consciousness of oneself as good<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps to be emended
						&lsquo;of its goodness,&rsquo; cf. l. 5 of the Greek. It is consciousness of
						life as good that makes it pleasant and desirable.</note> that makes existence
					desirable, and such consciousness is pleasant in itself. Therefore a man ought also to
					share his friend's consciousness of his existence, and this is attained by their living
					together and by conversing and communicating their thoughts to each other; for this is the
					meaning of living together as applied to human beings, it does not mean merely feeding in
					the same place, as it does when applied to cattle. </p>
				<p>If then to the supremely happy man existence is desirable in itself, being good and
					pleasant essentially, and if his friend's existence is almost equally desirable to him, it
					follows that a friend is one of the things to be desired. But that which is desirable for
					him he is bound to have, or else his condition will be incomplete in that particular.
					Therefore to be happy a man needs virtuous friends. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Ought we then to make as many friends as possible? or, just as it seems a wise saying
					about hospitality&mdash; <quote>
						<lg type="iambic">
							<l>Neither with troops of guests nor yet with none</l>
						</lg>
					</quote><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hes. WD 715">Hes. WD 715</bibl>
					</note>&mdash; so also with friendship perhaps it will be fitting neither to be
					without friends nor yet to make friends in excessive numbers. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This rule would certainly seem applicable to those friends whom we
					choose for their utility<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">But cf. 8.6.3.</note>; for it
					is troublesome to have to repay the services of a large number of people, and life is not
					long enough for one to do it. Any more therefore than are sufficient for the requirements
					of one's own life will be superfluous, and a hindrance to noble living, so one is better
					without them. Of friends for pleasure also a few are enough, just as a small amount of
					sweets is enough in one's diet. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But should one have as
					many good friends as possible? or is there a limit of size for a circle of friends, as
					there is for the population of a state? Ten people would not make a city, and with a
					hundred thousand it is a city no longer; though perhaps the proper size is not one
					particular number, but any number between certain limits. <milestone n="1171a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>So also the number of one's
					friends must be limited, and should perhaps be the largest number with whom one can
					constantly associate; since, as we saw,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						8.5.1.</note> to live together is the chief mark of friendship, <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>but it is quite clear that it is not possible to live with and to share
					oneself among a large number of people. Another essential is that one's friends must also
					be the friends of one another, if they are all to pass the time in each other's company;
					but for a large number of people all to be friends is a difficult matter. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Again, it is difficult to share intimately in the joys and sorrows of
					many people; for one may very likely be called upon to rejoice with one and to mourn with
					another at the same time. </p>
				<p>Perhaps therefore it is a good rule not to seek to have as many friends as possible, but
					only as many as are enough to form a circle of associates. Indeed it would appear to be
					impossible to be very friendly with many people, for the same reason as it is impossible
					to be in love with several people. Love means friendship in the superlative degree, and
					that must be with one person only; so also warm friendship is only possible with a few.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This conclusion seems to be supported by experience. Friendships between comrades<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See note on 8.5.3.</note> only include a few people, and
					the famous examples of poetry<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Such as Achilles and
						Patroclus, Orestes and Pylades, Theseus and Pirithous. It is not quite clear whether
						they are quoted as examples of comradeship or friendship in general.</note> are pairs of
					friends. Persons of many friendships, who are hail-fellow-well-met with everybody, are
					thought to be real friends of nobody &lpar;otherwise than as fellow-citizens are
					friends&rpar; : I mean the sort of people we call obsequious. It is true that one may
					be friendly with many fellow-citizens and not be obsequious, but a model of excellence;
					but it is not possible to have many friends whom we love for their virtue and for
					themselves. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> We may be glad to find even a few
					friends of this sort. <milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But do we need friends more in prosperity or in adversity? As a matter of fact men seek
					friends in both. The unfortunate require assistance; the prosperous want companions, and
					recipients of their bounty, since they wish to practise beneficence. Hence friendship is
					more necessary in adversity, so then it is useful friends that are wanted; but it is
					nobler in prosperity, so the prosperous seek also for good men as friends, since these are
					preferable both as objects of beneficence and as associates. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Also<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This gives a further reason for the second
					sentence of the chapter, and adds the motive of pleasure to those of utility and
					virtue.</note> the mere presence of friends is pleasant both in prosperity and adversity.
					Sorrow is lightened by the sympathy of friends. Hence the question may be raised whether
					friends actually share the burden of grief, or whether, without this being the case, the
					pain is nevertheless diminished by the pleasure of their company and by the consciousness
					of their sympathy. Whether one of these reasons or some other gives the true explanation
					of the consoling power of friendship need not now be considered, but in any case it
					appears to have the effect described. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Yet the pleasure that the company of friends affords seems to be of a mixed nature. It is
					true that the very sight of them is pleasant, <milestone n="1171b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>especially in time of misfortune, and is a
					considerable help in assuaging sorrow; for a friend, if tactful, can comfort us with look
					and word, as he knows our characters and what things give us pleasure and pain. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But on the other hand to see another pained by our own misfortunes
					is painful, as everyone is reluctant to be a cause of pain to his friends. Hence manly
					natures shrink from making their friends share their pain, and unless a man is excessively
					insensitive, he cannot bear the pain that his pain gives to them; and he will not suffer
					others to lament with him, because he is not given to lamentation himself. But weak women
					and womanish men like those who mourn with them, and love them as true friends and
					sympathizers. However, it is clear that in everything we ought to copy the example of the
					man of nobler nature. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>In prosperity again the company of friends sweetens our hours of leisure, and also
					affords the pleasure of being conscious of their pleasure in our welfare. </p>
				<p>Hence it may be thought that we ought to be eager to invite our friends to share our good
					fortune &lpar;since it is noble to wish to bestow benefits&rpar;, but reluctant to
					ask them to come to us in misfortune &lpar;since we should impart to others as little
					as possible of what is evil: whence the proverb &lsquo;My own misfortune is
					enough&rsquo;&rpar;. We should summon our friends to our aid chiefly when they
					will be of great service to us at the cost of little trouble to themselves. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>So, conversely, it is perhaps fitting that we should go uninvited and readily to those in
					misfortune &lpar;for it is the part of a friend to render service, and especially to
					those in need, and without being asked, since assistance so rendered is more noble and
					more pleasant for both parties&rpar;; but to the prosperous, though we should go
					readily to help them &lpar;for even prosperity needs the cooperation of
					friends&rpar;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 8.1.1 fin., 2 fin.</note> we
					should be slow in going when it is a question of enjoying their good things &lpar;for
					it is not noble to be eager to receive benefits&rpar;. But doubtless we should be
					careful to avoid seeming churlish in repulsing their advances, a thing that does sometimes
					occur. </p>
				<p>It appears therefore that the company of friends is desirable in all circumstances.
					<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As then lovers find their greatest delight in seeing those they love, and prefer the
					gratification of the sense of sight to that of all the other senses, that sense being the
					chief seat and source of love, so likewise for friends &lpar;may we not say?&rpar;
					the society of each other is the most desirable thing there is. For &lpar;i&rpar;
					friendship is essentially a partnership. And &lpar;ii&rpar; a man stands in the
					same relation to a friend as to himself<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See chap. 4 and
						9.5.</note>; but the consciousness of his own existence is a good; so also therefore is
					the consciousness of his friend's existence; but this<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly, &lsquo;and friendship is realized in intercourse,&rsquo; a
						separate reason for the thesis of the first sentence.</note> consciousness is actualized
					in intercourse; <milestone n="1172a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>hence friends naturally desire each other's society. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And &lpar;iii&rpar; whatever pursuit it is that
					constitutes existence for a man or that makes his life worth living, he desires to share
					that pursuit with his friends. Hence some friends drink or dice together, others practise
					athletic sports and hunt, or study philosophy, in each other's company; each sort spending
					their time together in the occupation that they love best of everything in life; for
					wishing to live in their friends&rsquo; society, they pursue and take part with them
					in these occupations as best they can.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text is
						doubtful; most MSS. give, &lsquo;by which they think they live in their
						society.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Thus the friendship of inferior people is evil, for they take part together in inferior
					pursuits &lsqb;being unstable,&rsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It seems
						best to excise these words as an inapposite reminiscence of 4.10.</note> and by becoming

					friendship into practice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For <foreign lang="greek">e)nergei=n</foreign> &lpar;sc. <foreign lang="greek">filikw=s</foreign>&rpar;

				</p>
				<p>So much for our treatment of Friendship. Our next business will be to discuss
					Pleasure.</p>
			</div1>
			<div1 type="Book" n="10">

				<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>Our next business after this is doubtless to discuss Pleasure. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> For pleasure is thought to be especially congenial to mankind; and
					this is why pleasure and pain are employed in the education of the young, as means whereby
					to steer their course. Moreover, to like and to dislike the right things is thought to be
					a most important element in the formation of a virtuous character. For pleasure and pain
					extend throughout the whole of life, and are of great moment and influence for virtue and
					happiness; since men choose what is pleasant and avoid what is painful. 
				</p>
				<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
				<p>It would therefore seem by no means proper to omit so important a subject, especially as
					there is much difference of opinion about it. Some people maintain that pleasure is the
					Good. Others on the contrary say that it is altogether bad: some of them perhaps from a
					conviction that it is really so, but others because they think it to be in the interests
					of morality to make out that pleasure is bad, even if it is not, since most men
					&lpar;they argue&rpar; have a bias towards it, and are the slaves of their
					pleasures, so that they have to be driven in the opposite direction in order to arrive at
					the due mean.</p>
				<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
				<p>Possibly however this view is mistaken. In matters of emotion and of action, words are
					less convincing than deeds; when therefore our theories are at variance with palpable
					facts, they provoke contempt, and involve the truth in their own discredit. <milestone n="1172b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>If one who censures
					pleasure is seen sometimes to desire it himself, his swerving towards it is thought to
					show that he really believes that all pleasure is desirable; for the mass of mankind
					cannot discriminate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Hence it appears that true theories are the most valuable for conduct as well as for
					science; harmonizing with the facts, they carry conviction, and so encourage those who
					understand them to guide their lives by them. </p>
				<p>With so much by way of introduction, let us now review the theories about pleasure that
					have been advanced.</p>
				<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>That pleasure is the Good was held by Eudoxus, on the following grounds. He saw that all
					creatures, rational and irrational alike, seek to obtain it; but in every case
					&lpar;he argued&rpar; that which is desirable is good, and that which is most
					desirable is the best; therefore the fact that all creatures &lsquo;move in the
					direction of&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As we should say,
						&lsquo;gravitate towards.&rsquo; Eudoxus, an unorthodox pupil of Plato, was a
						astronomer, and seems to have imported physical terminology into Ethics.</note> the same
					thing indicates that this thing is the Supreme Good for all &lpar;since everything
					finds its own particular good, just as it finds its own proper food&rpar;; but that
					which is good for all, and which all seek to obtain, is the Good. </p>
				<p>His arguments owed their acceptance however more to the excellence of his character than
					to their own merit. He had the reputation of being a man of exceptional temperance, and
					hence he was not suspected of upholding this view because he was a lover of pleasure, but
					people thought it must really be true.</p>
				<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
				<p>He also held that the goodness of pleasure was equally manifest from the converse: pain
					is intrinsically an object of avoidance to all, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					therefore its opposite must be intrinsically an object of desire to all. </p>
				<p>Again, he argued that that thing is most desirable which we choose not as a means to or
					for the sake of something else; but such admittedly is pleasure: we never ask a man for
					what purpose he indulges in pleasure&mdash;we assume it to be desirable in itself. </p>
				<p>He also said that the addition of pleasure to any good&mdash;for instance, just or
					temperate conduct&mdash;makes that good more desirable; but only the good can enhance
					the good.</p>
				<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
				<p>Now as for the last argument, it seems only to prove that pleasure is a good, and not
					that it is in any way better than any other good; for every good is more desirable when
					combined with some other good than in isolation. In fact, a similar argument is employed
					by Plato<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 60d">Plat. Phileb. 60d ff.</bibl>
					</note> to refute the view that pleasure is the Good: the life of pleasure, he urges, is
					more desirable in combination with intelligence than without it; but if pleasure combined
					with something else is better than pleasure alone, it is not the Good, for the Good is not
					rendered more desirable by the addition of anything to it. And it is clear that nothing
					else either will be the Good if it becomes more desirable when combined with something
					good in itself. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>What
					thing is there then of this nature,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz., incapable of
						being improved by the addition of something else. But the sentence looks like an
						interpolation.</note> which is attainable by us? for it is something of this nature that
					we are in search of. </p>
				<p>Those<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These are Speusippus and the Academics of
					Aristotle's day; see 7.11.3, note.</note> on the other hand who deny that that which all
					creatures seek to obtain is good, are surely talking nonsense. <milestone n="1173a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>For what all think to be good,
					that, we assert, is good; and he that subverts our belief in the opinion of all mankind,
					will hardly persuade us to believe his own either. If only the irrational creatures strove
					to obtain what is pleasant, there would have been some sense in this contention; but
					inasmuch as beings endowed with intelligence do so too, how can it be right? And perhaps
					even the lower animals possess an instinct superior to their own natures, which seeks to
					obtain the good appropriate to their kind.</p>
				<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
				<p>Again, these thinkers' refutation of the argument from the converse appears equally
					unsound. They pain say, if pain is bad, it does not follow therefore that pleasure is
					good: for an evil can also be opposed to an evil and to a thing that is neither good nor
					evil: a statement which is indeed sound enough, but which does not apply to the things in
					question. If both pleasure and pain were in the class of evils, both would be also of
					necessity things to be avoided, and if in the class of things neutral, neither ought to be
					avoided, or they ought to be avoided alike; but as it is we see men avoid pain as evil and
					choose pleasure as good; it is therefore as good and evil that they are opposed.
				</p>
				<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
				<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
				<p>Nor yet does it follow that if pleasure is not a quality, therefore it is not a good.
					Virtuous activities are not qualities either, nor is happiness. </p>
				<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
				<p>Again they argue<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 24e">Plat.
					Phileb. 24e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 31a">Plat. Phileb. 31a</bibl>.</note> that
					good is definite, but that pleasure is indefinite, because it admits of degrees. Now
					&lpar;a&rpar; if they base this judgement on the fact that one can be more or less
					pleased, the same argument will apply to Justice and the other virtues, the possessors of
					which are clearly spoken of as being more or less <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					virtuous; for example, A may be more just or brave, and may act more, or less, justly or
					temperately, than B. If on the other hand &lpar;b&rpar; they judge by the nature
					of the pleasures themselves, I am afraid they do not state the right ground for their
					conclusion, if it be true that there are two kinds of pleasures, unmixed as well as
					mixed.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., when they attribute
						&lsquo;indefiniteness&rsquo; to pleasure, they are really thinking of the
						&lsquo;mixed&rsquo; pleasures only; it does not apply to the
						&lsquo;pure&rsquo; pleasures, in which there is no admixture of pain; and the
						distinction between these two kinds of pleasure is Plato's own.</note>
				</p>
				<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
				<p>Again, &lpar;c&rpar; why should not pleasure be like health, which is definite
					although it admits of degrees? For health is not constituted by the same proportion of
					elements in all persons; nor yet by one particular proportion in the same person always,
					but when it is in process of dissolution it still lasts for a certain time, and therefore
					it varies in degree. It is possible therefore that the same may be the case with pleasure.
				</p>
				<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
				<p>Again, they postulate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 53c">Plat. Phileb. 53c-54d</bibl>.</note> that the Good is perfect, whereas a motion or
					process of generation is imperfect, and then they attempt to prove that pleasure is a
					motion or process. This appears to be a mistake. &lpar;a&rpar; It would seem that
					pleasure is not a motion; for we hold it to be a property of all motion to be quick or
					slow&mdash;if &lpar;as with the motion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						motion being uniform, it can only be spoken of as quick or slow in comparison with some
						other motion. not absolutely, i.e. in comparison with itself at some other time.</note>
					of the firmament&rpar; not absolutely, then relatively to some other moving body. But
					pleasure possesses neither absolute nor relative velocity. You can become pleased quickly,
					just as you can get angry quickly: <milestone n="1173b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>but you cannot be pleased quickly, nor yet more quickly than
					somebody else, as you can walk, grow, etc., more quickly than somebody else. It is
					possible to pass into a pleasurable state quickly or slowly, but not to function in that
					state&mdash;i.e. to feel pleasure&mdash;quickly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And &lpar;b&rpar; in what sense can pleasure
					be a process of generation? We do not think that any chance thing can be generated from
					any other chance thing, but that a thing at its dissolution is resolved into that from
					which it is generated; and if pleasure is the generation of something, pain is the
					destruction of that thing. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Also &lpar;c&rpar; they say<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 31e">Plat. Phileb. 31e-32b</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 42c">Plat. Phileb. 42c</bibl>.</note> that pain is a deficiency of
					the natural state and pleasure is its replenishment. But these are bodily experiences. Now
					if pleasure is a replenishment of the natural state, the pleasure will be felt by the
					thing in which the replenishment takes place. Therefore it is the body that feels
					pleasure. But this does not seem to be the case. Therefore pleasure is not a process of
					replenishment, though while replenishment takes place, a feeling of pleasure may accompany
					it, just as a feeling of pain may accompany a surgical operation.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., we do not say a cut is a pain, but it is accompanied by
						pain.</note> The belief that pleasure is a replenishment seems to have arisen from the
					pains and pleasures connected with food: here the pleasure does arise from a
					replenishment, and is preceded by the pain of a want. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But this is not the case with all pleasures: the
					pleasures of knowledge, for example, have no antecedent pain; nor have certain of the
					pleasures of sense, namely those whose medium is the sense of smell, as well as many
					sounds and sights; and also memories and hopes. If these are processes of generation,
					generation of what? <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> No lack of anything has
					occurred that may be replenished. </p>
				<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
				<p>In reply to those who bring forward the disreputable pleasures, one may
					&lpar;a&rpar; deny that these are really pleasant: for granted they are pleasant
					to ill-conditioned people, it cannot therefore be assumed that they are actually pleasant,
					except to them, any more than things healthy or sweet or bitter to invalids are really so,
					or any more than things that seem white to people with a disease of the eyes are really
					white. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Or
					&lpar;b&rpar; one may take the line that, though the pleasures themselves are
					desirable, they are not desirable when derived from those sources; just as wealth is
					desirable, but not if won by treachery, or health, but not at the cost of eating anything
					and everything. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Or
					&lpar;c&rpar; we may say that pleasures differ in specific quality; since
					&lpar;a&rpar; those derived from noble sources are not the same as those derived
					from base sources, and it is impossible to feel the pleasures of a just man without being
					just, or the pleasures of a musician without being musical, and so on. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>And also &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">b</foreign>&rpar; the distinction between a friend and a flatterer
					seems to show that pleasure is not a good, or else that pleasures are specifically
					different; since a friend is thought to aim at doing good to his companion, a flatterer at
					giving pleasure; to be a flatterer is a reproach, whereas a friend is praised because in
					his intercourse he aims at other things. <milestone n="1174a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="12" unit="section"/>And &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">a</foreign>&rpar; no one
					would choose to retain the mind of a child throughout his life, even though he continued
					to enjoy the pleasures of childhood with undiminished zest; nor &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">d</foreign>&rpar; would anyone choose to find enjoyment in doing some
					extremely shameful act, although it would entail no painful consequences. Also &lpar;
					<foreign lang="greek">e</foreign>&rpar; there are many things which we should be
					eager to possess even if they brought us no pleasure, for instance sight, memory,
					knowledge, virtue. It may be the case that these things are necessarily attended by
					pleasure, but that makes no difference; for we should desire them even if no pleasure
					resulted from them.</p>
				<milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
				<p>It seems therefore that pleasure is not the Good, and that not every pleasure is
					desirable, but also that there are certain pleasures, superior in respect of their
					specific quality or their source, that are desirable in themselves. </p>
				<p>Let this suffice for a discussion of the current views about pleasure and pain.
					<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We may ascertain the nature and quality of pleasure more clearly if we start again from
					the beginning. </p>
				<p>Now the act of sight appears to be perfect at any moment of its duration; it does not
					require anything to supervene later in order to perfect its specific quality. But pleasure
					also appears to be a thing of this nature. For it is a whole, and one cannot at any moment
					put one's hand on a pleasure which will only exhibit its specific quality perfectly if its
					duration be prolonged. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It follows also that pleasure is not a form of motion.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign> here has its wider sense of any process of
					change that actualizes what is potentially; it includes generation, of which building is
					an instance. In its proper sense <foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign> is limited to
					change of quality, quantity, or place.</note> For every motion or process of change
					involves duration, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and is a means to an end, for
					instance the process of building a house; and it is perfect when it has effected its end.
					Hence a motion is perfect either when viewed over the whole time of its duration, or at
					the moment when its end has been achieved. The several motions occupying portions of the
					time of the whole are imperfect, and different in kind from the whole and from each other.
					For instance, in building a temple the fitting together of the stones is a different
					process from the fluting of a column, and both are different from the construction of the
					temple as a whole; and whereas the building of the temple is a perfect process, for
					nothing more is required to achieve the end proposed, laying the foundation and
					constructing the triglyphs are imperfect processes, since each produces only a part of the
					design; they are therefore specifically different from the construction of the whole, and
					it is not possible to lay one's finger on a motion specifically perfect at any moment of
					the process of building, but only, if at all, in the whole of its duration. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And the same is true of walking and the other forms of locomotion. For if locomotion is
					motion from one point in space to another, and if this is of different kinds, flying,
					walking, leaping and the like, and not only so, but if there are also differences in
					walking itself &lpar;for the terminal points of a race course are not the same as
					those of a portion of the course, nor are those of one portion the same as those of
					another; nor is traversing this line the same as traversing that one,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The lecturer appears to draw a line representing a racecourse, and divide
						it into two parts, representing two sections of the course &lpar;not two lines
						across the course&rpar;. The motion of traversing one section is not the same as
						that of traversing the others, if only because they are in different places.</note>
					<milestone n="1174b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>for the
					runner does not merely travel along a certain line but travels along a line that is in a
					certain place, and this line is in a different place from
					that&rpar;&mdash;however, for a full treatment of the subject of motion I must
					refer to another work,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><title>Physics</title>,
						6-8.</note> but it appears that a motion is not perfect at every moment, but the many
					movements which make up the whole are imperfect; and different from each other in kind,
					inasmuch as the terminal points of a movement constitute a specific quality. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The specific quality of pleasure on the contrary is perfect at any
					moment. It is clear therefore that pleasure is not the same as motion, and that it is a
					whole and something perfect. </p>
				<p>This may also be inferred from the fact that a movement necessarily occupies a space of
					time, whereas a feeling of pleasure does not, for every moment of pleasurable
					consciousness is a perfect whole. </p>
				<p>These considerations also show that it is a mistake to speak of pleasure as the result of
					a motion or of a process of generation. For we cannot so describe everything, but only
					such things as are divided into parts and are not wholes. Thus an act of sight, a
					geometrical point, an arithmetical unit are not the result of a process of generation
					&lpar;nor is any of them a motion or process<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						parenthesis is perhaps an interpolation.</note>&rpar;. Pleasure therefore also is
					not the result of a motion or process; for pleasure is a whole. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, inasmuch as each of the senses acts in relation to its object, and acts perfectly
					when it is in good condition and directed to the finest of the and objects that belong to
					it &lpar;for this seems to be the best description of perfect activity, it being
					assumed to make no difference whether it be the sense itself that acts or the organ in
					which the sense resides&rpar;, it follows that the activity of any of the senses is at
					its best when the sense-organ being in the best condition is directed to the best of its
					objects; <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and this activity will be the most perfect
					and the pleasantest. For each sense has a corresponding pleasure, as also have thought and
					speculation, and its activity is pleasantest when it is most perfect, and most perfect
					when the organ is in good condition and when it is directed to the most excellent of its
					objects; and the pleasure perfects the activity. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The
					pleasure does not however perfect the activity in the same way as the object perceived and
					the sensory faculty, if good, perfect it; just as health and the physician are not in the
					same way the cause of being healthy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;It is clear that each of the senses is accompanied by pleasure, since we apply
					the term pleasant to sights and sounds<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As well as to
						tastes, scents, and contacts, which are more obviously pleasant.</note>; and it is also
					clear that the pleasure is greatest when the sensory faculty is both in the best condition
					and acting in relation to the best object; and given excellence in the perceived object
					and the percipient organ, there will always be pleasure when an object to cause it and a
					subject to feel it are both present.&rpar; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the pleasure perfects the activity, not as the fixed disposition does, by being
					already present in the agent, but as a supervening perfection, like the bloom of health in
					the young and vigorous. </p>
				<p>So long therefore as both object thought of or perceived, and subject discerning or
					judging, are such as they should be, <milestone n="1175a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>there will be pleasure in the activity; since while both the
					passive and the active parties to a relationship remain the same in themselves and
					unaltered in their relation to one another, the same result is naturally produced.
					<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>How is it then that no one can feel pleasure continuously? Perhaps it is due to fatigue,
					since no human faculty is capable of uninterrupted activity, and therefore pleasure also
					is not continuous, because it accompanies the activity of the faculties. It is for the
					same reason that some things please us when new, but cease to give so much pleasure later;
					this is because at first the mind is stimulated, and acts vigorously in regard to the
					object, as in the case of sight when we look at something intently; but afterwards the
					activity is less vigorous and our attention relaxes, and consequently the pleasure also
					fades. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It might be held that all men seek to obtain pleasure, because all men desire life. Life
					is a form of activity, and each man exercises his activity upon those objects and with
					those faculties which he likes the most: for example, the musician exercises his sense of
					hearing upon musical tunes, the student his intellect upon problems of philosophy, and so
					on. And the pleasure of these activities perfects the activities, and therefore perfects
					life, which all men seek. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Men have good reason therefore
					to pursue pleasure, since it perfects for each his life, which is a desirable thing. The
					question whether we desire life for the sake of pleasure or pleasure for the sake of life,
					need not be raised for the present. In any case they appear to be <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> inseparably united; for there is no pleasure without activity, and
					also no perfect activity without its pleasure. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>This moreover is the ground for believing that pleasures vary in specific quality. For we
					feel that different kinds of things must have a different sort of perfection. We see this
					to be so with natural organisms and the productions of art, such as animals, trees, a
					picture, a statue, a house, a piece of furniture. Similarly we think that that which
					perfects one kind of activity must differ in kind from that which perfects another kind.
					<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now the activities of the intellect differ from those
					of the senses, and from<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A variant reading gives
						&lsquo;and these &lsqb;sc. the activities of the senses&rsqb; from one
						another.&rsquo;</note> one another, in kind: so also therefore do the pleasures that
					perfect them. </p>
				<p>This may also be seen from the affinity which exists between the various pleasures and
					the activities which they perfect. For an activity is augmented by the pleasure that
					belongs to it; since those who work with pleasure always work with more discernment and
					with greater accuracy&mdash;for instance, students who are fond of geometry become
					proficient in it, and grasp its various problems better, and similarly lovers of music,
					architecture or the other arts make progress in their favorite pursuit because they enjoy
					it. An activity then is augmented by its pleasure; and that which augments a thing must be
					akin to it. <milestone n="1175b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>But things that are akin to things of different kinds must themselves differ in kind.
					<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>A still clearer proof may be drawn from the hindrance
					that activities receive from the pleasure derived from other activities. For instance,
					persons fond of the flute cannot give their attention to a philosophical discussion when
					they overhear someone playing the flute, because they enjoy music more than the activity
					in which they are engaged; therefore the pleasure afforded by the music of the flute
					impairs the activity of study. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The same thing occurs in
					other cases when a man tries to do two things at once; the pleasanter activity drives out
					the other, the more so if it is much more pleasant, until the other activity ceases
					altogether. Hence, when we enjoy something very much, we can hardly do anything else; and
					when we find a thing only mildly agreeable, we turn to some other occupation; for
					instance, people who eat sweets at the theater do so especially when the acting is bad.
					<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And since our activities are sharpened, prolonged and
					improved by their own pleasure, and impaired by the pleasures of other activities, it is
					clear that pleasures differ widely from each other. In fact alien pleasures have almost
					the same effect on the activities as their own pains<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e., the special pain accompanying a particular activity when it functions badly or in
						relation to a bad object.</note>; since, when an activity causes pain, this pain
					destroys it, for instance, if a person finds writing or doing sums unpleasant and irksome;
					for he stops writing or doing sums, because the activity is painful. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Activities then are affected in opposite ways by the pleasures and
					the pains that belong to them, that is to say, those that are intrinsically due to their
					exercise. Alien pleasures, as has been said, have very much the same effect as pain, for
					they destroy an activity, only not to the same degree. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Again, since activities differ in moral value, and some are to be adopted, others to be
					avoided, and others again are neutral, the same is true also of their pleasures: for each
					activity has a pleasure of its own. Thus the pleasure of a good activity is morally good,
					that of a bad one morally bad; for even desires for noble things are praised and desires
					for base things blamed; but the pleasures contained in our activities are more intimately
					connected with them than the appetites which prompt them, for the appetite is both
					separate in time and distinct in its nature from the activity, whereas the pleasure is
					closely linked to the activity, indeed so inseparable from it as to raise a doubt whether
					the activity is not the same thing as the pleasure. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>However, we must not regard pleasure as really being a thought or a
					sensation&mdash;indeed this is absurd, though because they are inseparable they seem
					to some people to be the same. </p>
				<p>As then activities are diverse, so also are their pleasures. <milestone n="1176a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Sight excels touch in purity,
					and hearing and smell excel taste; and similarly the pleasures of the intellect excel in
					purity the pleasures of sensation, while the pleasures of either class differ among
					themselves in purity. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And it is thought that every animal has its own special pleasure, just as it has its own
					special function: namely, the pleasure of exercising that function. This will also appear
					if we consider the different animals one by one: the horse, the dog, man, have different
					pleasures&mdash;as Heracleitus says, an ass would prefer chaff to gold, since to asses
					food gives more pleasure than gold. Different species therefore have different kinds of
					pleasures. On the other hand it might be supposed that there is no variety among the
					pleasures of the same species. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But as a matter of fact in
					the human species at all events there is a great diversity of pleasures. The same things
					delight some men and annoy others, and things painful and disgusting to some are pleasant
					and attractive to others. This also holds good of things sweet to the taste: the same
					things do not taste sweet to a man in a fever as to one in good health; nor does the same
					temperature feel warm to an invalid and to a person of robust constitution. The same holds
					good of other things as well. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But we hold that in all such cases the thing really is what it appears to be to the good
					man. And if this rule is sound, as it is generally held to be, and if the standard of
					everything is goodness, or the good man, <foreign lang="la">qua</foreign> good, then the
					things that seem to him to be pleasures are pleasures, and the things he enjoys are
					pleasant. <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> Nor need it cause surprise that things
					disagreeable to the good man should seem pleasant to some men; for mankind is liable to
					many corruptions and diseases, and the things in question are not really pleasant, but
					only pleasant to these particular persons, who are in a condition to think them so.
					<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It is therefore clear that we must pronounce the admittedly disgraceful pleasures not to
					be pleasures at all, except to the depraved. </p>
				<p>But among the pleasures considered respectable, which class of pleasures or which
					particular pleasure is to be deemed the distinctively human pleasure? Perhaps this will be
					clear from a consideration of man's activities. For pleasures correspond to the activities
					to which they belong; it is therefore that pleasure, or those pleasures, by which the
					activity, or the activities, of the perfect and supremely happy man are perfected, that
					must be pronounced human in the fullest sense. The other pleasures are so only in a
					secondary or some lower degree, like the activities to which they belong. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Having now discussed the various kinds of Virtue, of Friendship and of Pleasure, it
					remains for us to treat in outline of Happiness, inasmuch as we count this to be the End
					of human life. But it will shorten the discussion if we recapitulate what has been said
					already. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now we stated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1.8.9.</note> that happiness is not
					a certain disposition of character; since if it were it might be possessed by a man who
					passed the whole of his chosen life asleep, living the life of a vegetable, or by one who
					was plunged in the deepest misfortune. <milestone n="1176b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>If then we reject this as unsatisfactory, and feel bound to
					class happiness rather as some form of activity, as has been said in the earlier part of
					this treatise, and if activities are of two kinds, some merely necessary means and
					desirable only for the sake of something else, others desirable in themselves, it is clear
					that happiness is to be classed among activities desirable in themselves, and not among
					those desirable as a means to something else; since happiness lacks nothing, and is
					self-sufficient. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But those activities are desirable in themselves which do not aim at any result beyond
					the mere exercise of the activity. Now this is felt to be the nature of actions in
					conformity with virtue; for to do noble and virtuous deeds is a thing desirable for its
					own sake. </p>
				<p>But agreeable amusements also are desirable for not their own sake; we do not pursue them
					as a means to something else, for as a matter of fact they are more often harmful than
					beneficial, causing men to neglect their health and their estates. Yet persons whom the
					world counts happy usually have recourse to such pastimes; and this is why adepts in such
					pastimes stand in high favor with princes, because they make themselves agreeable in
					supplying what their patrons desire, and what they want is amusement. So it is supposed
					that amusements are a component part of happiness, because princes and potentates devote
					their leisure to them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But &lpar;i&rpar; perhaps princes and potentates are not good evidence. Virtue
					and intelligence, which are the sources of man's higher activities, do not depend on the
					possession of power; and if these persons, having no taste fo <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> pure and liberal pleasure, have recourse to the pleasures of the
					body, we must not on that account suppose that bodily pleasures are the more desirable.
					Children imagine that the things they themselves value are actually the best; it is not
					surprising therefore that, as children and grown men have different standards of value, so
					also should the worthless and the virtuous. &lt;<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Therefore, as has repeatedly been said, those things are actually valuable and pleasant
					which appear so to the good man; but each man thinks that activity most desirable which
					suits his particular disposition, and there fore the good a man thinks virtuous activity
					most desirable. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>It follows therefore that happiness is
					not to be found in amusements. </p>
				<p>&lpar;ii&rpar;Indeed it would be strange that amusement should be our
					End&mdash;that we should toil and moil all our life long in order that we may amuse
					ourselves. For virtually every object we adopt is pursued as a means to something else,
					excepting happiness, which is an end in itself; to make amusement the object of our
					serious pursuits and our work seems foolish and childish to excess: Anacharsis's motto,
					Play in order that you may work, is felt to be the right rule. For amusement is a form of
					rest; but we need rest because we are not able to go on working without a break, and
					therefore it is not an end, <milestone n="1177a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>since we take it as a means to further activity.
					&lpar;iii&rpar; And the life that conforms with virtue is thought to be a happy
					life; but virtuous life involves serious purpose, and does not consist in amusement.
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;iv&rpar; Also we pronounce serious things to be superior to things that are
					funny and amusing; and the nobler a faculty or a person is, the more serious, we think,
					are their activities; therefore, the activity of the nobler faculty or person is itself
					superior, and therefore more productive of happiness. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>&lpar;v&rpar; Also anybody can enjoy the pleasures of the body, a slave no less
					than the noblest of mankind; but no one allows a slave any measure of happiness, any more
					than a life of his own.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 3.1280a.32">Aristot. Pol. 1280a 32</bibl> &lsquo;Slaves and lower
						animals are not members of the state, because they do not participate in happiness nor
						in purposeful life.&rsquo;</note> Therefore happiness does not consist in pastimes
					and amusements, but in activities in accordance with virtue, as has been said already.
					<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But if happiness consists in activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it
					should be activity in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will be the virtue of
					the best part of us. Whether then this be the intellect, or whatever else it be that is
					thought to rule and lead us by nature, and to have cognizance of what is noble and divine,
					either as being itself also actually divine, or as being relatively the divinest part of
					us, it is the activity of this part of us in accordance with the virtue proper to it that
					will constitute perfect happiness; and it has been stated already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This does not appear to have been stated exactly, but in Book 6
						&lpar;see esp. 5.3, 13.8&rpar; it was shown that <foreign lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign>, the virtue of the higher part of the intellect, is the highest of the
						virtues.</note> that this activity is the activity of contemplation. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And that happiness consists in contemplation may be accepted as agreeing both with the
					results already reached and with the truth. For contemplation is at once the highest form
					of <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> activity &lpar;since the intellect is the
					highest thing in us, and the objects with which the intellect deals are the highest things
					that can be known&rpar; , and also it is the most continuous, for we can reflect more
					continuously than we can carry on any form of action. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And
					again we suppose that happiness must contain an element of pleasure; now activity in
					accordance with wisdom is admittedly the most pleasant of the activities in accordance
					with virtue: at all events it is held that philosophy or the pursuit of wisdom contains
					pleasures of marvellous purity and permanence, and it is reasonable to suppose that the
					enjoyment of knowledge is a still pleasanter occupation than the pursuit of it. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Also the activity of contemplation will be found to possess in the
					highest degree the quality that is termed self-sufficiency; for while it is true that the
					wise man equally with the just man and the rest requires the necessaries of life, yet,
					these being adequately supplied, whereas the just man needs other persons towards whom or
					with whose aid he may act justly, and so likewise do the temperate man and the brave man
					and the others, the wise man on the contrary can also contemplate by himself, and the more
					so the wiser he is; no doubt he will study better with the aid of fellow-workers, but
					still he is the most self-sufficient of men. <milestone n="1177b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Also the
					activity of contemplation may be held to be the only activity that is loved for its own
					sake: it produces no result beyond the actual act of contemplation, whereas from practical
					pursuits we look to secure some advantage, greater or smaller, beyond the action itself.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Also happiness is thought to involve leisure; for we do
					business in order that we may have leisure, and carry on war in order that we may have
					peace. Now the practical virtues are exercised in politics or in warfare; but the pursuits
					of politics and war seem to be unleisured&mdash;those of war indeed entirely so, for
					no one desires to be at war for the sake of being at war, nor deliberately takes steps to
					cause a war: a man would be thought an utterly bloodthirsty character if he declared war
					on a friendly state for the sake of causing battles and massacres. But the activity of the
					politician also is unleisured, and aims at securing something beyond the mere
					participation in politics&mdash;positions of authority and honor, or, if the happiness
					of the politician himself and of his fellow-citizens, this happiness conceived as
					something distinct from political activity &lpar;indeed we are clearly investigating
					it as so distinct&rpar;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably the sentence
						should be curtailed to run &lsquo;or in fact the happiness of himself and his
						fellow-citizens; and happiness we are clearly investigating as something distinct from
						the art of politics &lsqb;whose object it is&rsqb;.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>If then among practical pursuits displaying the virtues,
					politics and war stand out preeminent in nobility and grandeur, and yet they are
					unleisured, and directed to some further end, not chosen for their own sakes: whereas the
					activity of the intellect is felt to excel in serious worth,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This should almost certainly be emended to &lsquo;excel in
						leisuredness.&rsquo;</note> consisting as it does in contemplation, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> and to aim at no end beyond itself, and also to contain a
					pleasure peculiar to itself, and therefore augmenting its activity<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A reminder of 5.2.</note>: and if accordingly the attributes of this
					activity are found to be self-sufficiency, leisuredness, such freedom from fatigue as is
					possible for man, and all the other attributes of blessedness: it follows that it is the
					activity of the intellect that constitutes complete human happiness&mdash;provided it
					be granted a complete span of life, for nothing that belongs to happiness can be
					incomplete. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Such a life as this however will be higher than the human level:<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This section and 8.7 and 13 interpret 1.9.3.</note> not in virtue of his
					humanity will a man achieve it, but in virtue of something within him that is divine; and
					by as much as this something is superior to his composite nature, by so much is its
					activity superior to the exercise of the other forms of virtue. If then the intellect is
					something divine in comparison with man, so is the life of the intellect divine in
					comparison with human life. Nor ought we to obey those who enjoin that a man should have
					man's thoughts<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Euripides, fr. 1040.</note> and a mortal
					the thoughts of mortality,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Pind. I. 4">Pind. I. 4.16</bibl>.</note> but we ought so far as possible to achieve immortality,
					and do all that man may to live in accordance with the highest thing in him; for though
					this be small in bulk, <milestone n="1178a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>in power and value it far surpasses all the rest. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>It may even be held that this is the true self of each,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 9.4.3, 4; 8.6.</note> inasmuch as it is the dominant and better part;
					and therefore it would be a strange thing if a man should choose to live not his own life
					but the life of some other than himself. </p>
				<p>Moreover what was said before will apply here also: that which is best and most pleasant
					for each creature is that which is proper to the nature of each; accordingly the life of
					the intellect is the best and the pleasantest life<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						1.8.14.</note> for man, inasmuch as the intellect more than anything else is man;
					therefore this life will be the happiest. <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The life of moral virtue, on the other hand, is happy only in a secondary degree. For the
					moral activities are purely human: Justice, I mean, Courage and the other virtues we
					display in our intercourse with our fellows, when we observe what is due to each in
					contracts and services and in our various actions, and in our emotions also; and all of
					these things seem to be purely human affairs. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And some
					moral actions are thought to be the outcome of the physical constitution, and moral virtue
					is thought to have a close affinity in many respects with the passions. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Moreover, Prudence is intimately connected with Moral Virtue, and this
					with Prudence, inasmuch as the first Principles which Prudence employs are determined by
					the Moral Virtues, and the right standard for the Moral Virtues is determined by Prudence.
					But these being also connected with <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> the passions
					are related to our composite nature; now the virtues of our composite nature are purely
					human; so therefore also is the life that manifests these virtues, and the happiness that
					belongs to it. Whereas the happiness that belongs to the intellect is separate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In <bibl n="Aristot. de An. 3.5">Aristot. De anima
						3.5</bibl> Aristotle distinguishes the active from the passive intellect, and pronounces
						the former to be &lsquo;separate or separable &lpar;from matter, or the
						body&rpar;, unmixed and impassible.&rsquo;</note>: so much may be said about it
					here, for a full discussion of the matter is beyond the scope of our present purpose.
					<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And such happiness would appear to need but little
					external equipment, or less than the happiness based on moral virtue.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 7.4, 8.9, 10, and 1.8.15-17.</note> Both, it may be granted, require
					the mere necessaries of life, and that in an equal degree &lpar;though the politician
					does as a matter of fact take more trouble about bodily requirements and so forth than the
					philosopher&rpar; ; for in this respect there may be little difference between them.
					But for the purpose of their special activities their requirements will differ widely. The
					liberal man will need wealth in order to do liberal actions, and so indeed will the just
					man in order to discharge his obligations &lpar;since mere intentions are invisible,
					and even the unjust pretend to wish to act justly&rpar;; and the brave man will need
					strength if he is to perform any action displaying his virtue; and the temperate man
					opportunity for indulgence: otherwise how can he, or the possessor of any other virtue,
					show that he is virtuous? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>It is disputed also whether
					purpose or performance is the more important factor in virtue, as it is alleged to depend
					on both; <milestone n="1178b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>now
					the perfection of virtue will clearly consist in both; but the performance of virtuous
					actions requires much outward equipment, and the more so the greater and more noble the
					actions are. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But the student, so far as the pursuit of
					his activity is concerned, needs no external apparatus: on the contrary, worldly goods may
					almost be said to be a hindrance to contemplation; though it is true that, being a man and
					living in the society of others, he chooses to engage in virtuous action, and so will need
					external goods to carry on his life as a human being. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The following considerations also will show that perfect happiness is some form of
					contemplative activity. The gods, as we conceive them, enjoy supreme felicity and
					happiness. But what sort of actions can we attribute to them? Just actions? but will it
					not seem ridiculous to think of them as making contracts, restoring deposits and the like?
					Then brave actions&mdash;enduring terrors and running risks for the nobility of so
					doing? Or liberal actions? but to whom will they give? Besides, it would be absurd to
					suppose that they actually have a coinage or currency of some sort! And temperate
					actions&mdash;what will these mean in their case? surely it would be derogatory to
					praise them for not having evil desires! If we go through the list we shall find that all
					forms of virtuous conduct seem trifling and unworthy of the gods. Yet nevertheless they
					have always been conceived as, at all events, living, and therefore living actively, for
					we cannot suppose they are always asleep like <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/>
					Endymion. But for a living being, if we eliminate action, and <foreign lang="la">a
						fortiori</foreign> creative action, what remains save contemplation? It follows that the
					activity of God, which is transcendent in blessedness, is the activity of contemplation;
					and therefore among human activities that which is most akin to the divine activity of
					contemplation will be the greatest source of happiness. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>A further confirmation is that the lower animals cannot partake of happiness, because
					they are completely devoid of the contemplative activity. The whole of the life of the
					gods is blessed, and that of man is so in so far as it contains some likeness to the
					divine activity; but none of the other animals possess happiness, because they are
					entirely incapable of contemplation. Happiness therefore is co-extensive in its range with
					contemplation: the more a class of beings possesses the faculty of contemplation, the more
					it enjoys happiness, not as an accidental concomitant of contemplation but as inherent in
					it, since contemplation is valuable in itself. It follows that happiness is some form of
					contemplation. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But the philosopher being a man will also need external well&mdash;being, since man's
					nature is not self&mdash;sufficient for the activity of contemplation, but he must
					also have bodily health and a supply of food and other requirements. <milestone n="1179a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>Yet if supreme blessedness is
					not possible without external goods, it must not be supposed that happiness will demand
					many or great possessions; for self-sufficiency does not depend on excessive abundance,
					nor does moral conduct, <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>and it is possible to perform
					noble deeds even without being ruler of land and sea: one can do virtuous acts with quite
					moderate resources. This may be clearly observed in experience: private citizens do not
					seem to be less but more given to doing virtuous actions than princes and potentates. It
					is sufficient then if moderate resources are forthcoming; for a life of virtuous activity
					will be essentially a happy life. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Solon also doubtless gave a good description of happiness,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Solon in his conversation with Croesus &lpar;<bibl n="Hdt.1.30">Hdt.1.30-32</bibl>, see 1.10.1, note&rpar; says that Tellus the Athenian was the
					happiest man he ever knew. Tellus was well off, he lived to see his children's children,
					and he died gloriously in battle.</note> when he said that in his opinion those men were
					happy who, being moderately equipped with external goods, had performed noble exploits and
					had lived temperately; for it is possible for a man of but moderate possessions to do what
					is right. Anaxagoras again does not seem to have conceived the happy man as rich or
					powerful, since he says that he would not be surprised if he were to appear a strange sort
					of person in the eyes of the many; for most men judge by externals, which are all that
					they can perceive. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So our theories seem to be in
					agreement with the opinions of the wise. </p>
				<p>Such arguments then carry some degree of conviction; but it is by the practical
					experience of life and conduct that the truth is really tested, since it is ther
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> that the final decision lies. We must therefore
					examine the conclusions we have advanced by bringing them to the test of the facts of
					life. If they are in harmony with the facts, we may accept them; if found to disagree, we
					must deem them mere theories.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This section concludes
						the subject and prepares for the transition to politics in the next chapter; 8.13 would
						come better after 8.7: it looks back to 1.9.1-3.</note>
					<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>And it seems likely that the man who pursues intellectual activity, and who cultivates
					his intellect and keeps that in the best condition, is also the man most beloved of the
					gods. For if, as is generally believed, the gods exercise some superintendence over human
					affairs, then it will be reasonable to suppose that they take pleasure in that part of man
					which is best and most akin to themselves, namely the intellect, and that they recompense
					with their favors those men who esteem and honor this most, because these care for the
					things dear to themselves, and act rightly and nobly. Now it is clear that all these
					attributes belong most of all to the wise man. He therefore is most beloved by the gods;
					and if so, he is naturally most happy. Here is another proof that the wise man is the
					happiest. <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>If then we have sufficiently discussed in their outlines the subjects of Happiness and of
					Virtue in its various forms, and also Friendship and Pleasure, may we assume that the
					investigation we proposed is now complete? Perhaps however, as we maintain, <milestone n="1179b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>in the practical
					sciences the end is not to attain a theoretic knowledge of the various subjects, but
					rather to carry out our theories in action. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If so, to
					know what virtue is is not enough; we must endeavor to possess and to practice it, or in
					some other manner actually ourselves to become good. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now if discourses on ethics were sufficient in themselves to make men virtuous,
					&lsquo;large fees and many&rsquo; &lpar;as Theognis<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Thgn. 432">Theognis, 432 ff.</bibl>
						<foreign lang="greek">ei)= d' *)asklhpia/dais tou=to g' e)/dwke qeo/s, i)a=sqai
							kako/thta kai\ a)thra\s fre/nas a)ndrw=n, pollou\s a)\n misqou\s kai\ mega/lous
							e)/feron</foreign> If to physicians God had given The power to cure mankind of sin,
						Large fees and many they would win.</note> says&rpar; &lsquo;would they
					win,&rsquo; quite rightly, and to provide such discourses would be all that is wanted.
					But as it is, we see that although theories have power to stimulate and encourage generous
					youths, and, given an inborn nobility of character and a genuine love of what is noble,
					can make them susceptible to the influence of virtue, yet they are powerless to stimulate
					the mass of mankind to moral nobility. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For it is the
					nature of the many to be amenable to fear but not to a sense of honor, and to abstain from
					evil not because of its baseness but because of the penalties it entails; since, living as
					they do by passion, they pursue the pleasures akin to their nature, and the things that
					will procure those pleasures, and avoid the opposite pains, but have not even a notion of
					what is noble and truly pleasant, having never tasted true pleasure. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>What theory then can reform the natures of men like these? To dislodge
					by argument habits long firmly rooted in their characters is difficult if not impossible.
					We may doubtless think ourselves fortunate if we attain some measure of virtue when all
					the things believed to make men <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> virtuous are ours.
					<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Now some thinkers hold that virtue is a gift of nature; others think we become good by
					habit, others that we can be taught to be good. Natural endowment is obviously not under
					our control; it is bestowed on those who are fortunate, in the true sense, by some divine
					dispensation. Again, theory and teaching are not, I fear, equally efficacious in all
					cases: the soil must have been previously tilled if it is to foster the seed, the mind of
					the pupil must have been prepared by the cultivation of habits, so as to like and dislike
					aright. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>For he that lives at the dictates of passion will
					not hear nor understand the reasoning of one who tries to dissuade him; but if so, how can
					you change his mind by argument? </p>
				<p>And, speaking generally, passion seems not to be amenable to reason, but only to force.
					<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We must therefore by some means secure that the character shall have at the outset a
					natural affinity for virtue, loving what is noble and hating what is base. And it is
					difficult to obtain a right education in virtue from youth up without being brought up
					under right laws; for to live temperately and hardily is not pleasant to most men,
					especially when young; hence the nurture and exercises of the young should be regulated by
					law, since temperance and hardiness will not be painful when they have become habitual.
					<milestone n="1180a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/><milestone n="9" unit="section"/>But doubtless it is not enough for people to receive the right
					nurture and discipline in youth; they must also practice the lessons they have learnt, and
					confirm them by habit, when they are grown up. Accordingly we shall need laws to regulate
					the discipline of adults as well, and in fact the whole life of the people generally; for
					the many are more amenable to compulsion and punishment than to reason and to moral
					ideals. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Hence some persons hold,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Laws 722d">Plat. Laws 722d ff.</bibl>
					</note> that while it is proper for the lawgiver to encourage and exhort men to virtue on
					moral grounds, in the expectation that those who have had a virtuous moral upbringing will
					respond, yet he is bound to impose chastisement and penalties on the disobedient and
					ill-conditioned, and to banish the incorrigible out of the state altogether.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Prot. 325a">Plat. Prot. 325a</bibl>
					</note> For &lpar;they argue&rpar; although the virtuous man, who guides his life
					by moral ideals, will be obedient to reason, the base, whose desires are fixed on
					pleasure, must be chastised by pain, like a beast of burden. This indeed is the ground for
					the view that the pains and penalties for transgressors should be such as are most opposed
					to their favorite pleasures. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>But to resume: if, as has been said, in order to be good a man must have been properly
					educated and trained, and must subsequently continue to follow virtuous habits of life,
					and to do nothing base whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then this will be secured if
					men's lives are regulated by a certain intelligence, and by a right system, invested with
					adequate sanctions. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Now paternal authority has not the
					power to compel obedience, <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> nor indeed, speaking
					generally, has the authority of any individual unless he be a king or the like; but law on
					the other hand is a rule, emanating from a certain wisdom and intelligence, that has
					compulsory force. Men are hated when they thwart people's inclinations, even though they
					do so rightly, whereas law can enjoin virtuous conduct without being invidious. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>But <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> appears to be
					the only or almost the only state in which the lawgiver has paid attention to the nurture
					and exercises of the citizens; in most states such matters have been entirely neglected,
					and every man lives as he likes, in Cyclops
					fashion &lsquo;laying down the law For children and for spouse.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.114">Hom. Od. 9.114 f.</bibl>,
						quoted in <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1.1252b.22">Aristot. Pol. 1252b 22</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>The best thing is then that there should be a proper system of public regulation; but
					when the matter is neglected by the community, it would seem to be the duty of the
					individual to assist his own children and friends to attain virtue, or even if not able to
					do so successfully,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause, literally
						&lsquo;and to be able to do it,&rsquo; Bywater would place here; it comes in the
						mss. after &lsquo;public regulation&rsquo; above.</note> at all events to make
					this his aim. But it would seem to follow from what has been said before, that he will be
					more likely to be successful in this if he has acquired the science of legislation. Public
					regulations in any case must clearly be established by law, and only good laws will
					produce good regulations; <milestone n="1180b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>but it would not seem to make any difference whether these laws are
					written or unwritten, or whether they are to regulate the education of a single person or
					of a number of people, any more than in the case of music or athletics or any other form
					of training. Paternal exhortations and family habits have authority in the household, just
					as legal enactments and national customs have authority in the state, and the more so on
					account of the ties of relationship and of benefits conferred that unite the head of the
					household to its other members: he can count on their natural affection and obedience at
					the outset. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>Moreover individual treatment is better than
					a common system, in education as in medicine. As a general rule rest and fasting are good
					for a fever, but they may not be best for a particular case; and presumably a professor of
					boxing does not impose the same style of fighting on all his pupils. It would appear then
					that private attention gives more accurate results in particular cases, for the particular
					subject is more likely to get the treatment that suits him. But a physician or trainer or
					any other director can best treat a particular person if he has a general knowledge of
					what is good for everybody, or for other people of the same kind: for the sciences deal
					with what is universal, as their names<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g., medicine
						is &lsquo;the science of healing,&rsquo; not the &lsquo;science of healing
						Brown or Jones.&rsquo;</note> imply. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Not but what
					it is possible no doubt for a particular individual to be successfully treated by someone
					who is not a scientific expert, but has an empirical knowledge based on careful
					observation of the effects of various forms of treatment upon the person in question; just
					as some people appear to be their own best doctors, though they could not do any good
					<milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> to someone else. But nevertheless it would
					doubtless be agreed that anyone who wishes to make himself a professional and a man of
					science must advance to general principles, and acquaint himself with these by the proper
					method: for science, as we said, deals with the universal. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>So presumably a man who wishes to make other people better
					&lpar;whether few or many&rpar; by discipline, must endeavor to acquire the
					science of legislation&mdash;assuming that it is possible to make us good by laws. For
					to mold aright the character of any and every person that presents himself is not a task
					that can be done by anybody, but only &lpar;if at all&rpar; by the man with
					scientific knowledge, just as is the case in medicine and the other professions involving
					a system of treatment and the exercise of prudence. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>Is not then the next question to consider from whom or how the science of legislation can
					be learnt? Perhaps, like other subjects, from the experts, namely the politicians; for we
					saw<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.8.2.</note> that legislation who is a
					branch of political science. But possibly it may seem that political science is unlike the
					other sciences and faculties. In these the persons who impart a knowledge of the faculty
					are the same as those who practice it, for instance physicians and painters; but in
					politics the sophists, who profess to teach the science, <milestone n="1181a" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>never practice it. It is
					practiced by the politicians, who would appear to rely more upon a sort of empirical skill
					than on the exercise of abstract intelligence; for we do not see them writing or lecturing
					about political principles &lpar;though this might be a more honorable employment than
					composing forensic and parliamentary speeches&rpar;, nor yet do we notice that they
					have made their own sons or any others of their friends into statesmen. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>Yet we should expect them to have done so had they been able, for they
					could have bequeathed no more valuable legacy to their countries, nor is there any quality
					they would choose for themselves, and therefore for those nearest to them, to possess, in
					preference to political capacity. Not that experience does not seem to contribute
					considerably to political success; otherwise men would never have become statesmen merely
					through practical association with politics; so it would appear that those who aspire to a
					scientific knowledge of politics require practical experience as well as study. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>On the other hand those sophists who profess to teach politics
					are found to be very far from doing so successfully. In fact they are absolutely ignorant
					of the very nature of the science and of the subjects with which it deals; otherwise they
					would not class it as identical with, or even inferior to, the art of rhetoric.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Isoc. 15.80">Isoc. 15.80</bibl>
					</note> Nor would they imagine that it is easy to frame a constitution by making a
					collection of such existing laws as are reputed to be good ones, on the assumption that
					one can then select the best among them; as if even this selection did not call for
					understanding, and as if to judge correctly were not a very difficult task, just as much
					as it is for instance in music. It is only the experts in an art <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> who can judge correctly the productions of that art, and who
					understand the means and the method by which perfection is attained, and know which
					elements harmonize with which; amateurs may be content if they can discern whether the
					general result produced is good or bad, for example in the art of painting. Laws are the
					product, so to speak, of the art of politics; <milestone n="1181b" unit="bekker page"/><milestone n="1" unit="bekker line"/>how then can a mere collection of laws teach a
					man the science of legislation, or make him able to judge which of them are the best?
					<milestone n="21" unit="section"/>We do not see men becoming expert physicians from a
					study of medical handbooks. Yet medical writers attempt to describe not only general
					courses of treatment, but also methods of cure and modes of treatment for particular sorts
					of patients, classified according to their various habits of body; and their treatises
					appear to be of value for men who have had practical experience, though they are useless
					for the novice. Very possibly therefore collections of laws and constitutions may be
					serviceable to students capable of studying them critically, and judging what measures are
					valuable or the reverse, and what kind of institutions are suited to what national
					characteristics. But those who peruse such compilations without possessing a trained
					faculty cannot be capable of judging them correctly, unless they do so by instinct, though
					they may very likely sharpen their political intelligence. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>As then the question of legislation has been left uninvestigated by previous thinkers, it
					will perhaps be well if we consider it for ourselves, together with the whole question of
					the constitution of the State, in order to complete as far as possible our philosophy of
					human affairs. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
				<p>We<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This section roughly gives the contents of

					a review of any pronouncements of value contributed by our predecessors in this or that

					consider what institutions are preservative and what destructive of states in general, and
					of the different forms of constitution in particular, and what are the reasons which cause
					some states to be well <milestone n="20" unit="bekker line"/> governed and others the
					contrary. For after studying these questions we shall perhaps be in a better position to
					discern what is the best constitution absolutely, and what are the best regulations, laws,
					and customs for any given form of constitution. Let us then begin our discussion.</p>
