<milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1354a"/><milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/>  Rhetoric is a counterpart<note resp="Freese">Not an exact copy, but making a kind of pair with it, and corresponding to it as the antistrophe to the strophe in a choral ode.</note> of Dialectic; for both have to do with matters that are in a manner within the cognizance of all men and not confined<note resp="Freese">Or <q rend="double">and they (Rhetoric and Dialectic) are not confined.</q></note> to any special science. Hence all men in a manner have a share of both; for all, up to a certain point, endeavor to criticize or uphold an argument, to defend themselves or to accuse. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="2"><p>Now, the majority of people do this either at random or with a familiarity arising from habit. But since both these ways are possible, it is clear that matters can be reduced to a system, for it is possible to examine the reason why some attain their end by familiarity and others by chance; and such an examination all would at once admit to be the function of an art.<note resp="Freese">The special characteristic of an art is the discovery of a system or method, as distinguished from mere knack ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπειρία</foreign>).</note>
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="3"><p rend="align(indent)">Now, previous compilers of <q rend="double">Arts</q><note resp="Freese">Manuals or handbooks treating of the rules of any art or science.</note> of Rhetoric have provided us with only a small portion of this art, for proofs are the only things in it that come within the province of art; everything else is merely an accessory. And yet they say nothing about enthymemes which are the body of proof, but chiefly devote their attention to matters outside the subject;

</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="5"><p>For all men either think that all the laws ought so to prescribe,<note resp="Freese">That is, forbid speaking of matters that have nothing to do with the case.</note> or in fact carry out the principle and forbid speaking outside the subject, as in the court of Areopagus, and in this they are right. For it is wrong to warp the dicast's feelings, to arouse him to anger, jealousy or compassion, which would be like making the rule crooked which one intended to use. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="6"><p>Further, it is evident that the only business of the litigant is to prove that the fact in question is or is not so, that it has happened or not; whether it is important or unimportant, just or unjust, in all cases in which the legislator has not laid down a ruling, is a matter for the dicast himself to decide; it is not the business of the litigants to instruct him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="7"><p rend="align(indent)">First of all, therefore, it is proper that laws, properly enacted, should themselves define the issue of all cases as far as possible, and leave as little as possible to the discretion of the judges; in the first place, because it is easier to find one or a few men of good sense, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1354b"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/> capable of framing laws and pronouncing judgements, than a large number; secondly, legislation is the result of long consideration, whereas judgements are delivered on the spur of the moment, so that it is difficult for the judges properly to decide questions of justice or expediency. But what is most important of all is that the judgement of the legislator does not apply to a particular case, but is universal and applies to the future, whereas the member of the public assembly and the dicast have to decide present and definite issues, and in their case love, hate, or personal interest is often involved, so that they are no longer capable of discerning the truth adequately, their judgement being obscured by their own pleasure or pain.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="8"><p rend="align(indent)">All other cases, as we have just said, should be left to the authority of the judge as seldom as possible, except where it is a question of a thing having happened or not, of its going to happen or not, of being or not being so; this must be left to the discretion of the judges, for it is impossible for the legislator to foresee such questions. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="9"><p>If this is so, it is obvious that all those who definitely lay down, for instance, what should be the contents of the exordium or the narrative, or of the other parts of the discourse, are bringing under the rules of art what is outside the subject; for the only thing to which their attention is devoted <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="20"/> is how to put the judge into a certain frame of mind. They give no account of the artificial proofs,<note resp="Freese">Systematic logical proofs (enthymeme, for example), including testimony as to character and appeals to the emotions (2.3), which the rhetorician has to invent ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὑρεῖν</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="lat">inventio</foreign>) for use in particular cases. They are contrasted with <q rend="double">inartificial</q> proofs, which have nothing to do with the rules of the art, but are already in existence, and only need to be made use of. The former are dealt with in chs. 4-14, the latter in ch. 15 of this book.</note> which make a man a master of rhetorical argument.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="10"><p rend="align(indent)">Hence, although the method of deliberative and forensic Rhetoric is the same, and although the pursuit of the former is nobler and more worthy of a statesman than that of the latter, which is limited to transactions between private citizens, they say nothing about the former, but without exception endeavor to bring forensic speaking under the rules of art. The reason of this is that in public speaking it is less worth while to talk of what is outside the subject, and that deliberative oratory lends itself to trickery less than forensic, because it is of more general interest.<note resp="Freese"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινότερον</foreign>: or, <q rend="double">more intelligible to the ordinary man.</q></note> For in the assembly the judges decide upon their own affairs, so that the only thing necessary is to prove the truth of the statement of one who recommends a measure, but in the law courts this is not sufficient; there it is useful to win over the hearers, for the decision concerns other interests than those of the judges, who, having only themselves to consider and listening merely for their own pleasure, surrender to the pleaders but do not give a real decision.<note resp="Freese">The case as a rule being a matter of personal indifference, the judges are likely to be led away by the arguments which seem most plausible.</note> <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1355a"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/> That is why, as I have said before, in many places the law prohibits speaking outside the subject in the law courts, whereas in the assembly the judges themselves take adequate precautions against this. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="11"><p rend="align(indent)">It is obvious, therefore, that a system arranged according to the rules of art is only concerned with proofs; that proof is a sort of demonstration,<note resp="Freese">Exact scientific proof ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδειξις</foreign>), which probable proof ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>) only to a certain extent resembles.</note> since we are most strongly convinced when we suppose anything to have been demonstrated; that rhetorical demonstration is an enthymeme, which, generally speaking, is the strongest of rhetorical proofs and lastly, that the enthymeme is a kind of syllogism. Now, as it is the function of Dialectic as a whole, or of one of its parts,<note resp="Freese">Dialectic here apparently includes logic generally, the <q rend="double">part</q> being either the <title>Analytica Priori</title>, which deals with the syllogism, or the <title>Sophistici Elenchi</title>, on Fallacies.</note> to consider every kind of syllogism in a similar manner, it is clear that he who is most capable of examining the matter and forms of a syllogism will be in the highest degree a master of rhetorical argument, if to this he adds a knowledge of the subjects with which enthymemes deal and the differences between them and logical syllogisms. For, in fact, the true and that which resembles it come under the purview of the same faculty, and at the same time men have a sufficient natural capacity for the truth and indeed in most cases attain to it; wherefore one who divines well in regard to the truth will also be able to divine well in regard to probabilities.<note resp="Freese"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδοξα</foreign>, <q rend="double">resting on opinion</q>; defined in the <title>Topics</title> (1.1) as <q rend="double">things generally admitted by all, or by most men, or by the wise, and by all or most of these, or by the most notable and esteemed.</q></note></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">It is clear, then, that all other rhetoricians bring under the rules of art what is outside the subject, <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="20"/> and<note resp="Freese"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διότι</foreign> either = <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι</foreign>, <q rend="double">that</q>; or, (it is clear) <q rend="double">why.</q></note> have rather inclined to the forensic branch of oratory. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="12"><p>Nevertheless, Rhetoric is useful, because the true and the just are naturally superior to their opposites, so that, if decisions are improperly made, they must owe their defeat to their own advocates; which is reprehensible. Further, in dealing with certain persons, even if we possessed the most accurate scientific knowledge, we should not find it easy to persuade them by the employment of such knowledge. For scientific discourse is concerned with instruction,<note resp="Freese">Almost equivalent to demonstration or strictly logical proof.</note> but in the case of such persons instruction is impossible; our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, as we said in the <title>Topics</title>,<note resp="Freese">1.2. The <title>Topics</title> is a treatise in eight books on Dialectic and drawing conclusions from probabilities.</note> when speaking of converse with the multitude. Further, the orator should be able to prove opposites, as in logical arguments; not that we should do both (for one ought not to persuade people to do what is wrong), but that the real state of the case may not escape us, and that we ourselves may be able to counteract false arguments, if another makes an unfair use of them. Rhetoric and Dialectic alone of all the arts prove opposites; for both are equally concerned with them. However, it is not the same with the subject matter, but, generally speaking, that which is true and better is naturally always easier to prove and more likely to persuade. Besides, it would be absurd if it were considered disgraceful not to be able to defend oneself with the help of the body, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1355b"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/> but not disgraceful as far as speech is concerned, whose use is more characteristic of man than that of the body. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="13"><p>If it is argued that one who makes an unfair use of such faculty of speech may do a great deal of harm, this objection applies equally to all good things except virtue, and above all to those things which are most useful, such as strength, health, wealth, generalship; for as these, rightly used, may be of the greatest benefit, so, wrongly used, they may do an equal amount of harm.</p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.1" n="14"><p rend="align(indent)">It is thus evident that Rhetoric does not deal with any one definite class of subjects, but, like Dialectic, [is of general application]; also, that it is useful; and further, that its function is not so much to persuade, as to find out in each case the existing means of persuasion.<note resp="Freese">The early sophistical definition was <q rend="double">the art of persuasion.</q></note> The same holds good in respect to all the other arts. For instance, it is not the function of medicine to restore a patient to health, but only to promote this end as far as possible; for even those whose recovery is impossible may be properly treated. It is further evident that it belongs to Rhetoric to discover the real and apparent means of persuasion, just as it belongs to Dialectic to discover the real and apparent syllogism. For what makes the sophist is not the faculty but the moral purpose. But there is a difference: in Rhetoric, one who acts in accordance with sound argument, and one who acts in accordance with moral purpose, <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="20"/> are both called rhetoricians; but in Dialectic it is the moral purpose that makes the sophist, the dialectician being one whose arguments rest, not on moral purpose but on the faculty.<note resp="Freese">The essence of sophistry consists in the moral purpose, the deliberate use of fallacious arguments. In Dialectic, the dialectician has the power or faculty of making use of them when he pleases; when he does so deliberately, he is called a sophist. In Rhetoric, this distinction does not exist; he who uses sound arguments as well as he who uses false ones are both known as rhetoricians.</note></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Let us now endeavor to treat of the method itself, to see how and by what means we shall be able to attain our objects. And so let us as it were start again, and having defined Rhetoric anew, pass on to the remainder of the subject.</p> </div>
</div>	
	
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="1"><p>Rhetoric then may be defined as the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion in reference to any subject whatever. This is the function of no other of the arts, each of which is able to instruct and persuade in its own special subject; thus, medicine deals with health and sickness, geometry with the properties of magnitudes, arithmetic with number, and similarly with all the other arts and sciences. But Rhetoric, so to say, appears to be able to discover the means of persuasion in reference to any given subject. That is why we say that as an art its rules are not applied to any particular definite class of things.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="2"><p rend="align(indent)">As for proofs, some are artificial, others inartificial. By the latter I understand all those which have not been furnished by ourselves but were already in existence, such as witnesses, tortures, contracts, and the like; by the former, all that can be constructed by system and by our own efforts. Thus we have only to make use of the latter, whereas we must invent the former. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="3"><p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1356a"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/>Now the proofs furnished by the speech are of three kinds. The first depends upon the moral character of the speaker, the second upon putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind, the third upon the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="4"><p rend="align(indent)">The orator persuades by moral character when his speech is delivered in such a manner as to render him worthy of confidence; for we feel confidence in a greater degree and more readily in persons of worth in regard to everything in general, but where there is no certainty and there is room for doubt, our confidence is absolute. But this confidence must be due to the speech itself, not to any preconceived idea of the speaker's character; for it is not the case, as some writers of rhetorical treatises lay down in their <q rend="double">Art,</q> that the worth of the orator in no way contributes to his powers of persuasion; on the contrary, moral character, so to say, constitutes the most effective means of proof. 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="5"><p>The orator persuades by means of his hearers, when they are roused to emotion by his speech; for the judgements we deliver are not the same when we are influenced by joy or sorrow, love or hate; and it is to this alone that, as we have said, the present-day writers of treatises endeavor to devote their attention. (We will discuss these matters in detail when we come to speak of the emotions.) 
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="6"><p>Lastly, persuasion is produced by the speech itself, when we establish the true <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="20"/> or apparently true from the means of persuasion applicable to each individual subject.
</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="7"><p rend="align(indent)">Now, since proofs are effected by these means, it is evident that, to be able to grasp them, a man must be capable of logical reasoning, of studying characters and the virtues, and thirdly the emotions—the nature and character of each, its origin, and the manner in which it is produced. Thus it appears that Rhetoric is as it were an offshoot of Dialectic and of the science of Ethics, which may be reasonably called Politics.<note resp="Freese">Rhetoric, as dealing with human actions, characters, virtues, and emotions, is closely connected with Politics, which includes Ethics. The two latter treat of the same subject from a different point of view. Both deal with happiness and virtue, but the object of Politics is, by comparison of the different forms of States to find the one in which man will be most virtuous. Lastly, Rhetoric, as an important factor in the training and education of the individual citizen and of the members of the State as a whole, may be described as an offshoot of Politics, with which the sophistical rhetoricians <emph>identified</emph> it.</note> That is why Rhetoric assumes<note resp="Freese">Or, <q rend="double">slips into the garb of</q> (Jebb). Probably a stage metaphor.</note> the character of Politics, and those who claim to possess it, partly from ignorance, partly from boastfulness, and partly from other human weaknesses, do the same. For, as we said at the outset, Rhetoric is a sort of division or likeness of Dialectic, since neither of them is a science that deals with the nature of any definite subject, but they are merely faculties of furnishing arguments. We have now said nearly enough about the faculties of these arts and their mutual relations.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-eng2:1.2" n="8"><p rend="align(indent)">But for purposes of demonstration, real or apparent, just as Dialectic possesses two modes of argument, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1356b"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/> induction and the syllogism, real or apparent, the same is the case in Rhetoric; for the example is induction, and the enthymeme a syllogism, and the apparent enthymeme an apparent syllogism. Accordingly I call an enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, and an example rhetorical induction. Now all orators produce belief by employing as proofs either examples or enthymemes and nothing else; so that if, generally speaking, it is necessary to prove any fact whatever either by syllogism or by induction—and that this is so is clear from the <title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.23">Aristot. Pr. Anal. 2.23</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.1">Aristot. Post.

Similarly, the deliberative orator, although he often sacrifices everything else, will never admit that he is recommending what is inexpedient or is dissuading from what is useful; but often he is quite indifferent about showing that the enslavement of neighboring peoples, even if they have done no harm, is not an act of injustice.<note resp="Freese">The omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδικον</foreign> has been suggested.

(1) With a full stop at <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίζει</foreign> (Roemer, Jebb). The conclusion then drawn is that memory and hope are accompanied by imagination of what is remembered or hoped. To this it is objected that what Aristotle really wants to prove is that memory and hope are a cause of pleasure. (2) With a comma at <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίζει</foreign> (Cope, Victorius). The steps in the argument will then be: if pleasure is the sensation of a certain emotion; if imagination is a weakened (faded) sensation; if one who remembers or hopes is attended by an imagination of what he remembers or hopes; then, this being so, pleasure will attend one who remembers or hopes, since there is sensation, and pleasure is sensation and a kind of movement (sect. 1). <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>, the faculty of forming mental images (variously translated <q rend="double">imagination,</q> <q rend="double">mental impression,</q> <q rend="double">fantasy</q>) is defined by Aristotle (<bibl n="Aristot. de An. 3.3.11">Aristot.

If <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign> is referred to an earlier perception of which the sense image is a copy, this is memory. Imagination carries the sense images ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντάσματα</foreign>) to the seat of memory.

Further, since twice so much is unwholesome, one may argue that neither is the original amount wholesome; for it would be absurd that two halves separately should be good, but bad combined. In this way the argument may be used for refutation, in another way for demonstration, if one were to say, one good thing cannot make two bad things. But the whole topic is fallacious. Again, one may quote what Polycrates said of Thrasybulus, that he deposed thirty tyrants,<note resp="Freese">Thrasybulus deposed the thirty individuals and put down the single tyranny which they composed; he then claimed a thirtyfold reward, as having put down thirty tyrannies.</note> for here he combines them; or the example of the fallacy of division in the <title>Orestes</title> of Theodectes:<note resp="Freese">Frag. 5 (<title>T.G.F.</title>).</note> <q rend="double">It is just that a woman who has killed her husband</q> should be put to death, and that the son should avenge the father; <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1401b"/>  <milestone unit="line" resp="Bekker" n="1"/> and this in fact is what has been done.

If this is so, that which is improbable will be probable. But not absolutely; but as, in the case of sophistical disputations, the argument becomes fallacious when the circumstances, reference, and manner are not added, so here it will become so owing to the probability being not probable absolutely but only in particular cases.

But this must not be done in the same way; for the defendant must deal with this at the beginning, the accuser in the epilogue. The reason is obvious.

<p rend="align(indent)">The object of an appeal to the hearer is to make him well disposed or to arouse his indignation, and sometimes to engage his attention or the opposite; for it is not always expedient to engage his attention, which is the reason why many speakers try to make their hearers laugh.

Hearers pay most attention to things that are important, that concern their own interests, that are astonishing, that are agreeable; wherefore one should put the idea into their heads that the speech deals with such subjects.
