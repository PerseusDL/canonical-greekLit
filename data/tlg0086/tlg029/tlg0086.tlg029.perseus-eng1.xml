		    <div type="bekker page" n="1343a"><p><milestone unit="Book" n="1"/><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> Between Housecraft (the art of governing a Household or Home) and Statecraft
                    (the art of governing a Nation) there are differences corresponding to those
                    between the two kinds of community over which they severally preside. There is,
                    however, this further difference: that whereas the government of a nation is in
                    many hands, a household has but a single ruler.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now some arts are divided into two separate branches, one concerned with the
                    making of an object&mdash;for example a lyre or a flute&mdash;and the
                    other with its use when made. Statecraft on the other hand shows us how to build
                    up a nation from its beginning, as well as how to order rightly a nation that
                    already exists; from which we infer that Housecraft also tells us first how to
                    acquire a household and then how to conduct its affairs.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> By a Nation we
                    mean an assemblage of houses, lands, and property sufficient to enable the
                    inhabitants to lead a civilized life. This is proved by the fact that when such
                    a life is no longer possible for them, the tie itself which unites them is
                    dissolved. Moreover, it is with such a life in view that the association is
                    originally formed; and the object for which a thing exists and has come into
                    being is in fact the very essence of that particular thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From this definition of a Nation, it is evident that the art of
                    Housecraft is older than that of Statecraft, since the Household, which it
                    creates, is older; being a component part of the Nation created by
                        Statecraft.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Accordingly we must consider the
                    nature of Housecraft, and what the Household, which it creates, actually
                        is.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="2.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> The component parts of a household are (l) human beings, and (2) goods and
                    chattels. And as households are no exception to the rule that the nature of a
                    thing is first studied in its barest and simplest form,<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>we will follow Hesiod and begin by postulating
                    "Homestead first, and a woman; a plough-ox hardy to furrow." For the steading
                    takes precedence among our physical necessities, and the woman among our free
                    associates. It is, therefore, one of the tasks of Homecraft to set in order the
                    relation between man and woman; in other words, to see that it is what it ought
                    to be.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="2.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> Of occupations attendant on our goods and chattels, those come first which
                    are natural. Among these precedence is given to the one which cultivates the
                    land; those like mining, which extract wealth from it, take the second place.
                    Agriculture is the most honest of all such occupations; seeing that the wealth
                    it brings is not derived from other men. Herein it is distinguished from trade
                    and the wage-earning employments, which acquire wealth from others by their
                    consent; and from war, which wrings it from them perforce. It is also a natural
                    occupation; since by Nature's appointment all creatures receive sustenance from
                    their mother, </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1343b"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>and mankind like the rest from their common mother the
                        earth.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="2.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> And besides all this, agriculture contributes notably to
                    the making of a manly character; because, unlike the mechanical arts, it does
                    not cripple and weaken the bodies of those engaged in it, but inures them to
                    exposure and toil and invigorates them to face the perils of war. For the
                    farmer's possessions, unlike those of other men, lie outside the city's
                        defences.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="3.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> When we turn our attention to the human part of the
                    household, it is the woman who makes the first claim upon it; &lt;for the
                    natural comes first, as we have said,&gt; and nothing is more natural than
                    the tie between female and male. For we have elsewhere laid down the
                    premiss<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1.1252a.1">Aristot. Pol. 1.1</bibl>.</note> that Nature is intent on multiplying severally her types;
                    and this is true of every animal in particular. Neither the female, however, can
                    effect this without the male, nor the male without the female; whence the union
                    of the sexes has of necessity arisen.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="3.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> Now among the lower animals, this union is
                    irrational in character; it exists merely for the purpose of procreation, and
                    lasts only so long as the parents are occupied in producing their brood. In tame
                    animals, on the other hand, and those which possess a greater share of
                    intelligence, it has assumed a more complex form; for in their case we see more
                    examples of mutual help, goodwill, and co-operation. <milestone ed="P" n="3.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> It is, however, in the human species that this complexity
                    is most marked; since the co-operation between woman and man aims not merely at
                    existence, but at a happy <milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>existence.
                    Nor do mankind beget children merely to pay the service they owe to Nature, but
                    also that they may themselves receive a benefit; for the toil they undergo while
                    they are strong and their offspring is still weak is repaid by that offspring
                    when it in turn is grown strong and the parents by reason of age are
                        weak.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="3.4" unit="Loeb chap"/> At the same time Nature, by this cycle of changes,
                    fulfills her purpose of perpetuating existence; preserving the type when she is
                    unable to preserve the individual.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. GA 731b">Aristot. De Gen. An. 731b.</bibl></note> And so
                    with this purpose in view Divine Providence has fashioned the nature of man and
                    of woman for their partnership. For they are distinguished from each other by
                    the possession of faculties not adapted in every case to the same tasks, but in
                    some cases for opposite ones, though contributing to the same end. For
                    Providence made man stronger and woman weaker, </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1344a"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>so that he in
                    virtue of his manly prowess may be more ready to defend the home, and she, by
                    reason of her timid nature, more ready to keep watch over it; and while he
                    brings in fresh supplies from without, she may keep safe what lies within. In
                    handicrafts again, woman was given a sedentary patience, though denied stamina
                    for endurance of exposure; while man, though inferior to her in quiet
                    employments, is endowed with vigor for every active occupation. In the
                    production of children both share alike; but each makes a different contribution
                    to their upbringing. It is the mother who nurtures, and the father who
                        educates.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="4.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> We begin then with the rules that should govern a man's
                    treatment of his wife. And the first of these forbids him to do her wrong; for
                    if he observes this, he is not likely himself to suffer wrong at her hands. As
                    the Pythagoreans declare, even the common rule or custom of mankind thus
                    ordains, forbidding all wrong to a wife as stringently as though she were a
                    suppliant whom one has raised from the hearthstone. And a man does wrong to his
                    wife when he associates with other women.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="4.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> As regards the intercourse of
                    marriage, wives should neither importune their husbands, nor be restless in
                    their absence; but a man should accustom his wife to be content whether he is at
                    home or away. Good also is the advice of Hesiod: <cit>
                        <quote type="verse">
                            <l met="dactylic">Take thee a maiden to wife, and teach her ways of
                                discretion.</l>
                        </quote>
                        <bibl n="Hes. WD 699">Hes. WD 699</bibl>
                    </cit> For differences of ways and habits are little conducive to
                        affection.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="4.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> As regards adornment: it is not well<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>that souls should approach one another in
                    borrowed plumes, nor is it well in the case of bodies. Intercourse which depends
                    &lt;for its charm&gt; upon outward adornment differs in no respect from
                    that of figures on the stage in their conventional attire.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="5.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> Of property, the
                    first and most indispensable kind is that which is also best and most amenable
                    to Housecraft; and this is the human chattel. Our first step therefore must be
                    to procure good slaves. Of slaves there are two kinds; those in positions of
                    trust, and the laborers. And since it is matter of experience that the character
                    of the young can be moulded by training, when we require to charge slaves with
                    tasks befitting the free, we have not only to procure the slaves, but to bring
                    them up &lt;for the trust&gt;.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="5.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> In our intercourse with slaves we must
                    neither suffer them to be insolent nor treat them with cruelty. A share of honor
                    should be given to those who are doing more of a freeman's work, and abundance
                    of food to those who are laboring with their hands. And whereas the use of wine
                    renders even free men insolent, so that in many countries they too refrain from
                    it&mdash;as, for instance, the Carthaginians do when they are on
                    campaign&mdash;it follows that we must either deny wine to slaves
                    altogether, or reserve it for rare occasions.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="5.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> We may apportion to our
                    slaves (1) work, (2) chastisement, and (3) food. If men are given food, but no
                    chastisement nor any work, they become insolent. </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1344b"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>If they are made
                    to work, and are chastised, but stinted of their food, such treatment is
                    oppressive, and saps their strength. The remaining alternative, therefore, is to
                    give them work, and a sufficiency of food. Unless we pay men, we cannot control
                    them; and food is a slave's pay.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Slaves, again,
                    are no exception to the rule that men become worse when better conduct is not
                    followed by better treatment, but virtue and vice remain alike unrewarded.
                        <milestone ed="P" n="5.4" unit="Loeb chap"/> Accordingly we must keep watch
                    over our workers, suiting our dispensations and indulgences to their desert;
                    whether it be food or clothing, leisure or chastisement that we are
                    apportioning. Both in theory and in practice we must take for our model a
                    physician's freedom in prescribing his medicines; observing at the same time
                    that food differs from medicine in that it requires to be constantly
                        administered.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="5.5" unit="Loeb chap"/> The best laborers will be furnished by those races of
                    mankind which are neither wholly spiritless nor yet overbold. Each extreme has
                    its vice; the spiritless cannot endure hard labor, and the high-spirited will
                    not readily brook control.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="5.6" unit="Loeb chap"/> Every slave should have before his eyes a
                    definite goal or term of his labor. To set the prize of freedom before him is
                    both just and expedient; since having a prize to work for, and a time defined
                    for its attainment, he will put his heart into his labors. We should, moreover,
                    take hostages &lt;for our slaves' fidelity&gt; by allowing them to beget
                    children; and avoid the practice of purchasing many slaves of the same
                    nationality, as men avoid doing in towns. We should also keep festivals and give
                    treats, more on the slaves account than on that of the freemen;<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>since the free have a fuller share in those
                    enjoyments for the sake of which these institutions exist.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> There are four
                    qualities which the head of a household must possess in dealing with his
                    property. Firstly, he must have the faculty of acquiring, and secondly that of
                    preserving what he has acquired; otherwise there is no more benefit in acquiring
                    than in baling with a colander, or in the proverbial wine-jar with a hole in the
                    bottom. Thirdly and fourthly, he must know how to improve his property, and how
                    to make use of it; since these are the ends for which the powers of acquisition
                    and of preservation are sought.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> Everything we possess should be duly classified ;
                    and the amount of our productive property exceed that of the unproductive.
                    Produce should be so employed that we do not risk all our possessions at once.
                    For the safe keeping of our property, we shall do well to adopt the Persian and
                    Laconian systems. Athenian housecraft has, however, some advantages. The
                    Athenian buys immediately with the produce of his sales, and the smaller
                    households keep no idle deposits in store.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> Under the Persian system, the
                    master himself undertook the entire disposition and supervision of the
                    household, following the practice which
                    Dion used to remark in Dionysius. No one, indeed, takes the same
                    care of another's property as of his own; so that, as far as is possible,
                        </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1345a"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>each man ought to attend to his affairs in person. We may
                    commend also a pair of sayings, one attributed to a Persian and the other to a
                    Libyan. The former on being asked what best conditions a horse, replied "His
                    master's eye."<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Xen. Ec.                         12">Xen. Ec.

                    answered "The master's footprints."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.4" unit="Loeb chap"/> The master and mistress should, therefore,
                    give personal supervision, each to his or her special department of the
                    household work. In small households, an occasional inspection will suffice; in
                    estates managed through stewards, inspections must be frequent. For in
                    stewardship as in other matters there can be no good copy without a good
                    example; and if the master and mistress do not attend diligently to their
                    estate, their deputies will certainly not do so.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.5" unit="Loeb chap"/> Moreover, as such habits are
                    both commendable for moral reasons and also conducive to good management, the
                    master and mistress will do well to rise earlier than their servants and to
                    retire later; to treat their home as a city, and never leave it unguarded; nor
                    ever, by night or by day, to postpone a task which ought to be done. Rising
                    before daylight is also to be commended; it is a healthy habit, and gives more
                    time for the management of the household as well as for liberal
                        studies.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.6" unit="Loeb chap"/> We have remarked that on small holdings the Athenian
                    method of disposing of the produce is advantageous.<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>On large estates, after the amount for the year's or the
                    month's outlay has been set apart, it should be handed to the overseers; and so
                    also with implements, whether for daily or for occasional use. In addition, an
                    inspection of implements and stores should be made periodically, so that
                    remainders and deficiencies may alike be noted.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.7" unit="Loeb chap"/> In constructing a homestead,
                    we have to provide for the stock which it is to shelter, and for its health and
                    well-being. Providing for the stock involves questions such as these: What type
                    of building is best for the storage of crops and of clothing? How are we to
                    store the dry crops, and how the moist ones? Of the other stock, how is the
                    living to be housed, and how the dead? and what accommodation are we to make for
                    slaves and free, for women and men, for foreigners and fellow-citizens? For
                    well-being and health, again, the homestead should be airy in summer, and sunny
                    in winter.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="6.8" unit="Loeb chap"/> A homestead possessing these qualities would be longer
                    than it is deep; and its main front would face the south. On large estates,
                    moreover, it seems worth while to instal as porter a man incapable of other
                    work, to keep his eye on what passes in and out. </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1345b"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>That implements

                    are four main types, under which all others may be classified. We have the
                    administration of a king; of the governors under him; of a free state; and of a
                    private citizen.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> Of these, that of a king is the most extensive, yet at
                    the same time the simplest. A governor's office is also very extensive, but
                    divided into a great variety of departments. The administration of a free state
                    is again very varied, but it is the easiest to conduct; while that, of a private
                    individual presents the like variety, but within limits which are narrowest of
                    all. For the most part, all four will of necessity cover the same ground; we
                    will, however, take them in turn, and see what is especially characteristic of
                        each.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Taking first the royal administration,
                    we see that while theoretically its power is unlimited,<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>it is in practice concerned with four departments,
                    namely currency, exports, imports, and expenditure.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.3" unit="Loeb chap"/> Taking these severally, I
                    assign to that of currency the seasonable regulation of prices; to imports and
                    exports, the profitable disposition, at any given time, of the dues received
                    from provincial governors; and to expenditure, the reduction of outgoings as
                    occasion may serve, and the question of meeting expenses by currency or by
                        commodities.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.4" unit="Loeb chap"/> The second kind of administration, that of the governor,
                    is concerned with six different classes of revenue; those, namely, arising from
                    agriculture, from the special products of the country, from markets, from taxes,
                    from cattle, and from other sources.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Taking these
                    in turn, the first and most important of them is revenue from agriculture, which
                    some call tithe and some produce-tax.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Boeckh

                    from taxes on land and on sales. In the fifth place we have revenue from cattle,
                    called tithe or first-fruits; and in the sixth, revenue from other sources,
                    which we term poll-tax, or tax on industry.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.5" unit="Loeb chap"/> Of our third kind of
                    administration, that of a free state, the most important revenue is that arising
                    from the special products of the country. Next follows revenue from markets and
                    occupations; and finally that from every-day transactions.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Or (understanding <foreign lang="greek">LEITOURGIW=N</foreign>) "regular public services." </note>
                    <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.6" unit="Loeb chap"/>
                    Fourthly and lastly, we must consider the administration of a private citizen.
                    It is difficult to reduce this to rules owing to the necessary variety of its
                    aims; yet it is the most limited of the four, because both revenues and expenses
                    are &lt;comparatively&gt; small. Taking its revenues in turn, the chief
                    are those from agriculture; next in importance, those from other every-day
                    occupations; while third comes interest on money. Apart from all these, there is
                    a matter common to all kinds of administration which is best considered at this
                    particular point, and deserves more than cursory attention. This is the
                    importance of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenue.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.7" unit="Loeb chap"/> Having thus
                    enumerated the divisions of our subject, we must next consider whether the
                    province or the free state with which we are concerned is able to produce all
                    the forms of revenue we have just detailed<milestone ed="Bekker" n="20" unit="line"/>or at least the chief of them; &lt;and this being
                    known&gt; must make the best use of what we have. Next we must inquire what
                    kinds of revenue, at present wholly lacking, are yet potentially existent; what
                    kinds, though now small, may with care be increased, and how far certain items
                    of present expenditure may without prejudice to the commonwealth be
                        diminished.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="1.8" unit="Loeb chap"/> Having spoken thus of administrations and their various
                    departments, we have further proceeded to collect such instances as we deemed
                    noteworthy of the means adopted by certain statesmen in times past for the
                    replenishment of the treasury, and also of their skill in administration. These
                    anecdotes &lt;which follow&gt;, seemed to us by no means lacking in
                    utility; being capable from time to time of application by others to the
                    business they themselves have in hand.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="2.1" unit="Loeb chap"/> Cypselus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> had made a vow that if he became

                    Corinthians. Accordingly he commanded them to make a return of their
                    possessions; </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1346b"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>which done, he took from each a tenth part, and told them to
                    employ the remainder in trading. A year later, he repeated the process. And so
                    in ten years' time it came to pass that Cypselus received the entire amount
                    which he had dedicated; while the Corinthians on their part had replaced all
                    that they had paid him.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone ed="P" n="2.2" unit="Loeb chap"/> Lygdamis of <placeName key="perseus,Naxos City">Naxos</placeName>, after driving into exile a party of the inhabitants, found

                    to the exiled owners. The exiles had left behind them a number of works of art
                    destined for temple offerings, which lay in certain workshops in an unfinished
                    condition. These Lygdamis proceeded to sell to the exiles and whoso else would
                    buy them; allowing each purchaser to have his name engraved on the

                    their gains. The right of changing money they sold to a single bank, whose

                    arrival, his associates told him what Cleomenes had said. He, desirous of
                    winning their approval as well as that of Cleomenes, debited the latter with the
                    actual price he had given.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At a time when the

                    for the growers and asked them at what price they would contract to supply him
                    with their produce. On their quoting a price lower than what they were charging
                    the merchants, he offered them the full price they were accustomed to receive

                    of the attendant priests, must accordingly be suppressed. The priests, supposing
                    him to be in earnest, and wishing each to secure the continuance of his own

                    Antimenes of Rhodes, who was appointed by Alexander superintendent of highways
                    in the province of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, adopted the
                    following means of raising funds. An ancient law of the country imposed a tax of
                    one-tenth on all imports; but this had fallen into total abeyance. Antimenes
                    kept a watch for all governors and soldiers whose arrival was expected, and upon
                    the many ambassadors and craftsmen who were invited to the city, but brought
                    with them others who dwelt there unofficially; and also upon the multitude of
                    presents that were brought &lt;to these persons&gt; , on which he
                    exacted the legal tax of a tenth.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Another
                    expedient was this. He invited the owners of any slaves in the camp to register
                    them at whatever value they desired, undertaking at the same time to pay him
                    eight drachmae a year. If the slave ran away, the owner was to recover the
                    registered value. </p></div><div type="bekker page" n="1353a"><p><milestone ed="Bekker" n="1" unit="line"/>Many slaves were thus registered, and a large sum of

                    instructed the governor of the &lt;province&gt; where the camp lay

                    to superintend the revenues of the Province of <placeName key="tgn,7001308">Athribis</placeName>. The local governors came to him, and told him they
                    were willing to pay a much larger amount in taxes; but asked him to remove the
                    present superintendent. Ophellas inquired if they were really able to pay what
                    they promised; and on their assuring him that they were, left the superintendent
                    in office and instructed him to demand from them the amount of tax which they
                    themselves had assessed. And so, without being chargeable either with
                    discountenancing the officer he had appointed, or with taxing the governors
                    beyond their own estimate, he obtained from the latter many times his previous

                    Stabelbius, king of the Mysians, lacking pay to give his troops, summoned a
                    meeting of the officers, and declared that he no longer needed the private
                    soldiers, but only the officers. When he required troops, he would entrust a sum
                    of money to each officer and send him to collect mercenaries; but that meanwhile
                    he preferred to give the officers the pay he would otherwise have to give the
                    men. Accordingly he bade each dismiss the men who were on his own muster-roll.
                    The officers, scenting a source of gain for themselves, dismissed their men, as
                    they were bidden. Shortly afterwards, Stabelbius called them together and
                    informed them that a conductor without his chorus and an officer without his men

                    also stripped the images of their golden raiment and garlands, and declaring he
                    would give them lighter and more fragrant wear, arrayed them in robes of white
