    	      Every state is as we see a sort of partnership,<note resp="Rackham">The Greek word had not acquired a specially political connotation as the English word <q rend="single">community</q> has.</note> and every partnership is formed with a view to some good (since all the actions of all mankind are done with a view to what they think to be good). It is therefore evident that, while all partnerships aim at some good the partnership that is the most supreme of all and includes all the others does so most of all, and aims at the most supreme of all goods; and this is the partnership entitled the state, the political association.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Those then who think that the natures of the statesman, the royal ruler, the head of an estate<note resp="Rackham"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκονόμος</foreign> denoting a higher grade than <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσπότης</foreign> is unusual. For their ordinary use see 2.1 fin.</note> and the master of a family are the same, are mistaken (they imagine that the difference between these various forms of authority is one of greater and smaller numbers, not a difference in the kind—that is, that the ruler over a few people is a master, over more the head of an estate, over more still a statesman or royal ruler, as if there were no difference between a large household and a small city; and also as to the statesman and the royal ruler, they think that one who governs as sole head is royal, and one who, while the government follows the principles of the science of royalty, takes turns to govern and be governed is a statesman; but these views are not true). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And a proof that these people are mistaken will appear if we examine the question in accordance with our regular method of investigation. In every other matter it is necessary to analyze the composite whole down to its uncompounded elements (for these are the smallest <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>parts of the whole); so too with the state, by examining the elements of which it is composed we shall better discern in relation to these different kinds of rulers what is the difference between them, and whether it is possible to obtain any scientific precision in regard to the various statements made above.</p>
    	<p rend="align(indent)">In this subject as in others the best method of investigation is to study things in the process of development from the beginning. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>The first coupling together of persons then to which necessity gives rise is that between those who are unable to exist without one another: for instance the union of female and male for the continuance of the species (and this not of deliberate purpose, but with man as with the other animals and with plants there is a natural instinct to desire to leave behind one another being of the same sort as oneself); and the union of natural ruler and natural subject for the sake of security (for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things<note resp="Rackham">A probable emendation gives <q rend="single">that can carry out labor.</q></note> with his body is subject and naturally a slave; so that master and slave have the same interest).</p></div>   
    	  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:1" n="1252b">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1252b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>Thus the female and the slave are by nature distinct (for nature makes nothing as the cutlers make the Delphic knife,<note resp="Rackham">Uncertain: possibly a dagger and a carving-knife in one.</note> in a niggardly way, but one thing for one purpose; for so each tool will be turned out in the finest perfection, if it serves not many uses but one). Yet among barbarians the female and the slave have the same rank; and the cause of this is that barbarians have no class of natural rulers, but with them the conjugal partnership is a partnership of female slave and male slave. Hence the saying of the poets<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Eur. IA 1400">Eur. IA 1400</bibl>.</note>— <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="iambic">’Tis meet that Greeks should rule barbarians,—</l> </quote> implying that barbarian and slave are the same in nature. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>From these two partnerships then is first composed the household, and Hesiod<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hes. WD 405">Hes. WD 405</bibl>.</note> was right when he wrote <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">First and foremost a house and a wife and an ox for the ploughing—</l> </quote> for the ox serves instead of a servant for the poor. The partnership therefore that comes about in the course of nature for everyday purposes is the <q rend="single">house,</q> the persons whom Charondas<note resp="Rackham">A law-giver of <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, 6th century B.C. or earlier.</note> speaks of as <q rend="single">meal-tub-fellows</q> and the Cretan Epimenides<note resp="Rackham">A poet and prophet invited to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> <date when="-0596">596</date> B.C. to purify it of plague.</note> as <q rend="single">manger-fellows.</q><note resp="Rackham">The variant reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοκάπνους</foreign>, <q rend="single">smoke-sharers,</q> seems to mean <q rend="single">hearth-fellows.</q></note> </p>
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>On the other hand the primary partnership made up of several households for the satisfaction of not mere daily needs is the village. The village according to the most natural account seems to be a colony from<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">consists of colonies from.</q></note> a household, formed of those whom some people speak of as <q rend="single">fellow-sucklings,</q> sons and sons’ sons.<note resp="Rackham">The words <q rend="single">sons and sons’ sons</q> are probably an interpolated note.</note> It is owing to this that our cities were at first under royal sway and that foreign races are so still,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they were made up of parts that were under royal rule; for every household is under the royal rule of its eldest member, so that the colonies from the household were so too, because of the kinship of their members. And this is what Homer<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.114">Hom. Od. 9.114 f.</bibl> on the Cyclopes.</note> means: <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">And each one giveth law</l> <l>To sons and eke to spouses—</l> </quote> for his Cyclopes live in scattered families; and that is the way in which people used to live in early times. Also this explains why all races speak of the gods as ruled by a king, because they themselves too are some of them actually now so ruled and in other cases used to be of old; and as men imagine the gods in human form, so also they suppose their manner of life to be like their own.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>The partnership finally composed of several villages is the city-state; it has at last attained the limit of virtually complete self-sufficiency, and thus, while it comes into existence for the sake of life, it exists for the good life. Hence every city-state exists by nature, inasmuch as the first partnerships so exist; for the city-state is the end of the other partnerships, and nature is an end, since that which each thing is when its growth is completed we speak of as being the nature of each thing, for instance of a man, a horse, a household. Again, the object for which a thing exists, its end, is its chief good; </p></div>
    	  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:1" n="1253a">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1253a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and self-sufficiency is an end, and a chief good. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> From these things therefore it is clear that the city-state is a natural growth, and that man is by nature a political animal, and a man that is by nature and not merely by fortune citiless is either low in the scale of humanity or above it (like the <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">clanless, lawless, hearthless</l> </quote> man reviled by Homer,<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.63">Hom. Il. 9.63</bibl>; the passage goes on: <quote xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν ἐκεῖνος | ὃς πολέμου ἔραται</quote>.</note> for one by nature unsocial is also <q rend="single">a lover of war</q>) inasmuch as he is solitary, like an isolated piece at draughts.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>And why man is a political animal in a greater measure than any bee or any gregarious animal is clear. For nature, as we declare, does nothing without purpose; and man alone of the animals possesses speech. The mere voice, it is true, can indicate pain and pleasure, and therefore is possessed by the other animals as well (for their nature has been developed so far as to have sensations of what is painful and pleasant and to indicate those sensations to one another), but speech is designed to indicate the advantageous and the harmful, and therefore also the right and the wrong; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>for it is the special property of man in distinction from the other animals that he alone has perception of good and bad and right and wrong and the other moral qualities, and it is partnership in these things that makes a household and a city-state.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Thus also the city-state is prior in nature to the household and to each of us individually.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For the whole must necessarily be prior to the part; since when the whole body is destroyed, foot or hand will not exist except in an equivocal sense, like the sense in which one speaks of a hand sculptured in stone as a hand; because a hand in those circumstances will be a hand spoiled, and all things are defined by their function and capacity, so that when they are no longer such as to perform their function they must not be said to be the same things, but to bear their names in an equivocal sense. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>It is clear therefore that the state is also prior by nature to the individual; for if each individual when separate is not self-sufficient, he must be related to the whole state as other parts are to their whole, while a man who is incapable of entering into partnership, or who is so self-sufficing that he has no need to do so, is no part of a state, so that he must be either a lower animal or a god.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Therefore the impulse to form a partnership of this kind is present in all men by nature; but the man who first united people in such a partnership was the greatest of benefactors. For as man is the best of the animals when perfected, so he is the worst of all when sundered from law and justice. For unrighteousness is most pernicious when possessed of weapons, and man is born possessing weapons for the use of wisdom and virtue, which it is possible to employ entirely for the opposite ends. Hence when devoid of virtue man is the most unholy and savage of animals, and the worst in regard to sexual indulgence and gluttony. Justice on the other hand is an element of the state; for judicial procedure, which means the decision of what is just, is the regulation of the political partnership.</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1253b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>  	    
  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>And now that it is clear what are the component parts of the state, we have first of all to discuss household management; for every state is composed of households. Household management falls into departments corresponding to the parts of which the household in its turn is composed; and the household in its perfect form consists of slaves and freemen. The investigation of everything should begin with its smallest parts, and the primary and smallest parts of the household are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children; we ought therefore to examine the proper constitution and character of each of these three relationships, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> I mean that of mastership, that of marriage<note resp="Rackham">The Greek word properly denotes the marriage ceremony, not the married state.</note> (there is no exact term denoting the relation uniting wife and husband), and thirdly the progenitive relationship (this too has not been designated by a special name). Let us then accept these three relationships that we have mentioned. There is also a department which some people consider the same as household management and others the most important part of it, and the true position of which we shall have to consider: I mean what is called the art of getting wealth.<note resp="Rackham">No English word covers all the associations of the Greek, which means <q rend="single">dealing in <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρήματα</foreign>,</q> <q rend="single">things,</q>—goods, property, money—and so <q rend="single">business.</q></note></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Let us begin by discussing the relation of master and slave, in order to observe the facts that have a bearing on practical utility, and also in the hope that we may be able to obtain something better than the notions at present entertained, with a view to a theoretic knowledge of the subject. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> For some thinkers hold the function of the master to be a definite science, and moreover think that household management, mastership, statesmanship and monarchy are the same thing,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as we said at the beginning of the treatise; others however maintain that for one man to be another man’s master is contrary to nature, because it is only convention that makes the one a slave and the other a freeman and there is no difference between them by nature, and that therefore it is unjust, for it is based on force.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Since therefore property is a part of a household and the art of acquiring property a part of household management (for without the necessaries even life, as well as the good life,<note resp="Rackham"><q rend="single">As well as the good life</q> is probably an interpolation.</note> is impossible), <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> and since, just as for the particular arts it would be necessary for the proper tools to be forthcoming if their work is to be accomplished, so also the manager of a household must have his tools, and of tools some are lifeless and others living (for example, for a helmsman the rudder is a lifeless tool and the look-out man a live tool—for an assistant in the arts belongs to the class of tools), so also an article of property is a tool for the purpose of life, and property generally is a collection of tools, and a slave is a live article of property. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And every assistant is as it were a tool that serves for several tools; for if every tool could perform its own work when ordered, or by seeing what to do in advance, like the statues of Daedalus in the story,<note resp="Rackham">This legendary sculptor first represented the eyes as open and the limbs as in motion, so his statues had to be chained to prevent them from running away (<bibl n="Plat. Meno 97d">Plat. Meno 97d</bibl>).</note> or the tripods of Hephaestus which the poet says <q rend="single">enter self-moved the company divine,</q><note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.369">Hom. Il. 18.369</bibl> </note>—if thus shuttles wove and quills played harps of themselves, master-craftsmen would have no need of assistants and masters no need of slaves. </p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:1" n="1254a">
<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1254a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Now the tools mentioned are instruments of production, whereas an article of property is an instrument of action<note resp="Rackham">i.e. with it we do not <emph>make</emph> something but <emph>do</emph> something (e.g. wear a dress, lie in a bed).</note>; for from a shuttle we get something else beside the mere use of the shuttle, but from a garment or a bed we get only their use. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And also inasmuch as there is a difference in kind between production and action, and both need tools, it follows that those tools also must possess the same difference. But life is doing things, not making things; hence the slave is an assistant in the class of instruments of action.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">And the term <q rend="single">article of property</q> is used in the same way as the term <q rend="single">part</q>: a thing that is a part is not only a part of another thing but absolutely belongs to another thing, and so also does an article of property. Hence whereas the master is merely the slave’s master and does not belong to the slave, the slave is not merely the slave of the master but wholly belongs to the master.</p> 
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>These considerations therefore make clear the nature of the slave and his essential quality: one who is a human being belonging by nature not to himself but to another is by nature a slave, and a person is a human being belonging to another if being a man he is an article of property, and an article of property is an instrument for action separable from its owner. But we must next consider whether or not anyone exists who is by nature of this character, and whether it is advantageous and just for anyone to be a slave, or whether on the contrary all slavery is against nature. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  And it is not difficult either to discern the answer by theory or to learn it empirically. Authority and subordination are conditions not only inevitable but also expedient; in some cases things are marked out from the moment of birth to rule or to be ruled. And there are many varieties both of rulers and of subjects (and the higher the type of the subjects, the loftier is the nature of the authority exercised over them, for example to control a human being is a higher thing than to tame a wild beast; for the higher the type of the parties to the performance of a function, the higher is the function, and when one party rules and another is ruled, there is a function performed between them)—<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> because in every composite thing, where a plurality of parts, whether continuous or discrete, is combined to make a single common whole, there is always found a ruling and a subject factor, and this characteristic of living things is present in them as an outcome of the whole of nature, since even in things that do not partake of life there is a ruling principle, as in the case of a musical scale.<note resp="Rackham">Each <q rend="single">mode</q> (Dorian, the modern minor scale, Phrygian and Lydian, two forms of major) was ruled by its key-note.</note> However, this matter perhaps belongs to an investigation lying somewhat outside our subject. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> But in the first place an animal consists of soul and body, of which the former is by nature the ruling and the latter the subject factor. And to discover what is natural we must study it preferably in things that are in a natural state, and not in specimens that are degenerate. Hence in studying man we must consider a man that is in the best possible condition in regard to both body and soul, and in him the principle stated will clearly appear,—</p></div>
    	  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:1" n="1254b">
<p><milestone n="1254b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> since in those that are bad or in a bad condition it might be thought that the body often rules the soul because of its vicious and unnatural condition. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> But to resume—it is in a living creature, as we say, that it is first possible to discern the rule both of master and of statesman the soul rules the body with the sway of a master, the intelligence rules the appetites with that of a statesman or a king and in these examples it is manifest that it is natural and expedient for the body to be governed by the soul and for the emotional part to be governed by the intellect, the part possessing reason, whereas for the two parties to be on an equal footing or in the contrary positions is harmful in all cases. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> Again, the same holds good between man and the other animals: tame animals are superior in their nature to wild animals, yet for all the former it is advantageous to be ruled by man, since this gives them security. Again, as between the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject. And the same must also necessarily apply in the case of mankind as a whole; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> therefore all men that differ as widely as the soul does from the body and the human being from the lower animal （and this is the condition of those whose function is the use of the body and from whom this is the best that is forthcoming） these are by nature slaves, for whom to be governed by this kind of authority <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> is advantageous, inasmuch as it is advantageous to the subject things already mentioned. For he is by nature a slave who is capable of belonging to another （and that is why he does so belong）, and who participates in reason so far as to apprehend it but not to possess it; for the animals other than man are subservient not to reason, by apprehending it, but to feelings. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> And also the usefulness of slaves diverges little from that of animals; bodily service for the necessities of life is forthcoming from both, from slaves and from domestic animals alike. The intention of nature therefore is to make the bodies also of freemen and of slaves different—the latter strong for necessary service, the former erect and unserviceable for such occupations, but serviceable for a life of citizenship （and that again divides into the employments of war and those of peace）; but as a matter of fact often the very opposite comes about—some persons have the bodies of free men and others the souls; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/> since this is certainly clear, that if persons were born as distinguished only in body as are the statues of the gods, everyone would say that those who were inferior deserved to be these men’s slaves. And if this is true in the case of the body, there is far juster reason for this rule being laid down in the case of the soul; but beauty of soul is not so easy to see as beauty of body.</p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1255a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>It is manifest therefore that there are cases of people of whom some are freemen and the others slaves by nature, and for these slavery is an institution both expedient and just.</p> 
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/>But at the same time it is not difficult to see that those who assert the opposite are also right in a manner. The fact is that the terms <q rend="single">slavery</q> and <q rend="single">slave</q> are ambiguous; for there is also such a thing as a slave or a man that is in slavery by law, for the law is a sort of agreement under which the things conquered in war are said to belong to their conquerors. Now this conventional right is arraigned by many jurists just as a statesman is impeached for proposing an unconstitutional measure; they say that it is monstrous if the person powerful enough to use force, and superior in power, is to have the victim of his force as his slave and subject; and even among the learned some hold this view, though others hold the other. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> But the reason of this dispute and what makes the theories overlap is the fact that in a certain manner virtue when it obtains resources has in fact very great power to use force, and the stronger party always possesses superiority in something that is good,<note resp="Rackham">The difficulty turns on the ambiguity of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</foreign>, (a) moral goodness, virtue, (b) goodness of any kind, e.g. strength.</note> so that it is thought that force cannot be devoid of goodness, but that the dispute is merely about the justice of the matter (for it is due to the one party holding that the justification of authority is good-will, while the other identifies justice with the mere rule of the stronger); because obviously if these theories be separated apart,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the other theories have no force or plausibility at all, implying that the superior in goodness has no claim to rule and be master. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/> But some persons, simply clinging, as they think, to principle of justice (for the law is a principle of justice), assert that the enslavement of prisoners of war is just; yet at the same time they deny the assertion, for there is the possibility that wars may be unjust in their origin and one would by no means admit that a man that does not deserve slavery can be really a slave—otherwise we shall have the result that persons reputed of the highest nobility are slaves and the descendants of slaves if they happen to be taken prisoners of war and sold. Therefore they do not mean to assert that Greeks themselves if taken prisoners are slaves, but that barbarians are. Yet when they say this, they are merely seeking for the principles of natural slavery of which we spoke at the outset; for they are compelled to say that there exist certain persons who are essentially slaves everywhere and certain others who are so nowhere.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_19"/> And the same applies also about nobility: our nobles consider themselves noble not only in their own country but everywhere, but they think that barbarian noblemen are only noble in their own country—which implies that there are two kinds of nobility and of freedom, one absolute and the other relative, as Helen says in Theodectes<note resp="Rackham">A tragic poet, a friend of Aristotle.</note>: <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="iambic">But who would dare to call me menial,</l> <l>The scion of a twofold stock divine?</l> </quote> Yet in so speaking they make nothing but virtue and vice the distinction between slave and free, the noble and the base-born;</p></div>

<p rend="align(indent)">It is clear therefore that there is some reason for this dispute, and that in some instances it is not the case that one set are slaves and the other freemen by nature; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_20"/> and also that in some instances such a distinction does exist, when slavery for the one and mastership for the other are advantageous and just, and it is proper for the one party to be governed and for the other to govern by the form of government for which they are by nature fitted, and therefore by the exercise of mastership, while to govern badly is to govern disadvantageously for both parties (for the same thing is advantageous for a part and for the whole body or the whole soul, and the slave is a part of the master—he is, as it were, a part of the body, alive but yet separated from it; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_21"/> hence there is a certain community of interest and friendship between slave and master in cases when they have been qualified by nature for those positions, although when they do not hold them in that way but by law and by constraint of force the opposite is the case).</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">And even from these considerations it is clear that the authority of a master over slaves is not the same as the authority of a magistrate in a republic, nor are all forms of government the same, as some assert. Republican government controls men who are by nature free, the master’s authority men who are by nature slaves; and the government of a household is monarchy (since every house is governed by a single ruler),<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whereas statesmanship is the government of men free and equal. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/> The term <q rend="single">master</q> therefore denotes the possession not of a certain branch of knowledge but of a certain character, and similarly also the terms <q rend="single">slave</q> and <q rend="single">freeman.</q> Yet there might be a science of mastership and a slave’s science—the latter being the sort of knowledge that used to be imparted by the professor at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> (for there used to be a man there who for a fee gave lessons to servants in their ordinary duties); and indeed there might be more advanced scientific study of such matters, for instance a science of cookery and the other such kinds of domestic service—for different servants have different functions, some more honorable and some more menial, and as the proverb says, <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="iambic">Slave before slave and master before master.<note resp="Rackham">Probably from a comedy of Aristotle’s contemporary Philemon.</note> </l> </quote> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/> The slave’s sciences then are all the various branches of domestic work; the master’s science is the science of employing slaves—for the master’s function consists not in acquiring slaves but in employing them. This science however is one of no particular importance or dignity: the master must know how to direct the tasks which the slave must know how to execute. Therefore all people rich enough to be able to avoid personal trouble have a steward who takes this office, while they themselves engage in politics or philosophy. The science of acquiring slaves is different both from their ownership and their direction—that is, the just acquiring of slaves, which is akin to the art of war or that of the chase. Let this then stand as our definition of slave and master.</p></div>

In the first place therefore one might raise the question whether the art of getting wealth is the same as that of household management, or a part of it, or subsidiary to it; and if subsidiary, whether it is so in the sense in which the art of making shuttles is subsidiary to the art of weaving or in that in which the art of casting bronze is subsidiary to the making of statues (for the two are not subsidiary in the same way, but shuttle-making supplies tools whereas bronze-founding supplies material—and by material I mean the substance out of which certain work is produced, for example fleeces are material for a weaver and bronze for a statuary).</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Now it is clear that wealth-getting is not the same art as household management, for the function of the former is to provide and that of the latter to use—for what will be the art that will use the contents of the house if not the art of household management? but whether wealth-getting is a part of the art of household management, or a different sort of science, is open to debate. For if it is the function of the getter of wealth to study the source from which money and property are to be procured, . . .<note resp="Rackham">Some words seem to have fallen out in the Greek.</note> But property and riches comprise many divisions; hence first of all is husbandry a division of the household art, or is it a different kind of science? and so in general of the superintendence and acquisition of articles of food.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> But furthermore, there are many sorts of food,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>owing to which both animals and men have many modes of life; for it is impossible to live without food, so that the differences of food have made the lives of animals different. Among wild animals some are nomadic and others solitary, according to whichever habit is advantageous for their supply of food, because some of them are carnivorous, others graminivorous, and others eat all kinds of food; so that nature has differentiated their modes of life to suit their facilities and their predilection for those articles of food. And as different kinds of animals by nature relish different sorts of food, and not each kind the same, even within the classes of carnivorous and graminivorous animals their modes of life differ from one another. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> And similarly in the human race also, for there are wide differences of life among mankind. The idlest men are nomads (for to procure food from domesticated animals involves no toil or industry, but as it is necessary for the herds to move from place to place because of the pastures, the people themselves are forced to follow along with them, as though they were farming a live farm). Other men live from hunting, and different people from different kinds of hunting, for instance some from brigandage,<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps <q rend="single">slave-raiding,</q> cf. 3.9, the appropriation of the <q rend="single">live tools</q> that are a part of nature’s supplies; but <bibl n="Thuc. 1.5">Thuc. 1.5</bibl> speaks of brigandage and piracy as common in earlier times, and as still deemed respectable professions in Northern Greece.</note> others from fishing—these are those that dwell on the banks of lakes, marshes and rivers or of a sea suitable for fishing,—and others live on wild birds and animals. But the largest class of men live from the land and the fruits of cultivation. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> This then virtually completes the list of the various modes of life, those at least that have their industry sprung from themselves and do not procure their food by barter and trade—</p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1256b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the lives of the herdsman, the brigand, the fisherman, the hunter, the husband-man. Others also live pleasantly by combining some of these pursuits, supplementing the more deficient life where it happens to fall short in regard to being self-sufficing: for instance, some combine a pastoral life and brigandage, others husbandry and hunting, and similarly with the others—they pass their time in such a combination of pursuits as their need compels. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Property of this sort then seems to be bestowed by nature herself upon all, as immediately upon their first coming into existence, so also when they have reached maturity. For even at the original coming into existence of the young some kinds of animals bring forth with them at birth enough sustenance to suffice until the offspring can provide for itself, for example all the species that bear their young in the form of larvae or in eggs. The viviparous species have sustenance for their offspring inside themselves for a certain period, the substance called milk. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> So that clearly we must suppose that nature also provides for them in a similar way when grown up, and that plants exist for the sake of animals and the other animals for the good of man, the domestic species both for his service and for his food, and if not all at all events most of the wild ones for the sake of his food and of his supplies of other kinds, in order that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they may furnish him both with clothing and with other appliances. If therefore nature makes nothing without purpose or in vain, it follows that nature has made all the animals for the sake of men. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>Hence even the art of war will by nature be in a manner an art of acquisition (for the art of hunting is a part of it) that is properly employed both against wild animals and against such of mankind as though designed by nature for subjection refuse to submit to it, inasmuch as this warfare is by nature just.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">One kind of acquisition therefore in the order of nature is a part of the household art,<note resp="Rackham">Rassow would transpose the clause (with a slight alteration) to give <q rend="single">of the household art, that is, the acquisition of those goods capable of accumulation that are necessary for life and useful for the community of city and household, a supply of which must be forthcoming or else the art must procure it to be forthcoming.</q></note> in accordance with which either there must be forthcoming or else that art must procure to be forthcoming a supply of those goods, capable of accumulation, which are necessary for life and useful for the community of city or household.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> And it is of these goods that riches in the true sense at all events seem to consist. For the amount of such property sufficient in itself for a good life is not unlimited, as Solon <note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Sol. Fr. 13.71">Solon 13.71</bibl>.</note> says that it is in the verse <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">But of riches no bound has been fixed or revealed to men;</l> </quote> for a limit has been fixed, as with the other arts, since no tool belonging to any art is without a limit whether in number or in size, and riches are a collection of tools for the householder and the statesman. Therefore that there is a certain art of acquisition belonging in the order of nature to householders and to statesmen, and for what reason this is so, is clear.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>But there is another kind of acquisition that is specially called wealth-getting, and that is so called with justice and to this kind it is due that there is thought to be no limit to riches and property.</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:1" n="1257a">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1257a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Owing to its affinity to the art of acquisition of which we spoke, it is supposed by many people to be one and the same as that; and as a matter of fact, while it is not the same as the acquisition spoken of, it is not far removed from it. One of them is natural, the other is not natural, but carried on rather by means of a certain acquired skill or art. We may take our starting-point for its study from the following consideration: <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> with every article of property there is a double way of using it; both uses are related to the article itself, but not related to it in the same manner—one is peculiar to the thing and the other is not peculiar to it. Take for example a shoe—there is its wear as a shoe and there is its use as an article of exchange; for both are ways of using a shoe, inasmuch as even he that barters a shoe for money or food with the customer that wants a shoe uses it as a shoe, though not for the use peculiar to a shoe, since shoes have not come into existence for the purpose of barter. And the same also holds good about the other articles of property; for all of them have an art of exchange related to them, which began in the first instance from the natural order of things, because men had more than enough of some things and less than enough of others. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> This consideration also shows that the art of trade is not by nature a part of the art of wealth-getting<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps Aristotle wrote <q rend="single">of the art of exchange</q>: Bernays suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταβλητικῆς</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστικῆς</foreign>.</note>; for the practice of barter was necessary only so far as to satisfy men’s own needs. In the primary<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>association therefore (I mean the household) there is no function for trade, but it only arises after the association has become more numerous. For the members of the primitive household used to share commodities that were all their own, whereas on the contrary a group divided into several households participated also in a number of commodities belonging to their neighbors, according to their needs for which they were forced to make their interchanges by way of barter, as also many barbarian tribes do still; for such tribes do not go beyond exchanging actual commodities for actual commodities, for example giving and taking wine for corn, and so with the various other things of the sort. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> Exchange on these lines therefore is not contrary to nature, nor is it any branch of the art of wealth-getting, for it existed for the replenishment of natural self-sufficiency; yet out of it the art of business in due course arose. For when they had come to supply themselves more from abroad by importing things in which they were deficient and exporting those of which they had a surplus, the employment of money necessarily came to be devised. For the natural necessaries are not in every case readily portable; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> hence for the purpose of barter men made a mutual compact to give and accept some substance of such a sort as being itself a useful commodity was easy to handle in use for general life, iron for instance, silver and other metals, at the first stage defined merely by size and weight, but finally also by impressing on it a stamp in order that this might relieve them of having to measure it; for the stamp was put on as a token of the amount.</p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1257b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/> So when currency had been now invented as an outcome of the necessary interchange of goods, there came into existence the other form of wealth-getting, trade, which at first no doubt went on in a simple form, but later became more highly organized as experience discovered the sources and methods of exchange that would cause most profit. Hence arises the idea that the art of wealth-getting deals specially with money, and that its function is to be able to discern from what source a large supply can be procured, as this art is supposed to be creative of riches and wealth; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/> indeed riches are often assumed to consist of a quantity of money, because money is the thing with which the art of business and of trade deals. But at other times, on the contrary, it is thought that money is nonsense, and nothing by nature but entirely a convention, because when those who use it have changed the currency it is worth nothing, and because it is of no use for any of the necessary needs of life and a man well supplied with money may often<note resp="Rackham">e.g. on a desert island.</note> be destitute of the bare necessities of subsistence, yet it is anomalous that wealth should be of such a kind that a man may be well supplied with it and yet die of hunger, like the famous Midas in the legend, when owing to the insatiable covetousness of his prayer all the viands served up to him turned into gold. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> Hence people seek for a different definition of riches and the art of getting wealth, and rightly; for natural wealth-getting and natural riches are different:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>natural wealth-getting belongs to household management, whereas the other kind belongs to trade, producing goods not in every way but only by the method of exchanging goods. It is this art of wealth-getting that is thought to be concerned with money, for money is the first principle and limit of commerce. And these riches, that are derived from this art of wealth-getting, are truly unlimited<note resp="Rackham">i.e. a trader cannot get too much of his goods, any more than a doctor can make his patient too healthy.</note>; for just as the art of medicine is without limit in respect of health, and each of the arts is without limit in respect of its end (for they desire to produce that in the highest degree possible), whereas they are not without limit as regards the means to their end (for with all of them the end is a limit to the means), so also this wealth-getting has no limit in respect of its end, and its end is riches and the acquisition of goods in the commercial sense.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/>  But the household branch of wealth-getting has a limit, since the acquisition of commercial riches is not the function of household management. Hence from this point of view it appears necessary that there should be a limit to all riches, yet in actual fact we observe that the opposite takes place; for all men engaged in wealth-getting try to increase their money to an unlimited amount. The reason of this is the close affinity of the two branches of the art of business. Their common ground is that the thing that each makes use of is the same; they use the same property, although not in the same way—the one has another end in view, the aim of the other is the increase of the property. Consequently some people suppose that it is the function of household management to increase property, and they are continually under the idea that it is their duty to be either safeguarding their substance in money or increasing it to an unlimited amount. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_19"/> The cause of this state of mind is that their interests are set upon life but not upon the good life; </p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1258a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as therefore the desire for life is unlimited, they also desire without limit the means productive of life. And even those who fix their aim on the good life seek the good life as measured by bodily enjoyments, so that inasmuch as this also seems to be found in the possession of property, all their energies are occupied in the business of getting wealth; and owing to this the second kind of the art of wealth-getting has arisen. For as their enjoyment is in excess, they try to discover the art that is productive of enjoyable excess; and if they cannot procure it by the art of wealth-getting, they try to do so by some other means, employing each of the faculties in an unnatural way.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_20"/> For it is not the function of courage to produce wealth, but to inspire daring; nor is it the function of the military art nor of the medical art, but it belongs to the former to bring victory and to the latter to cause health. Yet these people make all these faculties means for the business of providing wealth, in the belief that wealth is the end and that everything must be directed to the end.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">We have therefore discussed both the unnecessary branch of wealth-getting, defining it and also explaining the cause why we require it, and the necessary branch, showing that this branch which has to do with food is different from the unnecessary branch and is by nature a part of household management, not being like that branch unlimited but having a limit.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_21"/> And we can also see the answer to the question raised at the beginning,<note resp="Rackham">See 3.1.</note> whether<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the art of wealth-getting belongs to the householder and the statesman, or whether on the contrary supplies ought to be provided already (for just as statesmanship does not create human beings but having received them from nature makes use of them, so also it is necessary for nature to bestow food by bestowing land or sea or something else), and the task of the householder is, starting with these supplies given, to dispose of them in the proper way. For it does not belong to the art of weaving to make fleeces, but to use them, and also to know what sort of fleece is good and suitable or bad and unsuitable.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/> Otherwise the question might be raised, why the getting of wealth is a part of the household art whereas the art of medicine is not a part of it, although the members of the household ought to be healthy, just as they must be alive or fulfil any of the other essential conditions. But inasmuch as although in a way it does belong to the householder and the ruler to see even to health, yet in a way it does not belong to them but to the physician, so also with regard to wealth, although in a way it is the affair of the house-holder, in a way it is not, but is a matter for the subsidiary art. But best of all, as has been said before, this provision ought to be made in advance by nature. For it is the work of nature to supply nourishment for her offspring, since every creature has for nourishment the residue of the substance from which it springs.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. animals are made of earth and water and live on the products of earth and water.</note> Hence the business of drawing provision from the fruits of the soil and from animals is natural to all.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/>But, as we said, this art is twofold, one branch being of the nature of trade while the other belongs to the household art; and the latter branch is necessary and in good esteem, </p></div>

<p>but the branch connected with exchange is justly discredited <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1258b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for it is not in accordance with nature, but involves men’s taking things from one another). As this is so, usury is most reasonably hated, because its gain comes from money itself and not from that for the sake of which money was invented. For money was brought into existence for the purpose of exchange, but interest increases the amount of the money itself (and this is the actual origin of the Greek word: offspring resembles parent, and interest is money born of money); consequently this form of the business of getting wealth is of all forms the most contrary to nature.</p>

The practically useful branches of the art of wealth-getting are first, an expert knowledge of stock, what breeds are most profitable and in what localities and under what conditions, for instance what particular stock in horses or cattle or sheep, and similarly of the other animals also (for the farmer must be an expert as to which of these animals are most profitable compared with one another, and also as to what breeds are most profitable on what sorts of land, since different breeds flourish in different places); secondly, the subject of agriculture, and this again is divided into corn-growing and fruit-farming; also bee-keeping, and the breeding of the other creatures finned and feathered<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which can be used to furnish supplies. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> These then are the branches and primary parts of wealth-getting in the most proper sense. Of the kind that deals with exchange, the largest branch is commerce (which has three departments, ship-owning, transport and marketing: these departments differ from each other in the fact that some are safer and others carry larger profits); the second branch is money-lending, and the third labor for hire, one department of which is that of the mechanic<note resp="Rackham"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάναυσος</foreign>(said to be from <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαῦνος</foreign> <q rend="single">furnace,</q> <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὔω</foreign> <q rend="single">to dry</q>), <q rend="single">artisan</q> (ranged with farmers, traders, and laborers, as forming the common people 1321a 6); it acquires the senses of <q rend="single">cramped in body</q> (1341a 7) and <q rend="single">vulgar in taste</q> (1337b 8).</note> arts and the other that of unskilled laborers who are useful only for bodily service. And there is a third form of wealth-getting that lies between the latter and the one placed first, since it possesses mediate an element both of natural wealth-getting and of the sort that employs exchange; it deals with all the commodities that are obtained from the earth and from those fruitless but useful things that come from the earth—examples are the felling of timber<note resp="Rackham">a very probable variant gives <q rend="single">the quarrying of stone.</q></note> and all sorts of mining; and of mining itself there are many classes, since there are many sorts of metals obtained out of the earth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> The<note resp="Rackham">In the mss. this sentence follows the next one.</note> most scientific of these industries are those which involve the smallest element of chance, the most mechanic those in which the operatives undergo the greatest amount of bodily degradation, the most servile those in which the most uses are made of the body, and the most ignoble those in which there is the least requirement of virtue as an accessory. But while we have even now given a general description of these various branches, yet a detailed and particular account of them, though useful for the practice of the industries, would be illiberal as a subject of prolonged study. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> There are books on these subjects by certain authors, </p></div>

It is true that in most cases of republican government the ruler and the ruled interchange in turn (for they tend to be on in equal level in their nature and to have no difference at all), although nevertheless during the period when one is ruler and the other ruled they seek to have a distinction by means of insignia and titles and honors, just as Amasis made his speech about the foot-bath<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hdt. 1.172">Hdt. 1.172</bibl>. Amasis king of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> was despised by his subjects for his low birth, so he had a statue made out of a gold foot-bath and set it up for them to worship, afterwards explaining to them its lowly origin.</note>; but the male stands in this relationship to the female continuously. The rule of the father over the children on the other hand is that of a king; for the male parent is the ruler in virtue both of affection and of seniority, which is characteristic of royal government (and therefore Homer<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom.

<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>It is clear then that household management takes more interest in the human members of the household than in its inanimate property, and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the excellence of these than in that of its property, which we style riches, and more in that of its free members than in that of slaves.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)">First of all then as to slaves the difficulty might be raised, does a slave possess any other excellence, besides his merits as a tool and a servant, more valuable than these, for instance temperance, have the courage, justice and any of the other moral virtues, or has he no excellence beside his bodily service? For either way there is difficulty; if slaves do possess moral virtue, wherein will they differ from freemen? or if they do not, this is strange, as they are human beings and participate in reason. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> And nearly the same is the question also raised about the woman and the child: have they too virtues, and ought a woman to be temperate, brave and just, and can a child be intemperate or temperate, or not? This point therefore requires general consideration in relation to natural ruler and subject: is virtue the same for ruler and ruled, or different? If it is proper for both to partake in nobility of character, how could it be proper for the one to rule and the other to be ruled unconditionally? we cannot say that the difference is to be one of degree, for ruling and being ruled differ in kind, and difference of degree is not a difference in kind at all. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>Whereas if on the contrary it is proper for the one to have moral nobility but not for the other, this is surprising.

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1260a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>If intemperate and cowardly he will not perform any of the duties of his position. It is evident therefore that both must possess virtue, but that there are differences in their virtue (as also there are differences between those who are by nature ruled).<note resp="Rackham">This clause seems to have been interpolated; one ms. has a marginal correction, <q rend="single">by nature rulers and ruled.</q></note> And of this we straightway find an indication in connection with the soul; for the soul by nature contains a part that rules and a part that is ruled, to which we assign different virtues, that is, the virtue of the rational and that of the irrational. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> It is clear then that the case is the same also with the other instances of ruler and ruled. Hence there are by nature various classes of rulers and ruled. For the free rules the slave, the male the female, and the man the child in a different way. And all possess the various parts of the soul, but possess them in different ways; for the slave has not got the deliberative part at all, and the female has it, but without full authority, while the child has it, but in an undeveloped form. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> Hence<note resp="Rackham">In the mss. this sentence follows the next one, <q rend="single">We must suppose—function,</q> and begins <q rend="single">Hence the ruler must possess <emph>moral</emph> virtue.</q></note> the ruler must possess intellectual virtue in completeness (for any work, taken absolutely, belongs to the master-craftsman, and rational principle is a master-craftsman); while each of the other parties must have that share of this virtue which is appropriate to them. We must suppose therefore that the same necessarily holds good of the moral virtues: all must partake of them, but not in the same way, but in such measure as is proper to each in relation to his own function. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence it is manifest that all the persons mentioned have a moral virtue of their own, and that the temperance of a woman and that of a man are not the same, nor their courage and justice, as Socrates thought,<note resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Meno 74b">Plat. Meno 74bff.</bibl> </note> but the one is the courage of command, and the other that of subordination, and the case is similar with the other virtues. And this is also clear when we examine the matter more in detail, for it is misleading to give a general definition of virtue, as some do, who say that virtue is being in good condition as regards the soul or acting uprightly or the like; those who enumerate the virtues of different persons separately, as Gorgias does,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. in Plato, <title>Meno</title> (see 7 above), where this sophist figures as a character in the dialogue; see also 3.1.9, note.</note> are much more correct than those who define virtue in that way. Hence we must hold that all of these persons have their appropriate virtues, as the poet said of woman: <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="iambic">Silence gives grace to woman<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Soph.

And similarly the slave’s virtue also is in relation to the master.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)">And we laid it down that the slave is serviceable for the mere necessaries of life, so that clearly he needs only a small amount of virtue, in fact just enough to prevent him from failing in his tasks owing to intemperance and cowardice. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> (But the question might be raised, supposing that what has just been said is true, will artisans also need to have virtue? for they frequently fall short in their tasks owing to intemperance. Or is their case entirely different? For the slave is a partner in his master’s life, but the artisan is more remote, and only so much of virtue falls to his share as of slavery<note resp="Rackham">i.e. his excellences as an artisan are the qualities of a subordinate (his virtues as a human being, apart from his trade, are not considered).</note>—</p></div>

Hence those persons are mistaken who deprive the slave of reasoning and tell us to use command only; for admonition is more properly employed with slaves than with children.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">But on these subjects let us conclude our decisions in this manner; while the question of the virtue severally belonging to man and woman and children and father, and of the right and wrong mode of conducting their mutual intercourse and the proper way of pursuing the good mode and avoiding the bad one, are matters that it will be necessary to follow up in the part of our treatise dealing with the various forms of constitution.<note resp="Rackham">As a matter of fact in Books 7, 8 dealing with the best constitution this subject is not reached.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> For since every household is part of a state, and these relationships are part of the household, and the excellence of the part must have regard to that of the whole, it is necessary that the education both of the children and of the women should be carried on with a regard to the form of the constitution, if it makes any difference as regards the goodness of the state for the children and the women to be good.

<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>We must first adopt as a starting-point that which is the natural point of departure for this inquiry. There are three possible systems of property: either all the citizens must own everything in common, or they must own nothing in common, or some things must be common property and others not. To have nothing in common is clearly impossible for the state is essentially a form of community, and to begin with there is bound to be a common locality: a single city occupies a single site, and the single city belongs to its citizens in common. </p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1261a">
 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1261a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But is it better for a city that is to be well ordered to have community in everything which can possibly be made common property, or is it better to have some things in common and others not? For example, it is possible for the citizens to have children, wives and possessions in common with each other, as in Plato’s <title>Republic</title>, in which Socrates says that there must be community of children, women and possessions. Well then, which is preferable, the system that now obtains, or one conforming with the regulation described in the <title>Republic</title> <note resp="Rackham">On the following criticisms see Grote, <title>Plato</title>, 3, pp. 211-233.</note>?</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>Now for all the citizens to have their wives in common involves a variety of difficulties; in particular,<note resp="Rackham">(1) 1.3-7; (2) 1.8-2.11; (3) 2.11-13; also (4) other objections 2.15-16.</note> (1) the object which Socrates advances as the reason why this enactment should be made clearly does not follow from his arguments; also (2) as a means to the end which he asserts should be the fundamental object of the city, the scheme as actually set forth in the dialogue is not practicable; yet (3) how it is to be further worked out has been nowhere definitely stated. I refer to the ideal of the fullest possible unity of the entire state, which Socrates takes as his fundamental principle.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>Yet it is clear that if the process of unification advances beyond a certain point, the city will not be a city at all for a state essentially consists of a multitude of persons, and if its unification is carried beyond a certain point, city will be reduced to family and family to individual,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for we should pronounce the family to be a more complete unity than the city, and the single person than the family; so that even if any lawgiver were able to unify the state, he must not do so, for he will destroy it in the process. And not only does a city consist of a multitude of human beings, it consists of human beings differing in kind. A collection of persons all alike does not constitute a state. For a city is not the same thing as a league; a league is of value by its quantity, even though it is art the same in kind (since the essential object of the league is military strength), just as a weight would be worth more if it weighed more, whereas<note resp="Rackham">In the mss. of the Greek <q rend="single">whereas—kind</q> comes below after <q rend="single">Arcadian.</q></note> components which are to make up a unity must differ in kind <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> (and it is by this characteristic that a city will also surpass a tribe of which the population is not scattered among villages but organized like the Arcadians). Hence reciprocal equality<note resp="Rackham">As the best state consists of different classes, its unity is secured by each citizen giving services to society and receiving in return benefits proportionate to his service. Probably <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἴσον</foreign> is an interpolation (though Newman explains it as <quote rend="single">the reciprocal rendering of an equal amount of dissimilar things</quote>): omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἴσον</foreign>, we render <q rend="single">reciprocity</q> and not <q rend="single">reciprocal equality</q>; cf. <bibl n="Aristot.

For even among the free and equal this principle must necessarily obtain, since all cannot govern at once: they must hold office for a year at a time or by some other arrangement or period; and in this manner it does actually come about that all govern, just as all shoemakers would be also carpenters if the shoemakers and the carpenters kept on changing trades instead of the same persons being shoemakers and carpenters always. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But since such permanence of function is better for the political community also, it is clear that it is better for the same persons to govern always, if possible; and among peoples where it is impossible because all the citizens are equal in their nature, </p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1261b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>yet at the same time it is only just, whether governing is a good thing or a bad, that all should partake in it, and for equals thus to submit to authority in turn imitates their being originally dissimilar<note resp="Rackham">The best form of constitution is where there is a superior class that governs continuously—an aristocracy; so where there are no class-distinctions, the next best thing is for all the citizens to take turns in governing and being governed, those in office for the time being forming a sort of aristocracy. Richards’s alteration of the text gives <q rend="single">to take turns to govern is an imitation of original inequality and class-distinction.</q></note>; for some govern and others are governed by turn, as though becoming other persons; and also similarly when they hold office the holders of different offices are different persons. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> It is clear then from these considerations that it is not an outcome of nature for the state to be a unity in the manner in which certain persons say that it is, and that what has been said to be the greatest good in states really destroys states; yet surely a thing’s particular good acts as its preservative.—Another line of consideration also shows that to seek to unify the state excessively is not beneficial. In point of self-sufficiency the individual is surpassed by the family and the family by the state, and in principle a state is fully realized only when it comes to pass that the community of numbers is self-sufficing; if therefore the more self-sufficing a community is, the more desirable is its condition, then a less degree of unity is more desirable than a greater.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>Again, even granting that it is best for the community to be as complete a unity as possible, complete unity does not seem to be proved by the formula <q rend="single">if all the citizens say <q rend="double">Mine</q> and <q rend="double">Not mine</q> at the same time,</q> which Socrates<note resp="Rackham">The reference is to <bibl n="Plat.

If it means <q rend="single">each severally,</q> very likely this would more fully realize the state of things which Socrates wishes to produce (for in that case every citizen will call the same boy his son and also the same woman his wife, and will speak in the same way of property and indeed of each of the accessories of life) <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> but <emph>ex hypothesi</emph> the citizens, having community of women and children, will not call them <q rend="single">theirs</q> in this sense, but will mean theirs collectively and not severally, and similarly they will call property <q rend="single">theirs</q> meaning the property of them all, not of each of them severally. We see then that the phrase <q rend="single">all say</q> is equivocal (in fact the words <q rend="single">all,</q> <q rend="single">both,</q> <q rend="single">odd,</q> <q rend="single">even,</q> owing to their ambiguity, occasion argumentative quibbling even in philosophical discussions); hence really for all to say the same thing is in one sense admirable, although impracticable, but in another sense is not at all a sign of concord. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> And furthermore, the proposal has another disadvantage. Property that is common to the greatest number of owners receives the least attention; men care most for their private possessions, and for what they own in common less, or only so far as it falls to their own individual share for in addition to the other reasons, they think less of it on the ground that someone else is thinking about it, just as in household service a large number of domestics sometimes give worse attendance than a smaller number. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>And it results in each citizen’s having a thousand sons, and these do not belong to them as individuals but any child is equally the son of anyone,</p></div>

This indeed is said by some of those who write of travels round the world<note resp="Rackham">Books of geography, founded on travellers’ reports—a famous one by Hecataeus, scoffed at by <bibl n="Hdt. 4.36">Hdt. 4.36</bibl>.</note> actually to occur;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they say that some of the people of Upper Libya have their wives in common, yet the children born are divided among them according to their personal resemblances. And there are some females both of the human race and of the other animals, for instance horses and cattle, who have a strong natural tendency to produce off-spring resembling the male parents, as was the case with the mare at <placeName key="perseus,Pharsalos">Pharsalus</placeName> named Honest Lady.<note resp="Rackham">Or possibly <q rend="single">Docile</q> ( Jackson), cf. <bibl n="Xen.

And it is also strange that he deprives them of intercourse for no other reason except because the pleasure is too violent; and that he thinks it makes no difference that the parties are in the one case father or son and in the other case brothers of one another. And it seems that this community of wives and sons is more serviceable for the Farmer class than for the Guardians; </p></div>

For we think that friendship is the greatest of blessings for the state, since it is the best safeguard against revolution, and the unity of the state, which Socrates praises most highly, both appears to be and is said by him to be the effect of friendship, just as we know that Aristophanes<note resp="Rackham">The comic poet, figuring as a character in Plato’s <title>Symposium,</title> see especially <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 192c">Plat. Sym. 192c ff.</bibl>.</note> in the discourses on love describes how the lovers owing to their extreme affection desire to grow together and both become one instead of being two.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> In such a union it would be inevitable that both would be spoiled, or at least one, and in the state friendship would inevitably become watery in consequence of such association, and the expressions <q rend="single">my father</q> and <q rend="single">my son</q> would quite go out. For just as putting a little sugar into a quantity of water makes the mixture imperceptible, so it also must come about that the mutual relationship based on these names must become imperceptible,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since in the republic described by Plato there will be the least possible necessity for people to care for one another as father for sons or as son for father or as brother for brother. For there are two things that most cause men to care for and to love each other, the sense of ownership and the sense of preciousness; and neither motive can be present with the citizens of a state so constituted.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/> Again, as to the transference of some of the children at birth from the Farmers and Artisans to the Guardians<note resp="Rackham">The three classes in Plato’s <title>Republic</title>.</note> and of others from the Guardians to the Farmers and Artisans, there is much confusion as to how it is to be done; and the parents who give the children and the officials who transfer them are bound to know which they give to whom. And again, the things spoken of above are bound to occur even more with these transferred children, such as outrage, love-making and murder; for the children of the Guardians transferred to the other citizens will no longer speak of the Guardians as brothers and children and fathers and mothers, nor yet will those living among the Guardians so speak of the other classes, so as to be careful not to commit any such offence because of their relationship.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Such therefore may be our decision as to community of children and women.</p> 
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>In connection with this we have to consider the due regulation of property in a community that is to have the best political institutions: should property be owned in common or privately? This question might indeed be considered separately from the system laid down by law with regard to the children and the women: </p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1263a"><p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1263a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>I mean, even if there be separate families as is now the case with all nations, is it better for both the ownership and the employment of property to be in common. . . ,<note resp="Rackham">Something has clearly been lost here, signifying <q rend="single">or should there be some limited form of communism?</q></note> for example, should the farms be separate property but the farm-produce be brought into the common stock for consumption (as is the practice with some non-Greek races); or on the contrary should the land be common and farmed in common, but the produce be divided for private use (and this form of communism also is said to prevail among some of the barbarians); or should both farms and produce be common property? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Now if the tillers of the soil be of a different class<note resp="Rackham">i.e. a class of serfs, like the Helots at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note> there might be another and easier system, but if the citizens do the work for themselves, the regulations for the common ownership of property would give more causes for discontent; for if both in the enjoyment of the produce and in the work of production they prove not equal but unequal, complaints are bound to arise between those who enjoy or take much but work little and those who take less but work more.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And in general to live together and share all our human affairs is difficult, and especially to share such things as these. And this is shown in the partnerships of fellow-travellers, for almost the greatest number of them quarrel because they come into collision with one another as a result of ordinary matters and trifles; and also we come into collision most with those of our servants<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whom we employ most often for ordinary attendance.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Community of property therefore involves these and other similar difficulties; and the present system, if further improved by good morals and by the regulation of correct legislation, would be greatly superior. For it will possess the merit of both systems, by which I mean the advantage of property being common and the advantage of its being private. For property ought to be common in a sense but private speaking absolutely. For the superintendence of properties being divided among the owners will not cause these mutual complaints, and will improve the more because each will apply himself to it as to private business of his own; while on the other hand virtue will be exercised to make <q rend="single">friends’ goods common goods,</q> as the proverb<note resp="Rackham">The saying was ascribed to Pythgagoras.</note> goes, for the purpose of use. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Such a system exists even now in outline in some states, showing that it is not impracticable, and especially in the ones that are well-administered parts of it are realized already and parts might be realized; for individuals while owning their property privately put their own possessions at the service of their friends and make use of their friends’ possessions as common property; for instance in <placeName key="tperseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> people use one another’s slaves as virtually their own, as well as horses and hounds, and also use the produce in the fields throughout the country if they need provisions on a journey. It is clear therefore that it is better for possessions to be privately owned, but to make them common property in use; and to train the citizens to this is the special task of the legislator.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And moreover to feel that a thing is one’s private property makes an inexpressibly great difference for pleasure; </p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1263b"> 
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1263b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the universal feeling of love for oneself is surely not purposeless, but a natural instinct. Selfishness on the other hand is justly blamed; but this is not to love oneself but to love oneself more than one ought, just as covetousness means loving money to excess—since some love of self, money and so on is practically universal. Moreover, to bestow favors and assistance on friends or visitors or comrades is a great pleasure, and a condition of this is the private ownership of property.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>These advantages therefore do not come to those who carry the unification of the state too far; and in addition to this they manifestly do away with the practice of two virtues, temperance in relation to women (for it is a noble deed to refrain from one through temperance when she belongs to another) and liberality in relation to possessions (for one will not be able to display liberality nor perform a single liberal action, since the active exercise of liberality takes place in the use of possessions).</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>Such legislation therefore has an attractive appearance, and might be thought to be humane; for he who is told about it welcomes it with gladness, thinking that it will result in a marvellous friendliness of everybody towards everybody, especially when somebody denounces the evils at present existing in states as due to the fact that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>wealth is not owned in common— I mean lawsuits between citizens about breach of contract, and trials for perjury, and the flattery of the rich.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>But the real cause of all these evils is not the absence of communism, but wickedness, since we see far more quarrels occurring among those who own or use property in common than among those who have their estates separate; but we notice that those who quarrel as a result of their partnerships are few when compared with the total number of private owners. And again it is just to state not only all the evils that men will lose by adopting communism, but also all the good things; and life in such circumstances is seen to be utterly impossible.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">The cause of Socrates’ error must be deemed to be that his fundamental assumption was incorrect. It is certain that in a way both the household and the state should be a unit, but they should not be so in every way. For in one way the state as its unification proceeds will cease to be a state, and in another way, though it continues a state, yet by coming near to ceasing to be one it will be a worse state, just as if one turned a harmony into unison or a rhythm into a single foot. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> The proper thing is for the state, while being a multitude, to be made a partnership and a unity by means of education, as has been said before and it is strange that the very philosopher who intends to introduce a system of education and thinks that this will make the city morally good should fancy that he can regulate society by such measures as have been mentioned instead of by manners and culture and laws, just as the legislator introduced community of property in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> by the institution of public messes.  </p></div>
  
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1264a">
   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1264a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And this very point also must not be ignored, that attention must be paid to length of time and to the long period of years, in which it would not have escaped notice if these measures were good ones; for nearly all of them have been discovered already, although some of them have not been collected together and others though brought to knowledge are not put into practice.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> And their value would become most manifest if one could see such a constitution in actual process of formation; for one will only be able to construct Plato’s state by introducing its partitions and dividing up the community into common messes and also into brotherhoods and tribes. So that in the upshot no other regulation will have been enacted except the exemption of the Guardians from the work of agriculture, which is a measure that even now the Spartans attempt to introduce.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">Moreover, the working of the constitution as a whole in regard to the members of the state has also not been described by Socrates, nor is it easy to say what it will be. Yet the general mass of the citizens of the other classes make almost the bulk of the state, and about these no definite regulations are laid down, as to whether the Farmers also are to have their property in common or to hold it in private ownership, and also whether community of wives and children is to apply to them or not.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> For if the Farmers are to have the same complete communism, what will be the difference between them and the Guardian class? or what advantage will they gain by submitting to their government? or what consideration will induce them to submit to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the government, unless the Guardians adopt some clever device like that of the Cretans? These have conceded to their slaves all the same rights as they have themselves except that they are forbidden gymnastic exercises and the possession of arms. But if the family life and property of the Farmers are to be such as they are in other states, what sort of communism will there be? For there will inevitably be two states in one, and these antagonistic to one another. For Socrates makes the Guardians a sort of garrison, while the Farmers, Artisans and other classes are the citizens.<note resp="Rackham">Or (omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνίτας</foreign>) <q rend="single">For Socrates makes one set of men guardians, a sort of garrison, and another set farmers and artisans and citizens of the other sorts.</q></note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> But quarrels and lawsuits and all the other evils which according to Socrates exist in actual states will all be found among his citizens too. Yet he says that owing to their education they will not need many regulations such as city and market by-laws and the other regulations of that sort, although he assigns his education only to the Guardians. Again, he makes the Farmers the masters of the estates, for which they pay rent; but they are likely to be far more unmanageable and rebellious than the classes of helots, serfs and slaves in certain states today.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> However, whether this communism is to be compulsory for the Farmers in the same way as for the Guardians or whether it is not, has as a matter of fact not been definitely stated anywhere, nor is there any information about the connected questions, what are to be the political functions and the education of the lower classes, and the laws affecting them. But it is not easy to discover the answers to these questions, yet the character of the lower classes is of no small importance for the preservation of the community of the Guardians.</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1264b">
 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1264b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But again, if Socrates intends to make the Farmers have their wives in common but their property private, who is to manage the household in the way in which the women’s husbands will carry on the work of the farms? And if the property and the wives of the Farmers are to be common <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/><note resp="Rackham">A passage has been lost here.</note></p>  
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/>It is also strange that Socrates employs the comparison of the lower animals to show that the women are to have the same occupations as the men, considering that animals have no households to manage. Also Socrates’ method of appointing the magistrates is not a safe one. For he makes the same persons hold office always; but this occasions rebellion even among people of no special distinction, much more so then among high-spirited and warlike men. But it is clear that he is compelled to make the same persons govern always, for the god-given admixture of gold in the soul is not bestowed on some at one time and others at another time, but is always in the same men, and Socrates says that at the moment of birth some men receive an admixture of gold and others of silver and those who are to be the Artisans and Farmers an admixture of copper and iron.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/> And again, although he deprives the Guardians of happiness, he says that it is the duty of the law-giver to make the whole city happy. But it is not possible for the whole to be happy unless most or all of its parts, or some of them, possess happiness. For happiness is not a thing of the same sort <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> as being an even number: that may belong to a whole but not to either of its parts, but happiness cannot belong to the whole and not to its parts. But yet, if the Guardians are not happy, what other class is? For clearly the Artisans and the general mass of the vulgar classes are not.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">The Republic discussed by Socrates therefore possesses these difficulties and also others not smaller than these.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_3"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> And almost the same holds good of the <title>Laws</title> also, which was written later, so that it will be advantageous to make some small examination of the constitution described in that book as well. For in the <title>Republic</title> Socrates has laid down details about very few matters—regulations about community of wives and children and about property, and the structure of the constitution (for the mass of the population is divided into two parts, one forming the Farmer class and the other the class that defends the state in war, and there is a third class drawn from these latter that forms the council and governs the state), but about the Farmers and the Artisans, whether they are excluded from government or have some part in it, and whether these classes also are to possess arms and to serve in war with the others or not, on these points Socrates has made no decision, but though he thinks that the women ought to serve in war with the Guardians and share the same education, the rest of the discourse he has filled up with external topics, and about the sort of education which it is proper for the Guardians to have.<note resp="Rackham">The last clause, <q rend="single">and about—to have,</q> has almost certainly been misplaced by a copyist, and should come near the beginning of the sentence, after <q rend="single">about property.</q></note></p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1265a"> 
<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1265a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> But though the <title>Laws</title> consists for the most part of a treatise on law, the author has said a little about the form of the constitution, and in a desire to make this more suitable for adoption by actual states he brings it round by degrees back to the other form, that of the <title>Republic</title>. For except community in wives and property, he assigns all his other regulations in the same form to both states, for he prescribes for both the same scheme of education, and a life detached from menial tasks, and similarly as regards common meals, except that in the state described in the <title>Laws</title> he says there are to be common meals for women also, and he makes the Republic consist of a class possessing arms that numbers a thousand, but the state of the <title>Laws</title> has five thousand.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Now it is true that all the discourses of Socrates possess brilliance, cleverness, originality and keenness of inquiry, but it is no doubt difficult to be right about everything: for instance with regard to the size of population just mentioned it must not be over-looked that a territory as large as that of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> will be needed for so many inhabitants, or some other country of unlimited extent, to support five thousand men in idleness and another swarm of women and servants around them many times as numerous. It is proper no doubt to assume ideal conditions, but not to go beyond all bounds of possibility. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> And it is said that in laying down the laws the legislator must have his attention fixed on two things,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the territory and the population. But also it would be well to add that he must take into account the neighboring regions also, if the city is to live a life of politics<note resp="Rackham">i.e. a life of intercourse with other states, cf. 1327b 5. Some mss. add <q rend="single">not one of isolation</q>; this looks like an explanatory note interpolated.</note> (for it is necessary for it to use for war not only such arms as are serviceable within its own territory but also such as are serviceable against places outside it); and if one does not accept such a description whether for the life of the individual or for the common life of the state, yet it is none the less necessary for the citizens to be formidable to their enemies not only when they have entered the country but also when they have left it.<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">when they are away from it.</q></note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Also the amount of property requires consideration: would it not perhaps be better to define it differently, by a clearer formula? The writer says that it ought to be sufficiently large for the citizens <q rend="single">to live a temperate life</q>—as if one were to say <q rend="single">to live a good life</q>; but really that phrase is too general, since it is possible to live temperately yet miserably. But a better definition would be <q rend="single">to live temperately and liberally</q> (for if the two are separated a liberal mode of life is liable to slip into luxury and a temperate one into a life of hardship), since surely these are the only desirable qualities relating to the use of wealth—for instance you cannot use wealth gently or bravely, but you can use it temperately and liberally, so that it follows that these are qualities that have to do with wealth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And it is also strange that although equalizing properties the writer does not regulate the number of the citizens, but leaves the birth-rate uncontrolled, on the assumption that it will be sufficiently levelled up to the same total owing to childless marriages, however many children are begotten,</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1265b">
<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1265b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because this seems to take place in the states at present. But this ought to be regulated much more in the supposed case than it is now, for now nobody is destitute, because estates are divided among any number, but then, as division of estates will not be allowed, the extra children will necessarily have nothing, whether they are fewer in number or more. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> And one might think that restriction ought to be put on the birth-rate rather than on property, so as not to allow more than a certain number of children to be produced, and that in fixing their number consideration should be paid to the chances of its happening that some of the children born may die, and to the absence of children in the other marriages; but for the matter to be left alone, as it is in most states, is bound to lead to poverty among the citizens, and poverty produces sedition and crime. The Corinthian Phidon<note resp="Rackham">Otherwise unknown.</note> in fact, one of the most ancient lawgivers, thought that the house-holds and the citizen population ought to remain at the same numbers, even though at the outset the estates of all were unequal in size; but in Plato’s <title>Laws</title> the opposite is the case.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the estates are equal, and the number of households fixed, but not the number of citizens.</note> However, we must say later what we think would be a better system in these matters; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> but another question omitted in the <title>Laws</title> is how the rulers will be different from the classes ruled; the writer prescribes<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that the rulers are to stand in the same relation to the ruled as the warp of cloth stands to the woof by being made of different wool.<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Laws 734e">Plat. Laws 734e ff.</bibl> In weaving cloth the warp (the threads set up first) must be of strong wool, the woof (the threads woven across the warp) must be softer.</note> And inasmuch as he allows a man’s total property to be increased up to five times its original value, for what reason should not an increase in his landed estate be allowed up to a certain point? Also it must be considered whether the proposed separation of homesteads is not inexpedient for household economy—for the writer allotted two homesteads separate from one another to each citizen; but it is difficult to manage two households.<note resp="Rackham">The object was to provide a separate establishment for a married son, <bibl n="Plat.

If therefore he introduces this constitution as the one most commonly existing of all forms of constitution in the actual states, he has perhaps made a good proposal, but if he introduces it as the next best to the first form of constitution, it is not a good proposal; for very likely one might approve the Spartan constitution more highly, or perhaps some other form nearer to an aristocracy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> In fact some people assert that the best constitution must be a combination of all the forms of constitution, and therefore praise the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> (for some people say that it consists of oligarchy, monarchy and democracy, meaning that the kingship is monarchy and the rule of the ephors oligarchy, but that an element of democracy is introduced by the rule of the ephors because the ephors come from the common people; while others pronounce the ephorate a tyranny but find an element of democracy in the public mess-tables and in the other regulations of daily life).</p></div>

A better theory therefore is put forward by those who intermingle a larger number of forms, for the constitution composed of a combination of a larger number of forms is better. In the next place, the constitution in the <title>Laws</title> proves as a matter of fact not to contain any element of monarchy at all, but its factors are taken from oligarchy and democracy, and for the most part it tends to incline towards oligarchy. This appears from the regulations for the appointment of the magistrates; for their selection by lot from a list previously elected by vote is a feature common to both oligarchy and democracy, but the compulsion put upon the richer citizens to attend the assembly and vote for magistrates or perform any other political function, while the others are allowed to do as they like, is oligarchical, as is the endeavor to secure that a majority of the magistrates shall be drawn from the wealthy and that the highest offices shall be filled from the highest of the classes assessed by wealth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> But the writer also makes the election of the council oligarchical for everybody is compelled to elect, but from the first property-class, and then again an equal number from the second class, and then from the members of the third class, except that it was not to be compulsory for all to vote for those to be elected from the members of the third or the fourth class, and to elect from the fourth class was only compulsory for the members of the first and second classes; and afterwards from those thus selected he says that they are to appoint<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>an equal number from each class. Thus those who elect the members from the highest property classes will be more numerous and better,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. a better ellective body because representative of all classes.</note> because some of the lower orders will abstain from voting<note resp="Rackham">i.e. from voting for the preliminary list from the third and fourth classes.</note> as it is not compulsory. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> Accordingly that it is not proper to establish a constitution of this character from a blend of democracy and monarchy appears clearly from these considerations, and from what will be said later when our inquiry comes to deal with this class of constitution; also the provision for the election of the rulers from among candidates chosen at a preliminary election is dangerous, for if even a moderate number of people choose to combine into a party, the elections will always go according to their wish.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Such are the points as to the constitution in the <title>Laws.</title></p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_4"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>There are also certain other constitutional schemes, some drawn up by amateurs and others by philosophers and statesmen, but all of them are nearer to those which have been actually established and by which states are governed at present than are both of those which have been considered; for nobody else has introduced the innovation of community of children and women, nor that of public meals for the women, but they start rather with the necessary reforms. For some persons think that the right regulation of property is the most important; for the question of property, they say, is universally the cause of party strife. Therefore the Chalcedonian Phaleas<note resp="Rackham">Otherwise unknown.</note> was the first who introduced this expedient;</p></div>

   <p><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> for he says that the citizens’ estates ought to be equal  <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1266b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and he thought that this would not be difficult to secure at the outset for cities in process of foundation, while in those already settled, although it would be a more irksome task, nevertheless a levelling would most easily be effected by the rich giving dowries but not receiving them and the poor receiving but not giving them. Plato when writing the <title>Laws</title> thought that up to a certain point inequality ought to be allowed, but that no citizen should be permitted to acquire more land than would make his estate five times the size of the smallest, as has also been said before.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> But those who bring in legislation of this sort must also not overlook this point, which is overlooked at present, that when regulating the amount of property legislators ought also to regulate the size of the family; for if the number of children becomes too large for the property, the law is quite sure to be broken, and apart from the breach of the law it is a bad thing that many citizens who were rich should become poor, for it is difficult for such men not to be advocates of a new order. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> That a level standard of property affects the community of the citizens in an important manner some men even in old times clearly have recognized; for example there is the legislation of Solon, and other states have a law prohibiting the acquisition of land to any amount that the individual may desire; and similarly there is legislation to prevent the sale of estates, as at <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName> there is a law<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that a man shall not sell unless he can prove that manifest misfortune has befallen him and also there is legislation to preserve the old allotments, and the repeal of this restriction at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName> made the Leucadian constitution excessively democratic, for it came about that the offices were no longer filled from the established property-qualifications. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But it is possible that equality of estates may be maintained, but their size may be either too large and promote luxury, or too small, causing a penurious standard of living; it is clear therefore that it is not enough for the lawgiver to make the estates equal, but he must aim at securing a medium size. And again, even if one prescribed a moderate property for all, it would be of no avail, since it is more needful to level men’s desires than their properties, and this can only be done by an adequate system of education enforced by law. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But perhaps Phaleas would say that he himself actually prescribes this, as he considers it fundamentally necessary for states to have equality in these two things, property and education. But the nature of the education needs to be defined: it is no use merely for it to be one and the same for all, for it is possible for all to have one and the same education but for this to be of such a nature as to make them desirous of getting more than their share of money or honor or both;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> moreover<note resp="Rackham">Probably the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">because</q> instead of <q rend="single">moreover.</q></note> civil strife is caused not only by inequality of property but also by inequality of honors, though the two motives operate in opposite ways—the masses are discontented if possessions are unequally distributed, </p></div>

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1267a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the upper classes if honors are equally distributed, bringing it about that <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">Noble and base in equal honor stand.<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.319">Hom. Il. 9.319</bibl> </note> </l> </quote> Nor do men do wrong for the sake of the bare necessities only, the sort of wrongdoing for which Phaleas thinks that equality of substance is a cure—preventing highway robbery by removing the motive of cold or hunger; men also do wrong to gain pleasure and to satisfy desire. For if they have a desire above the bare necessities of existence, they will transgress to cure this desire; and moreover not because of desire only, but in order that they may enjoy the pleasures that are not associated with pains.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> What remedy then is there for these three classes of offenders? For the first class, a modest competence and work; for the second, temperance; and as for the third sort, any people who desire pleasures that depend on themselves would require no cure for their desires save that which is derived from philosophy, for the other pleasures require the aid of fellow-creatures. Since clearly the greatest transgressions spring from a desire for superfluities, not for bare necessaries (for example, men do not become tyrants in order to avoid shivering with cold, and accordingly high honors are awarded to one who kills a tyrant, but not to one who kills a thief); so that the method of the constitution of Phaleas is efficacious only against the minor social disorders. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Again, Phaleas desires to frame institutions for the most part which will lead to a right state of affairs in the internal relations of the citizens, but the legislator should also have regard to relations with the neighboring peoples and with all foreign nations.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>It is essential therefore for the constitution to be framed with a view to military strength, about which Phaleas has said nothing. And the same is true also about property; for the citizens should not only possess enough to meet their requirements in civic life, but also to encounter the perils that face them from outside; hence they should possess neither so large an amount of wealth that it will be coveted by their neighbors and by stronger states while its possessors will be unable to repel their assailants, nor yet so small an amount as not to be capable of sustaining a war even against equal and similar states.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> Phaleas, it is true, has laid down no rule at all, but the question must not be overlooked, what amount of wealth is advantageous. Perhaps therefore the best limit to prescribe is that it must not profit a stronger people to make war upon the state because of its excessive wealth, but only just as it might do even if the citizens had not got so much property. For example, when Autophradates was about to lay siege to <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham">A stronghold on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> acquired by Eubulus, a Bithynian banker, when the Persian empire was breaking up, middle 4th century B.C.; Autophradates was a Persian general.</note> Eubulus bade him consider how long it would take him to capture the place, and then calculate what his expenditure would be for that period, for he himself was willing for the payment of a smaller sum than that to evacuate <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName> at once; these words caused Autophradates to ponder and led him to abandon the siege. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> Now equality of property among the citizens is certainly one of the factors that contribute to the avoidance of party faction; it is not however a particularly important one. For the upper classes may resent it on the ground that their merits are not equal, owing to which we actually see them often attacking the government and rebelling; </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1267b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and also the baseness of human beings is a thing insatiable, and though at the first a dole of only two obols<note resp="Rackham">Twopence-halfpenny for a seat in the theater at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> paid for citizens by the State after the time of Pericles.</note> is enough, yet when this has now become an established custom, they always want more, until they get to an unlimited amount; for appetite is in its nature unlimited, and the majority of mankind live for the satisfaction of appetite.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  The starting-point in such matters therefore, rather than levelling estates, is to train those that are respectable by nature so that they may not wish for excessive wealth, and to contrive that the base may not be able to do so, and this is secured if they are inferior in number and not unjustly treated. And also we cannot approve what Phaleas has said about equality of property, for he makes the citizens equal in respect of landed estate only, but wealth also consists in slaves and cattle and money, and there is an abundance of property in the shape of what is called furniture; we must therefore either seek to secure equality or some moderate regulation as regards all these things, or we must permit all forms of wealth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> And it is clear from Phaleas’s legislation that he makes the citizen-population a small one, inasmuch as all the artisans are to be publicly owned slaves and are not to furnish any complement of the citizen-body. But if it is proper to have public slaves, the laborers employed upon the public works ought to be of that status (as is the case at <placeName key="perseus,Epidamnos">Epidamnus</placeName> and as Diophantus once tried to institute at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>).</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">These remarks may serve fairly well to indicate such merits<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and defects as may be contained in the constitution of Phaleas.</p> 
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_5"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>Hippodamus<note resp="Rackham">A famous architect and town-planner (see 1330b 24) circa <date when="-0475">475</date> B.C.</note> son of Euryphon, a Milesian (who invented the division of cities into blocks and cut up <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>, and who also became somewhat eccentric in his general mode of life owing to a desire for distinction, so that some people thought that he lived too fussily, with a quantity of hair<note resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> men wore their hair long, but at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> this was the mark of a dandy.</note> and expensive ornaments, and also a quantity of cheap yet warm clothes not only in winter but also in the summer periods, and who wished to be a man of learning in natural science generally), was the first man not engaged in politics who attempted to speak on the subject of the best form of constitution. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> His system was for a city with a population of ten thousand, divided into three classes; for he made one class of artisans, one of farmers, and the third the class that fought for the state in war and was the armed class. He divided the land into three parts, one sacred, one public and one private: sacred land to supply the customary offerings to the gods, common land to provide the warrior class with food, and private land to be owned by the farmers. He thought that there are only three divisions of the law, since the matters about which lawsuits take place are three in number—outrage, damage, homicide. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> He also proposed to establish one supreme court of justice, to which were to be carried up all the cases at law thought to have been decided wrongly, and this court he made to consist of certain selected elders.</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:2" n="1268a">
 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1268a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>He held that the verdicts in the courts ought not to be given by ballot, but that each juryman should bring a tablet on which if he found a simple verdict of guilty he should write the penalty, and if simply not guilty leave a blank, but if he found the prisoner guilty on some counts but not on others he should state this; for the present state of the law he thought unsatisfactory, since it forces jurors to commit perjury by giving either the one verdict or the other. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> He proposed a law that those who discovered something of advantage to the state should receive honor, and that the children of those who died in war should have their maintenance from the state, in the belief that this had never yet been provided by law among other people—but as a matter of fact this law exists at present both at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and in others of the cities. The governing officials were all to be chosen by the assembly of the people, and this he made to consist of the three classes of the city; and the officials elected were to superintend the business of the community and the affairs of foreign residents and of orphans. These then are the greatest number and the most noteworthy of the provisions in the system of Hippodamus. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But doubt might be raised first of all about the division of the general mass of the citizens. The artisans, the farmers and the military class all participate in the government, though the farmers have not got arms and the artisans neither arms nor land,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which makes them almost the slaves of those who possess the arms. Therefore for them to share in all the offices is impossible (for it is inevitable that both military commanders and civic guards and in general the most important offices should be appointed from those that have the arms); but if they do not share in the government of the state, how is it possible for them to be friendly towards the constitution? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But it may be said that the ruling class as possessing the arms is bound to be stronger than both classes. But this is not easy if they are not numerous and if this be the case, why should the other classes participate in the government and control the appointment of the rulers?<note resp="Rackham">As military posts must be filled by the military class, the civilians will feel excluded and be disaffected; and the military class may not be strong enough to control them. Better, then, not to give full citizenship to civilians.</note> Again, what use are the farmers to the state? artisans there must necessarily be (for every state requires artisans), and they can make a living as in the other states from the practice of their craft; but as for the farmers, although it would have been reasonable for them to be a portion of the state if they provided the class possessing the arms with its food, as it is they have private land of their own and farm it for themselves. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> And again, if the common land from which those who fight for the state are to have their food is to be farmed by themselves, the military class would not be different from the agricultural, but the legislator intends it to be; while if the cultivators of the common land are to be a different set of people from both those who cultivate the private farms and the soldiers, this will be yet a forth section of the state, holding no part in it but quite estranged from the government. But yet if one is to make those who cultivate the private and the common land the same people, the amount of the produce from the farms which each man will cultivate will be scanty for two households, </p></div>

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1268b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and moreover why are they not both to take food for themselves and to supply it to the soldiers direct from the land and from the same allotments? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  All these points therefore involve much confusion. Also the law about trials is unsatisfactory—the requirement that the verdict shall be given on separate counts when the charge in the indictment is single, and the conversion of the juror into an arbitrator. A qualified verdict is practicable in an arbitration even when there are several arbitrators (for they confer with one another about their verdict), but it is not practicable in the law-courts, but the contrary to this is actually provided for by most lawgivers, who prohibit consultation between the jurymen. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Then the verdict will inevitably be a confused one when the juror thinks that the defendant is liable for damages but not in so large an amount as the plaintiff claims; for the plaintiff will sue for twenty minae<note resp="Rackham">The mina, 100 drachmas, may be put at 4 pounds (gold).</note> and the juror will adjudge ten minae (or the former some larger and the latter some smaller sum), and another juror five minae, and yet another four (and so they will obviously go on making fractions), while others will award the whole sum, and others nothing; what then will be the method of counting the votes? Again, nobody compels the juror to commit perjury who, if the indictment has been drawn in simple form, gives a simple verdict of acquittal or condemnation, and gives it justly; for the juror<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>who gives a verdict of acquittal does not give judgement that the defendant owes nothing, but that he does not owe the twenty minae for which he is sued; it is only the juror who gives a verdict condemning the defendant when he does not think that he owes twenty minae who commits perjury. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> As for the view that an honor ought to be awarded to those who invent something advantageous to the state, legislation to this effect is not safe, but only specious to the ear; for it involves malicious prosecutions and, it may even happen, constitutional upheavals. And the matter leads to another problem and a different inquiry: some persons raise the question whether to alter the ancestral laws, supposing another law is better, is harmful or advantageous to states. Hence it is not easy to give a speedy agreement to the above proposal to honor reformers, if really it is disadvantageous to alter the laws; yet it is possible that persons may bring forward the repeal of laws or of the constitution as a benefit to the community. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> And since we have made mention of this question, it will be better if we set out a few further observations about it, for, as we said, it involves difficulty. And it might be thought that it would be better for alteration to take place; at all events in the other fields of knowledge this has proved beneficial—for example, medicine has been improved by being altered from the ancestral system, and gymnastic training, and in general all the arts and faculties so that since statesmanship also is to be counted as one of these, it is clear that the same thing necessarily holds good in regard to it as well. And it might be said that a sign of this has occurred in the actual events of history, for (one might argue) the laws of ancient times were too simple and uncivilized: the Hellenes, for instance, used both to carry arms and to purchase their wives from one another, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> and all the survivals of the customs of antiquity existing anywhere are utterly foolish, </p></div>

And in general all men really seek what is good, not what was customary with their forefathers; and it is probable that primitive mankind, whether sprung from the earth<note resp="Rackham">So <bibl n="Hes.

Moreover even written codes of law may with advantage not be left unaltered. For just as in the other arts as well, so with the structure of the state it is impossible that it should have been framed aright in all its details; for it must of necessity be couched in general terms, but our actions deal with particular things. These considerations therefore make it clear that it is proper for some laws sometimes to be altered.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> But if we consider the matter in another way, it would seem to be a thing that needs much caution. For when it is the case that the improvement would be small, but it is a bad thing to accustom men to repeal the laws lightly, it is clear that some mistakes both of the legislator and of the magistrate should be passed over; for the people will not be as much benefited by making an alteration as they will be harmed by becoming accustomed to distrust their rulers. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> Also, the example from the case of the arts is a mistake, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as to change the practice of an art is a different thing from altering a law; for the law has no power to compel obedience beside the force of custom, and custom only grows up in long lapse of time, so that lightly to change from the existing laws to other new laws is to weaken the power of the law. Again, even if alteration of the laws is proper, are all the laws to be open to alteration, and in every form of constitution, or not? and is any chance person to be competent to introduce alterations or only certain people? for there is a great difference between these alternatives. Therefore let us abandon this inquiry for the present, since it belongs to other occasions. </p>

  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>Now it is a thing admitted that a state that is to be well governed must be provided with leisure from menial occupations; but how this is to be provided it is not easy to ascertain.

For with the Thessalians too the serf risings originally began because they were still at war with their neighbors, the Achaeans, Perraebi and Magnesians.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Also, apart from other drawbacks, the mere necessity of policing a serf class is an irksome burden—the problem of how intercourse with them is to be carried on: if allowed freedom they grow insolent and claim equal rights with their masters, and if made to live a hard life they plot against them and hate them. It is clear therefore that those whose helot-system works out in this way do not discover the best mode of treating the problem. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  Again, the freedom in regard to women is detrimental both in regard to the purpose of the constitution and in regard to the happiness of the state. For just as man and wife are part of a household, it is clear that the state also is divided nearly in half into its male and female population, so that in all constitutions in which the position of the women is badly regulated one half of the state must be deemed to have been neglected in framing the law. And this has taken place in the state under consideration,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the lawgiver wishing the whole city to be of strong character displays his intention clearly in relation to the men, but in the case of the women has entirely neglected the matter; for they live dissolutely<note resp="Rackham">The textual emendation giving <q rend="single">live without restraint</q> is probably correct.</note> in respect of every sort of dissoluteness, and luxuriously. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> So that the inevitable result is that in a state thus constituted wealth is held in honor, especially if it is the case that the people are under the sway of their women, as most of the military and warlike races are, except the Celts and such other races as have openly held in honor passionate friendship between males. For it appears that the original teller of the legend had good reason for uniting Ares with Aphrodite, for all men of martial spirit appear to be attracted to the companionship either of male associates or of women. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> Hence this characteristic existed among the Spartans, and in the time of their empire many things were controlled by the women; yet what difference does it make whether the women rule or the rulers are ruled by the women? The result is the same. And although bravery is of service for none of the regular duties of life, but if at all, in war, even in this respect the Spartans’ women were most harmful; and they showed this at the time of the Theban invasion,<note resp="Rackham">Under Epaminondas, <date when="-0369">369</date> B.C.</note> for they rendered no useful service, as the women do in other states, while they caused more confusion than the enemy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> It is true therefore that at the outset the freedom allowed to women at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> seems to have come about with good reason, </p></div>

But, as was also said before, errors as regards the status of women seem not only to cause a certain unseemliness in the actual conduct of the state but to contribute in some degree to undue love of money.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> For next to the things just spoken of one might censure the Spartan institutions with respect to the unequal distribution of wealth. It has come about that some of the Spartans own too much property and some extremely little; owing to which the land has fallen into few hands, and this has also been badly regulated by the laws;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the lawgiver made it dishonorable to sell a family’s existing estate, and did so rightly, but he granted liberty to alienate land at will by gift or bequest; yet the result that has happened was bound to follow in the one case as well as in the other.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> And also nearly two-fifths of the whole area of the country is owned by women, because of the number of women who inherit estates and the practice of giving large dowries; yet it would have been better if dowries had been prohibited by law or limited to a small or moderate amount . . .<note resp="Rackham">A clause seems to have been lost: <q rend="single">Also it would have been better to regulate by law the marriage of heiresses.</q></note> But as it is he is allowed to give an heiress in marriage to whomever he likes; and if he dies without having made directions as to this by will, whoever he leaves as his executor bestows her upon whom he chooses.

They have a tradition that in the earlier reigns they used to admit foreigners to their citizenship, with the result that dearth of population did not occur in those days, although they were at war for a long period; and it is stated that at one time the Spartiates numbered as many as ten thousand. However, whether this is true or not, it is better for a state’s male population to be kept up by measures to equalize property. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/>The law in relation to parentage is also somewhat adverse to the correction of this evil. </p></div>

The two kings were hereditary; the senate of twenty-eight nobles advised them, and the Ephors presided at the Assembly of citizens over thirty years old, who voted on the measures of the Kings and Ephors but could not discuss them.

For this office has absolute control over their most important affairs, but the Ephors are appointed from the entire people, so that quite poor men often happen to get into the office, who owing to their poverty used to be<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">are.</q></note> easily bought. This was often manifested in earlier times, and also lately in the affair<note resp="Rackham">Unknown</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>; for certain Ephors were corrupted with money and so far as lay in their power ruined the whole state. And because the office was too powerful, and equal to a tyranny, the kings also were compelled to cultivate popular favor, so that in this way too the constitution was jointly injured, for out of an aristocracy came to be evolved a democracy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/> Thus this office does, it is true, hold together the constitution—for the common people keep quiet because they have a share in the highest office of state, so that whether this is due to the lawgiver or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>has come about by chance, the Ephorate is advantageous for the conduct of affairs; for if a constitution is to be preserved, all the sections of the state must wish it to exist and to continue on the same lines; so the kings are in this frame of mind owing to their own honorable rank, the nobility owing to the office of the Elders, which is a prize of virtue, and the common people because of the Ephorate, which is appointed from the whole population—<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/> but yet the Ephorate, though rightly open to all the citizens, ought not to be elected as it is now, for the method is too childish.<note resp="Rackham">There is no clear evidence what the method was.</note> And further the Ephors have jurisdiction in lawsuits of high importance, although they are any chance people, so that it would be better if they did not decide cases on their own judgement but by written rules and according to the laws. Also the mode of life of the Ephors is not in conformity with the aim of the state, for it is itself too luxurious, whereas in the case of the other citizens the prescribed life goes too far in the direction of harshness, so that they are unable to endure it, and secretly desert the law and enjoy the pleasures of the body. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/>Also their regulations for the office of the Elders are not good; it is true that if these were persons of a high class who had been adequately trained in manly valor, one might perhaps say that the institution was advantageous to the state, although their life-tenure of the judgeship in important trials is indeed a questionable feature (for there is old age of mind as well as of body); </p></div>

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1271a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but as their education has been on such lines that even the lawgiver himself cannot trust in them as men of virtue, it is a dangerous institution.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/> And it is known that those who have been admitted to this office take bribes and betray many of the public interests by favoritism; so that it would be better if they were not exempt from having to render an account of their office, but at present they are. And it might be held that the magistracy of the Ephors serves to hold all the offices to account; but this gives altogether too much to the Ephorate, and it is not the way in which, as we maintain, officials ought to be called to account. Again, the procedure in the election of the Elders as a mode of selection is not only childish, but it is wrong that one who is to be the holder of this honorable office should canvass for it, for the man worthy of the office ought to hold it whether he wants to or not. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_19"/> But as it is the lawgiver clearly does the same here as in the rest of the constitution: he makes the citizens ambitious and has used this for the election of the Elders, for nobody would ask for office if he were not ambitious; yet surely ambition and love of money are the motives that bring about almost the greatest part of the voluntary wrongdoing that takes place among mankind. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_20"/> As to monarchy, the question whether it is not or is an advantageous institution for states to possess<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>may be left to another discussion; but at all events it would be advantageous that kings should not be appointed as they are now, but chosen in each case with regard to their own life and conduct. But it is clear that even the lawgiver himself does not suppose that he can make the kings men of high character: at all events he distrusts them as not being persons of sufficient worth owing to which the Spartans used to send kings who were enemies as colleagues on embassies, and thought that the safety of the state depended on division between the kings.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_21"/> Also the regulations for the the public mess-tables called Phiditia have been badly laid down by their originator. The revenue for these ought to come rather from public funds, as in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>; but among the Spartans everybody has to contribute, although some of them are very poor and unable to find money for this charge, so that the result is the opposite of what the lawgiver purposed. For he intends the organization of the common tables to be democratic, but when regulated by the law in this manner it works out as by no means democratic; for it is not easy for the very poor to participate, yet their ancestral regulation of the citizenship is that it is not to belong to one who is unable to pay this tax. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/> The law about the Admirals has been criticized by some other writers also, and rightly criticized; for it acts as a cause of sedition, since in addition to the kings who are military commanders the office of Admiral stands almost as another kingship. Another criticism that may be made against the fundamental principle of the lawgiver <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1271b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is one that Plato has made in the <title>Laws</title>.</p></div>

<p>The entire system of the laws is directed towards one part of virtue only, military valor, because this is serviceable for conquest. Owing to this they remained secure while at war, but began to decline when they had won an empire, because they did not know how to live a life of leisure, and had been trained in no other form of training more important than the art of war. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/> And another error no less serious than that one is this: they think that the coveted prizes of life are won by valor more than by cowardice, and in this they are right, yet they imagine wrongly that these prizes are worth more than the valor that wins them. The public finance of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is also badly regulated: when compelled to carry on wars on a large scale she has nothing in the state treasury, and the Spartiates pay war taxes badly because, as most of the land is owned by them, they do not scrutinize each other’s contributions. And the lawgiver has achieved the opposite result to what is advantageous—he has made the state poor and the individual citizen covetous.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">So much for a discussion of the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>: for these are the main points in it for criticism.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_7"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  The Cretan constitution approximates to that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but though in a few points it is not worse framed, for the larger part it has a less perfect finish. For the Spartan constitution appears and indeed is actually stated<note resp="Rackham">e.g. by Hdt 1.65.</note> to have been copied in most of its provisions from the Cretan; and as a rule old things have been less fully elaborated than newer ones. For it is said that when Lycurgus relinquished his post as guardian of King Charilaus<note resp="Rackham">Posthumous son of Lycurgus’s elder brother King Polydectes; cf.1316a 34.</note> and went abroad, he subsequently passed most of his time in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> because of the relationship between the Cretans and the Spartans; for the Lyctians<note resp="Rackham"> <placeName key="perseus,Lyctus">Lyctus</placeName> was an inland city in the east of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, not far from <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>.</note> were colonists from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and the settlers that went out to the colony found the system of laws already existing among the previous inhabitants of the place; owing to which the neighboring villagers even now use these laws in the same manner, in the belief that Minos<note resp="Rackham">Legendary ruler of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, son of Zeus and Europa, and after death a judge in the lower world.</note> first instituted this code of laws. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And also the island appears to have been designed by nature and to be well situated to be under Greek rule, as it lies across the whole of the sea, round which almost all the Greeks are settled; for <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> is only a short distance from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> in one direction, and from the part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> around Triopium and from <placeName key="tgn,7011265">Rhodes</placeName> in the other. Owing to this Minos won the empire of the sea,<note resp="Rackham">See <bibl n="Thuc. 1.4">Thuc. 1.4, 8</bibl>. The tradition of the wealth of Minos is supported by the recent excavations at <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>.</note> and made some of the islands subject to him and settled colonies in others, but finally when making an attack on <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he ended his life there near Camicus. </p>
<p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>The Cretan organization is on the same lines as that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.

And so also did the system of government; for the Ephors have the same power as the magistrates called Cosmi in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, except that the Ephors are five in number and the Cosmi ten; and the Elders at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> are equal in number to the Elders whom the Cretans call the Council; and monarchy existed in former times, but then the Cretans abolished it, and the Cosmi hold the leadership in war;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> and all are members of the Assembly, though it has no powers except the function of confirming by vote the resolutions already formed by the Elders and the Cosmi.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Now the Cretan arrangements for the public mess-tables are better than the Spartan; for at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> each citizen pays a fixed poll-tax, failing which he is prevented by law from taking part in the government, as has been said before; but in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> the system is more communal, for out of all the crops and cattle produced from the public lands, and the tributes paid by the serfs, one part is assigned for the worship of the gods and the maintenance of the public services,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the other for the public mess-tables, so that all the citizens are maintained from the common funds, women and children as well as men; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted association with the male sex, as to which there will be another occasion<note resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled</note> to consider whether it was a bad thing or a good one. That the regulations for the common mess-tables therefore are better in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> than at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is manifest; but the regulations for the Cosmi are even worse than those regarding the Ephors. For the evil attaching to the office of the Ephors belongs to the Cosmi also, as the post is filled by any chance persons, while the benefit conferred on the government by this office at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is lacking in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. At <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, as the election is made from all the citizens, the common people sharing in the highest office desire the maintenance of the constitution, but in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> they do not elect the Cosmi from all the citizens but from certain clans, and the Elders from those who have held the office of Cosmos, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> about which regulations the same comments might be made as about what takes place at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>: their freedom from being called to account and their tenure for life gives them greater rank than their merit deserves, and their administration of their office at their own discretion and not under the guidance of a written code is dangerous. And the fact that the common people quietly tolerate their exclusion is no proof that the arrangement is a sound one; for the Cosmi unlike the Ephors make no sort of profit, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1272b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as they live in an island remote from any people to corrupt them. </p></div>

 <p>Also the remedy which they employ for this defect<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the defect of the undue restriction of the office.</note> is a curious one, and less characteristic of a republic than of a dynasty<note resp="Rackham">See 1292b 10 n.</note>:  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> often the Cosmi are expelled by a conspiracy formed among some of their actual colleagues or the private citizens. Also the Cosmi are allowed to resign during their term of office. Now it would be preferable for all these expedients to be put in force by law rather than at the discretion of individuals, for that is a dangerous principle. And the worst expedient of all is that of the suspension of the office of Cosmi, which is often brought about by members of the powerful class who wish to escape being punished; this proves that the constitution has a republican element, although it is not actually a republic but rather a dynasty.<note resp="Rackham">See 1292b 10 n.</note> And the nobles frequently form parties among the common people and among their friends and so bring about a suspension of government,<note resp="Rackham">The MSS. give <q rend="single">bring about a monarchy.</q></note> and form factions and engage in war with one another.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> Yet such a state of things is virtually the same as if for a period of time the state underwent an entire revolution, and the bonds of civil society were loosened.</p>

  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Most of the points therefore in the Carthaginian system that would be criticized on the ground of their divergences happen to be common to all the constitutions of which we have spoken; but the features open to criticism as judged by the principle of an aristocracy or republic are some of them departures in the direction of democracy and others in the direction of oligarchy. The reference of some matters and not of others to the popular assembly rests with the kings in consultation with the Elders in case they agree<note resp="Rackham">i.e. agree to refer or not to refer</note> unanimously, but failing that, these matters also lie with the people<note resp="Rackham">i.e. even when the Kings only or the Elders only desire reference, it takes place</note>; and when the kings introduce business in the assembly, they do not merely let the people sit and listen to the decisions that have been taken by their rulers, but the people have the sovereign decision, and anybody who wishes may speak against the proposals introduced, a right that does not exist under the other constitutions. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> The appointment by co-optation of the Boards of Five which control many important matters, and the election by these boards of the supreme magistracy of the Hundred, and also their longer tenure of authority than that of any other officers (for they are in power after they have gone out of office and before they have actually entered upon it) are oligarchical features; their receiving no pay and not being chosen by lot and other similar regulations must be set down as aristocratic, and so must the fact that the members of the Boards are the judges in all lawsuits,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>instead of different suits being tried by different courts as at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  But the Carthaginian system diverges from aristocracy in the direction of oligarchy most signally in respect of a certain idea that is shared by the mass of mankind; they think that the rulers should be chosen not only for their merit but also for their wealth, as it is not possible for a poor man to govern well or to have leisure for his duties. If therefore election by wealth is oligarchical and election by merit aristocratic, this will be a third system exhibited in the organization of the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, for there elections are made with an eye to these two qualifications, and especially elections to the most important offices, those of the kings and of the generals.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But it must be held that this divergence from aristocracy is an error on the part of a lawgiver; for one of the most important points to keep in view from the outset is that the best citizens may be able to have leisure and may not have to engage in any unseemly occupation, not only when in office but also when living in private life. And if it is necessary to look to the question of means for the sake of leisure, it is a bad thing that the greatest offices of state, the kingship and the generalship, should be for sale. For this law makes wealth more honored than worth, and renders the whole state avaricious; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> and whatever the holders of supreme power deem honorable, the opinion of the other citizens also is certain to follow them, and a state in which virtue is not held in the highest honor <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1273b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>cannot be securely governed by an aristocracy.</p></div>

 <p> And it is probable that those who purchase office will learn by degrees to make a profit out of it, when they hold office for money spent; for it would be odd if a man of small means but respectable should want to make a profit but an inferior person when he has spent money to get elected should not want to. Hence the persons who should be in office are those most capable of holding office. And even if the lawgiver neglected to secure comfortable means for respectable people, it would at all events be better that he should provide for their leisure while in office.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  And it might also be thought a bad thing for the same person to hold several offices, which is considered a distinction at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. One man one job is the best rule for efficiency, and the lawgiver ought to see that this may be secured, and not appoint the same man to play the flute and make shoes. Hence except in a small city it is more statesmanlike for a larger number to share in the offices and more democratic, for it is fairer to all, as we said, and also functions are performed better and more quickly when separate than by the same people. This is clear in military and naval matters; for in both of these departments command and subordination penetrate throughout almost the whole body.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. everyone in command (except the commander-in-chief) has someone of higher rank over him.</note></p> 
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> But the constitution being oligarchical they best escape the dangers by being wealthy, as they constantly send out a portion of the common people to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>appointments in the cities; by this means they heal the social sore and make the constitution stable.

The Spartan constitution has been discussed. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> As for Solon, he is considered by some people to have been a good lawgiver, as having put an end to oligarchy when it was too unqualified and having liberated the people from slavery and restored the ancestral democracy with a skilful blending of the constitution: the Council on the Areopagus being an oligarchic element, the elective magistracies aristocratic and the law-courts democratic.</p></div>

As it is, this is a matter of dispute: a public act is spoken of by some people as the action of the state, others speak of it as the action not of the state but of the oligarchy or the tyrant in power<note resp="Rackham">So we speak of an action planned and carried by the party in power as an Act of Parliament, and technically as an act of the sovereign.</note>; and we see that the activity of the statesman and lawgiver is entirely concerned with a state as its object, and a constitution is a form of organization of the inhabitants of a state. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> But a state is a composite thing, in the same sense as any other of the things that are wholes but consist of many parts; it is therefore clear that we must first inquire into the nature of a citizen; for a state is a collection of citizens, </p></div>

    <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1275a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that we have to consider who is entitled to the name of citizen, and what the essential nature of a citizen is. For there is often a difference of opinion as to this: people do not all agree that the same person is a citizen; often somebody who would be a citizen in a democracy is not a citizen under an oligarchy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> We need not here consider those who acquire the title of citizen in some exceptional manner, for example those who are citizens by adoption; and citizenship is not constituted by domicile in a certain place (for resident aliens and slaves share the domicile of citizens), nor are those citizens who participate in a common system of justice, conferring the right to defend an action and to bring one in the law-courts (for this right belongs also to the parties under a commercial treaty, as they too can sue and be sued at law,—or rather, in many places even the right of legal action is not shared completely by resident aliens, but they are obliged to produce a patron, so that they only share in a common legal procedure to an incomplete degree), <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> but these are only citizens in the manner in which children who are as yet too young to have been enrolled in the list and old men who have been discharged<note resp="Rackham">This seems to imply that aged citizens were excused attendance at the assembly and law-courts, as well as military service</note> must be pronounced to be citizens in a sense, yet not quite absolutely, but with the added qualification of <q rend="single">under age</q> in the case of the former and <q rend="single">superannuated</q> or some other similar term (it makes no difference, the meaning being clear) in that of the latter. For we seek to define a citizen in the absolute sense, and one possessing no<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>disqualification of this nature that requires a correcting term, since similar difficulties may also be raised, and solved, about citizens who have been disfranchised or exiled. A citizen pure and simple is defined by nothing else so much as by the right to participate in judicial functions and in office. But some offices of government are definitely limited in regard to time, so that some of them are not allowed to be held twice by the same person at all, or only after certain fixed intervals of time; other officials are without limit of tenure, for example the juryman and the member of the assembly.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> It might perhaps be said that such persons are not officials at all, and that the exercise of these functions does not constitute the holding of office;<note resp="Rackham">Or, amending the text, <q rend="single">and yet that it is absurd to deny the title of citizen to those—</q></note> and yet it is absurd to deny the title of official to those who have the greatest power in the state. But it need not make any difference, as it is only the question of a name, since there is no common name for a juryman and a member of the assembly that is properly applied to both. For the sake of distinction therefore let us call the combination of the two functions <q rend="single">office</q> without limitation. Accordingly we lay it down that those are citizens who participate in office in this manner.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Such more or less is the definition of <q rend="single">citizen</q> that would best fit with all of those to whom the name is applied.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But it must not be forgotten that things in the case of which the things to which they are related differ in kind, one of them being primary, another one secondary and so on, either do not contain a common nature at all, as being what they are, or barely do so.<note resp="Rackham">The meaning of this abstract principle is most easily seen from its application here: if states are generically different from one another, membership of a state, citizenship, can hardly be a single thing, and come under a single definition.</note> Now we see that constitutions differ from one another in kind, and that some are subsequent and others prior; </p></div>

Hence the citizen corresponding to each form of constitution will also necessarily be different. Therefore the definition of a citizen that we have given applies especially to citizenship in a democracy; under other forms of government it may hold good, but will not necessarily do so. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> For in some states there is no body of common citizens, and they do not have the custom of a popular assembly but councils of specially convened members, and the office of trying law-suits goes by sections—for example at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> suits for breach of contract are tried by different ephors in different cases, while cases of homicide are tried by the ephors and doubtless other suits by some other magistrate. The same method is not<note resp="Rackham">The negative is a conjectural insertion, cf. 1273a 20.</note> followed at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, where certain magistrates judge all the law-suits.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> But still, our definition of a citizen admits of correction. For under the other forms of constitution a member of the assembly and of a jury-court is not <q rend="single">an official</q> without restriction, but an official defined according to his office; either all of them or some among them are assigned deliberative and judicial duties either in all matters or in certain matters. What constitutes a citizen is therefore clear from these considerations: we now declare that one who has the right to participate in deliberative or judicial office is a citizen of the state<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in which he has that right, and a state is a collection of such persons sufficiently numerous, speaking broadly, to secure independence of life.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> But in practice citizenship is limited to the child of citizens on both sides, not on one side only, that is, the child of a citizen father or of a citizen mother; and other people carry this requirement further back, for example to the second or the third preceding generation or further. But given this as a practical and hasty definition, some people raise the difficulty, How will that ancestor three or four generations back have been a citizen? Gorgias<note resp="Rackham">Sicilian orator and nihilistic philosopher, visited <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> <date when="-0427">427</date> B.C.</note> of Leontini therefore, partly perhaps in genuine perplexity but partly in jest, said that just as the vessels made by mortar-makers were mortars, so the citizens made by the magistrates were Larisaeans, since some of the magistrates were actually larisa-makers.<note resp="Rackham"> <placeName key="perseus,Larisa,Aeolis">Larisa</placeName>, a city in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, was famous for the manufacture of a kind of kettle called <q rend="single">larisa.</q></note> But it is really a simple matter; for if they possessed citizenship in the manner stated in our definition of a citizen, they were citizens—since it is clearly impossible to apply the qualification of descent from a citizen father or mother to the original colonizers or founders of a city.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  But perhaps a question rather arises about those who were admitted to citizenship when a revolution had taken place, for instance such a creation of citizens as that carried out<note resp="Rackham">In <date when="-0509">509</date> B.C.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Cleisthenes after the expulsion of the tyrants, when he enrolled in his tribes many resident aliens who had been foreigners or slaves. The dispute as to these is not about the fact of their citizenship, but whether they received it wrongly or rightly. Yet even as to this one might raise the further question, </p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:3" n="1276a">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1276a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whether, if a man is not rightly a citizen, he is a citizen at all, as <q rend="single">wrongly</q> means the same as <q rend="single">not truly.</q> But we sometimes see officials governing wrongly, as to whom we shall not deny that they do govern, but shall say that they do not do it rightly, and a citizen is defined by a certain function of government (a citizen, as we said, is one who shares in such and such an office); therefore it is clear that even persons wrongly admitted to citizenship are to be pronounced to be citizens, although the question whether they are so rightly or not rightly is connected with the question that was propounded before.<note resp="Rackham">The question, What is a state? 1274b 34.</note> For some persons raise the question, When is an occurrence the act of the state and when is it not? for example, when the government has been altered from oligarchy or tyranny to democracy. In such circumstances some people claim that the new government should not discharge public debts, on the ground that the money was borrowed by the tyrant and not by the state, and should repudiate many other similar claims also, because some forms of government rest upon force and are not aimed at the welfare of the community. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> If therefore some democracies also are governed in that manner, the acts of the authorities in their case can only be said to be the acts of the state in the same sense as the public acts emanating from an oligarchy or a tyranny are said to be. Akin to this controversy seems to be the subject, What exactly is the principle on which we ought to pronounce a city to be the same city as it was before, or not the same but a different city? The most obvious mode of inquiring into this difficulty<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>deals with place and people: the place and the people may have been divided, and some may have settled in one place, and some in another. In this form the question must be considered as easier of solution; for, as <q rend="single">city</q> has several meanings, the inquiry so put is in a way not difficult.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> means both (1) <q rend="single">city</q> (and also <q rend="single">citadel</q>) and (2) <q rend="single">state,</q> a collection of citizens; and if the citizens divide and settle in two different <q rend="single">cities</q> with different governments, they are clearly not the same <q rend="single">state</q> as before.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> But it may similarly be asked, Suppose a set of men inhabit the same place, in what circumstances are we to consider their city to be a single city? Its unity clearly does not depend on the walls, for it would be possible to throw a single wall round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>; and a case in point perhaps is <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, and any other city that has the circuit of a nation rather than of a city; for it is said that when <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> was captured a considerable part of the city was not aware of it three days later. But the consideration of this difficulty will be serviceable for another occasion, as the student of politics must not ignore the question, What is the most advantageous size for a city, and should its population be of one race or of several? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> But are we to pronounce a city, where the same population inhabit the same place, to be the same city so long as the population are of the same race, in spite of the fact that all the time some are dying and others being born, just as it is our custom to say that a river or a spring is the same river or spring although one stream of water is always being added to it and another being withdrawn from it, or are we to say that though the people are the same people for the similar reason of continuity, yet the city is a different city? </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1276b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For inasmuch as a state is a kind of partnership, and is in fact a partnership of citizens in a government, when the form of the government has been altered and is different it would appear to follow that the state is no longer the same state, just as we say that a chorus which on one occasion acts a comedy and on another a tragedy is a different chorus although it is often composed of the same persons, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> and similarly with any other common whole or composite structure we say it is different if the form of its structure is different—for instance a musical tune consisting of the same notes we call a different tune if at one time it is played in the Dorian mode and at another in the Phrygian. Therefore if this is the case, it is clear that we must speak of a state as being the same state chiefly with regard to its constitution; and it is possible for it to be called by the same or by a different designation both when its inhabitants are the same and when they are entirely different persons. But whether a state is or is not bound in justice to discharge its engagements when it has changed to a different constitution, is another subject.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  The next thing to consider after what has now been said is the question whether we are to hold that the goodness of a good man is the same as that of a good citizen, or not the same. However, if this point really is to receive investigation, we must first ascertain in some general outline what constitutes the excellence of a citizen.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Now a citizen we pronounced to be one sort of partner in a community, as is a sailor. And although sailors differ from each other in function—one is an oarsman, another helmsman, another look-out man, and another has some other similar special designation—and so clearly the most exact definition of their excellence will be special to each, yet there will also be a common definition of excellence that will apply alike to all of them; for security in navigation is the business of them all, since each of the sailors aims at that. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Similarly therefore with the citizens, although they are dissimilar from one another, their business is the security of their community, and this community is the constitution, so that the goodness of a citizen must necessarily be relative to the constitution of the state. If therefore there are various forms of constitution, it is clear that there cannot be one single goodness which is the perfect goodness of the good citizen; but when we speak of a good man we mean that he possesses one single goodness, perfect goodness. Hence it is manifestly possible to be a good citizen without possessing the goodness that constitutes a good man.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Moreover it is also feasible to pursue the same topic by raising the question in another manner in relation to the best form of constitution. If it is impossible<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">possible</q>. If we emend the text with Bernays to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ γὰρ δύνατον ἐξ ἁπάντων σπουδαίων ὄντων εἶναι πόλιν</foreign>, the sense is: assuming the possibility of a perfect state, with all its factors the best of their kind, this means that all the population will be good citizens, not that they will all be perfect specimens of the human race, because the state needs citizens of the working classes, etc., and these cannot in the nature of things be perfect human beings</note> for a state to consist entirely of good men, and if it is necessary for each person to perform well the work of his position, and to do this springs from goodness, then because it is impossible for all the citizens to be alike, </p></div>

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1277a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the goodness of a good citizen would not be one and the same as the goodness of a good man; for all ought to possess the goodness of the good citizen (that is a necessary condition of the state’s being the best possible), but it is impossible that all should possess the goodness of a good man, if it is not necessary that all the citizens in a good state should be good men. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Again, since the state consists of unlike persons—just as an animal (to take this instance first) consists of soul and body, and a soul of reason and appetite, and a household of husband and wife and [ownership involves]<note resp="Rackham">These words in the Greek are probably an interpolation.</note> a master and slave, in the same manner a state consists of all of these persons and also of others of different classes in addition to these,—it necessarily follows that the goodness of all the citizens is not one and the same, just as among dancers the skill of a head dancer is not the same as that of a subordinate leader.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>It is clear then from these considerations that the goodness of a good citizen and that of a good man are not the same in general; but will the goodness of a good citizen of a particular sort be the same as that of a good man? Now we say that a good ruler is virtuous and wise, and that a citizen taking part in politics must be wise. Also some people say that even the education of a ruler must be different, as indeed we see that the sons of kings are educated in horsemanship and military exercises, and Euripides says<note resp="Rackham">Fragment 16, from <title>Aeolus</title>.</note> <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="iambic">No subtleties for me, but what the state</l> <l>Requireth—</l> </quote> <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>implying that there is a special education for a ruler. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And if the goodness of a good ruler is the same as the goodness of a good man, yet the person ruled is also a citizen, so that the goodness of a citizen in general will not be the same as that of a man, although that of a particular citizen will; for goodness as a ruler is not the same as goodness as a citizen, and no doubt this is the reason why Jason<note resp="Rackham">Tyrant of Pherae in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, assassinated <date when="-0370">370</date> B.C.</note> said that when he was not tyrant he went hungry, meaning that he did not know the art of being a private person.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  Another point is that we praise the ability to rule and to be ruled, and it is doubtless held that the goodness of a citizen consists in ability both to rule and to be ruled well. If then we lay it down that the goodness of the good man is displayed in ruling, whereas that of the citizen is shown in both capacities, the two capacities cannot be equally laudable.

But there exists a form of authority by which a man rules over persons of the same race as himself, and free men (for that is how we describe political authority), and this the ruler should learn by being ruled, just as a man should command cavalry after having served as a trooper, command a regiment after having served in a regiment and been in command of a company and of a platoon. Hence there is much truth in the saying that it is impossible to become a good ruler without having been a subject. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> And although the goodness of a ruler and that of a subject are different, the good citizen must have the knowledge and the ability both to be ruled and to rule, and the merit of the good citizen consists in having a knowledge of the government of free men on both sides. And therefore both these virtues are characteristic of a good man, even if temperance and justice in a ruler are of a different kind from temperance and justice in a subject; for clearly a good man’s virtue, for example his justice, will not be one and the same when he is under government and when he is free, but it will be of different kinds,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one fitting him to rule and one to be ruled, just as temperance and courage are different in a man and in a woman (for a man would be thought a coward if he were only as brave as a brave woman, and a woman a chatterer if she were only as modest as a good man; since even the household functions of a man and of a woman are different—his business is to get and hers to keep). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> And practical wisdom alone of the virtues is a virtue peculiar to a ruler; for the other virtues seem to be necessary alike for both subjects and rulers to possess, but wisdom assuredly is not a subject’s virtue, but only right opinion: the subject corresponds to the man who makes flutes and the ruler to the flute-player who uses them.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">The question whether the goodness of a good man is the same as that of a good citizen or different, and how they are the same and how different, is clear from these considerations.</p>

Is it truly the case that a citizen is a person who has the right to share office in the government, or are the working classes also to be counted citizens? If these persons also are to be counted who have no share in offices, it is not possible for every citizen to possess the citizen’s virtue; for the true citizen is the man capable of governing.<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <q rend="single">for the working-man is a citizen.</q> <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος γὰρ πολίτης</foreign>.

In ancient times in fact the artisan class in some states consisted of slaves or aliens, owing to which the great mass of artisans are so even now; and the best-ordered state will not make an artisan a citizen. While if even the artisan is a citizen, then what we said to be the citizen’s virtue must not be said to belong to every citizen, nor merely be defined as the virtue of a free man, but will only belong to those who are released from menial occupations.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Among menial occupations those who render such services to an individual are slaves, and those who do so for the community are artisans and hired laborers.

At <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> there was a law that no one who had not kept out of trade for the last ten years might be admitted to office. But under many constitutions the law draws recruits even from foreigners; for in some democracies the son of a citizen-mother is a citizen, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  and the same rule holds good as to base-born sons in many places. Nevertheless, inasmuch as such persons are adopted as citizens owing to a lack of citizens of legitimate birth (for legislation of this kind is resorted to because of under-population), when a state becomes well off for numbers it gradually divests itself first of the sons of a slave father or mother, then of those whose mothers only were citizens, and finally only allows citizenship to the children of citizens on both sides.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  These facts then show that there are various kinds of citizen, and that a citizen in the fullest sense means the man who shares in the honors of the state, as is implied in the verse of Homer<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom.

<p rend="align(indent)">The answer therefore to the question, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1278b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Is the goodness that makes a good man to be deemed the same as that which makes a worthy citizen, or different? is now clear from what has been said in one form of state the good man and the good citizen are the same, but in another they are different, and also in the former case it is not every citizen but only the statesman, the man who controls or is competent to control, singly or with colleagues, the administration of the commonwealth, that is essentially also a good man.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_4"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  And since these points have been determined, the next question to be considered is whether we are to lay it down that there is only one form of constitution or several, and if several, what they are and how many and what are the differences between them. Now a constitution is the ordering of a state in respect of its various magistracies, and especially the magistracy that is supreme over all matters. For the government is everywhere supreme over the state and the constitution is the government. I mean that in democratic states for example the people are supreme, but in oligarchies on the contrary the few are; and we say that they have a different constitution. And we shall use the same language about the other forms of government also.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  We have therefore to determine first the fundamental points, what is the object for which a state exists and how many different kinds of system there are for governing mankind and for controlling the common life.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Now it has been said in our first discourses,<note resp="Rackham">1253a 1 ff.</note> in which we determined the principles concerning household management and the control of slaves, that man is by nature a political animal;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and so even when men have no need of assistance from each other they none the less desire to live together.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> At the same time they are also brought together by common interest, so far as each achieves a share of the good life. The good life then is the chief aim of society, both collectively for all its members and individually; but they also come together and maintain the political partnership for the sake of life merely, for doubtless there is some element of value contained even in the mere state of being alive, provided that there is not too great an excess on the side of the hardships of life, and it is clear that the mass of mankind cling to life at the cost of enduring much suffering, which shows that life contains some measure of well-being and of sweetness in its essential nature.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And again, the several recognized varieties of government can easily be defined; in fact we frequently discuss them in our external discourses.<note resp="Rackham">Mentioned at 1323a 22 (and also six times in other books); they are there appealed to for the tripartite classification of foods which in <bibl n="Aristot.

<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  It is clear then that those constitutions that aim at the common advantage are in effect rightly framed in accordance with absolute justice, while those that aim at the rulers’ own advantage only are faulty, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> and are all of them deviations from the right constitutions; for they have an element of despotism, whereas a city is a partnership of free men.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">These matters having been determined the next step is to consider how many forms of constitution there are and what they are; and first to study the right forms of constitution, since the deviations will also become manifest when these are defined.</p>

For either we must not say that those who are part of the state are citizens, or those who are part of the state must share in the advantage of membership.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Our customary designation for a monarchy that aims at the common advantage is <q rend="single">kingship</q>; for a government of more than one yet only a few <q rend="single">aristocracy</q> （either because the best men rule or because they rule with a view to what is best for the state and for its members）; while when the multitude govern the state with a view to the common advantage, it is called by the name common to all the forms of constitution, <q rend="single">constitutional government.</q> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> (And this comes about reasonably, since although it is possible for one man or a few to excel in virtue, when the number is larger it becomes difficult for them to possess perfect excellence in respect of every form of virtue, </p></div>

  <p rend="align(indent)">But it is necessary to say at a little greater length what each of these constitutions is; for the question involves certain difficulties, and it is the special mark of one who studies any subject philosophically, and not solely with regard to its practical aspect, that he does not overlook or omit any point, but brings to light the truth about each. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Now tyranny, as has been said, is monarchy exerting despotic power over the political community; oligarchy is when the control of the government is in the hands of those that own the properties; democracy is when on the contrary it is in the hands of those that do not possess much property, but are poor.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>A first difficulty is with regard to the definition. If the majority of the citizens were wealthy and were in control of the state, yet when the multitude is in power it is a democracy, and similarly, to take the other case, if it were to occur somewhere that the poor were fewer than the rich but were stronger than they and accordingly were in control of the government, yet where a small number is in control it is said to be an oligarchy, then it would seem that our definition of the forms of constitution was not a good one.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. it would be absurd to term government by the people democracy if the people happened to be very rich, or government by a few oligarchy if the few were poor and the many whom they governed rich.</note><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And once again, if one assumed the combination of small numbers with wealth and of multitude with poverty, and named the constitutions thus—one in which the rich being few in number hold the offices, oligarchy: one in which the poor being many in number hold the offices, democracy,—this involves another difficulty. What names are we to give to the constitutions just described—the one in which there are more rich and the one in which the poor are the fewer, and these control their respective governments—if there exists no other form of constitution beside those mentioned? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> The argument therefore seems to make it clear that for few or many to have power is an accidental feature of oligarchies in the one case and democracies in the other, due to the fact that the rich are few and the poor are many everywhere (so that it is not really the case that the points mentioned constitute a specific difference), but that the real thing in which democracy and oligarchy differ from each other is poverty and wealth; </p></div>
    
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:3" n="1280a">
   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1280a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and it necessarily follows that wherever the rulers owe their power to wealth, whether they be a minority or a majority, this is an oligarchy, and when the poor rule, it is a democracy, although it does accidentally happen, as we said, that where the rulers hold power by wealth they are few and where they hold power by poverty they are many, because few men are rich but all men possess freedom, and wealth and freedom are the grounds on which the two classes lay claim to the government. </p>
    <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>And first we must ascertain what are stated to be the determining qualities of oligarchy and democracy, and what is the principle of justice under the one form of government and under the other. For all men lay hold on justice of some sort, but they only advance to a certain point, and do not express the principle of absolute justice in its entirety. For instance, it is thought that justice is equality, and so it is, though not for everybody but only for those who are equals; and it is thought that inequality is just, for so indeed it is, though not for everybody, but for those who are unequal; but these partisans strip away the qualification of the persons concerned, and judge badly. And the cause of this is that they are themselves concerned in the decision, and perhaps most men are bad judges when their own interests are in question. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Hence inasmuch as <q rend="single">just</q> means just for certain persons, and it is divided in the same way in relation to the things to be distributed and the persons that receive them, as has been said before in the Ethics,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131a 14-24</bibl>.</note> the two parties agree as to what constitutes equality in the thing, but dispute as to what constitutes equality in the person,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>chiefly for the reason just now stated, because men are bad judges where they themselves are concerned, but also, inasmuch as both parties put forward a plea that is just up to a certain point, they think that what they say is absolutely just. For the one side think that if they are unequal in some respects, for instance in wealth, they are entirely unequal, and the other side think that if they are equal in some respects, for instance in freedom, they are entirely equal.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> But the most important thing they do not mention. If men formed the community and came together for the sake of wealth, their share in the state is proportionate to their share in the property, so that the argument of the champions of oligarchy would appear to be valid—namely that in a partnership with a capital of 100 minae<note resp="Rackham">See 1268b 14 n.</note> it would not be just for the man who contributed one mina to have a share whether of the principal or of the profits accruing equal to the share of the man who supplied the whole of the remainder; but if on the other hand the state was formed not for the sake of life only but rather for the good life (for otherwise a collection of slaves or of lower animals would be a state, but as it is, it is not a state, because slaves<note resp="Rackham">See 1260a 12, and <bibl n="Aristot.

All those on the other hand who are concerned about good government do take civic virtue and vice into their purview. Thus it is also clear that any state that is truly so called and is not a state merely in name must pay attention to virtue; for otherwise the community becomes merely an alliance, differing only in locality from the other alliances, those of allies that live apart. And the law is a covenant or, in the phrase of the sophist Lycophron,<note resp="Rackham">Probably a pupil of Gorgias, see 1275b 26 n.</note> a guarantee of men’s just claims on one another, but it is not designed to make the citizens virtuous and just. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> And that this is how the matter stands is manifest. For if one were actually to bring the sites of two cities together into one, so that the city-walls of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and those of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> were contiguous, even so they would not be one city; nor would they if they enacted rights of intermarriage with each other, although intermarriage between citizens is one of the elements of community which are characteristic of states. And similarly even if certain people lived in separate places yet not so far apart as not to have intercourse, but had laws to prevent their wronging one another<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in their interchange of products— for instance, if one man were a carpenter, another a farmer, another a shoemaker and another something else of the kind,—and the whole population numbered ten thousand, but nevertheless they had no mutual dealings in anything else except such things as exchange of commodities and military alliance, even then this would still not be a state. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> What then exactly is the reason for this? for clearly it is not because their intercourse is from a distance since even if they came together for intercourse of this sort (each nevertheless using his individual house as a city) and for one another’s military aid against wrongful aggressors only, as under a defensive alliance, not even then would they seem to those who consider the matter carefully to constitute a state, if they associated on the same footing when they came together as they did when they were apart. It is manifest therefore that a state is not merely the sharing of a common locality for the purpose of preventing mutual injury and exchanging goods. These are necessary preconditions of a state’s existence, yet nevertheless, even if all these conditions are present, that does not therefore make a state, but a state is a partnership of families and of clans in living well, and its object is a full and independent life. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> At the same time this will not be realized unless the partners do inhabit one and the same locality and practise intermarriage; this indeed is the reason why family relationships have arisen throughout the states, and brotherhoods and clubs for sacrificial rites and social recreations. But such organization is produced by the feeling of friendship, for friendship is the motive of social life; therefore, while the object of a state is the good life, these things are means to that end. And a state is the partnership of clans and villages in a full and independent life, </p></div>

Clearly it must be either the multitude, or the rich, or the good, or the one man who is best of all, or a tyrant. But all of these arrangements appear to involve disagreeable consequences. For instance, if the poor take advantage of their greater numbers to divide up the property of the rich, is not this unjust? No, it may be said, for it was a resolution made by the supreme authority in just form. Then what must be pronounced to be the extreme of injustice? And again, when everybody is taken into account, suppose the majority share out among themselves the property of the minority, it is manifest that they are destroying the state; but assuredly virtue does not destroy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>its possessor, and justice is not destructive of the state, so that it is clear that this principle also cannot be just. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Also it follows from it that all the actions done by a tyrant are just, for his use of force is based upon superior strength, as is the compulsion exerted by the multitude against the rich. But is it just that the minority and the rich should rule? Suppose therefore they also act in the same way and plunder and take away the property of the multitude, is this just?

It is clear therefore that all these things are bad and not just. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> But ought the good to rule, and be in control of all classes? If so, then it follows that all the other classes will be dishonored,<note resp="Rackham">The term is technical and means disfranchisement and loss of civic rights.</note> if they are not honored by holding the offices of government; for we speak of offices as honors, and if the same persons are always in office the rest must necessarily be excluded from honor. But is it better for the most virtuous individual to be the ruler? But that is still more oligarchical, for the people excluded from honor will be more numerous. But perhaps some one would say that in any case it is a bad thing for a human being, having in his soul the passions that are the attributes of humanity, to be sovereign, and not the law. Suppose therefore that law is sovereign, but law of an oligarchic or democratic nature, what difference will it make as regards the difficulties that have been raised? for the results described before will come about just the same. </p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Most of these points therefore must be discussed on another occasion; but the view that it is more proper for the multitude to be sovereign than the few of greatest virtue might be thought to be explicable and to have some justification, and even to be the true view.

This is why the general public is a better judge of the works of music and those of the poets, because different men can judge a different part of the performance, and all of them all of it.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But the superiority of good men over the mass of men individually, like that of handsome men, so it is said, over plain men and of the works of the painter’s art over the real objects, really consists in this, that a number of scattered good points have been collected together into one example; since if the features be taken separately, the eye of one real person is more beautiful than that of the man in the picture, and some other feature of somebody else. It is not indeed clear whether this collective superiority of the many compared with the few good men can possibly exist in regard to every democracy and every multitude, and perhaps it may be urged that it is manifestly impossible in the case of some—for the same argument would also apply to animals, yet what difference is there,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>practically, between some multitudes and animals?—but nothing prevents what has been said from being true about some particular multitude.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>One might therefore employ these considerations to solve not only the previously stated difficulty but also the related question, over what matters is the authority of the freemen, the mass of the citizens, to extend (using that expression to denote those who are not rich nor possessed of any distinguishing excellence at all)? For it is not safe for them to participate in the highest offices (for injustice and folly would inevitably cause them to act unjustly in some things and to make mistakes in others), but yet not to admit them and for them not to participate is an alarming situation, for when there are a number of persons without political honors and in poverty, the city then is bound to be full of enemies. It remains therefore for them to share the deliberative and judicial functions.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  For this reason Solon and certain other lawgivers appoint the common citizens to<note resp="Rackham">Probably words meaning <q rend="single">these functions and to</q> have fallen out.</note> the election of the magistrates and the function of calling them to audit, although they do not allow them to hold office singly. For all when assembled together have sufficient discernment, and by mingling with the better class are of benefit to the state, just as impure food mixed with what is pure makes the whole more nourishing than the small amount of pure food alone; but separately the individual is immature in judgement.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> This arrangement of the constitution is however open to question in the first place on the ground that it might be held that the best man to judge which physician has given the right treatment is the man that is himself capable of treating and curing the patient of his present disease, and this is the man who is himself a physician;  </p></div>

Hence just as a court of physicians must judge the work of a physician, so also all other practitioners ought to be called to account before their fellows. But <q rend="single">physician</q> means both the ordinary practitioner, and the master of the craft, and thirdly, the man who has studied medicine as part of his general education (for in almost all the arts there are some such students, and we assign the right of judgement just as much to cultivated amateurs as to experts).<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Further the same might be thought to hold good also of the election of officials, for to elect rightly is a task for experts—for example, it is for experts in the science of mensuration to elect a land-surveyor and for experts in navigation to choose a pilot; for even though in some occupations and arts some laymen also have a voice in appointments, yet they certainly do not have more voice than the experts. Hence according to this argument the masses should not be put in control over either the election of magistrates or their audit.<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> But perhaps this statement is not entirely correct, both for the reason stated above,<note resp="Rackham">See 6.4.</note> in case the populace is not of too slavish a character (for although each individual separately will be a worse judge than the experts, the whole of them assembled together will be better or at least as good judges), and also because about some things the man who made them would not be the only nor the best judge, in the case of professionals whose products come within the knowledge of laymen also:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to judge a house, for instance, does not belong only to the man who built it, but in fact the man who uses the house (that is, the householder) will be an even better judge of it, and a steersman judges a rudder better than a carpenter, and the diner judges a banquet better than the cook.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">This difficulty then might perhaps be thought to be satisfactorily solved in this way. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> But there is another connected with it: it is thought to be absurd that the base should be in control over more important matters than the respectable; but the audits and the elections of magistrates are a very important matter, yet in some constitutions, as has been said, they are assigned to the common people, for all such matters are under the control of the assembly, yet persons of a low property-assessment and of any age take part in the assembly and the council and sit on juries, whereas treasury officials, generals and the holders of the highest magistracies are drawn from among persons of large property. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> Now this difficulty also may be solved in a similar way; for perhaps these regulations also are sound, since it is not the individual juryman or councillor or member of the assembly in whom authority rests, but the court, the council and the people, while each of the individuals named (I mean the councillor, the members of assembly and the juryman) is a part of those bodies. Hence justly the multitude is sovereign in greater matters, for the popular assembly, the council and the jury-court are formed of a number of people, and also the assessed property of all these members collectively is more than that of the magistrates holding great offices individually or in small groups.</p>

But equality in what characteristics does this mean, and inequality in what? This must be made clear, since this too raises a difficulty, and calls for political philosophy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> For perhaps someone might say that the offices of state ought to be distributed unequally according to superiority in every good quality, even if the candidates in all other respects did not differ at all but were exactly alike, because men that are different<note resp="Rackham">i.e. different in some good quality.</note> have different rights and merits. Yet if this is true, those who are superior in complexion or stature or any good quality will have an advantage in respect of political rights. But surely the error here is obvious, and it comes out clearly if we consider the other sciences and faculties. Among flute-players equally good at their art it is not proper to give an advantage in respect of the flutes to those of better birth, for they will not play any better, but it is the superior performers who ought to be given the superior instruments.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And if our meaning is not yet plain, it will become still clearer when we have carried the matter further. Suppose someone is superior in playing the flute but much inferior in birth or in good looks, then, even granting that each of these things—birth and beauty—is a greater good than ability to play the flute, and even though they surpass flute-playing proportionately more than the best flute-player surpasses the others in flute-playing, even so the best flute-player ought to be given the outstandingly good flutes;</p></div>

For if to be of some particular height gave more claim, then height in general would be in competition with wealth and with free birth; therefore if A excels in height more than B does in virtue, and speaking generally size gives more superiority than virtue,<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps we should rewrite the Greek to give <q rend="single">even though speaking generally virtue gives more superiority than size.</q></note> all things would be commensurable for; if such-and-such an amount of one thing is better than such-and-such an amount of another, it is clear that such-and-such an amount of the one is equal to that amount of another. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But since this is impossible, it is clear that in politics with good reason men do not claim a right to office on the ground of inequality of every kind—if one set of men are slow runners and another fast, this is no good ground for the one set having more and the other less<note resp="Rackham">Doubtless the author meant the other way round, <q rend="single">for the slow having less and the fast more political power.</q></note> political power, but the latter’s superiority receives its honor in athletic contests; but the claim to office must necessarily be based on superiority in those things which go to the making of the state. Hence it is reasonable for the well-born, free and wealthy to lay claim to honor; for there must be free men and tax-payers, since a state consisting entirely of poor men would not be a state, any more than one consisting of slaves. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But then, granting there is need of these, it is clear that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there is also need of justice and civic virtue, for these are also indispensable in the administration of a state; except that wealth and freedom are indispensable for a state’s existence, whereas justice and civic virtue are indispensable for its good administration.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">As a means therefore towards a state’s existence all or at all events some of these factors would seem to make a good claim, although as means to a good life education and virtue would make the most just claim, as has been said also before.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  On the other hand since those who are equal in one thing only ought not to have equality in all things nor those unequal as regards one thing inequality in all, it follows that all these forms of constitution must be deviations. Now it has been said before that all make a claim that is in a manner just, though not all a claim that is absolutely just; the rich claiming because they have a larger share of the land, and the land is common property, and also as being for the most part more faithful to their covenants; the free and well-born as being closely connected together (for the better-born are citizens to a greater degree than those of claims, low birth, and good birth is in every community held in honor at home), and also because it is probable that the children of better parents will be better, for good birth means goodness of breed; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> and we shall admit that virtue also makes an equally just claim, for we hold that justice is social virtue, which necessarily brings all the other virtues in its train; but moreover the majority have a just claim as compared with the minority, since they are stronger and richer and better if their superior numbers are taken in comparison with the others’ inferior numbers.</p></div>

  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>
  If then the possessors of virtue should be quite few in number, how is the decision to be made? ought we to consider their fewness in relation to the task, and whether they are able to administer the state, or sufficiently numerous to constitute a state? And there is some difficulty as regards all the rival claimants to political honors. Those who claim to rule because of their wealth might seem to have no justice in their proposal, and similarly also those who claim on the score of birth; for it is clear that if, to go a step further, a single individual is richer than all the others together, according to the same principle of justice it will obviously be right for this one man to rule over all, and similarly the man of outstanding nobility among the claimants<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>on the score of freebirth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> And this same thing will perhaps result in the case of aristocratic government based on virtue; for if there be some one man who is better than the other virtuous men in the state, by the same principle of justice that man must be sovereign. Accordingly if it is actually proper for the multitude to be sovereign because they are better than the few, then also, if one person or if more than one but fewer than the many are better than the rest, it would be proper for these rather than the multitude to be sovereign.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> All these considerations therefore seem to prove the incorrectness of all of the standards on which men claim that they themselves shall govern and everybody else be governed by them. For surely even against those who claim to be sovereign over the government on account of virtue, and similarly against those who claim on account of wealth, the multitudes might be able to advance a just plea; for it is quite possible that at some time the multitude may be collectively better and richer than the few, although not individually.</p>

   Hence it is also possible to meet in this way the question which some persons investigate and put forward (for some raise the question whether the legislator desiring to lay down the rightest laws should legislate with a view to the advantage of the better people or that of the larger number) in cases when the situation mentioned<note resp="Rackham">At the end of the last sentence, 7.12.</note> occurs. And <q rend="single">right</q> must be taken in the sense of <q rend="single">equally right,</q> and this means right in regard to the interest of the whole state and in regard to the common welfare of the citizens; and a citizen is in general one who shares in governing and being governed, </p></div>

This is why democratically governed states institute the system of ostracism, because of a reason of this nature; for these are the states considered to pursue equality most of all things,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that they used to ostracize men thought to be outstandingly powerful on account of wealth or popularity or some other form of political strength, and used to banish them out of the city for fixed periods of time. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And there is a mythical story that the Argonauts left Heracles behind for a similar reason; for the Argo<note resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.19">Apollod. 1.9.19</bibl> <quote xml:lang="grc">τῆς Ἀργοῦς φθεγξαμένης μὴ δύνασθαι πέρειν τὸ τούτου βάρος</quote>. Argo was a live creature, and Athena had built a <q rend="single">talking timber</q> into her cutwater.</note> refused to carry him with the others because he was so much heavier than the sailors.

And the same course is adopted in regard to cities and races by the holders of sovereign power, for example the Athenians so dealt with the Samians and Chians and Lesbians<note resp="Rackham">In 440, 424 and <date when="-0427">427</date> B.C. respectively</note> (for no sooner did they get a strong hold of their empire than they humbled them in contravention of their covenants),  </p></div>

   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1284b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the king of the Persians frequently used to cut down the numbers of the Medes and Babylonians and the other races that had waxed proud because they had once been head of an empire.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And the problem applies universally to all the forms of constitution, even the right forms; for while the divergent forms of government do this because their regard is fixed on their private advantage, nevertheless with the constitutions directed to the common good the same is the case. And this is also clear in the field of the other arts and sciences; a painter would not let his animal have its foot of disproportionately large size, even though it was an exceptionally beautiful foot, nor would a shipbuilder make the stern or some other part of a ship disproportionately big, nor yet will a trainer of choruses allow a man who sings louder and more beautifully than the whole band to be a member of it.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Hence as far as this practice goes nothing prevents monarchs from being in harmony with the cities they rule, if they resort to it when their own personal rule is beneficial to the cities. Therefore in relation to acknowledged superiorities the argument for ostracism has a certain element of political justice. True, it is better for the lawgiver so to constitute the state at the outset that it does not need this medicine; but the next best course to steer, if occasion arises, is to endeavor to correct<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the constitution by some such method of rectification. But this was not what happened with the states, for they were not looking at what was advantageous for their proper constitution, but their acts of ostracism were done in a revolutionary spirit. In the divergent forms of constitution therefore it is evident that ostracism is advantageous and just under the special constitution, though perhaps it is also evident that it is not<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps <q rend="single">not</q> should be struck out; but if it stands, the clause refers to 8.5 init.—in these cases ostracism is practiced only in the interest of those in power.</note> just absolutely; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> but in the case of the best constitution there is much doubt as to what ought to be done, not as regards superiority in the other things of value, such as strength and wealth and popularity, but in the case of a person becoming exceptionally distinguished for virtue. It certainly would not be said that such a man must be banished and got out of the way; yet nevertheless no doubt men would not think that they ought to rule over such a man, for that would be the same as if they claimed to rule over Zeus, dividing up his spheres of government. It remains therefore, and this seems to be the natural course, for all to obey such a man gladly, so that men of this sort may be kings in the cities for all time.</p>

And it has to be considered whether it is advantageous for a city or a country that is to be well administered to be ruled by a king, or whether it is not so but some other constitution is more expedient, or whether royal rule is expedient for some states and not for others. But it is needful to decide first whether there is only one sort of kingship or whether it has several varieties.</p></div>

This, to put it simply, is an elective tyranny, and it differs from the monarchy that exists among barbarians not in governing without the guidance of law but only in not being hereditary. Some holders of this type of monarchy ruled for life, others until certain fixed limits of time or until certain undertakings were ended, as for example the people of <placeName key="perseus,Mitylene">Mitylene</placeName> once elected Pittacus to resist the exiles under the leadership of Antimenides and the poet Alcaeus. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> That they elected Pittacus<note resp="Rackham">Pittacus held the office <date from="-0587" to="-0579">587</date>-579 B.C.

 <p>These monarchies therefore now and in the past are of the nature of tyrannies because they are autocratic, but of the nature of kingships because they are elective and rule over willing subjects.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> A fourth class of royal monarchy consists of the hereditary legal kingships over willing subjects in the heroic period. For because the first of the line had been benefactors of the multitude in the arts or in war, or through having drawn them together or provided them with land, these kings used to come to the throne with the consent of the subjects and hand it on to their successors by lineal descent. And they had supreme command in war and control over all sacrifices that were not in the hands of the priestly class, and in addition to these functions they were judges in law-suits; some gave judgement not on oath and some on oath—the oath was taken by holding up the sceptre.<note resp="Rackham">This ritual is mentioned in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.234">Hom. Il. 1.234</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7.412">Hom. Il. 7.412</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.328">Hom.

These kingships then differ from one another in this manner. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> But a fifth kind of kingship is when a single ruler is sovereign over all matters in the way in which each race and each city is sovereign over its common affairs; this monarchy ranges with the rule of a master over a household, for just as the master’s rule is a sort of monarchy in the home, so absolute monarchy is domestic mastership over a city, or over a race or several races.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">There are therefore, we may say, virtually two kinds of kingship that have been examined, this one and the Spartan. For most of the others lie between these, since with them the king is sovereign over fewer things than under absolute monarchy, but over more than under the Spartan kingship. Hence our inquiry is virtually about two questions, one whether it is expedient or inexpedient for states to have a military commander holding office for life, and that either by descent or by class,<note resp="Rackham">Some MSS. give <q rend="single">or by election.</q></note> </p></div>

 <p> <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1286a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and one whether it is expedient or inexpedient for one man to be sovereign over everything. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Now the study of a militarycommand of the kind mentioned has more the aspect of a legal than of a constitutional inquiry (for it is possible for this form of office to exist under all constitutions), so let it be dismissed at the first stage<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1289a 11 ff.; but the promise of a full discussion of law is not fulfilled</note>; but the remaining mode of kingship is a kind of constitution, so that it is necessary to consider this one and to run over the difficulties that it involves.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">And the starting-point of the inquiry is the question whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best men or by the best laws. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Those of the opinion that it is advantageous to be governed by a king think that laws enunciate only general principles but do not give directions for dealing with circumstances as they arise; so that in an art of any kind it is foolish to govern procedure by written rules (and indeed in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> physicians have the right to alter their prescription after four days, although if one of them alters it before he does so at his own risk); it is clear therefore that government according to written rules, that is laws, is not the best, for the same reason. At the same time, however, rulers ought to be in possession of the general principle before mentioned as well. And a thing that does not contain the emotional element is generally superior to a thing in which it is innate; now the law does not possess this factor, but every human soul<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>necessarily has it. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But perhaps someone might say that in compensation for this a single ruler will decide better about particular cases. Therefore it is clear that on the one hand the ruler must necessarily be a legislator, and that there must or be laws laid down, although these must not be sovereign<note resp="Rackham">i.e. unalterably binding, and not be set aside by special dispensation of the ruler when deemed to be unjust in some particular case.</note> where they go astray—admittedly in all other cases they ought to be sovereign; but on the other hand in matters which it is impossible for the law either to decide at all or to decide well, ought the one best man to govern or all the citizens? As it is, the citizens assembled hear lawsuits and deliberate and give judgements, but these judgements are all on particular cases. Now no doubt any one of them individually is inferior compared with the best man, but a state consists of a number of individuals, and just as a banquet towhich many contribute dishes is finer than a single plain dinner, for this reason in many cases a crowd judges better than any single person. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Also the multitude is more incorruptible—just as the larger stream of water is purer, so the mass of citizens is less corruptible than the few; and the individual’s judgement is bound to be corrupted when he is overcome by anger or some other such emotion, whereas in the other case it is a difficult thing for all the people to be roused to anger and go wrong together. But the multitude must consist of the freemen, doing nothing apart from the law except about matters as to which the law must of necessity be deficient. And if this is not indeed easy to ensure in the case of many men, yet if there were a majority of good men and good citizens, would an individual make a more incorruptible ruler or rather those who though the majority in number yet are all good? </p></div>
     
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:3" n="1286b">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1286b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The majority, is it not obvious? But it will be said that they will split up into factions, whereas with a single ruler this cannot happen. But against this must perhaps be set the fact that they are as virtuous in soul as the single ruler.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> If then the rule of the majority when these are all good men is to be considered an aristocracy, and that of the one man kingship, aristocracy would be preferable for the states to kingship, whether the royal office be conjoined with military force or without it, if it be possible to get a larger number of men than one who are of similar quality. And it was perhaps only owing to this that kingships existed in earlier times, because it was rare to find men who greatly excelled in virtue, especially as in those days they dwelt in small cities. Moreover they used to appoint their kings on the ground of public service, and to perform this is a task for the good men. But as it began to come about that many men arose who were alike in respect of virtue, they would no longer submit to royalty, but sought for some form of commonwealth, and set up a republican constitution. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> And as men becoming baser began to make money out of the community, it is reasonable to suppose that some such cause as this occasioned the rise of oligarchies; for they brought wealth into honor. And from oligarchies they first changed to tyrannies, and from tyrannies to democracy; for by constantly bringing the government into fewer hands owing to a base love of gain, they made the multitude stronger,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. more men of ability and position went over to the opposition.</note> so that it set upon the oligarchs, and democracies came into existence.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But now that the states have come to be even greater than they were, perhaps it is not easy for yet another form of constitution beside democracy to come into existence. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> And even if one held that royal government is best for states, what is to be the position as regards the king’s children? is the sovereignty to be hereditary? But this will be disastrous if the king’s sons turn out to be like what some have been. It may be said that the king being sovereign will not in that case bequeath the throne to his children. But that is too much to be easy to believe: it would be difficult for a king to disinherit his sons, and an act of virtue above the level of human nature. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>And there is a difficulty also about the royal power: ought the man who is to reign as king to force to have an armed force about him, by means of which he willhave power to compel those who may be unwilling to obey, or if not, how is it possible for him to administer his office? For even if he were a law-abiding sovereign and never acted according to his own will against the law, nevertheless it would be essential for him to have power behind him whereby to safeguard the laws. Probably therefore it is not difficult to define the regulations for a king of this sort: he must have a force of his own, but the force must be only so large as to be stronger than a single individual or even several individuals banded together, but weaker than the multitude, on the principle on which the men of old times used to assign bodyguards whenever they appointed somebody as what they termed <emph>aesymnetes</emph> or tyrant<note resp="Rackham"><q rend="single">Or tyrant</q> looks like an incorrect note, see 1285b 25.</note> of the state, and also, when Dionysius<note resp="Rackham">See 1259a 39 n.</note> asked for his guards, somebody advised him to give the same number of guards to the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</p></div>

For the so-called constitutional monarchy, as we said,<note resp="Rackham">See 10.3.</note> is not a special kind of constitution (since it is possible for a life-long generalship to exist under all constitutions, for example under a democracy and an aristocracy, and many people make one man sovereign over the administration, for instance there is a government of this sort in <placeName key="perseus,Epidamnos">Epidamnus</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham"> Durazzo, on the Adriatic.</note> and also at Opus<note resp="Rackham">Chief town of <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, near the Straits of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> </note> to a certain smaller extent);  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> but we have now to discuss what is called Absolute Monarchy, which is the monarchy under which the king governs all men according to his own will. Some people think that it is entirely contrary to nature for one person to be sovereign over all the citizens where the state consists of men who are alike; for necessarily persons alike in nature must in accordance with nature have the same principle of justice and the same value, so that inasmuch as for persons who are unequal to have an equal amount of food or clothing is harmful for their bodies, the same is the case also in regard to honors; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> similarly therefore it is wrong for those who are equal to have inequality, owing to which it is just for no one person to govern or be governed more than another, and therefore for everybody to govern and be governed alike in turn. And this constitutes law for regulation is law. Therefore it is preferable for the law to rule rather than any one of the citizens,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and according to this same principle, even if it be better for certain men to govern, they must be appointed as guardians of the laws and in subordination to them; for there must be some government, but it is clearly not just, men say, for one person to be governor when all the citizens are alike. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> It may be objected that any case which the law appears to be unable to define, a human being also would be unable to decide. But the law first specially educates the magistrates for the purpose and then commissions them to decide and administer the matters that it leaves over <q rend="single">according to the best of their judgement,</q><note resp="Rackham">This formula came in the oath taken by the dicasts at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and furthermore it allows them to introduce for themselves any amendment that experience leads them to think better than the established code. He therefore that recommends that the law shall govern seems to recommend that God and reason alone shall govern, but he that would have man govern adds a wild animal also; for appetite is like a wild animal, and also passion warps the rule even of the best men. Therefore the law is wisdom without desire. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And there seems to be no truth in the analogy which argues from the arts<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the practical sciences, of which medicine is taken as an example.</note> that it is a bad thing to doctor oneself by book, but preferable to employ the experts in the arts. For they never act contrary to principle from motives of friendship, but earn their fee when (for instance) they have cured their patients, whereas holders of political office usually do many things out of spite and to win favor; since when people suspect even the physicians of being in the confidence of their enemies and of trying to make away with them for gain, in that case they would sooner look up the treatment in the books.</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:3" n="1287b">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1287b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  Yet certainly physicians themselves call in other physicians to treat them when they are ill, and gymnastic trainers put themselves under other trainers when they are doing exercises, believing that they are unable to judge truly because they are judging about their own cases and when they are under the influence of feeling. Hence it is clear that when men seek for what is just they seek for what is impartial; for<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps this should be <q rend="single">and.</q></note> the law is that which is impartial. Again, customary laws<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the rules of duty and of manners that are customary but not embodied in legislation: cf. 1319b 40 <q rend="single">the laws both written and unwritten.</q></note> are more sovereign and deal with more sovereign matters than written laws, so that if a human ruler is less liable to error than written laws, yet he is not less liable to error than the laws of custom.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> But also it is certainly not easy for the single ruler to oversee a multitude of things; it will therefore be necessary for the officials appointed by him to be numerous; so that what difference does it make whether this has been the arrangement immediately from the outset or the single ruler appoints them in this manner? Again, a thing that has also been said before, if the virtuous man justly deserves to rule because he is better, yet two good men are better than one: for that is the meaning of the line<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.224">Hom. Il. 10.224</bibl>: The passage goes on <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί τε πρὸ ὃ τοῦ ἐνόησεν ὅππως κέρδος ἔῃ</foreign>, <q rend="single">then one discerneth Before the other how advantage lieth.</q></note> <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">When two together go—</l> </quote> and of the prayer of Agamemnon<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom.

For to lay down a law about things that are subjects for deliberation is an impossibility. Therefore men do not deny that it must be for a human being to judge about such matters, but they say that it ought not to be a single human being only but a number. For the individual official judges well when he has been instructed by the law, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> and it would doubtless seem curious if a person saw better when judging with two eyes and two organs of hearing and acting with two feet and hands than many persons with many, since even as it is monarchs make many eyes and ears and hands and feet their own, for they adopt persons that are friendly to their rule and to themselves as their fellow-rulers. Although therefore if these assistants are not friendly they will not act in conformity with the monarch’s policy, if they are friends of him and of his rule, well, a friend is one’s equal and like, so that if the monarch thinks that his friends ought to rule he thinks that people who are equal to and like himself ought to rule like himself.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">This then more or less is the case advanced by those who argue against kingship.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  But perhaps, although this is a true account of the matter in some cases, it does not apply in others. For there is such a thing as being naturally fitted to be controlled by a master, and in another case, to be governed by a king, and in another, for citizenship, and this is just and expedient; but there is no such thing as natural fitness for tyranny, nor for any other of the forms of government that are divergences, for these come about against nature.  </p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:3" n="1288a">
<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1288a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But merely from what has been said, it is clear that among people who are alike and equal it is neither expedient nor just for one to be sovereign over all—neither when there are no laws, but he himself is in the place of law, nor when there are laws, neither when both sovereign and subjects are good nor when both are bad, nor yet when the sovereign is superior in virtue, except in a certain manner. What this manner is must be stated; and in a way it has been stated already even before.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> But first we must define what constitutes fitness for royal government, what fitness for aristocracy, and what for a republic. A fit subject for royal government is a populace of such a sort as to be naturally capable of producing a family of outstanding excellence for political leadership; a community fit for aristocracy is one that naturally produces a populace<note resp="Rackham">The clause translated <q rend="single">that—populace</q> some editors excise as a superfluous insertion.</note> capable of being governed under the form of government fit for free men by those who are fitted by virtue for taking the part of leaders in constitutional government; a republican community, one in which there naturally grows up a military populace<note resp="Rackham">They also excise <q rend="single">in which-populace</q></note> capable of being governed and of governing under a law that distributes the offices among the well-to-do in accordance with merit.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  When therefore it comes about that there is either a whole family or even some one individual that differs from the other citizens in virtue so greatly that his virtue exceeds that of all the others, then it is just for this family to be the royal family or this individual king, and sovereign over all matters. For, as has been said before,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>this holds good not only in accordance with the right that is usually brought forward by those who are founding aristocratic and oligarchic constitutions, and from the other side by those who are founding democratic ones (for they all make their claim on the ground of superiority, though not the same superiority), but it also holds good in accordance with the right spoken of before.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the right of merit, 8.7.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> For it is not seemly to put to death or banish, nor yet obviously to ostracize, such a man, nor is it seemly to call upon him to take his turn as a subject; for it is not in the order of nature for the part to overtop the whole, but the man that is so exceptionally outstanding has come to overtop the whole community. Hence it only remains for the community to obey such a man, and for him to be sovereign not in turn but absolutely.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Let this be our answer to the questions as regards kingship, what are its varieties, and whether it is disadvantageous for states or advantageous, and for what states, and under what conditions.</p>

But as it is, some students inquire which is the highest form of all even though requiring much material equipment,<note resp="Rackham">The word originally denoted the duty of the wealthy citizen holding office of Choregus to supply dresses, etc., for the chorus and actors in a drama.</note> while those who rather state some general form sweep aside the constitutions actually existing and praise that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> or some other;</p> </div>

And after this it needs this same discrimination also to discern the laws that are the best, and those that are suited to each of the forms of constitution. For the laws should be laid down, and all people lay them down, to suit the constitutions—the constitutions must not be made to suit the laws; for a constitution is the regulation of the offices of the state in regard to the mode of their distribution and to the question what is the sovereign power in the state and what is the object of each community, but laws are distinct from the principles of the constitution, and regulate how the magistrates are to govern and to guard against those<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>who transgress them. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> So that clearly it is necessary to be in possession of the different varieties of each form of constitution, and the number of these, even for the purpose of legislation; for it is impossible for the same laws to be expedient for all oligarchies or democracies if there are really several kinds of them, and not one sort of democracy or oligarchy only.  </p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>And inasmuch as in our first inquiry<note resp="Rackham">Book 3.5.</note> about the forms of the constitution we classified the right constitutions as three, kingship, aristocracy and constitutional government, and the deviations from these as three, tyranny from kingship, oligarchy from aristocracy and democracy from constitutional government, and about aristocracy and kingship we have spoken (for to study the best constitution is the same thing as to speak about the forms that bear those names, since each of them means a system based on the qualification of virtue equipped with means), and as also the question what constitutes the difference between aristocracy and kingship and when a royal government is to be adopted has been decided before, it remains to discuss the form of constitution designated by the name<note resp="Rackham">i.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>, <q rend="single">polity,</q> which denotes not only a constitution of any form, but also (like our term <q rend="single">constitutional government</q>) a particular form, viz., a republic, cf.

Stat. 302a">Plat. Stat. 302a ff.</bibl> </note> though not on the same principle as ours; for he inclined to judge that there were good varieties of all the forms, for instance a good sort of oligarchy and so on, and that democracy was the worst among these, but the best among the bad varieties, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>whereas we say that the deviations are wholly wrong, and that it is not right to speak of one form of oligarchy as better than another, but only as less bad. But let us for the present dismiss the question of a classification of this nature. Our business is first to distinguish how many different forms of the constitutions there are, assuming that there do exist several kinds of democracy and of oligarchy; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> next, which form is most general, and which most desirable after the best constitution, and also if there exists some other form that is aristocratic in nature and well constructed but not fitted to the largest number of cities, which this is; next, which of the other forms too is desirable for what people (since probably for some democracy is necessary more than oligarchy, and for others oligarchy more than democracy);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and after this, in what way should one proceed who wishes to set up these constitutions, I mean the various forms of democracy and of oligarchy; and finally, when as far as possible we have concisely touched upon all these questions, we must endeavor to review what are the agencies that destroy and what are those that preserve constitutions generally and each variety of constitution in particular, and what are the causes by which it is most natural for these events to be brought about. </p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_3"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Now the reason of there being several forms of constitution is that every city has a considerable number of parts. For in the first place we see that all the cities are composed of households, and then again that of this multitude some must necessarily be rich and some poor and some between the two, and also of the rich and the poor the former class is heavy-armed and the latter without armor. And we see that one portion of the common people is agricultural, another engaged in trade and another mechanic. And the upper classes have distinctions also corresponding to their wealth and the amounts of their property (for example in a stud of horses—for it is not easy to rear horses without being rich, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> and this is why in ancient times there were oligarchies in all the states whose strength lay in their cavalry, and they used to use horses for their wars against their neighbors, as for instance did the Eretrians and Chalcidians and the people of <placeName key="perseus,Magnesia ad Maeandrum">Magnesia</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName> and many of the other Asiatic peoples). Moreover in addition to differences in wealth there is the difference of birth, and that in regard to virtue,  </p></div>
  
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:4" n="1290a">
   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1290a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and indeed any other similar distinction that in the discussion of aristocracy has been stated to constitute a part of the state (for there we distinguished how many necessary parts there are of which every state must consist); for sometimes all of these parts participate in the constitution and sometimes a smaller or a larger number ofthem. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> It is clear therefore that there must necessarily be several forms of constitution differing in kind from one another, inasmuch as these parts differ in kind among themselves. For a constitution means the arrangement of the magistracies, and this all people plan out either according to the power of those who share political rights, or according to some common equality between them, I mean for example between the poor or between the rich, or some equality common to them both.<note resp="Rackham">This clause looks like an interpolation.</note> It follows therefore that there are as many forms of constitution as there are modes of arrangement according to the superiorities and the differences of the sections. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  But the forms mostly are thought to be two—just as in the case of the winds we speak of some as north and some as south and regard the rest as deviations from these,<note resp="Rackham">Aristotle refers to this view in <bibl n="Aristot. Meteo. 364a.19">Aristot. Meteor. 364a 19</bibl>, saying that west winds are classed with north and east winds with south, because wind from the setting sun is cooler and from the rising sun warmer. He notes that north and south winds are the most frequent, <bibl n="Aristot. Meteo. 361a.6">Aristot. Meteor. 361a 6</bibl>; this may have suggested the idea that they were the typical winds.</note> so also of constitutions there are held to be two forms, democracy and oligarchy; for men reckon aristocracy as a kind of oligarchy because it is oligarchy of a sort, and what is called constitutional government as democracy, just as in the case of the winds they reckon the west wind as a kind of north wind and the east wind as a kind of south wind.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And the case is similar with musical modes, as some people say: for there too they posit two kinds, the Dorian mode and the Phrygian, and call the other scales some of them Dorian and the others Phrygian. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> For the most part therefore they are accustomed to think in this way about the constitutions; but it is truer and better to class them as we did, and assuming that there are two well-constructed forms, or else one, to say that the others are deviations, some from the well-blended constitution and the others from the best one, the more tense and masterful constitutions being oligarchic and the relaxed and soft ones demotic.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But it is not right to define democracy, as some people are in the custom of doing now, merely as the constitution in which the multitude is sovereign (for even in oligarchies and everywhere the majority is sovereign) nor oligarchy as the constitution in which a few are sovereign over the government. For if the whole number were thirteen hundred, and a thousand of these were rich and did not give the three hundred poor a share in the government although they were free-born and like themselves in all other respects, no one would say that this people was governed democratically; and similarly also if there were few poor, but these more powerful than the rich who were more numerous, no one would call such a government a democracy either, if the other citizens being rich had no share in the honors.</p></div>

<p><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> Rather therefore ought we to say that it is a democracy  <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1290b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>when the free are sovereign and an oligarchy when the rich are, but that it comes about that the sovereign class in a democracy is numerous and that in an oligarchy small because there are many men of free birth and few rich. For otherwise, suppose people assigned the offices by height, as some persons<note resp="Rackham">e.g. <bibl n="Hdt. 3.20">Hdt. 3.20</bibl>.</note> say is done in <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>, or by beauty, that would be an oligarchy, because both the handsome and the tall are few in number.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  Nevertheless it is not enough to define these constitutions even by wealth and free birth only; but inasmuch as there are more elements than one both in democracy and in oligarchy, we must add the further distinction that neither is it a democracy if the free<note resp="Rackham">i.e. those of citizen birth.</note> being few govern the majority who are not of free birth, as for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> on the Ionian Gulf and at <placeName key="perseus,Thera City">Thera</placeName> (for in each of these cities the offices of honor were filled by the specially noble families who had been the first settlers of the colonies, and these were few out of many), nor is it a democracy<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered here to give <q rend="single">an oligarchy.</q></note> if the rich rule because they are in a majority, as in ancient times at <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName> (for there the majority of the population owned large property before the war against the Lydians took place), but it is a democracy when those who are free are in the majority and have sovereignty over the government, and an oligarchy when the rich and more well born<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are few and sovereign.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  It has then been stated that there are several forms of constitution, and what is the cause of this; but let us take the starting-point that was laid down before<note resp="Rackham">See 3.1.</note> and say that there are more forms than those mentioned, and what these forms are, and why they vary. For we agree that every state possesses not one part but several. Therefore just as, in case we intended to obtain a classification of animals, we should first define the properties necessarily belonging to every animal (for instance some of the sense organs, and the machinery for masticating and for receiving food, such as a mouth and a stomach, and in addition to these the locomotive organs of the various species), <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> and if there were only so many necessary parts, but there were different varieties of these (I mean for instance certain various kinds of mouth and stomach and sensory organs, and also of the locomotive parts as well), the number of possible combinations of these variations will necessarily produce a variety of kinds of animals (for it is not possible for the same animal to have several different sorts of mouth, nor similarly of ears either), so that when all the possible combinations of these are taken they will all produce animal species, and there will be as many species of the animal as there are combinations of the necessary parts:—<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>so in the same way also we shall classify the varieties of the constitutions that have been mentioned. For states also are composed not of one but of several parts, as has been said often. One of these parts therefore is the mass of persons concerned with food who are called farmers, </p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:4" n="1291a">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1291a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and second is what is called the mechanic class (and this is the group engaged in the arts without which it is impossible for a city to be inhabited, and some of these arts are indispensably necessary, while others contribute to luxury or noble living), and third is a commercial class (by which I mean the class that is engaged in selling and buying and in wholesale and retail trade), and fourth is the class of manual laborers, and the fifth class is the one to defend the state in war, which is no less indispensable than the others if the people are not to become the slaves of those who come against them; for surely it is quite out of the question that it should be proper to give the name of state to a community that is by nature a slave, for a state is self-sufficient, but that which is a slave is not self-sufficient.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> Therefore the statement made in the <title>Republic</title> <note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 369b">Plat. Rep. 369b-371e</bibl> </note> is witty but not adequate. For Socrates says that the most necessary elements of which a state is composed are four, and he specifies these as a weaver, a farmer, a shoemaker and a builder; and then again he adds, on the ground that these are not self-sufficient, a copper-smith and the people to look after the necessary live-stock, and in addition a merchant and a retail trader. These elements together constitute the full complement of his first city,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the first sketch of the City-state, loc. cit.</note> implying that every city is formed for the sake of the necessaries of life and not rather for the sake of what is noble, and that it has equal need of both shoemakers and farmers; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> but the warrior class<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>he does not assign to it until as the territory is increased and comes into contact with that of the neighbors they are brought into war. But yet even among the four partners or whatever their number be there must necessarily be somebody to assign justice and to judge their claims; inasmuch therefore as one would count the soul of an animal to be more a part of it than the body, so also the factors in states corresponding to the soul must be deemed to be parts of them more than those factors which contribute to necessary utility,—the former being the military class and the class that plays a part in judicial justice, and in addition to these the deliberative class, deliberation being a function of political intelligence. And it makes no difference to the argument whether these functions are held by special classes separately or by the same persons; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> for it often happens for the same men to be both soldiers and farmers. Hence inasmuch as both groups<note resp="Rackham">The first four classes and the fifth and sixth (the military and judicial).</note> of classes must be counted parts of the state, it is clear that the heavy-armed soldiery at any rate<note resp="Rackham">Lower grades of the forces may be excluded from citizenship, e.g. the rowers of the triremes (see below, 1376b 15).</note> must be a part of the state. And a seventh class is the one that serves the community by means of its property, the class that we call the rich. And an eighth is the class of public servants, that is, those who serve in the magistracies, inasmuch as without rulers it is impossible for a city to exist; it is therefore necessary that there should be some men who are able to govern and who render this service to the state either continuously or in turn. And there remain the classes which we happen to have defined just before, the deliberative class and the one that judges the claims of litigants. If therefore it is proper for the states to have these functions performed, and well and justly performed,  </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1291b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is necessary for there also to be some men possessing virtue in the form of political excellence. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/>  Now as to the other capacities many people think that it is possible for them to be possessed in combination, for example, for the same men to be the soldiers that defend the state in war and the farmers that till the land and the artisans, and also the councillors and judges, and indeed all men claim to possess virtue and think themselves capable of filling most of the offices of state; but it is not possible for the same men to be poor and rich. Hence these seem to be in the fullest sense the parts of the state, the rich and the poor. And also the fact that the rich are usually few and the poor many makes these two among the parts of the state appear as opposite sections; so that the superior claims<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.11, 12 fin.</note> of these classes are even made the guiding principles upon which constitutions are constructed, and it is thought that there are two forms of constitution, democracy and oligarchy.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_4"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  That there are then several forms of constitution, and what are the reasons for this, has been stated before; let us now say that there are several varieties both of democracy and of oligarchy. And this is clear even from what has been said already. For there are several classes both of the people and of those called the notables; for instance classes of the people are, one the farmers, another the class dealing with the arts and crafts, another the commercial class<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>occupied in buying and selling and another the one occupied with the sea—and this is divided into the classes concerned with naval warfare, with trade, with ferrying passengers and with fishing (for each of these classes is extremely numerous in various places, for instance fishermen at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, navy men at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the mercantile class at <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, and the ferryman-class at <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>), and in addition to these the hand-working class and the people possessing little substance so that they cannot live a life of leisure, also those that are not free men of citizen parentage on both sides, and any other similar class of common people; while among the notables wealth, birth, virtue, education, and the distinctions that are spoken of in the same group as these, form the classes.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  The first kind of democracy therefore is the one which receives the name chiefly in respect of equality. For the law of this sort of democracy ascribes equality to the state of things in which the poor have no more prominence than the rich, and neither class is sovereign, but both are alike; for assuming that freedom is chiefly found in a democracy, as some persons suppose, and also equality, this would be so most fully when to the fullest extent all alike share equally in the government. And since the people are in the majority, and a resolution passed by a majority is paramount, this must necessarily be a democracy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  This therefore is one kind of democracy, where the offices are held on property qualifications, but these low ones, although it is essential that the man who acquires the specified amount should have the right to hold office, and the man who loses it should not hold office. </p></div>

   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1292a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And another kind of democracy is for all the citizens that are not open to challenge<note resp="Rackham">i.e. on the score of birth, cf. 5.4.</note> to have a share in office, but for the law to rule; and another kind of democracy is for all to share in the offices on the mere qualification of being a citizen, but for the law to rule. Another kind of democracy is where all the other regulations are the same, but the multitude is sovereign and not the law; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> and this comes about when the decrees of the assembly over-ride the law. This state of things is brought about by the demagogues; for in the states under democratic government guided by law a demagogue does not arise, but the best classes of citizens are in the most prominent position; but where the laws are not sovereign, then demagogues arise; for the common people become a single composite monarch, since the many are sovereign not as individuals but collectively. Yet what kind of democracy Homer<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.204">Hom. Il. 2.204</bibl> </note> means by the words <q rend="single">no blessing is the lordship of the many</q>—whether he means this kind or when those who rule as individuals are more numerous, is not clear.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> However, a people of this sort, as being monarch, seeks to exercise monarchic rule through not being ruled by the law, and becomes despotic, so that flatterers are held in honor. And a democracy of this nature is comparable to the tyrannical form of monarchy, because their spirit is the same, and both exercise despotic control over the better classes, and the decrees voted by the assembly<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are like the commands issued in a tyranny, and the demagogues and the flatterers are the same people or a corresponding class, and either set has the very strongest influence with the respective ruling power, the flatterers with the tyrants and the demagogues with democracies of this kind. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And these men cause the resolutions of the assembly to be supreme and not the laws, by referring all things to the people; for they owe their rise to greatness to the fact that the people is sovereign over all things while they are sovereign over the opinion of the people, for the multitude believes them. Moreover those who bring charges against the magistrates say that the people ought to judge the suits, and the people receive the invitation gladly, so that all the magistracies are put down. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> And it would seem to be a reasonable criticism to say that such a democracy is not a constitution at all; for where the laws do not govern there is no constitution, as the law ought togovern all things while the magistrates control particulars, and we ought to judge this to be constitutional government; if then democracy really is one of the forms of constitution, it is manifest that an organization of this kind, in which all things are administered by resolutions of the assembly, is not even a democracy in the proper sense, for it is impossible for a voted resolution to be a universal rule.</p>

This among oligarchies is the form corresponding to tyranny among monarchies and to the form of democracy about which we spoke last among democracies, and indeed oligarchy of this sort has the special name of dynasty.<note resp="Rackham">Government controlled by a few powerful families.

For necessarily either all the parts of the population that have been mentioned must have a share in the government, or some and not others. When therefore the farmer class and the class possessed of moderate property is sovereign over the government, they govern according to laws; for they have a livelihood if they work, but are not able to be at leisure, so that they put the law in control and hold the minimum of assemblies necessary; and the other persons have the right to take part when they have acquired the property-assessment fixed by the laws, so that to take part in the government is open to all who have got that amount of property; since for it not to be open to everybody on any terms at all is a characteristic of oligarchy, but then on the other hand it is impossible for it to be open to them to have leisure if there are no revenues.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. revenues from abroad; the poor can only attend often if paid for attendance, and this can only be financed if the state has income from tribute or foreign property.</note> This then is one kind of democracy for these reasons. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Another kind is due to the distinction that comes next: it is possible that all the citizens not liable to objection on the score of birth may have the right to take part in the assembly, but may actually take part only when they are able to be at leisure; hence in a democracy of this nature the laws govern because there is no revenue. A third kind is when all those who are free men have the right to take part in the government yet do not do so because of the aforesaid reason, so that it follows that in this form of democracy also the law governs.</p></div>

Because the states have become much greater than the original ones and possess large supplies of revenue, while all the citizens have a share in the government because of the superiority<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1288a 20 ff.</note> of the multitude, all actually take part in it and exercise their citizenship because even the poor are enabled to be at leisure by receiving pay. Indeed the multitude in this kind of state has a very great deal of leisure, for they are not hampered at all by the care of their private affairs, but the rich are, so that often they take no part in the assembly nor in judging lawsuits. Owing to this the multitude of the poor becomes sovereign over the government, instead of the laws. Such in number and in nature are the kinds of democracy that these causes necessarily bring into existence. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> To turn to the varieties and of oligarchy, when more men possess property, but less of it and not a very large amount, this is the first form of oligarchy; for they allow the man that acquires property the right to participate, and because there is a large number of persons participating in the government it necessarily follows that not the men but the law is sovereign (for the farther removed they are from monarchy, and as they have not so much property as to be idle and neglect it, nor yet so little as to be kept at the expense of the state,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they are compelled to call upon the law to rule instead of ruling themselves). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> But then if the owners of the properties are fewer than those who owned them previously, and own more, the second form of oligarchy comes into being; for as they become stronger they claim to have a larger share, and therefore they themselves select those from among the rest of the citizens who go into the government, but as they are not yet strong enough to rule without law they make the law conform with this.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. they legalize the recruiting of the ruling class by co-optation; or the words may mean <q rend="single">they make the law ruler.</q></note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> And if they carry matters further by becoming fewer and holding larger properties, there comes about the third advance in oligarchy, which consists in their keeping the offices in their own hands, but under a law enacting that they are to be hereditary. And when finally they attain very great pre-eminence by their wealth and their multitude of friends, a dynasty of this nature is near to monarchy, and men become supreme instead of the law; and this is the fourth kind of oligarchy, the counterpart of the last kind of democracy. </p>

For even in the states that do not pay any public attention to virtue there are nevertheless some men that are held in high esteem and are thought worthy of respect. Where then the constitution takes in view wealth and virtue as well as the common people, as for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, this is of the nature of an aristocracy; and so also are the states, in which the constitution, like that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, takes in view two of these things only, virtue and the common people, and there is a mingling of these two factors, democracy and virtue. These then are two kinds of aristocracy beside the first, which is the best constitution,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a third kind is those instances of what is called constitutional government that incline more in the direction of oligarchy.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_6"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  It remains for us to speak about what is termed constitutional government and also about tyranny. Though neither the former nor the aristocracies spoken of just now are really deviations, we have classed them thus because in actual truth they have all fallen away from the most correct constitution, and consequently are counted with the deviation-forms, and those are deviations from them, as we said in our remarks at the beginning.<note resp="Rackham">See 1279b 4 ff. Actual aristocracies are a falling-off from the Aristocracy and Polity is a decline from Monarchy and Aristocracy; but they are not deviations in the technical sense.</note> Tyranny is reasonably mentioned last because it is the least constitutional of all governments, whereas our investigation is about constitutional government.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)">Having then stated the reason for this mode of classification, we have now to set forth our view about constitutional government. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> For its meaning is clearer now that the characteristics of oligarchy and democracy have been defined; since constitutional government is, to put it simply, a mixture of oligarchy and democracy. But people customarily give the name of constitutional government only to those among such mixed constitutions that incline towards democracy, and entitle those that incline more towards oligarchy aristocracies, because education and good birth go more with the wealthier classes, and also the wealthy are thought to have already the things to get which wrongdoers commit wrong; owing to which people apply the terms <q rend="single">gentry</q> and <q rend="single">notabilities</q> to the rich.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Since therefore aristocracy means the assignment of the highest place to the best of the citizens, oligarchies also are said to be drawn rather from the gentry. </p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1294a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And it seems an impossibility for a city governed not by the aristocracy but by the base to have well-ordered government, and similarly also for a city that has not a well-ordered government to be governed aristocratically. But to have good laws enacted but not obey them does not constitute well-ordered government. Hence one form of good government must be understood to consist in the laws enacted being obeyed, and another form in the laws which the citizens keep being well enacted (for it is possible to obey badly enacted laws). And for laws to be well enacted is possible in two ways: they must either be the best laws possible for the given people or the best absolutely. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> But aristocracy in the fullest sense seems to consist in the distribution of the honors according to virtue; for virtue is the defining factor of aristocracy, as wealth is of oligarchy, and freedom of democracy (while the principle that a decision of the majority is supreme is found in them all: for in both oligarchy and aristocracy and democracies whatever the larger part of those who have a share in the government decides is supreme). In most states<note resp="Rackham">i.e. in most states that are considered aristocracies.</note> then the name of aristocracy is given to that form of constitutional government,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. the more oligarchical form, 1293b 36.</note> for the combination aims only at the well-off and the poor, wealth and freedom (since in almost the largest number of states the rich seem to occupy the place of the gentry); <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  butas there are three things that claim equal participation<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the constitution, freedom, wealth and virtue (for the fourth, what is called nobility, accompanies the two latter—nobility means ancient wealth and virtue), it is manifest that the mixture of the two factors, the rich and the poor,<note resp="Rackham">Loosely put for <q rend="single">wealth and free birth.</q></note> ought to be termed constitutional government, while the mixture of the three factors deserves the name of aristocracy most of all the various forms of aristocracy beside the true and best form.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)">It has then been stated that other forms of constitution also exist besides monarchy, democracy and oligarchy, and what their characteristics are, and how the various sorts of aristocracy and of constitutional government differ from one another; and it is manifest that aristocracy and constitutional government are not widely apart from one another.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_7"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Next to what has been said let us state the way in which what is called constitutional government comes into existence by the side of democracy and oligarchy, and how it is proper to establish it. At the same time the defining characteristics of democracy and oligarchy will also be clear; for we must grasp the distinction between these and then make a combination out of them, taking, so to say, a contribution from each. And there are three principles determining this combination or mixture.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  Under one plan we must adopt both features from the legislative schemes of the two different constitutions: for example, in regard to the administration of justice, in oligarchies they institute a fine for the rich if they do not serve on juries but no pay for the poor for serving, while in democracies they assign pay for the poor but no fine for the rich, but a common and intermediate principle is to have both payment and fine, and therefore this is a mark of a constitutional government, since it is a mixture of elements from both oligarchy and democracy.</p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1294b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  This then is one mode of combining the two. Another is to take the middle course between the regulations of each: for example, democracies permit membership of the assembly on no property-qualification at all or a quite small one, oligarchies on a large property-qualification, but the combination clearly is to have neither principle, but one which lies in the middle between either of these two qualifications. In the third place is a combination of the two systems, taking some features from the oligarchical law and some from the democratic; I mean, for example, that it is thought to be democratic for the offices to be assigned by lot, for them to be elected oligarchic, and democratic for them not to have a property-qualification, oligarchic to have one; therefore it is aristocratic and constitutional to take one feature from one form and the other from the other, from oligarchy that offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a property-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a democracy and as an oligarchy; for manifestly this is so when it is said because they have been mixed well, and this is the case with the form that lies in the middle, for each of the two extreme forms can be seen in it.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>This is the case with the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. For many people<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>endeavor to describe it as being a democracy, because its system has many democratic features, for instance first of all its regulation for the rearing of boys, since the sons of the rich are brought up in the same way as those of the poor, and are educated in a manner in which the sons of the poor also could be educated, and they are also treated similarly at the next age, and in the same manner when they are grown up, for there is nothing that distinguishes the rich man from the poor man—thus the arrangements for food are the same for all at the common messes, and the rich wear clothes such as even any poor man could procure, and also because of the two greatest offices the common people elect to one and share in the other (they elect the Elders and share in the Ephorate); but others call it an oligarchy, because it has many oligarchical features, for instance that all the offices are elective and none appointed by lot and few persons have the power to sentence to death and exile, and a number of other such matters. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> But in a well-constructed mixed constitution both of the two factors, and neither of them,<note resp="Rackham">A conjectural emendation removes this mysterious epigram, giving <q rend="single">and not one of the two (only).</q></note> should seem to be present, and it should be kept safe by its own means and not by outside aid, and by its own means not because those who desire its security are more numerous outside it<note resp="Rackham">Or, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξωθεν</foreign> is an interpolation, <q rend="single">not merely because those (citizens) who wish it to survive are more numerous (than those who do not).</q></note> (for even a bad constitution might possess this quality), but because no section of the state whatever would even wish for another constitution.</p>

The nature of kingship we have defined in our first discourses,<note resp="Rackham">Book 3.9-12.</note> in which we examined the question in relation to the constitution most commonly denoted by the term <q rend="single">kingship,</q> whether it is disadvantageous or an advantage to states, <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>and what person ought to be set up as king, and from what source, and by what procedure; and in the passage in which we were considering kingship we distinguished two kinds of tyranny, because their power in a manner borders upon royalty, because both these forms of rule are in accordance with law (for among some of the barbarians they elect monarchic rulers with autocratic powers, and also in old times among the ancient Greeks some men used to become monarchs of this sort, the rulers called <emph>aesymnetae</emph>), but these two forms of tyranny have certain differences from one another, although they were on the one hand of the nature of royalty because they were in accordance with law and because they exercised monarchic rule over willing subjects, and on the other hand of the nature of a tyranny because they ruled despotically and according to their own judgement. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  But there is a third kind of tyranny which is thought to be tyranny in the fullest degree, being the counterpart of universal kingship; to this sort of tyranny must necessarily belong a monarchy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that exercises irresponsible rule over subjects all of the same or of a higher class with a view to its own private interest and not in the interest of the persons ruled. Hence it is held against the will of the subjects, since no free man willingly endures such rule.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">These then are the kinds of tyranny and such is their number, for the reasons stated.</p> 
   <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_9"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  But what is the best constitution and what is the best mode of life for most cities and most of mankind, if we do not judge by the standard of a virtue that is above the level of private citizens or of an education that needs natural gifts and means supplied by fortune, norby the standard of the ideal constitution, but of a mode of life able to be shared by most men and a constitution possible for most states to attain?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  For the constitutions called aristocracies, of which we spoke just now,<note resp="Rackham">See 1293b 7-21, cf. 1293b 36-1294a 25.</note> in some cases fall somewhat out of the scope of most states, and in others approximate to what is called constitutional government, so that it is proper to speak of these two forms as if they were one. And indeed the decision in regard to all these questions is based on the same elementary principles. For if it has been rightly said in the<title>Ethics</title> <note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1101a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1101a 14</bibl>.</note> that the happy life is the life that is lived without impediment in accordance with virtue, and that virtue is a middle course, it necessarily follows that the middle course of life is the best—such a middle course as it is possible for each class of men to attain.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  And these same criteria must also necessarily apply to the goodness and badness of a state, and of a constitution—for a constitution is a certain mode of life of a state.</p></div>

Since then it is admitted that what is moderate or in the middle is best, it is manifest that the middle amount of all of the good things of fortune is the best amount to possess.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> For this degree of wealth is the readiest to obey reason, whereas for a person who is exceedingly beautiful or strong or nobly born or rich, or the opposite—exceedingly poor or weak or of very mean station, it is difficult to follow the bidding of reason; for the former turn more to insolence and grand wickedness, and the latter overmuch to malice and petty wickedness, and the motive of all wrongdoing is either insolence or malice. And moreover the middle class are the least inclined to shun office and to covet office,<note resp="Rackham">The text is an emendation; some MSS. give <q rend="single">to rule the tribe and to rule the council,</q> but most have <q rend="single">to love office and rule the council,</q> apparently thinking that the verb translated <q rend="single">rule the council</q> meant <q rend="single">wish office.</q></note> and both these tendencies are injurious to states. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And in addition to these points, those who have an excess of fortune’s goods, strength, wealth, friends and the like, are not willing to be governed and do not know how to be (and they have acquired this quality even in their boyhood from their homelife, which was so luxurious that they have not got used to submitting to authority even in school), while those who are excessively in need of these things are too humble. Hence the latter class do not know how to govern but know how to submit to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>government of a servile kind, while the former class do not know how to submit to any government, and only know how to govern in the manner of a master.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> The result is a state consisting of slaves and masters, not of free men, and of one class envious and another contemptuous of their fellows. This condition of affairs is very far removed from friendliness, and from political partnership—for friendliness is an element of partnership, since men are not willing to be partners with their enemies even on a journey. But surely the ideal of the state is to consist as much as possible of persons that are equal and alike, and this similarity is most found in the middle classes; therefore the middle-class state will necessarily be best constituted in respect of those elements<note resp="Rackham">Probably Lambinus’s alteration of the Greek should be accepted, giving <q rend="single">hence that state will necessarily be best governed which consists of those elements—.</q></note> of which we say that the state is by nature composed. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> And also this class of citizens have the greatest security in the states; for they do not themselves covet other men’s goods as do the poor, nor do the other classes covet their substance as the poor covet that of the rich; and because they are neither plotted against nor plotting they live free from danger. Because of this it was a good prayer of Phocylides<note resp="Rackham">A gnomic poet of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, born <date when="-0560">560</date> B.C.</note>— <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">In many things the middle have the best;</l> <l>Be mine a middle station.</l> </quote>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  It is clear therefore also that the political community administered by the middle class is the best, and that it is possible for those states to be well governed that are of the kind in which the middle class is numerous, and preferably stronger than both the other two classes, or at all events than one of them, for by throwing in its weight it sways the balance and prevents the opposite extremes<note resp="Rackham">i.e. extreme democracy and very limited oligarchy.</note> from coming into existence.

The cause of this we will speak of later in our treatment of political revolutions. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> That the middle form of constitution is the best is evident; for it alone is free from faction, since where the middle class is numerous, factions and party divisions among the citizens are least likely to occur. And the great states are more free from faction for the same reason, because the middle class is numerous, whereas in the small states it is easy to divide the whole people into two parties leaving nothing in between, and also almost everybody is needy or wealthy. Also democracies are more secure and more long-lived than oligarchies owing to the citizens of the middle class (for they are more numerous and have a larger share of the honors in democracies than in oligarchies), since when the poor are in a majority without the middle class, adversity sets in and they are soon ruined. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> And it must be deemed a significant fact that the best lawgivers are from among the middle citizens; for Solon was of that class,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as appears from his poetry, and so was Lycurgus (for he was not a king) and Charondas and almost the greatest number of the other lawgivers.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">And these considerations also show the reason why the constitutions of most states are either democratic or oligarchical; owing to the middle class in these states being often a small one, the classes diverging from the middle status—whichever of the two, the owners of the estates or the people, from time to time has the upper hand—conduct the government on their own lines, so that it becomes either a democracy or an oligarchy.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  And in addition to this, because factions occur and fights between the people and the wealthy, whichever party happens to gain the upper hand over its opponents does not establish a common or equal government, but takes the superior share in the government as a prize of victory, and makes it a democracy in the one case and an oligarchy in the other. Moreover each of the two states that in the past held the leadership of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> took as a pattern the form of government that existed among themselves and set up in the one case democracies and in the other oligarchies in the cities, not considering the interest of the cities but their own advantage.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> Hence owing to these causes the middle form of constitution either never comes into existence or seldom and in few places; for one man<note resp="Rackham">It is quite uncertain who is meant, possibly Solon or Theramenes.</note> only among the states that have formerly held the leadership was induced to grant this form of organization, and by this time it has become a fixed habit with the people of the separate cities also not even to desire equality, </p></div>

For at each stage the form nearest to the best one must necessarily be superior, and the form that is more remote from the middle must be inferior—unless one is judging relatively to given conditions: I make this reservation because it is quite possible that although one form of constitution is preferable it may often be more advantageous for certain people to have another form.</p>

But every state consists of both quality and quantity: by quality I mean freedom, wealth, education, good birth, and by quantity the superior numbers of the multitude.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  And it is possible that,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>while the quality of the state belongs to one among the parts of which the state consists and its quantity to another part—for example the low-born may be more numerous than the noble or the poor than the rich, yet the more numerous class may not exceed in quantity as much as they fall behind in quality. Hence these two factors have to be judged in comparison with one another.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Where therefore the multitude of the poor exceeds in the proportion stated,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. so as to outbalance their inferiority in quality.</note> here it is natural for there to be democracy, and each kind of democracy in accordance with the superior number of the common people of each sort, for example if the number of the farming class exceeds, the first sort of democracy, but if that of the common laborers and wage-earners, the last sort, and similarly also with the other sorts that lie between these two;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  but where the class of the well-to-do and notable exceeds in quality more than it falls behind in quantity, here it is natural for there to be an oligarchy, and likewise the various kinds of oligarchy according to the degree of superiority<note resp="Rackham">i.e. superiority in quality.</note> of the oligarchical multitude.<note resp="Rackham">The word is loosely used of this small class.</note> But the lawgiver in his constitution must always take in the middle class; if he is making the laws of anoligarchical character he must keep the middle class in view, and if democratic, he must legislate so as to bring them in. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> And where the number of the middle class exceeds both the extreme classes together, or even one of them only, here it is possible for a constitutional government to be lasting; </p></div>

   <p> <milestone n="1297a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> for there is no fear of the rich ever coming to terms with the poor against this numerous middle class; for neither class will ever wish to be subject to the other, and if they look for another constitution fairer to both than this they will not find one, for they would not endure to take turns to govern because they distrust each other: everywhere it is the arbitrator that is most trusted, and the man in the middle is an arbitrator. And the better the constitution is mixed, the more permanent it is; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> and many even of those who want to establish aristocratic forms of constitution make a great mistake not only in giving too large a share to the well-to-do but also in cheating the people; for false benefits inevitably result ultimately in true evil, as the encroachments of the rich ruin the constitution more than those of the people. </p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  The artifices employed in constitutions as a pretext in regard to the people are five in number, and are concerned with the assembly, the magistracies, the law-courts, the bearing of heavy arms, and gymnastic exercises; in relation to the assembly, the granting to all of the right to attend but the imposition of a fine for non-attendance on the well-to-do only, or a much larger fine on them than others; in relation to the magistracies, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> the denial to the owners of rated property of the right to swear off serving, while the poor have this right; in relation to the law-courts, the imposition of a fine on the well-to-do if they do not serve on a jury, but no penalty for the poor, or else a large fine for the one class and a small one for the others, as in the laws of Charondas. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> In some places all have the right to serve in the assembly and on juries after having their names put on a register, but large fines are imposed on those who after so registering fail to attend in either capacity, in order that the fine may cause them to avoid registration and that owing to their not registering they may not serve on juries or in the assembly. They also legislate in the same manner about owning heavy arms and engaging in gymnastic exercises: the poor are not allowed to possess arms, but the well-to-do are liable to a fine if they have not got them, and there is no fine for the former class if they abstain from gymnastics, but the well-to-do are liable to a fine, in order that the one class because of the fine may take part in them and the other because they have no penalty to fear may not. These artifices of legislation then are of an oligarchic nature; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> in democracies they introduce contrary devices in regard to these matters: they provide pay for the poor for serving in the assembly and on juries and impose no fine upon the well-to-do for abstaining. Hence it is manifest that if anybody wishes to make a just blend, he must bring together the regulations existing in each of the two forms of constitution, and provide pay for attendance and a fine for non-attendance; for thus all would participate, whereas in the other way the government comes to be in the hands of only one of the two classes.</p></div>

Also people have a way of being reluctant to serve when there is a war if they do not get rations and are poor men but; if somebody provides food they want to fight. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> In some states the citizen-body consists not only of those who are serving as heavy-armed soldiers, but also of those who have so served; and at Malea the citizen-body consistedof these, while the magistrates were elected from those who were actually on service. And indeed the earliest form of constitution among the Greeks after the kingships consisted of those who were actually soldiers, the original form consisting of the cavalry （for war had its strength and its pre-eminence in cavalry, since without orderly formation heavy-armed infantry <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> is useless, and the sciences and systems dealing with tactics did not exist among the men of old times, so that their strength lay in their cavalry）; but as the states grew and the wearers of heavy armor had become stronger, more persons came to have a part in the government. Hence what we now call constitutional governments the men of former times called democracies; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> but the constitutional governments of early days were naturally oligarchical and royal, for owing to the smallness of the populations their middle class was not numerous, so that because of their small numbers as well as in conformity with the structure of the state the middle class more readily endured being in a subject position.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">It has then been said what is the reason of there being several forms of constitution, and why there are others besides those designated by name （for there is not one single democracy only, and similarly there are more than one of the other forms）, and also what are the differences between them and what is the reason why these differences occur, and in addition to these points, which is the best of the constitutions speaking generally, and of the other constitutions which sort is suited to which sort of people.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_11"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  And again, let us speak about the points that come next, both generally and with reference to each constitution separately, taking their appropriate starting-point. All forms of constitution then have three factors in reference to which the good lawgiver has to consider what is expedient for each constitution; and if these factors are well-ordered the constitution must of necessity be well-ordered, and the superiority of one constitution over another necessarily consists in the superiority of each of these factors. Of these three factors one is, what is to be the body that deliberates about the common interests, </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1298a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>second the one connected with the magistracies, that is, what there are to be and what matters they are to control, and what is to be the method of their election, and a third is, what is to be the judiciary.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">The deliberative factor is sovereign about war and peace and the formation and dissolution of alliances, and about laws, and about sentences of death and exile and confiscation of property, and about the audits of magistrates. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And necessarily either all these decisions must be assigned to all the citizens, or all to some of them (for instance to some one magistracy or to several), or different ones to different magistracies, or some of them to all the citizens and some to certain persons.</p> 
 <p rend="align(indent)">For all the citizens to be members of the deliberative body and to decide all these matters is a mark of a popular government, for the common people seek for equality of this nature.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> But there are several modes of such universal membership. One is for the citizens to serve in rotation and not all in a body (as is enacted in the constitution of the Milesian Telecles,<note resp="Rackham">Otherwise unknown</note> and in other constitutions also the boards of magistrates deliberate in joint assemblies but all the citizens enter into the magistracies from the tribes or from the very smallest sections of the citizen-body in rotation until office has gone through the whole body), and for there to be joint assemblies only to consider legislation and reforms of the constitution and to hear the reports submitted by the magistrates.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  Another mode is<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for all to assemble in a body, but only for the purpose of electing magistrates, enacting laws, considering the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace and holding the audit of magistrates, but for all other matters to be considered by the magistrates appointed to deal with each respectively and elected by suffrage or by lot from all the citizens. Another mode is for the citizens to meet about the magistracies and the audits and in order to deliberate about declaring war and concluding an alliance, but for all other matters to be dealt with by the magistrates, elected by suffrage in as many cases as circumstances allow,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. in an advanced democracy.</note> and such magistracies are all those which must of necessity be filled by experts. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  A fourth mode is for all to meet in council about all matters, and for the magistracies to decide about nothing but only to make preliminary decisions; this is the mode in which democracy in its last form is administered at the present day—the form of democracy which we pronounce to correspond to dynastic oligarchy and to tyrannical monarchy.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  These modes then are all of them democratic. On the other hand for some persons to deliberate upon all matters is oligarchic. But this also has several variations. For when the members of the deliberative body are elected on comparatively moderate property-qualifications, and the eligible persons are comparatively numerous because of the moderateness of the qualification, and when they do not make changes in things in which the law forbids it but follow the law, and when anybody acquiring the property-qualification is allowed to become a member, a constitution of this sort is indeed an oligarchy, but one of the nature of constitutional government, because of its moderation. When on the other hand not everybody thus qualified participates in deliberation but only certain persons previously chosen by election, </p></div>
   
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:4" n="1298b">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1298b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and these govern in accordance with law as in the former case, this is oligarchical; and also when the deliberative officials are elected by co-optation, and when the office is hereditary and has supreme control over the laws, this system is bound to be oligarchical. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> But when certain persons control certain matters, for instance when all the citizens control decisions as to war and peace and the audit of officials while everything else is controlled by magistrates and these are elected by vote, not by lot,<note resp="Rackham">The MSS. give <q rend="single">or by lot.</q></note> the constitution is an aristocracy; while if some matters are controlled by magistrates elected by vote and others by magistrates chosen by lot, and this either directly or from a list previously selected by vote, or if magistrates elected by vote and by lot sit in a joint body, some of these regulations are features of an aristocratic constitution and others of constitutional government itself.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">We have then in this way distinguished the different kinds of deliberative body in relation to the forms of constitution, and each form of constitution carries on the administration in accordance with the distinction stated.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  But for a democracy of the form that at the present day is considered to be democracy in the fullest degree (and I mean one of the sort in which the people is sovereign even over the laws) it is advantageous for the improvement of its deliberative function for it to do the same as is done in oligarchies in the matter of the law-courts (for they enact a fine to compel the attendance on juries of those whom they want to attend, whereas democratic states institute payment for attendance for the benefit of the poor), and also to do this in respect of the assemblies<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for they will deliberate better when all are deliberating jointly, the common people when with the notables and these when with the masses), and it is also advantageous for those who deliberate to be elected by vote or by lot equally from the different sections, and, if the men of the people far exceed the political class in number, it is advantageous either not to give pay to all but only to as many as are commensurate with the number of the notables, or to discard by lot those who exceed this number.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  In oligarchies on the other hand it is advantageous either to co-opt some persons from the multitude, or to institute an office like the one that exists in certain constitutional governments under the flame of Preliminary Councillors or Guardians of the Law,<note resp="Rackham">There were <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> as well as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> and an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοφύλακες</foreign> at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and elsewhere: at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> they sat with the presidents of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign> to check illegal procedure.</note> and deal with the matters about which these officials have held a preliminary deliberation (for thus the common people will have a share in deliberation and will not have the power to abolish any part of the constitution), and then for the people by their vote either to confirm or at all events not to pass anything contrary to the resolutions brought before them, or to allow all to take part in debate but only the magistrates to frame resolutions;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  and in fact it is proper to do just the opposite of what takes place in constitutionally governed states; for the common people ought to be given power to vote the rejection of a measure, but not to vote its ratification, but it should be referred back to the magistrates. In constitutional governments the procedure is the reverse; the few are competent to vote the rejection of a resolution but are not competent to vote its ratification, this being always referred back to the most numerous body.</p></div>

  <p rend="align(indent)"><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1299a"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Let us then decide in this manner about the deliberative body, which in fact is the sovereign power in the constitution.</p>
    <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_12"/>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Connected with this subject is the determination in regard to the magistracies (for this part of the constitution also has many varieties), how many magistracies there are to be, and what are to be their powers, and what their various periods of tenure (for some people make their magistracies tenable for six months, others for less, others for a year and others for a longer period)—shall the magistracies be for life or for a long period, or if for a shorter term shall the same people be allowed to hold them several times or not the same man twice but once only? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> and also as to the appointment of magistrates, who shall be eligible, who the electors, and what the mode of election? For on all these points it is needful to be able to determine how many modes of procedure are possible, and then to settle what modes are expedient for what sorts of constitution. Nor is it easy to decide to what kinds of office the name of magistracy ought to be applied; for the political community requires a great many officials, owing to which it is not proper to reckon all of them magistrates, whether elected by vote or by lot,—for instance first the priests (for this office must be considered as something different from the political magistracies), and again there are leaders of choruses, and heralds, and persons are also elected as ambassadors. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  And of the offices exercising superintendence some are political, and are exercised either over the whole of the citizens in regard to some operation—for instance ageneral superintends them when serving as soldiers, or over a section—for instance the superintendent of women or of children; while others are economic (for states often elect officers to dole out corn<note resp="Rackham">Distributions of corn were made at times of scarcity, or when the state had received a present of corn.</note>); and others are subordinate, and are the sort of services to which people when well off appoint slaves. But the title of magistracy, to put it simply, is chiefly to be applied to all those offices to which have been assigned the duties of deliberating about certain matters and of acting as judges and of issuing orders, and especially the last, for to give orders is most characteristic of authority. But this question is of virtually no practical importance (for no decision has yet been given, our discussion being merely about the name), although it does admit of some further inquiry of a speculative kind. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> On the other hand the questions what kinds and what number of magistracies are necessary to constitute a state at all, and what kinds although not necessary are advantageous for a good constitution, are questions that might preferablybe discussed, both indeed as regards every form of constitution and particularly in regard to the small states. For it is true that in the large states it is possible and proper for one magistracy to be assigned to one function (for the large number of the citizens makes it possible for many people to enter on an official career, so as to intermit their tenure of some offices for a long time and to hold others only once, and also every task is better attended to if the attention is directed to one thing only than if it is busy with many); </p></div>

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1299b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  but in the small states it is inevitable that many offices must be gathered into few hands (for owing to shortage of manpower it is not easy for many people to be in office, since who will take over the posts as their successors?). But sometimes small states require the same magistracies and laws as large ones except that the latter require the same persons to serve often, but in the former this only occurs after a long interval. Hence it is possible to assign several duties to one man at the same time (since they will not interfere with one another), and to meet the shortage of man-power it is necessary to make the magistracies like spit-lampholders.<note resp="Rackham">An implement (its exact shape does not appear to be known) used by soldiers on campaign, here mentioned as an illustration of one tool serving two purposes, cf. 1252b 1.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> If therefore we are able to say how many magistracies every state must necessarily possess and how many, though not absolutely necessary, it ought to possess, knowing these points one might more easily make a combination of those magistracies which are of a suitable nature to be combined into a single office. And it is suitable for the further question not to be overlooked, what kinds of matters ought to be attended to by a number of officials locally distributed and what ought to be under the authority of one magistrate for all localities, for example should good order be seen to in the market-place by a Controller of the Market and elsewhere by another official, or everywhere by the same one? and ought the offices to be divided according to the function or according to the persons concerned—I mean, for instance, should there be a single official in control of good order, or a different one<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for children and for women?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> and also under the various constitutions does the nature of the magistracies vary in accordance with each or does it not vary at all—for example in democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy and monarchy are the magistracies the same in their powers, although they are not filled from equal ranks nor from similar classes but are different in different constitutions (for example in aristocracies drawn from the educated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies from the free), or although some constitutions happen to be correspondent with the actual differences of their magistracies, yet in other cases are the same magistracies advantageous even where the constitutions differ (for in some places it is suitable for the same magistracies to have large functions and in other places small ones)?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> Not but what there are also some offices peculiar to special forms of constitution, for instance the office of Preliminary Councillors.<note resp="Rackham">See 1298b 29 n.</note> This is undemocratic, although a Council is a popular body, for there is bound to be some body of this nature to have the duty of preparing measures for the popular assembly, in order that it may be able to attend to its business; but a preparatory committee, if small, is oligarchical, and Preliminary Councillors must necessarily be few in number, so that they are an oligarchical element. But where both of these magistracies exist, the Preliminary Councillors are in authority over the Councillors, since a councillor is a democratic official, but a preliminary councillor is an oligarchic one.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Also the power of the Council is weakened in democracies of the sort in which the people in assembly deals with everything itself; </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1300a"/> <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this usually happens when there is a plentiful supply of pay for those who attend the assembly, for being at leisure they meet frequently and decide all things themselves. But a Superintendent of Children and a Superintendent of Women, and any other magistrates that exercise a similar sort of supervision, are an aristocratic feature, and not democratic (for how is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors<note resp="Rackham">Or possibly <q rend="single">from going in processions</q>: Solon made regulations <quote xml:lang="grc">ταῖς ἐξόδοις τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τοῖς πένθεσι καὶ ταῖς ἑορταῖς</quote>(<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 21">Plut. Sol. 21</bibl>).</note>?) nor yet oligarchic (for the wives of oligarchic rulers are luxurious). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> But let the discussion of these matters go no further at present, and let us attempt to go through from the beginning the question of the ways of appointing the magistrates. The varieties here depend on three determinants, the combinations of which must give all the possible modes. One of these three determining points is, who are the persons who appoint the magistrates? the second is, from whom? and last, in what manner? And of each of these three determinants there are three variations: either all the citizens appoint or some, and either from all or from a certain class (defined for instance by property-assessment or birth or virtue or some other such qualification, as at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> only those were eligible who returned in a body from exile and fought together against the common people),<note resp="Rackham">It is quite uncertain when this event took place and whether it is the same as those referred to at 1302b 30 f. and l304b 34 ff.</note> and the mode of appointment may be either by vote or by lot; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  again, these systems may be coupled together—<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>I mean that some citizens may appoint to some offices but all to others, and to some offices all citizens may be eligible but to others only a certain class, and to some appointment may be by vote but to others by lot. And of each variation of these determinants there will be four modes: either all citizens may appoint from all by vote, or all from all by lot—and from all either section by section, for instance by tribes or demes or brotherhoods until the procedure has gone through all the citizens, or from the whole number every time,—or else partly in one way and partly in the other. Again, if the electors are some of the citizens, they must either appoint from all by vote, or from all by lot, or from some by vote, or from some by lot, or partly in one way and partly in the other—I mean partly by vote and partly by lot. Hence the modes prove to be twelve, apart from the two combinations. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> And among these, two ways of appointment are democratic—for all to appoint from all by vote, or by lot, or by both—some offices by lot and others by vote; but for not all to be the electors and for them to appoint simultaneously, and either from all or from some either by lot or by vote or by both, or some offices from all and others from some by both (by which I mean some by lot and others by vote) is constitutional. And for some to appoint from all, to some offices by vote and to others by lot or by both<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be rewritten to give <q rend="single">for some to appoint from all either by vote or by lot or by both.</q></note> (to some by lot and to others by vote) is oligarchical; and it is even more oligarchical to appoint from both classes. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> But to appoint some offices from all and the others from a certain class is constitutional with an aristocratic bias; </p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:4" n="1300b">
 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1300b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or to appoint some by vote and others by lot. And for a certain class to appoint from a certain class 〈by vote〉<note resp="Rackham">This insertion by Lambinus seems certain.</note> is oligarchical, and so it is for a certain class to appoint from a certain class by lot (although not working out in the same way), and for a certain class to appoint from a certain class by both methods. And for a certain class to make a preliminary selection from the whole body and then for all to appoint from among certain persons (thus selected) is aristocratic.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">So many in number therefore are the modes of appointing to the magistracies, and this is how the modes are classified according to the different constitutions; and what regulations are advantageous for what people and how the appointments ought to be conducted will be made clear at the same time as we consider what are the powers of the offices. By the power of an office I mean for instance the control of the revenues and the control of the guard; since a different sort of power belongs for example to a generalship and to the office that controls market contracts.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_13"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Of the three factors of a constitution it remains to speak of the judiciary, and of judicial bodies also we must consider the various modes, in accordance with the same plan. And a difference among judicial courts rests upon three determinants—constituents, sphere of action, and mode of appointment. As to their constituents I mean are the courts drawn from all the citizens or from a certain class? as to sphere of action, how many kinds of courts are there? and as to mode of appointment, are they appointed by lot or by vote? First then let us distinguish how many kinds of courts there are. They are eight in number, one a court of audit,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>another to deal with offenders against any public interest, another with matters that bear on the constitution, a fourth for both magistrates and private persons in disputes about penalties, fifth the court dealing with private contracts that are on an important scale, and beside these there is (6) the court that tries homicide, and (7) that which hears alien suits <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> (of courts of homicide there are four kinds, whether the jury is the same or different—namely, for cases of deliberate homicide, of involuntary homicide, of homicide admitted but claimed to be justifiable, and fourth to deal with charges of homicide brought against men that have fled from the country for homicide, upon their return,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. men that had been allowed to flee the country when charged with accidental homicide, and on their return were accused of another homicide, a willful murder.</note> such as at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for instance the Court at Phreatto is said to be, although such cases are of rare occurrence in the whole course of history, even in the great states and of the aliens’ court one branch hears suits of aliens against aliens and another of aliens against citizens); and also beside all of these there are (8) courts to try cases of petty contracts, involving sums of one drachma, five drachmas or a little more—for even these cases have to be tried, though they are not suitable for a numerous jury. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  But let us dismiss the subject of these petty suits, and the courts for homicide and those for aliens, and let us speak about political trials, which when not well conducted cause party divisions and revolutionary disturbances. And necessarily either all the judges of all the cases that have been classified will be appointed by vote, or by lot, or all in all cases partly by lot and partly by vote, or in some cases some judges will be appointed by lot and others by vote for the same case.</p></div>

  <p><milestone n="1301a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> These modes then are four in number, and the sectional modes also make as many others; for here again the judges for all cases may be drawn by vote from a certain class, or for all cases by lot from a certain class, or some courts may be appointed by lot and others by vote, or some courts may be composed of judges chosen by lot and by vote for the same cases. These then are the modes, as was said, corresponding to those mentioned. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And there are also the same courts in combination—I mean for example some drawn from the whole body and some from a class and some from both, as for instance if the same court contained some members from the whole body and others from a class, and appointed either by lot or by vote or both. We have then stated all the modes in which it is possible for the courts to be composed; and of these the first set, drawn from all the citizens and dealing with all cases, are popular, the second, drawn from a certain class to deal with all cases, are oligarchic, and the third, drawn partly from all and partly from a certain class, are suited to an aristocracy and to a constitutional government.</p></div></div>

There must follow the consideration of the questions, what are the number and the nature of the causes that give rise to revolutions in constitutions, and what are the causes that destroy each form of constitution, and out of what forms into what forms do they usually change, and again what are the safeguards of constitutions in general and of each form in particular, and what are the means by which the safeguarding of each may best be put into effect.<note resp="Rackham">For this distinction between broad methods of guarding against revolution and the practical means by which those methods can be put into effect Newman compares 9.2 f., 10 f.; 4.2.5 fin., 6.1.1.</note> </p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And we must first assume the starting-point, that many forms of constitution have come into existence with everybody agreeing as to what is just, that is proportionate equality, but failing to attain it (as has also been said before). Thus democracy arose from men’s thinking that if they are equal in any respect they are equal absolutely (for they suppose that because they are all alike free they are equal absolutely), oligarchy arose from their assuming that if they are unequal as regards some one thing they are unequal wholly (for being unequal in property they assume that they are unequal absolutely); <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> and then the democrats claim as being equal to participate in all things in equal shares, while the oligarchs as being unequal seek to have a larger share, for a larger share is unequal. All these forms of constitution then have some element of justice, but from an absolute point of view they are erroneous; and owing to this cause, when each of the two parties has not got the share in the constitution which accords with the fundamental assumption that they happen to entertain, faction ensues. And of all men those who excel in virtue would most justifiably stir up faction, though they are least given to doing so; </p></div>

And there are some men who being superior in birth claim unequal rights because of this inequality; for persons who have ancestral virtue and wealth behind them are thought to be noble.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  These then roughly speaking are the starting-points and sources of factions, which give rise to party strife (and revolutions due to this take place in two ways: sometimes they are in regard to the constitution, and aim at changing from the one established to another, for instance from democracy to oligarchy, or to democracy from oligarchy, or from these to constitutional government and aristocracy, or from those to these; but sometimes the revolution is not in regard to the established constitution, but its promoters desire the same form of government, for instance oligarchy or monarchy, but wish it to be in their own control.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Again it may be a question of degree; for instance, when there is an oligarchy the object may be to change to a more oligarchical government or to a less, or when there is a democracy to a more or to a less democratic government, and similarly in the case of the remaining constitutions, the aim may be either to tighten them up or to relax them. Or again the aim may be to change a certain part of the constitution, for example to establish or abolish a certain magistracy, as according to some accounts Lysander<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>attempted to abolish the kingship at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and the king Pausanias the ephorate<note resp="Rackham">See 1307a 34 n.</note>; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> and also at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> the constitution was altered in part, for they set up a council instead of the tribal rulers, and it is still compulsory for the magistrates alone of the class that has political power to come to the popular assembly when an appointment to a magistracy is put to the vote; and the single supreme magistrate was also an oligarchical feature in this constitution). For party strife is everywhere due to inequality, where classes that are unequal do not receive a share of power in proportion (for a lifelong monarchy is an unequal feature when it exists among equals); for generally the motive for factious strife is the desire for equality. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  But equality is of two kinds, numerical equality and equality according to worth—by numerically equal I mean that which is the same and equal in number or dimension, by equal according to worth that which is equal by proportion<note resp="Rackham">This ethical arithmetic is helped out in Greek by the fact that, even without the qualification <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ’ ἀξίαν, ἴσος</foreign> often means <q rend="single">equal to desert,</q> fair, just.</note>; for instance numerically 3 exceeds 2 and 2 exceeds 1 by an equal amount, but by proportion 4 exceeds 2 and 2 exceeds 1 equally, since 2 and 1 are equal parts of 4 and 2, both being halves. But although men agree that the absolutely just is what is according to worth, they disagree (as was said before<note resp="Rackham">See 1301a 27 ff. and note.</note>) in that some think that if they are equal in something they are wholly equal, and others claim that if they are unequal in something they deserve an unequal share of all things. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> Owing to this two principal varieties of constitution come into existence, democracy and oligarchy; for noble birth and virtue are found in few men,</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:5" n="1302a">
<p>but the qualifications specified<note resp="Rackham">That is, numbers and wealth.</note> in more:  <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1302a"/> <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>nowhere are there a hundred men nobly born and good, but there are rich men<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be emended to give <q rend="single">there are many rich men and poor men in many places.</q></note> in many places. But for the constitution to be framed absolutely and entirely according to either kind of equality is bad. And this is proved by experience, for not one of the constitutions formed on such lines is permanent. And the cause of this is that it is impossible for some evil not to occur ultimately from the first and initial error that has been made. Hence the proper course is to employ numerical equality in some things and equality according to worth in others.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> But nevertheless democracy is safer and more free from civil strife than oligarchy; for in oligarchies two kinds of strife spring up, faction between different members of the oligarchy and also faction between the oligarchs and the people, whereas in democracies only strife between the people and the oligarchical party occurs, but party strife between different sections of the people itself does not occur to any degree worth mentioning. And again the government formed of the middle classes is nearer to the people than to the few, and it is the safest of the kinds of constitution mentioned.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> And since we are considering what circumstances give rise to party factions and revolutions in constitutions, we must first ascertain their origins and causes generally. They are, speaking roughly, three in number,<note resp="Rackham">Viz. the material, final and efficient causes of revolutions (Jowett).</note> which we must first define in outline separately.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we must ascertain what state of affairs gives rise to party strife, and for what objects it is waged, and thirdly what are the origins of political disorders and internal party struggles.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Now the principal cause, speaking generally, of the citizens being themselves disposed in a certain manner towards revolution is the one about which we happen to have spoken already. Those that desire equality enter on party strife if they think that they have too little although they are the equals of those who have more, while those that desire inequality or superiority do so if they suppose that although they are unequal they have not got more but an equal amount or less <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> (and these desires may be felt justly, and they may also be felt unjustly); for when inferior, people enter on strife in order that they may be equal, and when equal, in order that they may be greater. We have therefore said what are the states of feeling in which men engage in party strife.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The objects about which it is waged are gain and honor, and their opposites, for men carry on party faction in states in order to avoid dishonor and loss, either on their own behalf or on behalf of their friends.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>   And the causes and origins of the disturbances which occasion the actual states of feeling described and their direction to the objects mentioned, according to one account happen to be seven in number, though according to another they are more. Two of them are the same as those spoken of before although not operating in the same way: the motives of gain and honor also stir men up against each other not in order that they may get them for themselves, as has been said before, </p></div>

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1302b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but because they see other men in some cases justly and in other cases unjustly getting a larger share of them. Other causes are insolence, fear, excessive predominance, contempt, disproportionate growth of power; and also other modes of cause<note resp="Rackham">The four causes now mentioned are those alluded to just above (1302a 38) as an addition to the seven enumerated above, 1302a 38-b 5.</note> are election intrigue, carelessness, pettiness, dissimilarity.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Among these motives the power possessed by insolence and gain, and their mode of operation, is almost obvious; for when the men in office show insolence and greed, people rise in revolt against one another and against the constitutions that afford the opportunity for such conduct; and greed sometimes preys on private property and sometimes on common funds. It is clear also what is the power of honor and how it can cause party faction; for men form factions both when they are themselves dishonored and when they see others honored; and the distribution of honors is unjust when persons are either honored or dishonored against their deserts, just when it is according to desert. Excessive predominance causes faction, when some individual or body of men is greater and more powerful than is suitable to the state and the power of the government; for such are the conditions that usually result in the rise of a monarchy or dynasty.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Owing to this in some places they have the custom of temporary banishment,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1284a 18.</note> as at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; yet it would be better to provide from the outset that there may be no persons in the state<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so greatly predominant, than first to allow them to come into existence and afterwards to apply a remedy. Fear is the motive of faction with those who have inflicted wrong and are afraid of being punished, and also with those who are in danger of suffering a wrong and wish to act in time before the wrong is inflicted, as the notables at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> banded together<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps in <date when="-0390">390</date> B.C., cf. 1302b 32 f. and 1304b 27 ff.</note> against the people because of the law-suits that were being brought against them.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Contempt is a cause of faction and of actual attacks, upon the government, for instance in oligarchies when those who have no share in the government are more numerous (for they think themselves the stronger party), and in democracies when the rich have begun to feel contempt for the disorder and anarchy that prevails, as for example at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> the democracy was destroyed owing to bad government after the battle of Oenophyta,<note resp="Rackham">Against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, <date when="-0456">456</date> B.C.</note> and that of the Megarians was destroyed when they had been defeated owing to disorder and anarchy,<note resp="Rackham">See 1300a 18 n.</note> and at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> before the tyranny<note resp="Rackham"> <date when="-0485">485</date> B.C.</note> of Gelo, and at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">See 1302b 23 n.</note> the common people had fallen into contempt before the rising against them.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> Revolutions in the constitutions also take place on account of disproportionate growth; for just as the body<note resp="Rackham">It is not clear whether what follows refers to a work of art (cf. 1284b 8) or is an exaggerated account of a disease; Galen describes one called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σατυρίασις</foreign>, in which the bones of the temple swell out like satyrs’ horns.</note> is composed of parts, and needs to grow proportionately in order that its symmetry may remain, and if it does not it is spoiled, when the foot is four cubits long and the rest of the body two spans, and sometimes it might even change into the shape of another animal if it increased disproportionately not only in size but also in quality,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. if, for example, the foot became as hard as a hoof.</note> so also a state is composed of parts, </p></div>

Another cause is alteration by small stages; by this I mean that often a great change of institutions takes place unnoticed when people overlook a small alteration, as in <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName> the property-qualification was small, and finally men hold office with none at all, as a little is near to nothing, or practically the same. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  Also difference of race is a cause of faction, until harmony of spirit is reached; for just as any chance multitude of people does not form a state, so a state is not formed in any chance period of time.

 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  Also states sometimes enter on faction for geographical reasons, when the nature of the country is not suited for there being a single city, as for example at Clazomenae<note resp="Rackham">Topography uncertain: Clazomenae near <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName> was partly on a small island, which Alexander joined to the mainland with a causeway.</note> the people near Chytrum are in feud with the inhabitants of the island, and the Colophonians and the Notians<note resp="Rackham"> <placeName key="perseus,Notium">Notium</placeName> was the port of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>.</note>; and at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the population is not uniformly democratic in spirit, but the inhabitants of <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName> are more so than those of the city.

Owing to this men who are exceptional in virtue generally speaking do not cause faction, because they find themselves few against many. Universally then in connection with all the forms of constitution the origins and causes of factions and revolutions are of this nature. </p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  The means used to cause revolutions of constitutions are sometimes force and sometimes fraud. Force is employed either when the revolutionary leaders exert compulsion immediately from the start or later on—as indeed the mode of using fraud is also twofold: sometimes the revolutionaries after completely deceiving the people at the first stage alter the constitution with their consent, but then at a later stage retain their hold on it by force against the people’s will: for instance, at the time of the Four Hundred,<note resp="Rackham">The oligarchy at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> <date when="-0411">411</date> B.C., cf. 1305a 27.</note> they deceived the people by saying that the Persian King would supply money for the war against the Spartans, and after telling them this falsehood endeavored to keep a hold upon the government; but in other cases they both persuade the people at the start and afterwards repeat the persuasion and govern them with their consent.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Speaking generally therefore in regard to all the forms of constitution, the causes that have been stated are those from which revolutions have occurred.</p>
 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_4"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> But in the light of these general rules we must consider the usual course of events<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as classified according to each different kind of constitution. In democracies the principal cause of revolutions is the insolence of the demagogues; for they cause the owners of property to band together, partly by malicious prosecutions of individuals among them (for common fear brings together even the greatest enemies), and partly by setting on the common people against them as a class. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And one may see this taking place in this manner in many instances. In Cos the democracy was overthrown<note resp="Rackham">Date unknown.</note> when evil demagogues had arisen there, for the notables banded themselves together; and also in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham">See 1302b 23 n.</note> for the demagogues used to provide pay for public services, and also to hinder the payment of money owed<note resp="Rackham">i.e. owed for repairs to the ships, and perhaps also for advances of pay to the crews.</note> to the naval captains, and these because of the lawsuits that were brought against them were forced to make common cause and overthrow the people. And also at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">Probably the Pontic Heraclea (cf. 1305b 5, 36, 1306a 37), founded middle of the 6th century B.C., not the Trachinian.</note> the people were put down immediately after the foundation of the colony because of the people’s leaders; for the notables being unjustly treated by them used to be driven out, but later on those who were driven out collecting together effected their return and put down the people. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And also the democracy at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> was put down in a similar manner<note resp="Rackham">See 1300a 18 ff. n.</note>; the people’s leaders in order to have money to distribute to the people went on expelling many of the notables, until they made the exiles a large body, and these came back and defeated the people in a battle and set up the oligarchy.  </p></div>
   
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:5" n="1305a">
  <p>And the same thing happened also at Cyme <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1305a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the time of the democracy which Thrasymachus put down<note resp="Rackham">An event otherwise unknown.</note>, and in the case of other states also examination would show that revolutions take place very much in this manner. Sometimes they make the notables combine by wronging them in order to curry favor, causing either their estates to be divided up or their revenues by imposing public services, and sometimes by so slandering them that they may have the property of the wealthy to confiscate. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And in old times whenever the same man became both leader of the people and general, they used to change the constitution to a tyranny; for almost the largest number of the tyrants of early days have risen from being leaders of the people. And the reason why this used to happen then but does not do so now is because then the leaders of the people were drawn from those who held the office of general (for they were not yet skilled in oratory), but now when rhetoric has developed the able speakers are leaders of the people, but owing to their inexperience in military matters they are not put in control of these, except in so far as something of the kind has taken place to a small extent in some places. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And tyrannies also used to occur in former times more than they do now because important offices were entrusted to certain men, as at <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName> a tyranny<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps that of Thrasybulus (<bibl n="Hdt. 1.20">Hdt. 1.20</bibl>), <date when="-0612">612</date> B.C.</note> arose out of the presidency (for the president had control of many important matters). And moreover, because the cities in those times were not large but the common people lived on their farms<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>busily engaged in agriculture, the people’s champions when they became warlike used to aim at tyranny. And they all used to do this when they had acquired the confidence of the people, and their pledge of confidence was their enmity towards the rich, as at Athens Pisistratus made himself tyrant by raising up a party against the men of the plain, and Theagenes at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> by slaughtering the cattle of the well-to-do which he captured grazing by the river, and Dionysius<note resp="Rackham">Dionysius the elder, see 1259a 29 n.</note> established a claim to become tyrant when he accused Daphnaeus and the rich, since his hostility to them caused him to be trusted as a true man of the people.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And revolutions also take place from the ancestral form of democracy to one of the most modern kind; for where the magistracies are elective, but not on property-assessments, and the people elect, men ambitious of office by acting as popular leaders bring things to the point of the people’s being sovereign even over the laws. A remedy to prevent this or to reduce its extent is for the tribes to elect the magistrates, and not the people collectively.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">These then are the causes through which almost all the revolutions in democracies take place.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_5"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Oligarchies undergo revolution principally through two ways that are the most obvious. One is if they treat the multitude unjustly; for anybody makes an adequate people’s champion, and especially so when their leader happens to come from the oligarchy itself, like Lygdamis at <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName>, who afterwards actually became tyrant of the Naxians.</p></div>

Sometimes when the honors of office are shared by very few, dissolution originates from the wealthy themselves,<note resp="Rackham">The contrasted case, of dissolution of oligarchy arising from the people, should follow, but is omitted.</note> but not those that are in office, as for example has occurred at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1321a 29 ff.</note> at <placeName key="tgn,6002796">Istrus</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham">Near the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>.</note> at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham">See 1304b 31 n.</note> and in other states; for those who did not share in the magistracies raised disturbances until as a first stage the older brothers were admitted, and later the younger ones again (for in some places a father and a son may not hold office together, and in others an elder and a younger brother may not). At <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> the oligarchy became more constitutional, while at <placeName key="tgn,6002796">Istrus</placeName> it ended in becoming democracy, and in <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> the government passed from a smaller number to six hundred. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> At <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName> also there was a revolution<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps not the same as the one mentioned at 1306b 3.</note> of the oligarchy caused by a faction formed by the notables against one another, because few shared in the government, and the rule stated held, that if a father was a member a son could not be, nor if there were several brothers could any except the eldest; for the common people seized the opportunity of their quarrel and, taking a champion from among the notables, fell upon them and conquered them, for a party divided against itself is weak.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Another case was at Erythrae,<note resp="Rackham">Just west of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>.

  <p rend="align(indent)">On the other hand, oligarchies are overthrown from within themselves both<note resp="Rackham">This sentence is interrupted by a parenthesis and is resumed in 5.6, <q rend="single">And revolution is oligarchy also—</q>.</note> when from motives of rivalry they play the demagogue (and this demagogy is of two sorts, one among the oligarchs themselves, for a demagogue can arise among them even when they are a very small body,—as for instance in the time of the Thirty at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the party of Charicles rose to power by currying popularity with the Thirty, and in the time of the Four Hundred<note resp="Rackham">See 1304b 12 n.</note> the party of Phrynichus rose in the same way,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>
the other when the members of the oligarchy curry popularity with the mob, as the Civic Guards at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">See 1275b 29 n.</note> courted popularity with the mob because it elected them, and in all the oligarchies in which the magistracies are not elected by the class from which the magistrates come but are filled from high property-grades or from political clubs while the electors are the heavy-armed soldiers or the common people, as used to be the case at <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName>, and in places where the jury-courts are not made up from the government<note resp="Rackham">i.e. (apparently) where membership is not confined to the class eligible for the magistracies.</note>—for there members of the oligarchy by courting popular favor with a view to their trials cause a revolution of the constitution, as took place at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> on the Euxine<note resp="Rackham">See 1304b 31 n.</note>; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> and a further instance is when some men try to narrow down the oligarchy to a smaller number, for those who seek equality are forced to bring in the people as a helper.) And revolutions in oligarchy also take place when they squander their private means by riotous living; for also men of this sort seek to bring about a new state of affairs, and either aim at tyranny themselves or suborn somebody else  </p></div>

On the other hand, harmonious oligarchy does not easily cause its own destruction; and an indication of this is the constitutional government at <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName>, for there the ruling class though few are masters of many men<note resp="Rackham">i.e. both of the lower classes and of the subject cities.</note> because on good terms with one another.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  Also oligarchical governments break up when they create a second oligarchy within the oligarchy.

<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> Revolutions<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of oligarchies occur both during war and in time of peace— during war since the oligarchs are forced by their distrust of the people to employ mercenary troops (for the man in whose hands they place them often becomes tyrant, as Timophanes did at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,<note resp="Rackham"> <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> was at war with <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> circa <date when="-0350">350</date> B.C. Timophanes was killed by his brother the famous Timoleon, in order to restore constitutional government.</note> and if they put several men in command, these win for themselves dynastic power), and when through fear of this they give a share in the constitution to the multitude, the oligarchy falls because they are compelled to make use of the common people; during peace, on the other hand, because of their distrust of one another they place their protection in the hands of mercenary troops and a magistrate between the two parties, who sometimes becomes master of both, which happened at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> in the time of the government of the Aleuadae led by Simus,<note resp="Rackham">A probable emendation of the Greek gives <q rend="single">happened at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> to Simus and his party at the time of the government of the Aleuadae.</q> This family were hereditary rulers of <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> (see also 1275b 29 ff. n., and 1305b 29 ff.)</note> and at <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName> in the time of the political clubs of which that of Iphiades was one. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> And factions arise also in consequence of one set of the members of the oligarchy themselves being pushed aside by another set and being driven into party strife in regard to marriages or law-suits; examples of such disorders arising out of a cause related to marriage are the instances spoken of before, and also the oligarchy of the knights at <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> was put down<note resp="Rackham">Possibly before the Persian wars.

And revolutions also occur from an accident, both in what is called a constitutional government and in those oligarchies in which membership of the council and the law-courts and tenure of the other offices are based on a property-qualification. For often the qualification first having been fixed to suit the circumstances of the time, so that in an oligarchy a few may be members and in a constitutional government the middle classes, when peace or some other good fortune leads to a good harvest it comes about that the same properties become worth many times as large an assessment, so that all the citizens share in all the rights, the change sometimes taking place gradually and little by little and not being noticed, but at other times more quickly.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/> Such then are the causes that lead to revolutions and factions in oligarchies (and generally, both democracies and oligarchies are sometimes altered not into the opposite forms of constitution but into ones of the same class, for instance<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>from legitimate democracies and oligarchies into autocratic ones and from the latter into the former).</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_6"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  In aristocracies factions arise in some cases because few men share in the honors (which has also been said<note resp="Rackham">See 1306a 13 ff.</note> to be the cause of disturbances in oligarchies, because an aristocracy too is a sort of oligarchy, for in both those who govern are few—although the reason for this is not the same in both—since this does cause it to be thought that aristocracy is a form of oligarchy). And this is most bound to come about when there is a considerable number of people who are proud-spirited on the ground of being equals in virtue (for example the clan called the Maidens’ Sons<note resp="Rackham">Said to be descended from irregular unions authorized in order to keep up population during the First Messenian War.

For what starts it in the case of a constitutional government is that it does not contain a good blend of democracy and oligarchy; and in the case of an aristocracy it is the lack of a good blend of those two elements and of virtue, but chiefly of the two elements (I mean popular government and oligarchy), for both constitutional governments and most of the constitutions that are called aristocracies aim at blending these. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  For this<note resp="Rackham">i.e. their mode of blending oligarchy and democracy.</note> is the point of distinction between aristocracies and what are called constitutional governments, and it is owing to this that some of them<note resp="Rackham">The writer loosely speaks of aristocracies and polities as a single class, differing only in degree of concentration of power in the hands of the upper classes.</note> are less and others more stable; for the constitutions inclining more towards oligarchy men call aristocracies and those inclining more to the side of the multitude constitutional governments, owing to which those of the latter sort are more secure than the others, for the greater number is the stronger, and also men are more content when they have an equal amount, whereas the owners of wealthy properties, if the constitution gives them the superior position,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>seek to behave insolently and to gain money. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And speaking broadly, to whichever side the constitution leans, that is the side to which it shifts as either of the two parties increases its own side—a constitutional government shifts to democracy and an aristocracy to oligarchy, or to the opposite extremes, that is, aristocracy to democracy (for the poorer people feeling they are unjustly treated pull it round to the opposite) and constitutional governments to oligarchy (for the only lasting thing is equality in accordance with desert and the possession of what is their own). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And the change mentioned<note resp="Rackham">i.e. from aristocracy to democracy. Possibly these events occurred after the defeat of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> in <date when="-0413">413</date> B.C., when the Athenian party at <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName> was banished (Lysias 835 D).

  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  Besides, as all aristocratic constitutions are inclined towards oligarchy, the notables grasp at wealth (for example at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> the estates are coming into a few hands); and the notables have more power to do what they like, and to form marriage connections with whom they like (which was the cause of the fall of the state of <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, as a result of the marriage with Dionysius,<note resp="Rackham">See 1259a 28 n.

For when they give up one of the details of the constitution, afterwards they also make another slightly bigger change more readily, until they alter the whole system. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> This occurred for instance with the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName>. There was a law that the office of general could be held at intervals of four years, but some of the younger men, becoming warlike and winning high repute with the mass of the guards, came to despise the men engaged in affairs, and thought that they would easily get control; so first they tried to repeal the law referred to, so as to enable the same persons to serve as generals continuously, as they saw that the people would vote for themselves with enthusiasm. And though the magistrates in charge of this matter, called the Councillors, at first made a movement to oppose them, they were won over, believing that after repealing this law they would allow the rest of the constitution to stand; but later, though they wished to prevent them when other laws were being repealed, they could no longer do anything more, but the whole system of the constitution was converted into a dynasty of the men who had initiated the innovations. </p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>   And constitutions of all forms<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are broken up some times from movements initiating from within themselves, but sometimes from outside, when there is an opposite form of constitution either near by or a long way off yet possessed of power.

For that equality which men of democratic spirit seek for in the case of the multitude is not only just but also expedient in the case of their compeers.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Hence if there are a greater number in the governing class, many of the legislative enactments of a democratic nature are advantageous, for example for the offices to be tenable for six months, to enable all the compeers to participate in them; for the compeers in this case are as it were the people (owing to which demagogues often arise even among them, as has been said already), and also oligarchies and aristocracies fall into dynasties less (for it is not so easy to do wrongs <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> when in office for a short time as when in for a long time, since it is long tenure of office that causes tyrannies to spring up in oligarchies and democracies; for either those who are the greatest men in either sort of state aim at tyranny, in the one sort the demagogues and in the other the dynasts, or those who hold the greatest offices, when they are in office for along time).  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> And constitutions are kept secure not only through being at a distance from destroyers but sometimes also through being near them,<note resp="Rackham">This modifies 1207a 31.</note> for when they are afraid the citizens keep a closer hold on the government; hence those who take thought for the constitution must contrive causes of fear, in order that the citizens may keep guard and not relax their vigilance for the constitution like a watch in the night, and they must make the distant near. Again, they must also endeavor to guard against the quarrels and party struggles of the notables by means of legislation, and to keep out those who are outside the quarrel before they too have taken it over; since to discern a growing evil at the commencement is not any ordinary person’s work but needs a statesman.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> And to deal with the revolution from oligarchy and constitutional government that arises because of the property-qualifications, when this occurs while the rates of qualification remain the same but money is becoming plentiful, it is advantageous to examine the total amount of the rated value of the community as compared with the past amount, in states where the assessment is made yearly, over that period, </p></div>

And also sectional prosperity in the state must be guarded against for the same reasons; and the way to avert this is always to entrust business and office to the opposite sections (I mean that the respectable are opposite to the multitude and the poor to the wealthy), and to endeavor either to mingle together the multitude of the poor and that of the wealthy or to increase the middle class (for this dissolves party factions due to inequality). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> And in every form of constitution it is a very great thing for it to be so framed both by its laws and by its other institutions that it is impossible for the magistracies to make a profit. And this has most to be guarded against in oligarchies; for the many are not so much annoyed at being excluded from holding office (but in fact they are glad if somebody lets them have leisure to spend on their own affairs) as they are if they think that the magistrates are stealing the common funds, but then both things annoy them, exclusion from the honors of office and exclusion from its profits.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  And indeed the sole way in which a combination of democracy and aristocracy is possible is if someone could contrive this arrangement<note resp="Rackham">i.e. render it impossible to make money out of office</note>; </p></div>

And in democracies it is necessary to be sparing of the wealthy not only by not causing properties to be divided up, but not incomes either (which under some constitutions takes place unnoticed), and it is better to prevent men from undertaking costly but useless public services like equipping choruses and torch-races<note resp="Rackham">Equipping the chorus and actors for tragedies and comedies and providing for the ceremonial torch-races were public services borne by individuals at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and all other similar services, even if they wish to; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  in an oligarchy on the other hand it is necessary to take much care of the poor, and to allot to them the offices of profit, and the penalty if one of the rich commits an outrage against them must be greater than if it is done by one of themselves,<note resp="Rackham">Or possibly <q rend="single">than if he does it against one of his own class.</q></note> and inheritance must not go by bequest but by family, and the same man must not inherit more than one estate, for so estates would be more on a level, and more of the poor would establish themselves as prosperous. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> And it is expedient both in a democracy and in an oligarchy to assign to those who have a smaller share in the government—in a democracy to the wealthy and in anoligarchy to the poor—either equality or precedence in all other things excepting the supreme offices of state; but these should be entrusted to those prescribed by the constitution exclusively, or to them for the most part.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> There are some three qualities which those who are to hold the supreme magistracies ought to possess, first, loyalty to the established constitution, next, very great capacity to do the duties of the office, and third, virtue and justice—in each constitution the sort of justice suited to the constitution (for if the rules of justice are not the same under all constitutions, it follows that there must be differences in the nature of justice also).

Therefore in the case of military command one must consider experience more than virtue, for men have a smaller share of military experience and a larger share of moral goodness; but in the case of a trusteeship or a stewardship the opposite, for these require more virtue than most men possess, but the knowledge required is common to all men. And somebody might raise the question, why is virtue needed if both capacity and loyalty to the constitution are forthcoming, as even these two qualities will do what is suitable? May not the answer be, because those who possess these two qualities may possibly lack self-control, so that just as they do not serve themselves well although they know how to and although they love themselves, so possibly in some cases they may behave in this way in regard to the community also? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/> And broadly, whatever provisions in the laws we describe as advantageous to constitutions, these are all preservative of the constitutions, and so is the supreme elementary principle that has been often stated, that of taking precautions that the section desirous of the constitution shall be stronger in numbers than the section not desirous off it. And beside all these matters one thing must not be overlooked which at present is overlooked by the, deviation-forms<note resp="Rackham">See 1279a 20.</note> of constitution—the middle party; <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> for many of the institutions thought to be popular destroy democracies, and many of those thought oligarchical destroy oligarchies. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> But the adherents of the deviation-form, thinking that this form is the only right thing, drag it to excess, not knowing that just as there can be a nose that although deviating from the most handsome straightness towards being hooked or snub nevertheless is still beautiful and agreeable to look at, yet all the same, if a sculptor carries it still further in the direction of excess, he will first lose the symmetry of the feature and finally will make it not even look like a nose at all, because of its excess and deficiency in the two opposite qualities (and the same is the ease also in regard to the other parts of the body), so this is what happens about constitutions likewise;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/>  for it is possible for an oligarchy and a democracy to be satisfactory although they have diverged from the best structure, but if one strains either of them further, first he will make the constitution worse, and finally he will make it not a constitution at all. Therefore the legislator and the statesman must not fail to know what sort of democratic institutions save and what destroy a democracy, and what sort of oligarchical institutions an oligarchy; for neither constitution can exist and endure without the well-to-do and the multitude, but when an even level of property comes about, the constitution resulting must of necessity be another one,  </p></div>

For royal government corresponds with aristocracy, while tyranny is a combination of the last form of oligarchy<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1296a 3, 1312b 35.</note> and of democracy; and for that very reason it is most harmful to its subjects, inasmuch as it is a combination of two bad things, and is liable to the deviations and errors that spring from both forms of constitution. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And these two different sorts of monarchy have their origins from directly opposite sources; royalty has come into existence for the assistance of the distinguished against the people, and a king is appointed from those distinguished by superiority in virtue or the actions that spring from virtue, or by superiority in coming from a family of that character, while a tyrant is set up from among the people and the multitude to oppose the notables, in order that the people may suffer no injustice from them. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  And this is manifest from the facts of history. For almost the greatest number of tyrants have risen, it may be said, from being demagogues, having won the people’s confidence by slandering the notables. For some tyrannies were set up in this manner when the states had already grown great, but others that came before them arose from kings departing from the ancestral customs and aiming at a more despotic rule,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and others from the men elected to fill the supreme magistracies (for in old times the peoples used to appoint the popular officials<note resp="Rackham">Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημιουργία</foreign> means <q rend="single">magistracy</q> generally; <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημιουργός</foreign> was the title of a special officer in some Peloponnesian states.</note> and the sacred embassies<note resp="Rackham">Official missions to religious games and to oracles.</note> for long terms of office), and others from oligarchies electing some one supreme official for the greatest magistracies.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  For in all these methods they had it in their powerto effect their purpose easily, if only they wished, because they already possessed the power of royal rule in the one set of cases and of their honorable office in the other, for example Phidon in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">Perhaps circa <date when="-0750">750</date> B.C.</note> and others became tyrants when they possessed royal power already, while the Ionian tyrants<note resp="Rackham">e.g. Thrasybulus, tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, <date when="-0612">612</date> B.C.</note> and Phalaris<note resp="Rackham">Tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> <date when="-0572">572</date> B.C.</note> arose from offices of honor, and Panaetius at Leontini and Cypselus at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and Pisistratus<note resp="Rackham">See 1305a 23 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and Dionysius<note resp="Rackham">See 1259a 28 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and others in the same manner from the position of demagogue.

Therefore, as we said, royalty is ranged in correspondence with aristocracy, for it goes by merit, either by private virtue or by family or by services or by a combination of these things and ability.

Hence even in their requisitions money is the aim of tyrants but rather marks of honor that of kings; and a king’s body-guard consists of citizens, a tyrant’s of foreign mercenaries. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  And it is manifest that tyranny has the evils of both democracy and oligarchy; it copies oligarchy in making wealth its object (for inevitably that is the only way in which the tyrant’s body-guard and his luxury can be kept up) and in putting no trust in the multitude (which is why they resort to the measure of stripping the people of arms, and why ill-treatment of the mob and its expulsion from the city and settlement in scattered places is common to both forms of government, both oligarchy and tyranny), while it copies democracy in making war on the notables and destroying them secretly and openly and banishing them as plotting against it and obstructive to its rule. For it is from them that counter-movements actually spring, some of them wishing themselves to rule, and others not<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to be slaves.

Also the objects aimed at by the revolutionaries in the case both of tyrannies and of royal governments are the same as in revolts against constitutional government; for monarchs possess great wealth and great honor, which are desired by all men. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> And in some cases the attack is aimed at the person of the rulers, in others at their office. Risings provoked by insolence are aimed against the person; and though insolence has many varieties, each of them gives rise to anger, and when men are angry they mostly attack for the sake of revenge, not of ambition. For example the attack on the Pisistratidae took place because they outraged Harmodius’s sister and treated Harmodius with contumely (for Harmodius attacked them because of his sister and Aristogiton because of Harmodius, and also the plot was laid against Periander the tyrant in <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">See 1304a 31 n.</note> because when drinking  <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1311b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with his favorite he asked him if he was yet with child by him),</p></div>

And <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> and Heraclides of <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName> made away with Cotys<note resp="Rackham">King of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> <date from="-0382" to="-0358">382</date>-358 B.C.</note> to avenge their father, and Adamas revolted from Cotys because he had been mutilated by him when a boy, on the ground of the insult. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/>  And also many men when enraged by the indignity of corporal chastisement have avenged the insult by destroying or attempting to destroy its author, even when a magistrate or member of a royal dynasty.

Also Decamnichus took a leading part in the attack upon Archelaus, being the first to stir on the attackers; and the cause of his anger was that he had handed him over to Euripides the poet to flog, Euripides being angry because he had made a remark about his breath smelling. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/>And many others also for similar reasons have been made away with or plotted against. And similarly also from the motive of fear; for this was one of the causes we mentioned in the case of monarchies, as also in that of constitutional governments; for instance Artapanes<note resp="Rackham">Captain of Xerxes’ body-guard.</note> killed Xerxes fearing the charge about Darius, because he had hanged him when Xerxes had ordered him not to but he had thought that he would forgive him because he would forget, as he had been at dinner.

A proof of this is that most of those that have won tyrannies have also kept their offices to the end, but those that have inherited them almost all lose them at once; for they live a life of indulgence, and so become despicable and also give many opportunities to their attackers.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_21"/> And also anger must be counted as an element in the hatred felt for them, for in a way it occasions the same actions. And often it is even more active than hatred, since angry men attack more vigorously because passion does not employ calculation (and insolence most frequently causes men to be led by their angry tempers, which was the cause of the fall of the tyranny of the Pisistratidae and many others), but hatred calculates more; for anger brings with it an element of pain, making calculation difficult, but enmity is not accompanied by pain. And to speak summarily, all the things that we have mentioned as causing the down fall of unmixed and extreme oligarchy and of the last form of democracy must be counted as destructive of tyranny as well, since extreme oligarchy and democracy are in reality divided<note resp="Rackham">i.e. divided among several persons, <q rend="single">put into commission.</q></note> tyrannies.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/> Royal government on the other hand is very seldom destroyed by external causes, so that it is long-lasting; but in most cases its destruction arises out of itself. And it is destroyed in two ways,  </p></div>

Royal governments do not occur any more now, but if ever monarchies do occur they are rather tyrannies, because royalty is government over willing subjects but with sovereignty over greater matters, but men of equal quality are numerous and no one is so outstanding as to fit the magnitude and dignity of the office; so that for this reason the subjects do not submit willingly, and if a man has made himself ruler by deception or force, then this is thought to be a tyranny.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/>  In cases of hereditary royalty we must also set down a cause of their destruction, in addition to those mentioned, the fact that hereditary kings often become despicable, and that although possessing not the power of a tyrant but the dignity of a king they commit insolent outrages; for the deposition of kings used to be easy, since a king will at once cease to be king if his subjects do not wish him to be, whereas a tyrant will still be tyrant even though his subjects do not wish it.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">These causes then and others of the same nature are those that bring about the destruction of monarchies.</p>

But taking the different sorts of monarchy separately—royalties are preserved by bringing them<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>into a more moderate form; for the fewer powers the kings have, the longer time the office in its entirety must last, for they themselves become less despotic and more equal to their subjects in temper, and their subjects envy them less. For this was the cause of the long persistence of the Molossian royalty, and that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> has continued because the office was from the beginning divided into two halves, and because it was again limited in various ways by Theopompus,<note resp="Rackham">King of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> circa <date from="-0770" to="-0720">770</date>-720 B.C.</note> in particular by his instituting the office of the ephors to keep a check upon it; for by taking away some of the kings’ power he increased the permanence of the royal office, so that in a manner he did not make it less but greater. This indeed as the story goes is what he said in reply to his wife, when she asked if he felt no shame in bequeathing the royal power to his sons smaller than he had inherited it from his father: <q rend="double">Indeed I do not,</q> he is said to have answered, <q rend="double">for Ihand it on more lasting.</q></p> 
 <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  Tyrannies on the other hand are preserved in two extremely opposite ways. One of these is the traditional way and the one in which most tyrants administer their office. Most of these ordinary safeguards of tyranny are said to have been instituted by Periander<note resp="Rackham">See 1284a 26 n.</note> of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and also many such devices may be borrowed from the Persian empire.

Also the tyrant is a stirrer-up of war, with the deliberate purpose of keeping the people busy and also of making them constantly in need of a leader. Also whereas friends are a means of security to royalty, it is a mark of a tyrant to be extremely distrustful of his friends, on the ground that, while all have the wish, these chiefly have the power.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Also the things that occur in connection with the final form of democracy<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1309b 27 ff.</note> are all favorable to tyranny—dominance of women in the homes, in order that they may carry abroad reports against the men, and lack of discipline among the slaves, for the same reason; for slaves and women do not plot against tyrants, and also, if they prosper under tyrannies, must feel well-disposed to them, and to democracies as well (for the common people also wishes to be sole ruler). Hence also the flatterer is in honor with both—with democracies the demagogue (for the demagogue is a flatterer of the people), and with the tyrants those who associate with them humbly, which is the task of flattery.  </p></div>

  <p>  <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1314a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In fact owing to this tyranny is a friend of the base; for tyrants enjoy being flattered, but nobody would ever flatter them if he possessed a free spirit—men of character love their ruler, or at all events do not flatter him. And the base are useful for base business, for nail is driven out by nail, as the proverb goes.<note resp="Rackham">The proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡλῷ ἧλος ἐκκρούεται</foreign> usually meant driving out something by a thing of the same kind (‘set a thief to catch a thief’), not as here the execution of evil designs by appropriate agents.</note>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  And it is a mark of a tyrant to dislike anyone that is proud or free-spirited; for the tyrant claims for himself alone the right to bear that character, and the man who meets his pride with pride and shows a free spirit robs tyranny of its superiority and position of mastery; tyrants therefore hate the proud as undermining their authority. And it is a mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as guests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers make no claim against him.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. do not claim honors as against their patron, claim to be his equals.</note> These and similar habits are characteristic of tyrants and preservative of their office, but they lack no element of baseness.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  And broadly speaking, they are all included under three heads; for tyranny aims at three things, one to keep its subjects humble (for a humble-spirited man would not plot against anybody), second to have them continually distrust one another (for a tyranny is not destroyed until some men come to trust each other, owing to which tyrants also make war on the respectable, as detrimental<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to their rule not only because of their refusal to submit to despotic rule, but also because they are faithful to one another and to the other citizens, and do not inform against one another nor against the others); and the third is lack of power for political action (since nobody attempts impossibilities, so that nobody tries to put down a tyranny if he has not power behind him). 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>
 These then in fact are the three aims to which the wishes of tyrants are directed; for all the measures taken by tyrants one might class under these principles—some are designed to prevent mutual confidence among the subjects, others to curtail their power, and others to make them humble-spirited. </p>  
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> Such then is the nature of one method by which security is obtained for tyrannies. The other tries to operate in a manner almost the opposite of the devices mentioned. And it can be ascertained from considering the downfall of royal governments. For just as one mode of destroying royalty is to make its government more tyrannical, so a mode of securing tyranny is to make it more regal, protecting one thing only, its power, in order that the ruler may govern not only with the consent of the subjects but even without it; for if he gives up this, he also gives up his position as tyrant. But while this must stand as a fundamental principle, all the other measures he may either adopt or pretend to adopt by cleverly acting the royal part.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  The first step is to be careful of the public funds,</p></div>

Secondly he must be seen to collect his taxes and benevolences for purposes of administration and to meet his occasional requirements for military emergencies, and generally must pose as guardian and steward as it were of a public fund and not a private estate. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/>  And his bearing must not be harsh but dignified, and also such as to inspire not fear but rather respect <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> in those who encounter him, though this is not easy to achieve if he is a contemptible personality; so that even if he neglects the other virtues he is bound to cultivate military valor, and to make himself a reputation as a soldier. And further more not only must he himself be known not to outrage any of his subjects, either boy or girl, but so also must everybody about him, and also their wives must similarly show respect towards the other women, since even the insolences of women have caused the fall of many tyrannies. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> And in regard to bodily enjoyments he must do the opposite of what some tyrants do now (for they not only begin their debaucheries at daybreak and carry them on for many days at a time, but also wish to be seen doing so by the public, in order that people may admire them as fortunate and happy(, but best of all he must be moderate in such matters, or if not, he must at all events avoid displaying his indulgences to his fellows (for not the sober man but the drunkard is easy to attack and to despise, not the wakeful man but the sleeper). <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_15"/> And he must do the opposite of almost all the things mentioned some time back, for he must lay out and adorn the city as if he were a trustee and not a tyrant.

And it is a protection common to every sort of monarchy to make no one man great, but if necessary to exalt several (for they will keep watch on one another), and if after all the ruler has to elevate an individual, at all events not take a man of bold spirit (for such a character is most enterprising in all undertakings); and if he thinks fit to remove somebody from his power, to do this by gradual stages and not take away the whole of his authority at once. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> And again he should carefully avoid all forms of outrage, and two beyond all, violent bodily punishments and outrage of the young. And this caution must especially be exercised in relation to the ambitious, for while to be slighted in regard to property annoys the lovers of wealth, slights that involve dishonor are what men of honorable ambition and high character resent.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the tyrant should either not consort with men of this kind, or appear to inflict his punishments paternally and not because of contempt, and to indulge in the society of the young for reasons of passion, not because he has the power, and in general he should buy off what are thought to be dishonors by greater honors. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/> And among those who make attempts upon the life of a ruler the most formidable and those against whom the greatest precaution is needed are those that are ready to sacrifice their lives if they can destroy him. Hence the greatest care must be taken to guard against those who think that insolent outrage is being done either to themselves or to those who happen to be under their care; for men attacking under the influence of anger are reckless of themselves, as Heraclitus<note resp="Rackham">The natural philosopher of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, fl. circa <date when="-0513">513</date> B.C., known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ σκοτεινός</foreign> for his epigrammatic obscurity.</note> also observed when he said that anger was hard to combat because it would buy revenge with a life.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_19"/>  And since states consist of two parts, the poor people and the rich, the most important thing is for both to think that they owe their safety to the government and for it to prevent either from being wronged by the other, but whichever class is the stronger, this must be made to be entirely on the side of the government, as, if this support for the tyrant’s interests is secured, there is no need for him to institute a liberation of slaves or a disarming of the citizens, for one of the two parts of the state added to his power will be enough to make him and them stronger than their attackers.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_20"/>  But to discuss each of such matters separately is superfluous; for the thing to aim at is clear, </p></div>

For the result of these methods must be that not only the tyrant’s rule will be more honorable and more enviable because he will rule nobler subjects and not men that have been humiliated, and will not be continually hated and feared, but also that his rule will endure longer, and moreover that he himself in his personal character will be nobly disposed towards virtue, or at all events half-virtuous, and not base but only half-base.</p>

At all events it is said that Cleisthenes placed a wreath on the judge who awarded the victory away from him, and some say that the statue<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of a seated figure in the market-place is a statue of the man who gave this judgement. And they say that Pisistratus<note resp="Rackham">See 1305a 23 n.</note> also once submitted to a summons for trial before the Areopagus. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/>  And the second longest is the tyranny at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, that of the Cypselids,<note resp="Rackham">From <date when="-0655">655</date> B.C.</note> for even this lasted seventy-three and a half years, as Cypselus was tyrant for thirty years, Periander for forty-four,<note resp="Rackham">The Greek may be corrected to <q rend="single">forty and a half</q> to give the stated total.</note> and Psammetichus son of Gordias for three years. And the reasons for the permanence of this tyranny also are the same: Cypselus was a leader of the people and continuously throughout his period of office dispensed with a bodyguard; and although Periander became tyrannical, yet he was warlike. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/> The third longest tyranny is that of the Pisistratidae at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but it was not continuous; for while Pisistratus<note resp="Rackham">See 1305a 23 n.</note> was tyrant he twice fled into exile, so that in a period of thirty-three years he was tyrant for seventeen years out of the total, and his sons for eighteen years, so that the whole duration of their rule was thirty-five years.

Rep. 546c">Plat. Rep. 546c</bibl>—see Adam’s note there.</note> but is not discussed well. For his account of revolution in the constitution that is the best one and the first does not apply to it particularly. He says that the cause is that nothing is permanent but everything changes in a certain cycle, and that change has its origin in those numbers <q rend="single">whose basic ratio 4 : 3 linked with the number 5 gives two harmonies,</q>—meaning whenever the number of this figure becomes cubed,—in the belief that nature sometimes engenders men that are evil, and too strong for education to influence—speaking perhaps not ill as far as this particular dictum goes (for it is possible that there are some persons incapable of being educated and becoming men of noble character), but why should this process of revolution belong to the constitution which Socrates speaks of as the best, more than to all the other forms of constitution, and to all men that come into existence? <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  and why merely by the operation of time, which he says is the cause of change in all things, do even things that did not begin to exist simultaneously change simultaneously? for instance, if a thing came into existence the day before the completion of the cycle, why does it yet change simultaneously with everything else? And in addition to these points, what is the reason why the republic changes from the constitution mentioned into the Spartan form<note resp="Rackham">Timocracy, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 545a">Plat. Rep. 545a.</bibl> </note>? For all constitutions more often change into the opposite form than into the<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one near them. And the same remark applies to the other revolutions as well. For from the Spartan constitution the state changes, he says, to oligarchy, and from this to democracy, and from democracy to tyranny. Yet revolutions also occur the other way about, for example from democracy to oligarchy, and more often so than from democracy to monarchy.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Again as to tyranny he does not say whether it will undergo revolution or not, nor, if it will, what will be the cause of it, and into what sort of constitution it will change; and the reason for this is that he would not have found it easy to say, for it is irregular; since according to him tyranny ought to change into the first and best constitution, for so the process would be continuous and a circle, but as a matter of fact tyranny also changes into tyranny, as the constitution of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">See 1315b 13 n.</note> passed from the tyranny of Myron to that of Cleisthenes, and into oligarchy, as did that of Antileon<note resp="Rackham">Unknown, cf. 1304a 29 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, and into democracy, as that of the family of Gelo<note resp="Rackham">See 1302b 33 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and into aristocracy, as that of Charilaus<note resp="Rackham">See 1271b 26 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> [and as at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>].<note resp="Rackham">This clause seems an interpolation; cf. b 6.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And constitutions change from oligarchy to tyranny, asdid almost the greatest number of the ancient oligarchies in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, at Leontini to the tyranny of Panaetius,<note resp="Rackham">See 1310b 29 n.</note> at Gelo to that of Cleander, at <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName> to that of Anaxilaus,<note resp="Rackham">Unknown. <placeName key="tgn,7005020">Reggio</placeName> is related to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> as Dover is to France.</note> and in many other cities similarly.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>
 And it is also a strange remark<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 551d">Plat. Rep. 551d</bibl> </note> that the oligarchical state is two states, one of rich men and one of poor men. For what has happened to this state rather than to the Spartan or any other sort of state where all do not own an equal amount of wealth or where all are not equally good men? and when nobody has become poorer than he was before, none the less revolution takes place from oligarchy to democracy if the men of no property become more numerous, and from democracy to oligarchy if the wealthy class is stronger than the multitude and the latter neglect politics but the former give their mind to them. And although there are many causes through which revolutions in oligarchies occur, he mentions only one—that of men becoming poor through riotous living, by paying away their money in interest on loans—as if at the start all men or most men were rich.  
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>
 But this is not true, but although when some of the leaders have lost their properties they stir up innovations, when men of the other classes are ruined nothing strange happens;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and even when such a revolution does occur it is no more likely to end in a democracy than in another form of constitution. And furthermore men also form factions and cause revolutions in the constitution if they are not allowed a share of honors, and if they are unjustly or insolently treated, even if they have not run through all their property . . .<note resp="Rackham">Some words appear to be lost here; what follows refers to democracy, cf. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 587b">Plat. Rep. 587b</bibl>.</note> because of being allowed to do whatever they like; the cause of which he states to be excessive liberty. And although there are several forms of oligarchy and of democracy, Socrates speaks of the revolutions that occur in them as though there were only one form of each.</p></div> </div>

And first let us speak about democracy; for at the same time the facts will also become clear about the opposite form of constitution, that is, the constitution which some people call oligarchy.<note resp="Rackham"><q rend="single">Rule of the few,</q> i.e. the few rich, but the name is not exact, for in aristocracy also the rulers are few.</note></p> 
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And for this inquiry we must take into view all the features that are popular and that are thought<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to go with democracies; for it comes about from combinations of these that the kinds of democracy are formed, and that there are different democracies and more than one sort. In fact there are two causes for there being several kinds of democracy, first the one stated before, the fact that the populations are different (for we find one multitude engaged in agriculture and another consisting of handicraftsmen and day-laborers, and when the first of these is added to the second and again the third to both of them it not only makes a difference in that the quality of the democracy becomes better or worse but also by its becoming different in kind); and the second cause is the one about which we now speak.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  For the institutions that go with democracies and seem to be appropriate to this form of constitution make the democracies different by their combinations; for one form of democracy will be accompanied by fewer, another by more, and another by all of them. And it is serviceable to ascertain each of them both for the purpose of instituting whichever of these kinds of democracy one happens to wish and for the purpose of amending existing ones. For people setting up constitutions seek to collect together all the features appropriate to their fundamental principle, but in so doing they make a mistake, as has been said before in the passage dealing with the causes of the destruction and the preservation of constitutions. And now let us state the postulates, the ethical characters and the aims of the various forms of democracy. </p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty—that is what is usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty, </p></div>
   
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:6" n="1317b">
   <p> <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1317b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty.<note resp="Rackham">This clause is obscure: perhaps it is an interpolation.</note><milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  And these principles having been laid down and this being the nature of democratic government, the following institutions are democratic in character: election of officials by all from all; government of each by all,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and of all by each in turn; election by lot either to all magistracies or to all that do not need experience and skill; no property-qualification for office, or only a very low one; no office to be held twice, or more than a few times, by the same person, or few offices except the military ones; short tenure either of all offices or of as many as possible; judicial functions to be exercised by all citizens, that is by persons selected from all, and on all matters, or on most and the greatest and most important, for instance the audit of official accounts, constitutional questions, private contracts; the assembly to be sovereign over all matters, but no official over any or only over extremely few; or else a council to be sovereign over the most important matters <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/> (and a council is the most democratic of magistracies in states where there is not a plentiful supply of pay for everybody—for where there is, they deprive even this office of its power, since the people draws all the trials to itself when it has plenty of pay, as has been said before in the treatise preceding this one<note resp="Rackham">Book 4, 1299b 38 ff. (Books 4. and 5. are regarded as forming one treatise).</note>); also payment for public duties, preferably in all branches, assembly, law-courts, magistracies, or if not, for the magistracies, the law-courts, council and sovereign assemblies, or for those magistracies which are bound<note resp="Rackham">i.e. owing to the nature of their duties, and by general custom.</note> to have common mess tables. Also inasmuch as oligarchy is defined by birth, wealth and education, the popular qualifications are thought to be the opposite of these, low birth, poverty, vulgarity. And in respect of the magistracies it is democratic to have none tenable for life, </p></div>

  <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> These<note resp="Rackham">The rest of the chapter is most obscure, and its authenticity is questioned.</note> then are the features common to democracies. But what is thought to be the extreme form of democracy and of popular government comes about as a result of the principle of justice that is admitted to be democratic, and this is for all to have equality according to number. For it is equality for the poor to have no larger share of power than the rich, and not for the poor alone to be supreme but for all to govern equally; for in this way they would feel that the constitution possessed both equality and liberty. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  But the question follows, how will they have equality? are the property-assessments of five hundred citizens to be divided among a thousand and the thousand to have equal power to the five hundred<note resp="Rackham">i.e. two groups of voters, with equal total wealth and total voting-power, but one group twice as numerous as the other, so that a man in the rich group has two votes and one in the poor group one, the former being on the average twice as rich as the latter.</note>? or is equality on this principle<note resp="Rackham">i.e. <q rend="single">equality in proportion to number.</q></note> not to be arranged in this manner, but the division into classes to be on this system, but then an equal number to be taken from the five hundred and from the thousand and these to control the elections and the law-courts? Is this then the justest form of constitution in accordance with popular justice, or is it rather one that goes by counting heads?<note resp="Rackham">i.e. <q rend="single">one man one vote.</q></note> For democrats say that justice is whatever seems good to the larger number,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but advocates of oligarchy think that it is whatever seems good to the owners of the larger amount of property, for they say that the decision ought to go by amount of property. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  But both views involve inequality and injustice; for if the will of the few is to prevail, this means a tyranny, since if one man owns more than the other rich men,<note resp="Rackham">i.e. apparently, more than the property of all the others put together.</note> according to the oligarchic principle of justice it is just for him to rule alone; whereas if the will of the numerical majority is to prevail, they will do injustice by confiscating the property of the rich minority, as has been said before.<note resp="Rackham">1281a 14.</note> What form of equality therefore would be one on which both parties will agree must be considered in the light of the principles of justice as defined by both sets. For they say that whatever seems good to the majority of the citizens ought to be sovereign.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/>  Let us then accept this principle, yet not wholly without qualification, but inasmuch as fortune has brought into existence two component parts of the state, rich and poor, let any resolution passed by both classes, or by a majority of each, be sovereign, but if the two classes carry opposite resolutions, let the decision of the majority, in the sense of the group whose total property assessment is the larger, prevail: for instance, if there are ten rich citizens and twenty poor ones, and opposite votes have been cast by six of the rich on one side and by fifteen of the less wealthy on the other, four of the rich have sided with the poor and five of the poor with the rich; then the side that has the larger total property when the assessments of both classes on either side are added together carries the voting.<note resp="Rackham">If the rich citizens are on the average twice as wealthy as the poor (1.11), and therefore a rich man has two votes to a poor man’s one, when 6 rich and 5 poor vote one way, and 15 poor and 4 rich the other, the division is 17 to 23, and the view of the latter party, which is carried, represents a larger total of wealth but a larger proportion of poor men.</note>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/>  But if the totals fall out exactly equal, this is to be deemed an impasse common to both sides, as it is at present if the assembly or law-court is exactly divided; </p></div>

The best common people are the agricultural population, so that it is possible to introduce democracy as well as other forms of constitution where the multitude lives by agriculture or by pasturing cattle. For owing to their not having much property they are busy, so that they cannot often meet in the assembly, while owing to their having<note resp="Rackham">The MSS. give <q rend="single">not having,</q> but editors do not explain how in that case people would avoid starvation.</note> the necessaries of life they pass their time attending to their farm work and do not covet their neighbors’ goods, but find more pleasure in working than in taking part in politics and holding office, where the profits to be made from the offices are not large; for the mass of mankind are more covetous of gain than of honor.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And this is indicated by the fact that men endured the tyrannies of former times, and endure oligarchies, if a ruler does not preventthem from working or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>rob them; for then some of them soon get rich and the others free from want. And also, if they have any ambition, to have control over electing magistrates and calling them to account makes up for the lack of office, since in some democracies even if the people have no part in electing the magistrates but these are elected by a special committee selected in turn out of the whole number, as at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, yet if they have the power of deliberating on policy, the multitude are satisfied. (And this too must be counted as one form of democracy, on the lines on which it once existed at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>.)  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Indeed it is for this reason that it is advantageous for the form of democracy spoken of before, and is a customary institution in it, for all the citizens to elect the magistrates and call them to account, and to try law-suits, but for the holders of the greatest magistracies to be elected and to have property-qualifications, the higher offices being elected from the higher property-grades, or else for no office to be elected on a property-qualification, but for officials to be chosen on the ground of capacity. And a state governed in this way is bound to be governed well (for the offices will always be administered by the best men with the consent of the people and without their being jealous of the upper classes), and this arrangement is certain to be satisfactory for the upper classes and notables, for they will not be under the government of others inferior to themselves, and they will govern justly because a different class will be in control of the audits— <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  since it is expedient to be in a state of suspense and not to be able to do everything exactly as seems good to one, for liberty to do whatever one likes cannot guard against the evil that is in every man’s character. </p></div>

But almost all the other classes of populace, of which the remaining kinds of democracy are composed, are very inferior to these, for their mode of life is mean, and there is no element of virtue in any of the occupations in which the multitude of artisans and market-people and the wage-earning class take part, and also owing to their loitering about the market-place and the city almost all people of this class find it easy to attend the assembly; whereas the farmers owing to their being scattered over the country do not attend, and have not an equal desire for this opportunity of meeting.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  Andwhere it also happens that the lie of the land is such that the country is widely separated from the city, it is easy to establish a good democracy and also a good constitutional government, for the multitude is forced to live at a distance on the farms; and so, even if there is a crowd that frequents the market-place, it is best in democracies not to hold assemblies without the multitude scattered over the country.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. in a largely agricultural democracy, even though there may be a considerable idle population, which would attend frequent assemblies, it is best to hold them infrequently, so as to secure the attendance of the farmers.</note></p>

With a view to setting up this kind of democracy and making the people powerful their leaders usually acquire as many supporters as possible and admit to citizenship not only the legitimate children of citizens but also the base-born and those of citizen-birth on one side, I mean those whose father or mother is a citizen; for all this element is specially congenial to a to democracy of this sort. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  Popular leaders therefore regularly introduce such institutions; they ought however only to go on adding citizens up to the point where the multitude outnumbers the notables and the middle class and not to go beyond that point; for if they exceed it they make the government more disorderly, and also provoke the notables further in the direction of being reluctant to endure the democracy, which actually took place and caused the revolution at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> <note resp="Rackham">In N.

Hence those who are caring for the safety of the constitution must counteract this by enacting that nothing belonging to persons condemned at law shall be confiscated and liable to be carried to the public treasury, but that their property shall be consecrated to the service of religion; for male-factors will be no less on their guard, as they will be punished just the same, while the mob will less often vote guilty against men on trial when it is not going to get anything out of it. Also they must always make the public trials that occur as few as possible, checking those who bring indictments at random by big penalties; for they do not usually indict men of the people but notables, whereas even with this form of constitution it is desirable for all the citizens if possible to be friendly to the state, or failing that, at all events not to think of their rulers as enemies.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  And inasmuch as the ultimate forms of democracy tend to have large populations and it is difficult for their citizens to sit in the assembly without pay, and this in a state where there do not happen to be revenues is inimical to the notables <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for pay has to be obtained from a property-tax and confiscation, and from corruption of the law-courts, which has caused the overthrow of many democracies before now),—where therefore there happen to be no revenues, few meetings of the assembly must be held, and the law-courts must consist of many members but only sit a few days (for this not only contributes to the rich not being in fear of the cost of the system even if the well-off do not take the pay and only the poor do, but also leads to far greater efficiency in the trial of law-suits, for the well-to-do, though not wishing to be away from their private affairs for many days, are willing to leave them for a short time), <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  while where there are revenues men must not do what the popular leaders do now (for they usethe surplus for doles, and people no sooner get them than they want the same doles again, because this way of helping the poor is the legendary jar with a hole in it<note resp="Rackham">The fifty daughters of Danaus were married to their cousins, and all but one murdered their husbands on the bridal night, and were punished in Hades by having to pour water into the jar described.</note>), but the truly democratic statesman must study how the multitude may be saved from extreme poverty; for this is what causes democracy to be corrupt. Measures must therefore be contrived that may bring about lasting prosperity. And since this is advantageous also for the well-to-do, the proper course is to collect all the proceeds of the revenues into a fund and distribute this in lump sums to the needy, best of all, if one can, in sums large enough for acquiring a small estate, or, failing this, to serve as capital for trade or husbandry, </p></div>

It is also a good plan to imitate the policy<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1263a 35.</note> of the Tarentines. They get the goodwill of the multitude by making property communal for the purpose of use by the needy<note resp="Rackham">This seems to mean that the land was in private ownership, but that there was some system of poor-relief, to provide for the destitute out of the produce.</note>; also they have divided the whole number of their magistracies into two classes, one elected by vote and the other filled by lot,—the latter to ensure that the people may have a share in them, and the former to improve the conduct of public affairs. And it is also possible to effect this by dividing the holders of the same magistracy into two groups, one appointed by lot and the other by vote.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">We have then said how democracies should be organized.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_4"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> It is also fairly clear from these considerations how oligarchies ought to be organized. We must infer them from their opposites, reasoning out each form of oligarchy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with reference to the form of democracy opposite to it, starting with the most well-blended and first form of oligarchy<note resp="Rackham">In contrast with the first and best form of democracy, 2 init.</note>—and this is the one near to what is called a constitutional government, and for it the property-qualifications must be divided into one group of smaller properties and another of larger ones, smaller properties qualifying their owners for the indispensable offices and larger ones for the more important; and a person owning the qualifying property must be allowed to take a share in the government,—introducing by the assessment a large enough number of the common people to secure that with them the governing class will have a majority over those excluded; and persons to share in the government must constantly be brought in from the better class of the common people. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> And the next form of oligarchy also must be constructed in a similar way with a slight tightening up of the qualification. But the form of oligarchy that stands opposite to the last form of democracy, the most autocratic and tyrannical of the oligarchies, in as far as it is the worst requires a correspondingly great amount of safe-guarding. For just as human bodies in a good state of health and ships well equipped with their crews for a voyage admit of more mistakes without being destroyed thereby, but bodies of a morbid habit and vessels strained in their timbers and manned with bad crews cannot endure even the smallest mistakes, so also the worst constitutions need the most safe-guarding. </p></div>

    <p rend="align(indent)">And since the mass of the population falls principally into four divisions, the farming class, artisans, retail traders and hired laborers, and military forces are of four classes, cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry and marines, in places where the country happens to be suitable for horsemanship, there natural conditions favor the establishment of an oligarchy that will be powerful (for the security of the inhabitants depends on the strength of this element, and keeping studs of horses is the pursuit of those who own extensive estates); and where the ground is suitable for heavy infantry, conditions favor the next form of oligarchy (for heavy infantry is a service for the well-to-do rather than the poor); but light infantry and naval forces are an entirely democratic element. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  As things are therefore, where there is a large multitude of this class, when party strife occurs the oligarchs often get the worst of the struggle; and a remedy for this must be adopted from military commanders, who combine with their cavalry and heavy infantry forces a contingent of light infantry. And this is the way<note resp="Rackham">i.e. by superior mobility.</note> in which the common people get the better over the well-to-do in outbreaks of party strife:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>being unencumbered they fight easily against cavalry and heavy infantry. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>Therefore to establish this force out of this class is to establish it against itself, but the right plan is for the men of military age to be separated into a division of older and one of younger men, and to have their own sons while still young trained in the exercises of light and unarmed troops, and for youths selected from among the boys to be themselves trained in active operations. And the bestowal of a share in the government upon the multitude should either go on the lines stated before,<note resp="Rackham">4.1, 1320b 25 ff.</note> and be made to those who acquire the property-qualification, or as at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, to people after they have abstained for a time from mechanic industries, or as at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, by making a selection among members of the governing classes and those outside it of persons who deserve<note resp="Rackham">If the text is corrected it seems to mean that the list was revised from time to time and some old names taken off and new ones put on.</note> inclusion. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  And furthermore the most supreme offices also, which must be retained by those within the constitution, must have expensive duties attached to them, in order that the common people may be willing to be excluded from them, and may feel no resentment against the ruling class, because it pays a high price for office. And it fits in with this that they should offer splendid sacrifices and build up some public monument on entering upon office, so that the common people sharing in the festivities and seeing the city decorated both with votive offerings and with building may be glad to see the constitution enduring; and an additional result will be that the notables will have memorials of their outlay. But at present the members of oligarchies do not adopt this course but the opposite, for they seek the gains of office just as much as the honor; hence these oligarchies are well described as miniature democracies.<note resp="Rackham">The phrase suggests that in democracy public duties are cheifly undertaken for their emoluments.</note> </p></div>

And furthermore the magistracies are bound to be fewer in the small states and more numerous in the large ones, as in fact has been said before<note resp="Rackham">Book 4, 1299b 30 ff.</note>; it must therefore be kept in view what kinds of magistracies it is desirable to combine and what kinds to keep separate. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> First among the indispensable services is the superintendence of the market, over which there must be an official to superintend contracts and good order; since it is a necessity for almost all states that people shall sell some things and buy others according to one another’s necessary requirements, and this is the readiest means of securing self-sufficiency, which seems to be the reason for men’s having united into a single state.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Another superintendency connected very closely with this one is the curatorship of public and private properties in the city,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to secure good order and the preservation and rectification of falling buildings and roads, and of the bounds between different persons’ estates, so that disputes may not arise about them, and all the other duties of superintendence similar to these. An office of this nature is in most states entitled that of City-controller, but it has several departments, each of which is filled by separate officials in the states with larger populations, for instance Curators of Walls, Superintendents of Wells, Harbors-guardians.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> And another office also is indispensable and closely akin to these, for it controls the same matters but deals with the country and there regions outside the city; and these magistrates are called in some places Land-controllers and in others Custodians of Forests. These then are three departments of control over these matters, while another office is that to which the revenues of the public funds are paid in, the officials who guard them and by whom they are divided out to the several administrative departments; these magistrates are called Receivers and Stewards. Another magistracy is the one that has to receive a written return of private contracts and of the verdicts of the law-courts; and with these same officials the registration of legal proceedings and their institution have also to take place. In some states this office also is divided into several, but there are places where one magistracy controls all these matters; and these officials are called Sacred Recorders, Superintendents, Recorders, and other names akin to these.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And after these is the office connectedwith it but perhaps the most indispensable and most difficult of all, the one concerned with the execution of judgement upon persons cast in suits and those posted as defaulters according to the lists, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1322a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and with the custody of prisoners. </p></div>

<p>This is an irksome office because it involves great unpopularity, so that where it is not possible to make a great deal of profit out of it men will not undertake it, or when they have undertaken it are reluctant to carry out its functions according to the laws; but it is necessary, because there is no use in trials being held about men’s rights when the verdicts are not put into execution, so that if when no legal trial of disputes takes place social intercourse is impossible, so also is it when judgements are not executed.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  Hence it is better for this magistracy not to be a single office but to consist of several persons drawn from different courts, and it is desirable similarly to try to divide up the functions connected with the posting up of people registered as public debtors, and further also in some cases for the sentences to be executed by magistrates, especially by the newly elected ones preferably in suits tried by the outgoing ones, and in those tried by men actually in office for the magistrate executing the sentence to be different from the one that passed it, for instance the City-controllers to execute the judgements passed on from the Market-controllers and other magistrates those passed on by the City-controllers. For the less odium involved for those who execute the judgements, the more adequately the judgements will be carried out; so for the same magistrates to have imposed the sentence and to execute it involves a twofold odium, and for the same ones to execute it in all cases makes them the enemies of everybody.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  And in many places also the office of keeping custody of prisoners, forexample at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the office of the magistrates known as the Eleven<note resp="Rackham">This example looks like a mistaken note interpolated in the text. The Eleven had both functions.</note>,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is separate from the magistracy that executes sentences. It is better therefore to keep this also separate, and to attempt the same device with regard to this as well. For though it is no less necessary than the office of which I spoke, yet in practice respectable people avoid it most of all offices, while it is not safe to put it into the hands of the base, for they themselves need others to guard them instead of being able to keep guard over others. Hence there must not be one magistracy specially assigned to the custody of prisoners nor must the same magistracy perform this duty continuously, but it should be performed by the young, in places where there is a regiment of cadets<note resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and elsewhere young citizens from eighteen to twenty were enrolled in training corps for military instruction; these served as police and home troops.</note> or guards, and by the magistrates, in successive sections. </p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  These magistracies therefore must be counted first as supremely necessary, and next to them must be put those that are not less necessary but are ranked on a higher grade of dignity, because they require much experience and trustworthiness; in this class would come the magistracies concerned with guarding the city and those assigned to military requirements. And both in peace and in war it is equally necessary for there to be magistrates to superintend the guarding of gates and walls and the inspection and drill of the citizen troops.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  In some places therefore there are more magistracies assigned to all these duties, and in others fewer—for instance in the small states there is one to deal with all of them. And the officers of this sort are entitled Generals or War-lords. </p></div>

But the whole of this sort of officers constituted a single class, that of military command. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  This then is how the matter stands in regard to this office; but inasmuch as some of the magistracies, if not all, handle large sums of public money, there must be another office to receive an account and subject it to audit, which must itself handle no other business; and these officials are called Auditors by some people, Accountants by others, Examiners by others and Advocates by others. And by the side of all these offices is the one that is most supreme over all matters, for often the same magistracy has the execution of business that controls its introduction, or presides over the general assembly in places where the people are supreme; for the magistracy that convenes the sovereign assembly is bound to be the sovereign power in the state. It is styled in some places the Preliminary Council because it considers business in advance, but where there is a democracy<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1323a 9 below. Apparently <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλῆθός ἐστι</foreign> stands for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πλῆθος κύριόν ἐστι</foreign>, but editors quote no parallel.</note> it is more usually called a Council. This more or less completes the number of the offices of a political nature; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/> but another kind of superintendence is that concerned with divine worship; in this class are priests and superintendents of matters<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>connected with the temples, the preservation of existing buildings and the restoration of those that are ruinous, and the other duties relating to the gods. In practice this superintendence in some places forms a single office, for instance in the small cities, but in others it belongs to a number of officials who are not members of the priesthood, for example Sacrificial Officers and Temple-guardians and Stewards of Sacred Funds. And connected with this is the office devoted to the management of all the public festivals which the law does not assign to the priests but the officials in charge of which derive their honor from the common sacrificial hearth, and these officials are called in some places Archons, in others Kings and in others Presidents.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  To sum up therefore, the necessary offices of superintendence deal with the following matters : institutions of religion, military institutions, revenue and expenditure, control of the market, citadel, harbors and country, also the arrangements of the law-courts, registration of contracts, collection of fines, custodyof prisoners, supervision of accounts and inspections, and the auditing of officials, and lastly the offices connected with the body that deliberates about public affairs.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/> On the other hand, peculiar to the states that have more leisure and prosperity, and also pay attention to public decorum, are the offices of Superintendent of Women, Guardian of the Laws, Superintendent of Children, Controller of Physical Training,</p> </div>

Some of these offices are obviously not of a popular character, for instance that of Superintendent of Women and of Children; for the poor having no slaves are forced to employ their women and children as servants. There are three offices which in some states supervise the election of the chief magistrates—Guardians of the Laws, Preliminary Councillors and Council; of these the Guardians of the Laws are an aristocratic institution, the Preliminary Councillors oligarchic, and a Council democratic.</p>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>
  <note resp="Rackham">Book 4 in some editions.</note>The student who is going to make a suitable investigation of the best form of constitution must necessarily decide first of all what is the most desirable mode of life. For while this is uncertain it is also bound to be uncertain what is the best constitution, since it is to be expected that the people that have the best form of government available under their given conditions will fare the best, exceptional circumstances apart. Hence we must first<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>agree what life is most desirable for almost all men, and after that whether the same life is most desirable both for the community and for the individual, or a different one. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Believing therefore in the adequacy of much of what is said even in extraneous discourses<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.6. It is debated whether the phrase refers to Aristotle’s own popular writings, or to those of other philosophers, or to discussions of the subject in ordinary intercourse.</note> on the subject of the best life, let us make use of these pronouncements now. For as regards at all events one classification of things good, putting them in three groups, external goods, goods of the soul and goods of the body, assuredly nobody would deny that the ideally happy are bound to possess all three. For nobody would call a man ideally happy that has not got a particle of courage nor of temperance nor of justice nor of wisdom, but is afraid of the flies that flutter by him, cannot refrain from any of the most outrageous actions in order to gratify a desire to eat or to drink, ruins his dearest friends for the sake of a farthing, and similarly in matters of the intellect also is as senseless and mistaken as any child or lunatic. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  But although these are propositions which when uttered everybody would agree to, yet men differ about amount and degrees of value. They think it is enough to possess however small a quantity of virtue, but of wealth, riches, power, glory and everything of that kind they seek a larger and larger amount without limit. We on the other hand shall tell them that it is easy to arrive at conviction on these matters in the light of the actual facts, when one sees that men do not acquire and preserve the virtues by means of these external goods, but external goods by means of the virtues, </p></div>
      
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:7" n="1323b">
   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1323b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that whether the life of happiness consists for man in enjoyment or in virtue or in both, it is found in larger measure with those who are of surpassingly high cultivation in character and intellect but only moderate as regards the external acquisition of goods, than with those who own more than they can use of the latter but are deficient in the former. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  Not but what the truth is also easily seen if we consider the matter in the light of reason. For external goods have a limit, as has any instrument (and everything useful is useful for something), so an excessive amount of them must necessarily do harm, or do no good, to its possessor; whereas with any of the goods of the soul, the more abundant it is, the more useful it must be—if even to goods of the soul not only the term <q rend="single">noble</q> but also the term <q rend="single">useful</q> can be properly applied. And broadly, it is clear that we shall declare that the best condition of each particular thing, comparing things with one another, corresponds in point of superiority to the distance that subsists between the things of which we declare these conditions themselves to be conditions.<note resp="Rackham">e.g. the finest man excels the finest monkey to the degree in which the species man excels the species monkey.</note> Hence inasmuch as our soul is a more valuable thing both absolutely and relatively to ourselves than either our property or our body, the best conditions of these things must necessarily stand in the same relation to one another as the things themselves do. Moreover it is for the sake of the soul that these goods are in their nature desirable, and that all wise men must<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>choose them, not the soul for the sake of those other things. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Let us then take it as agreed between us that to each man there falls just so large a measure of happiness as he achieves of virtue and wisdom and of virtuous and wise action: in evidence of this we have the case of God, who is happy and blessed, but is so on account of no external goods, but on account of himself, and by being of a certain quality in his nature; since it is also for this reason that prosperity is necessarily different from happiness—for the cause of goods external to the soul is the spontaneous and fortune,<note resp="Rackham">Aristotle taught that some events are the result of the undesigned interaction of two lines of causation in nature’s design; he denoted this (1) in general, by <q rend="single">the automatic</q> or self-acting (represented in Latin by <emph>sponte</emph>, spontaneous), (2) as concerning man, by <q rend="single">fortune.</q></note> but nobody is just or temperate as a result of or owing to the action of fortune. And connected is a truth requiring the same arguments to prove it, that it is also the best state, and the one that does well,<note resp="Rackham">The common play on the ambiguity of <q rend="single">do well,</q> meaning either <q rend="single">prosper</q> or <q rend="single">act rightly.</q></note> that is happy. But to do well is impossible save for those who do good actions, and there is no good action either of a man or of a state without virtue and wisdom; and courage, justice and wisdom belonging to a state have the same meaning and form as have those virtues whose possession bestows the titles of just and wise and temperate on an individual human being.</p> 
 <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  These remarks however must suffice by way of preface to our discourse: for neither is it possible to abstain from touching on these subjects altogether, nor is it feasible to follow out all the arguments that are germane to them, for that is the business of another course of study. For the present let us take it as established that the best life, whether separately for an individual or collectively for states, </p></div>

Eth. 1179a 4 ff.</bibl> </note>; while objections to this position we must pass over in the course of the present inquiry, and reserve them for future consideration, if anyone be found to disagree with what has been said.</p> 
    <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_2"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> Onthe other hand it remains to say whether the happiness of a state is to be pronounced the same as that of each individual man, or whether it is different. Here too the answer is clear: everybody would agree that it is the same; for all those who base the good life upon wealth in the case of the individual, also assign felicity to the state as a whole if it is wealthy; and all who value the life of the tyrant highest, would also say that the state which rules the widest empire is the happiest; and if any body accepts the individual as happy on account of virtue, he will also say that the state which is the better morally is the happier. </p> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> <p> But there now arise these two questions that require consideration: first, which mode of life is the more desirable, the life of active citizenship and participation in politics, or rather the life of an alien and that of detachment from the political partnership; next, what constitution and what organization of a state is to be deemed the best,—either on the assumption that to take an active part in the state is desirable for everybody, or that it is undesirable for some men although desirable for most. But as it is<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the latter question that is the business of political study and speculation, and not the question of what is desirable for the individual, and as it is the investigation of politics that we have now taken up, the former question would be a side issue, and the latter is the business of political inquiry.</p>
    <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> Now it is clear that the best constitution is the system under which anybody whatsoever would be best off and would live in felicity; but the question is raised even on the part of those who agree that the life accompanied by virtue is the most desirable, whether the life of citizenship and activity is desirable or rather a life released from all external affairs, for example some form of contemplative life, which is said by some to be the only life that is philosophic.<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">which alone is said to be desirable by some philosophers.</q></note> For it is manifest that these are the two modes of life principally chosen by the men most ambitious of excelling in virtue, both in past times and at the present day—I mean the life of politics and the life of philosophy. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And it makes no little difference which way the truth lies; for assuredly the wise are bound to arrange their affairs in the direction of the better goal—and this applies to the state collectively as well as to the individual human being. Some persons think that empire over one’s neighbors, if despotically exercised, involves a definite injustice of the greatest kind, and if constitutionally, although it carries no injustice, yet is a hindrance to the ruler’s own well-being; but others hold almost the opposite view to these—they think that the life of action and citizenship is the only life fit for a man, since with each of the virtues its exercise in actions is just as possible for men engaged in public affairs and in politics as for those who live a private life.</p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:7" n="1324b">
 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1324b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  Some people then hold the former view, while others declare that the despotic and tyrannical form of constitution alone achieves happiness; and in some states it is also the distinctive aim of the constitution and the laws to enable them to exercise despotic rule over their neighbors. Hence even though with most peoples most of the legal ordinances have been laid down virtually at random, nevertheless if there are places where the laws aim at one definite object, that object is in all cases power, as in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> both the system of education and the mass of the laws are framed in the main with a view to war; and also among all the non-Hellenic nations that are strong enough to expand at the expense of others, military strength has been held in honor, for example, among the Scythians, Persians, Thracians and Celts. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  Indeed among some peoples there are even certain laws stimulating military valor; for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, we are told, warriors receive the decoration of armlets of the same number as the campaigns on which they have served; and at one time there was also a law in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> that a man who had never killed an enemy must wear his halter instead of a belt. Among Scythian tribes at a certain festival a cup was carried round from which a man that had not killed an enemy was not allowed to drink. Among the Iberians, a warlike race, they fix small spits<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <q rend="single">pointed stones.</q></note> <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the earth round a man’s grave corresponding in number to the enemies he has killed. So with other races there are many other practices of a similar kind, some established by law and others by custom.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>   Nevertheless those who wish to examine the matter closely might perhaps think it exceedingly strange that it should be the business of a statesman to be able to devise means of holding empire and mastery over the neighboring peoples whether they desire it or not. How can that be worthy of a statesman or lawgiver which is not even lawful? and government is not lawful when it is carried on not only justly but also unjustly—and superior strength may be unjustly exercised. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> Moreover we do not see this in the other sciences either: it is no part of a physician’s or ship-captain’s business to use either persuasion or compulsion upon the patients in the one case and the crew<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <q rend="single">the passengers.</q></note> in the other. Yet most peoples seem to think that despotic rule is statesmanship, and are not ashamed to practise towards others treatment which they declare to be unjust and detrimental for themselves; for in their own internal affairs they demand just government, yet in their relations with other peoples they pay no attention to justice. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  Yet it is strange if there is not a natural distinction between peoples suited to be despotically ruled and those not suited; so that if this is so, it is not proper to attempt to exercise despotic government over all people, but only over those suited for it, just as it is not right to hunt human beings for food or sacrifice, but only the game suitable for this purpose, that is, such wild creatures as are good to eat. And moreover it is possible even for a single state in isolation to be happy,  </p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:7" n="1325a">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1325a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that is one that is well governed, in as much as it is conceivable that a state might be carried on somewhere in isolation, enjoying good laws, and in such a state the system of the constitution will not be framed for the purpose of war or of overpowering its enemies—for we are to suppose everything to do with war to be excluded.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  It is evident therefore that while all military pursuits are to be deemed honorable, they are not so as being the ultimate end of all things but as means to that end. And it is the business of the good lawgiver to study how a state, a race of men or any other community is to partake of the good life and the happiness possible for them. Some however of the regulations laid down will vary; and in case there exist any neighbor peoples, it is the business of the legislative art to consider what sort of exercises should be practised in relation to what sort of neighbors or how the state is to adopt the regulations that are suitable in relation to each.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">But this question of the proper end for the best constitutions to aim at may receive its due consideration later.<note resp="Rackham">See 13, 14.</note> </p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_3"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  We turn to those who, while agreeing that the life of virtue is the most desirable, differ about the way in which that life should be pursued. Some disapprove of holding office in the state, thinking that the life of the free man<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is different from the life of politics and is the most desirable of any; whereas others think the political life the best life, for they argue that it is impossible for the man who does nothing to do well, and doing well and happiness are the same thing.<note resp="Rackham">On the ambiguous use of <q rend="single">do well</q> see 1323b 32 n.</note> To these two parties we must reply that both are partly right and partly wrong. The former are right in saying that the life of the free man is better than the life of mastership, for this is true—there is nothing specially dignified in employing a slave, as a slave, for giving orders about menial duties has in it nothing of nobility; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> yet to think that all government is exercising the authority of a master is a mistake, for there is as wide a difference between ruling free men and ruling slaves as there is between the natural freeman and the natural slave themselves. But these things have been adequately decided in the first discourses.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. Book 1.</note> But to praise inaction more highly than action is an error, for happiness is an activity, and further the actions of the just and temperate have in them the realization of much that is noble. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Yet on the strength of these decisions somebody might perhaps suppose that the highest good is to be the master of the world, since thus one would have the power to compass the greatest number and the noblest kind of actions, and therefore it is not the duty of the man that is capable of ruling to surrender office to his neighbor, but rather to take it from him, and no account must be taken by father of sons nor by sons of father nor in general by one friend of another, and no heed must be paid to them in comparison with this; for the best thing is the most to be desired, and to do well is the best thing. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> Now this statement is perhaps true </p></div>
  
 <div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:7" n="1325b">

But perhaps it cannot belong to them, and this is a false assumption. For a man’s acts can no longer be noble if he does not excel as greatly as a man excels a woman or a father his children or a master his slaves, so that one who transgresses cannot afterwards achieve anything sufficient to rectify the lapse from virtue that he had already committed; because for equals the noble and just consists in their taking turns, since this is equal and alike, but for those that are equal to have an unequal share and those that are alike an unlike share is contrary to nature, and nothing contrary to nature is noble. Hence in case there is another person who is our superior in virtue and in practical capacity for the highest functions, him it is noble to follow and him it is just to obey; though he must possess not only virtue but also capacity that will render him capable of action. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  But if these things are well said, and if happiness is to be defined as well-doing, the active life is the best life both for the whole state collectively and for each man individually. But the active life is not necessarily active in relation to other men, as some people think, nor are only those processes of thought active that are pursued for the sake of the objects that result from action, but far more<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>those speculations and thoughts that have their end in themselves and are pursued for their own sake; for the end is to do well, and therefore is a certain form of action.<note resp="Rackham">Cf. 1323b 32 n., 1325a 21.</note> And even with actions done in relation to external objects we predicate action in the full sense chiefly of the master-craftsmen who direct the action by their thoughts. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Moreover with cities also, those that occupy an isolated situation and pursue a policy of isolation are not necessarily inactive; for state activities also can be sectional, since the sections of the state have many common relations with one another. And this is also possible similarly in the case of any individual human being; for otherwise God and the whole universe could hardly be well circumstanced, since they have no external activities by the side of their own private activities.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">It is therefore manifest that the same life must be the best both for each human being individually and for states and mankind collectively.</p>

For a state like other things has a certain function to perform, so that it is the state most capable of performing this function that is to be deemed the greatest, just as one would pronounce Hippocrates to be greater, not as a human being but as a physician, than somebody who surpassed him in bodily size.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  All the same, even if it be right to judge the state by the test of its multitude, this ought not to be done with regard to the multitude of any and every class (for states are doubtless bound to contain a large number of slaves<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and resident aliens and foreigners), but the test should be the number of those who are a part of the state—the special parts of which a state consists. It is superiority in the number of these that indicates a great state; a state that sends forth to war a large number of the baser sort and a small number of heavy-armed soldiers cannot possibly be a great state—for a great state is not the same thing as a state with a large population. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  But certainly experience also shows that it is difficult and perhaps impossible for a state with too large a population to have good legal government. At all events we see that none of the states reputed to be well governed is without some restriction in regard to numbers. The evidence of theory proves the same point. Law is a form of order, and good law must necessarily mean good order; but an excessively large number cannot participate in order: to give it order would surely be a task for divine power, which holds even this universe together.<note resp="Rackham">In the MSS. this clause follows the next.</note> Hence that state also must necessarily be the most beautiful with whose magnitude is combined the above-mentioned limiting principle; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  for certainly beauty is usually found in number and magnitude, but there is a due measure of magnitude for a city-state as there also is for all other things—animals, plants, tools; each of these if too small or excessively large will not possess its own proper efficiency, but in some cases will have entirely lost its true nature and in others will be in a defective condition: for instance, a ship a span long will not be a ship at all, nor will a ship a quarter of a mile long, and even when it reaches a certain size, </p></div>

   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1326b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in some cases smallness and in others excessive largeness will make it sail badly. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  Similarly a state consisting of too few people will not be self-sufficing (which is an essential quality of a state), and one consisting of too many, though self-sufficing in the mere necessaries, will be so in the way in which a nation<note resp="Rackham">i.e. presumably an Ethnos in the usual sense, a community composed of villages loosely bound together by relationship and trade, and united for defence, but not for political life; not an Ethnos of associated cities.</note> is, and not as a state, since it will not be easy for it to possess constitutional government—for who will command its over-swollen multitude in war? or who will serve as its herald, unless he have the lungs of a Stentor? It follows that the lowest limit for the existence of a state is when it consists of a population that reaches the minimum number that is self-sufficient for the purpose of living the good life after the manner of a political community. It is possible also for one that exceeds this one in number to be a greater state, but, as we said, this possibility of increase is not without limit, and what the limit of the state’s expansion is can easily be seen from practical considerations. The activities of the state are those of the rulers and those of the persons ruled, and the work of a ruler is to direct the administration and to judge law-suits; but in order to decide questions of justice and in order to distribute the offices according to merit it is necessary for the citizens to know each other’s personal characters, since where this does not happen to be the case the business of electing officials and trying law-suits is bound to go badly; haphazard decision is unjust in both matters, and this<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>must obviously prevail in an excessively numerous community.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/> Also in such a community it is easy for foreigners and resident aliens to usurp the rights of citizenship, for the excessive number of the population makes it not difficult to escape detection. It is clear therefore that the best limiting principle for a state is the largest expansion of the population, with a view to self-sufficiency that can well be taken in at one view.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">Such may be our conclusion on the question of the size of the state.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_5"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> Very much the same holds good about its territory. As to the question what particular kind of land it ought to have, it is clear that everybody would command that which is most self-sufficing (and such is necessarily that which bears every sort of produce, for self-sufficiency means having a supply of everything and lacking nothing). In extent and magnitude the land ought to be of a size that will enable the inhabitants to live a life of liberal and at the same time temperate leisure. Whether this limiting principle is rightly or wrongly stated must be considered more precisely later on,<note resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled in the work as it has come down to us.</note> when we come to raise the general subject of property and the ownership of wealth,—how and in what way it ought to be related to the employment of wealth<note resp="Rackham">The distinction seems to be between owning (or perhaps getting) wealth and using it; but a probable emendation of the Greek gives <q rend="single">how we ought to stand in relation to its employment.</q></note>; about this question there are many controversies, owing to those that draw us towards either extreme of life, the one school towards parsimony and the other towards luxury. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> The proper configuration of the country it is not difficult to state (though there are some points on which the advice of military experts also must be taken): on the one hand it should be difficult for enemies to invade and easy for the people themselves to march out from, </p></div>

 <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1327a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in addition, on the other hand, the same thing holds good of the territory that we said about the size of the population—it must be well able to be taken in at one view, and that means being a country easy for military defence. As to the site of the city, if it is to be ideally placed, it is proper for it to be well situated with regard both to the sea and to the country. One defining principle is that mentioned above<note resp="Rackham">At the beginning of 5.2.</note>—the city must be in communication with all parts of the territory for the purpose of sending out military assistance; and the remaining principle is that it must be easily accessible for the conveyance to it of the agricultural produce, and also of timber-wood and any other such material that the country happens to possess.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> As to communication with the sea it is in fact much debated whether it is advantageous to well-ordered states or harmful. It is maintained that the visits of persons brought up under other institutions are detrimental to law and order, and so also is a swollen population, which grows out of sending out abroad and receiving in a number of traders, but is unfavorable to good government.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  Now it is not difficult to see that, if these consequences are avoided, it is advantageous in respect of both security and the supply of necessary commodities<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that the city and the country should have access to the sea. With a view to enduring wars more easily people that are to be secure must be capable of defensive operations on both elements, land and sea, and with a view to striking at assailants, even if it be not possible on both elements, yet to do so on one or the other will be more in the power of people that have access to both. And the importation of commodities that they do not happen to have in their own country and the export of their surplus products are things indispensable; for the state ought to engage in commerce for its own interest, but not for the interest of the foreigner.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  People that throw open their market to the world do so for the sake of revenue, but a state that is not to take part in that sort of profit-making need not possess a great commercial port. But since even now we see many countries and cities possessing sea-ports and harbors conveniently situated with regard to the city, so as not to form part of the same town<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">part of the town itself.</q></note> and yet not to be too far off, but commanded by walls and other defence-works of the kind, it is manifest that if any advantage does result through the communication of city with port the state will possess this advantage, and if there is any harmful result it is easy to guard against it by means of laws stating and regulating what persons are not and what persons are to have intercourse with one another.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> On the question of naval forces, there is no doubt that to possess them up to a certain strength is most desirable </p></div>

In fact we see this state of thing existing even now in some places, for instance in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>; the Heracleotes man a large fleet of triremes, although they possess a city of but moderate size as compared with others.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Let such then be our conclusions about the territories and harbors of cities, and the sea, and about naval forces.</p> <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_6"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> About the citizen population, we said before what is its proper limit of numbers. Let us now speak<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of what ought to be the citizens’ natural character. Now this one might almost discern by looking at the famous cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and by observing how the whole inhabited world is divided up among the nations.<note resp="Rackham">4. fin.</note> The nations inhabiting the cold places and those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> are full of spirit but somewhat deficient in intelligence and skill, so that they continue comparatively free, but lacking in political organization and capacity to rule their neighbors. The peoples of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on the other hand are intelligent and skillful in temperament, but lack spirit, so that they are in continuous subjection and slavery. But the Greek race participates in both characters, just as it occupies the middle position geographically, for it is both spirited and intelligent; hence it continues to be free and to have very good political institutions, and to be capable of ruling all mankind if it attains constitutional unity.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> The same diversity also exists among the Greek races compared with one another: some have a one-sided nature, others are happily blended in regard to both these capacities.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. intelligence and high spirit, capacity for self-government and capacity for empire.</note> It is clear therefore that people that are to be easily guided to virtue by the lawgiver must be both intellectual and spirited in their nature. For as to what is said by certain persons about the character that should belong to their Guardians<note resp="Rackham">The ruling class in Plato’s Ideal State,<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 375c">Plat.

Therefore Archilochus<note resp="Rackham">Archilochus of <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> (one of the earliest lyric poets, fl. <date when="-0600">600</date> B.C., the inventor of the iambic meter, which he used for lampoons), fr. 61 Bergk, 676 Diehl, 67 Edmonds,<title>Elegy and Iambus</title>, 2. 133.</note> for instance, when reproaching his friends, appropriately apostrophizes his spirit: <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="lyric">For ’tis thy friends that make thee choke with rage.</l> </quote> Moreover it is from this faculty that power to command and love of freedom are in all cases derived; for spirit is a commanding and indomitable element. But it is a mistake to describe the Guardians as cruel towards strangers; it is not right to be cruel towards anybody, and men of great-souled nature are not fierce except towards wrongdoers, and their anger is stillfiercer against their companions if they think that these are wronging them, as has been said before.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And this is reasonable, because they think that in addition to the harm done them they are also being defrauded of a benefit by persons whom they believe to owe them one.

<p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1328b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for as each set of people pursues participation in happiness in a different manner and by different means they make for themselves different modes of life and different constitutions. And we must also further consider how many there are of these things referred to that are indispensable for the existence of a state; for among them will be the things which we pronounce to be parts of a state, owing to which their presence is essential. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> We must therefore consider the list of occupations that a state requires : for from these it will appear what the indispensable classes are. First then a state must have a supply of food; secondly, handicrafts (since life needs many tools); third, arms (since the members of the association must necessarily possess arms both to use among themselves and for purposes of government, in cases of insubordination, and to employ against those who try to molest them from without); also a certain abundance of money, in order that they may have enough both for their internal needs and for requirements of war; fifth, a primary need, the service of religion, termed a priesthood; and sixth in number and most necessary of all, a provision for deciding questions of interests and of rights between the citizens. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  These then are the occupations that virtually every state requires (for the state is not any chance multitude of people but one self-sufficient for the needs of life, as we say,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. Books 2.1.7, 3.1.8, 5.2.10.</note> and if any of these industries happens to be wanting, it is impossible for that association to be absolutely self-sufficient). It is necessary therefore for the state to be organized<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>on the lines of these functions; consequently it must possess a number of farmers who will provide the food, and craftsmen, and the military class, and the wealthy, and priests and judges to decide questions of necessity<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be altered to give <q rend="single">matters of justice.</q></note> and of interests.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_8"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> These matters having been settled, it remains to consider whether everybody is to take part in all of these functions (for it is possible for the whole of the people to be at once farmers and craftsmen and the councillors and judges), or whether we are to assume different classes corresponding to each of the functions mentioned, or whether some of them must necessarily be specialized and others combined. But it will not be the same in every form of constitution; for, as we said,<note resp="Rackham">Cf. Book 4.4 and 14.</note> it is possible either for all the people to take part in all the functions or for not all to take part in all but for certain people to have certain functions. In fact these different distributions of functions are the cause of the difference between constitutions: democracies are states in which all the people participate in all the functions, oligarchies where the contrary is the case. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  But at present we are studying the best constitution, and this is the constitution under which the state would be most happy, and it has been stated before<note resp="Rackham">1.5.</note> that happiness cannot be forthcoming without virtue; it is therefore clear from these considerations that in the most nobly constituted state, and the one that possesses men that are absolutely just, not merely just relatively to the principle that is the basis of the constitution, the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil </p></div>

But here also the answer is clear, because in a certain sense they should be assigned to the same persons, but in a certain sense to different ones. Inasmuch as each of these two functions belongs to a different prime of life, and one requires wisdom, the other strength, they are to be assigned to different people; but inasmuch as it is a thing impossible that when a set of men are able to employ force and to resist control, these should submit always to be ruled, from this point of view both functions must be assigned to the same people; for those who have the power of arms have the power to decide whether the constitution shall stand or fall. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  The only course left them is to assign this constitutional function to both sets of men without distinction,<note resp="Rackham">Or, amending this curious Greek, <q rend="single">for the constitution to assign both these functions to the same people.</q></note> yet not simultaneously, but, as in the natural order of things strength is found in the younger men and wisdom in the elder, it seems to be expedient and just for their functions to be allotted to both in this way, for this mode of division possesses conformity with merit.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Moreover the ownership of properties also must be centered round these classes, for the citizens must necessarily possess plentiful means, and these are the citizens.

We may almost take it therefore that all other political devices also have been discovered repeatedly, or rather an infinite number of times over, in the lapse of ages; for the discoveries of a necessary kind are probably taught by need itself, and when the necessaries have been provided it is reasonable that things contributing to refinement and luxury should find their development; so that we must assume that this is the way with political institutions also.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> The antiquity of all of them is indicated by the history of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; for the Egyptians are reputed to be the oldest of nations, but they have always had laws and a political system. Hence we should use the results of previous discovery when adequate, while endeavoring to investigate matters hitherto passed over.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">It has been stated before that the land ought to be owned by those who possess arms and those who share the rights of the constitution, and why the cultivators ought to be a different caste from these, and what is the proper extent and conformation of the country. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> We have now to discuss first the allotment of the land, and the proper class and character of its cultivators; since we advocate not common ownership of land, as some have done,  </p></div>

It is necessary therefore for the land to be divided into two parts, of which one must be common and the other the private property of individuals; and each of these two divisions must again be divided in two. Of the common land one portion should be assigned to the services of religion, and the other to defray the cost of the common meals; of the land in private ownership one part should be the district near the frontiers, and another the district near the city, in order that two plots may be assigned to each citizen and all may have a share in both districts. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  This arrangement satisfies equity and justice, and also conduces to greater unanimity in facing border warfare. Where this system is not followed, one set of people are reckless about quarrelling with the neighboring states,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the other set are too cautious and neglect considerations of honor. Hence some people have a law that the citizens whose land is near the frontier are not to take part in deliberation as to wars against neighboring states, on the ground that private interest would prevent them from being able to take counsel wisely. The land must therefore be divided up in this manner because of the reasons aforesaid. </p>

Of these laborers those in private employment must be among the private possessions of the owners of the estates, and those working on the common land common property.

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1330b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  and among the remaining considerations, a sloping site is favorable both for political and for military purposes. For military purposes therefore the site should be easy of exit for the citizens themselves, and difficult for the adversary to approach and to blockade, and it must possess if possible a plentiful natural supply of pools and springs, but failing this, a mode has been invented of supplying water by means of constructing an abundance of large reservoirs for rain-water, so that a supply may never fail the citizens when they are debarred from their territory by war. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  And since we have to consider the health of the inhabitants, and this depends upon the place being well situated both on healthy ground and with a healthy aspect, and secondly upon using wholesome water-supplies, the following matter also must be attended to as of primary importance. Those things which we use for the body in the largest quantity, and most frequently, contribute most to health; and the influence of the water-supply and of the air is of this nature. Hence in wise cities if all the sources of water are not equally pure and there is not an abundance of suitable springs, the water-supplies for drinking must be kept separate from those for other requirements. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  As to fortified positions, what is expedient is not the same for all forms of constitution alike; for example, a citadel-hill is suitable for oligarchy and monarchy,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a level site for democracy; neither is favorable to an aristocracy, but rather several strong positions. The arrangement of the private dwellings is thought to be more agreeable and more convenient for general purposes if they are laid out in straight streets, after the modern fashion, that is, the one introduced by Hippodamus<note resp="Rackham">See Book 2.5.</note>; but it is more suitable for security in war if it is on the contrary plan, as cities used to be in ancient times; for that arrangement is difficult for foreign troops<note resp="Rackham">i.e. an enemy’s mercenaries; but the MSS. give <q rend="single">difficult for foreign troops to make sorties from [i.e. presumably to find their way out when once they have got in, cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.4.2">Thuc. 2.4.2</bibl>] and for attackers to find their way about in.</q></note> to enter and to find their way about in when attacking. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  Hence it is well to combine the advantages of both plans (for this is possible if the houses arelaid out in the way which among the farmers some people call <q rend="single">on the slant</q><note resp="Rackham">The Roman <emph>quincunx</emph>, each plant of one row being in line with the gap between two plants of the next row, thus:</note> in the case of vines), and not to lay out the whole city in straight streets, but only certain parts and districts, for in this way it will combine security with beauty.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">As regards walls, those who aver that cities which pretend to valor should not have them hold too old-fashioned a view—and that though they see that the cities that indulge in that form of vanity are refuted by experience.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> It is true that against an evenly matched foe and one little superior in numbers it is not honorable to try to secure oneself bythe strength of one’s fortifications; but as it does and may happen that the superior numbers of the attackers may be too much for the human valor of a small force, if the city is to survive and not to suffer disaster or insult, the securest fortification of walls must be deemed to be the most warlike, </p></div>

Another point moreover that must not be forgotten is that those who have walls round the city can use their cities in both ways, both as walled cities and as open ones, whereas cities not possessing walls cannot be used in both ways.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  If then this is so, not only must walls be put round a city, but also attention must be paid to them in order that they may be suitable both in regard to the adornment of the city and in respect of military requirements, especially the new devices recently invented. For just as the attackers of a city are concerned to study the means by which they can gain the advantage, so also for the defenders some devices have already been invented and others they must discover and think out; for people do not even start attempting to attack those who are well prepared.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">And since the multitude of citizens must be distributed<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in separate messes, and the city walls must be divided up by guard-posts and towers in suitable places, it is clear that these facts themselves call for some of the messes to be organized at these guard-posts.

  <p> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_11"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  But it is fitting that the dwellings assigned to the gods and the most important of the official messes should have a suitable site, and the same for all, excepting those temples which are assigned a special place apart by the law or else by some utterance of the Pythian oracle. And the site would be suitable if it is one that is sufficiently conspicuous in regard to the excellence of its position, and also of superior strength in regard to the adjacentparts of the city.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> It is convenient that below this site should be laid out an agora of the kind customary in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>which they call a free agora, that is, one which has to be kept clear of all merchandise and into which no artisan or farmer or any other such person may intrude unless summoned by the magistrates.

And all the magistracies that superintend contracts, and the registration of actions at law, summonses and other such matters of administration, and also those that deal with the control of the markets and with what is termed policing the city, should have buildings adjacent to an agora or some public place of resort, and such a place is the neighborhood of the business agora, for we assign the upper agora as the place in which to spend leisure, and this one for necessary business.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> The arrangements in the country also should copy the plan described; there too the magistrates called in some states Wardens of the Woods and in others Land-superintendents must have their guard-posts and mess-rooms for patrol duty, and also temples must be distributed over the country, some dedicated to gods and some to heroes. But to linger at this point over the detailed statement and discussion of questions of this kind is waste of time.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The difficulty with such things is not so much in the matter of theory but in that of practice; to lay down principles is a work of aspiration, but their realization is the task of fortune.

 <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_12"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> We must now discuss the constitution itself, and ask what and of what character should be the components of the state that is to have felicity and good government. There are two things in which the welfare of all men consists: one of these is the correct establishment of the aim and end of their actions, the other the ascertainment of the actions leading to that end. (For the end proposed and the means adopted may be inconsistent with one another, as also they may be consistent; sometimes the aim has been correctly proposed, but people fail to achieve it in action, sometimes they achieve all the means successfully but the end that they posited was a bad one, and sometimes they err as to both—for instance, in medicine practitioners are sometimes both wrong in their judgement of what qualities a healthy body ought to possess and unsuccessful in hitting on effective means to produce the distinctive aim that they have set before them; whereas in the arts and sciences both these things have to be secured, the end and the practical means to the end.)  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  Now it is clear that all men aim at the good life and at happiness, but though some possess the power to attain these things, some do not, owing to some factor of fortune or of nature </p></div>

    <p>(fortune because the good life needs also a certain equipment of means, <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1332a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and although it needs less of this for men of better natural disposition it needs more for those of worse); while others, although they have the power, go wrong at the start in their search for happiness.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. they misconceive the nature of happiness and select the wrong thing to aim at.</note> But the object before us is to discern the best constitution, and this is the one under which a state will be best governed, and a state will be best governed under the constitution under which it has the most opportunity for happiness; it is therefore clear that we must know whathappiness is. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  The view that we maintain (and this is the definition that we laid down in the<title>Ethics</title>,<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098a 16</bibl> and <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1176b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1176b 4</bibl> </note> if those discourses are of any value) is that happiness is the complete activity and employment of virtue, and this not conditionally but absolutely. When I say <q rend="single">conditionally</q> I refer to things necessary, by <q rend="single">absolutely</q> I mean <q rend="single">nobly</q>: for instance, to take the case of just actions, just acts of vengeance and of punishment spring it is true from virtue, but are necessary, and have the quality of nobility only in a limited manner (since it would be preferable that neither individual nor state should have any need of such things), whereas actions aiming at honors and resources<note resp="Rackham">A conjectural emendation gives <q rend="single">distinctions.</q></note> are the noblest actions absolutely; for the former class of acts consist in the removal<note resp="Rackham">This is a conjectural emendation; the MSS. give <q rend="single">the adoption.</q></note> of something evil, but actions of the latter kind are the opposite—they are the foundation and the generation of things good. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  The virtuous man will use even poverty, disease, and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the other forms of bad fortune in a noble manner, but felicity consists in their opposites (for it is a definition established by our ethical discourses<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a 15 ff.</bibl> </note> that the virtuous man is the man of such a character that because of his virtue things absolutely good are good to him, and it is therefore clear that his employment of these goods must also be virtuous and noble absolutely); and hence men actually suppose that external goods are the cause of happiness, just as if they were to assign the cause of a brilliantly fine performance on the harp to the instrument rather than to the skill of the player. It follows therefore from what has been said that some goods must be forthcoming to start with and others must be provided by the legislator.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  Hence we pray that the organization of the state may be successful in securing those goods which are in the control of fortune (for that fortune does control externalgoods we take as axiomatic); but when we come to the state’s being virtuous, to secure this is not the function of fortune but of science and policy. But then the virtue of the state is of course caused by the citizens who share in its government being virtuous; and in our state all the citizens share in the government. The point we have to consider therefore is, how does a man become virtuous? For even if it be possible for the citizens to be virtuous collectively without being so individually, the latter is preferable, since for each individual to be virtuous entails as a consequence the collective virtue of all.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  But there are admittedly three things by which men are made good and virtuous, and these three things are nature, habit and reason. For to start with, one must be born with the nature of a human being and not of some other animal; and secondly, one must be born of a certain quality of body and of soul. But there are some qualities that it is of no use to be born with, </p></div>

 <p rend="align(indent)">Now we have already<note resp="Rackham">In 4.</note> defined the proper natural character of those who are to be amenable to the hand of the legislator; what now remains is the task of education, for men learn some things by practice, others by precept.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_13"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  But since every political community is composed of rulers and subjects, we must therefore consider whether the rulers and the subjects ought to change, or to remain the same through life; for it is clear that their education also will have to be made to correspond with this distribution of functions. If then it were the case that the one class differed from the other as widely as we believe the gods and heroes to differ from mankind, having first a great superiority in regard to the body and then in regard to <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> the soul, so that the pre-eminence of the rulers was indisputable and manifest to the subjects, it is clear that it would be better for the same persons always to be rulers and subjects once for all;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  but as this is not easy to secure, and as we do not find anything corresponding to the great difference that Scylax states to exist between kings and subjects in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, it is clear that for many reasons it is necessary for all to share alike in ruling and being ruled in turn. For equality means for persons who are alike identity of status, and also it is difficult<note resp="Rackham">The emendation suggested by Richards gives <q rend="single">For equality and identity (of status) are just for persons who are alike, and it is difficult,</q> etc.</note> for a constitution to endure that is framed in contravention of justice. For all the people throughout the country are ranged on the side of the subject class in wishing for a revolution, and it is a thing inconceivable that those in the government should be sufficiently numerous to over power all of these together.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  But yet on the other hand that the rulers ought to be superior to the subjects cannot be disputed; therefore the lawgiver must consider how this is to be secured, and how they are to participate in the government. And this has been already<note resp="Rackham">8.3, 1329a 4 ff.</note> discussed. Nature has given the distinction by making the group that is itself the same in race partly younger and partly older, of which two sets it is appropriate to the one to be governed and for the other to govern; and no one chafes or thinks himself better than his rulers when he is governed on the ground of age, especially as he is going to get back what he has thus contributed to the common stock when he reaches the proper age.  
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> In a sense therefore we must say that the rulers and ruled are the same, and in a sense different. </p></div>

But since we say that the goodness of a citizen<note resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give <q rend="single">of the best citizen.</q></note> and ruler are the same as that of the best man, and that the same person ought to become a subject first and a ruler afterwards, it will be important for the legislator to study how and by what courses of training good men are to be produced, and what is the end of the best life.</p>

And following the same lines as they, some later writers also have pronounced the same opinion: in praising the Spartan constitution they express admiration for the aim of its founder on the ground that he framed the whole of his legislation with a view to conquest and to war. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  These views are easy to refute on theoretical grounds and also have now been refuted by the facts of history. For just as most of mankind covet being master of many servants<note resp="Rackham">Or possibly, <q rend="single">covet a wide empire.</q></note> because this produces a manifold supply of fortune’s goods, so Thibron<note resp="Rackham">Unknown.</note> and all the other writers about the Spartan constitution<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>show admiration for the lawgiver of the Spartans because owing to their having been trained to meet dangers they governed a wide empire. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  Yet it clearly follows that since as a matter of fact at the present day the Spartans no longer possess an empire, they are not happy, and their lawgiver was not a good one. And it is ridiculous that although they have kept to his laws, and although nothing hinders their observing the laws, they have lost the noble life. Also writers have a wrong conception of the power for which the lawgiver should display esteem; to govern freemen is nobler and more conjoined with virtue than to rule despotically. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_13"/>  And again it is not a proper ground for deeming a state happy and for praising its lawgiver, that it has practised conquest with a view to ruling<note resp="Rackham">A probable emendation gives <q rend="single">that he has trained it with a view to ruling.</q></note> over its neighbors. This principle is most disastrous; it follows from it that an individual citizen who has the capacity ought to endeavor to attain the power to hold sway over his own city; but this is just what the Spartans charge as a reproach against their king Pausanias, although he attained such high honor. No principle therefore and no law of this nature is either statesmanlike or profitable, nor is it true; the same ideals are the best both for individuals and for communities, and the lawgiver should endeavor to implant them in the souls of mankind. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_14"/> The proper object of practising military training is not in order that men may enslave those who do not deserve slavery, but in order that first they may themselves avoid becoming enslaved to others; then so that they may seek suzerainty for the benefit of the subject people, </p></div>

Most military states remain safe while at war but perish when they have won their empire; in peace-time they lose their keen temper, like iron.<note resp="Rackham">i.e. an iron blade when not used loses keenness and has to be re-tempered.</note> The lawgiver is to blame, because he did not educate them to be able to employ leisure.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_16"/>  And since it appears that men have the same end collectively and individually, and since the same distinctive aim must necessarily belong both to the best man and to the best government, it is clear that the virtues relating to leisure are essential<note resp="Rackham">i.e. to the state as well as to the individual.</note>; since, as has been said repeatedly, peace is the end of war, leisure of business. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_17"/> But the virtues useful for leisure and for its employment are not only those that operate during leisure but also those that operate in business; for many of the necessaries must needs be forthcoming to give us opportunity for leisure. Therefore it is proper for the state to be temperate,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>brave and enduring; since, as the proverb goes, there is no leisure for slaves, but people unable to face danger bravely are the slaves of their assailants. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_18"/>  Therefore courage and fortitude are needed for business, love of wisdom for leisure, temperance and justice for both seasons, and more especially when men are at peace and have leisure; for war compels men to be just and temperate, whereas the enjoyment of prosperity and peaceful leisure tend to make them insolent. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_19"/>  Therefore much justice and much temperance are needed by those who are deemed very prosperous and who enjoy all the things counted as blessings, like the persons, if such there be, as the poets say,<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Hes. WD 170">Hes. WD 170 ff.</bibl> </note> that dwell in the Islands of the Blest; these will most need wisdom, temperance and justice, the more they are at leisure and have an abundance of such blessings. It is clear therefore why a state that is to be happy and righteous must share in these virtues; for if it is disgraceful to be unable to use our good things, it is still more disgraceful to be unable to use them in time of leisure, and although showing ourselves good men when engaged in business and war, in times of peace and leisure to seem no better than slaves.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_20"/> Therefore we must not cultivate virtue after the manner of the state of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>

Now we have indeed previously decided that it requires nature and habit and reason, and among these, what particular quality of nature men ought to possess has been defined previously; but it remains to consider whether men ought to be educated first by means of the reason or by the habits. For between reason and habit the most perfect harmony ought to exist, as it is possible both for the reason to have missed the highest principle and for men to have been as wrongly trained through the habits.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_22"/> This therefore at all events is clear in the first place, in the case of men as of other creatures, that their engendering starts from a beginning, and that the end starts from a certain beginning that is another end,<note resp="Rackham">A conjectural addition to the text gives <q rend="single">the end to which a certain beginning leads is itself the beginning of another end.</q> The active use of the reason is the end (i.e. the completion and the purpose) of the birth and growth of the human animal.</note> and that reason and intelligence are for us the end of our natural development, so that it is with a view to these ends that our engendering and the training of our habits must be regulated.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_23"/> And secondly, as soul and body are two, so we observe that the soul also has two parts, the irrational part and the part possessing reason, and that the states which they experience are two in number,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the one being desire and the other intelligence; and as the body is prior in its development to the soul, so the irrational part of the soul is prior to the rational. And this also is obvious, because passion and will, and also appetite,<note resp="Rackham">These three emotions are subdivisions of <q rend="single">desire</q> above.</note> exist in children even as soon as they are born, but it is the nature of reasoning and intelligence to arise in them as they grow older. Therefore in the first place it is necessary for the training of the body to precede that of the mind, and secondly for the training of the appetite to precede that of the intelligence; but the training of the appetite must be for the sake of the intellect, and that of the body for the sake of the soul.</p>
    <p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_14"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/>  Inasmuch therefore as it is the duty of the lawgiver to consider from the start how the children reared are to obtain the best bodily frames, he must first pay attention to the union of the sexes, and settle when and in what condition a couple should practise matrimonial intercourse. In legislating for this partnership he must pay regard partly to the persons themselves and to their span of life, so that they may arrive together at the same period in their ages, and their powers may not be at discord through the man being still capable of parentage and the wife incapable, or the wife capable and the man not (for this causes differences and actual discord between them),  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> and also he must consider as well the succession of the children, for the children must neither be too far removed in their ages from the fathers (since elderly fathers get no good from their children’s return of their favors, nor do the children from the help they get from the fathers),  </p></div>

For since the period of parentage terminates, speaking generally, with men at the age of seventy at the outside, and with women at fifty, the commencement of their union should correspond in respect of age with these times. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  But the mating of the young is bad for child-bearing; for in all animal species the offspring of the young are more imperfect and likely to produce female children,<note resp="Rackham">Some editors write <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηλύτοκα</foreign> and interpret <q rend="single">more likely to be born females.</q> ( <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηλυτόκα</foreign>, <q rend="single">likely to bear females,</q> is applied to the young parents themselves in <bibl n="Aristot.

And a proof of this is that in all the states where it is the local custom to mate young men and young women, the people are deformed and small of body. And again young women labor more, and more of them die in childbirth; indeed according to some accounts such was the reason why the oracle<note resp="Rackham"> <quote xml:lang="grc">Μὴ τέμνε νέαν ἄλοκα</quote> (‘cut not a new furrow’) schol.</note> was given<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to the people of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, because many were dying owing to its being their custom for the women to marry young, and it did not refer to the harvest. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  And again it also contributes tochastity for the bestowal of women in marriage to be made when they are older, for it is thought that they are more licentious when they have had intercourse in youth. Also the males are thought to be arrested in bodily growth if they have intercourse while the seed is still growing, for this also has a fixed period after passing which it is no longer plentiful.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  Therefore it is fitting for the women to be married at about the age of eighteen and the men at thirty-seven or a little before<note resp="Rackham">The word <q rend="single">before</q> is a conjectural insertion.</note>—for that will give long enough for the union to take place with their bodily vigor at its prime, and for it to arrive with a convenient coincidence of dates at the time when procreation ceases. Moreover the succession of the children to the estates, if their birth duly occurs soon after the parents marry, will take place when they are beginning their prime, and when the parents’ period of vigor has now come to a close, towards the age of seventy.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/>  The proper age therefore for union has been discussed; as to the proper times in respect of the season we may accept what is customary with most people, who have rightly decided even as it is to practise marital cohabitation in winter. And people should also study for themselves, when their time comes, the teachings of physicians and natural philosophers on the subject of the procreation of children; the suitable bodily seasons are adequately discussed by the physicians, </p></div>

The athlete’s habit of body is not serviceable for bodily fitness as required by a citizen, nor for health and parentage, nor yet is a habit that is too valetudinarian and unfit for labor, but the condition that lies between them. The bodily habit therefore should have been trained by exercise, but not by exercises that are violent, and not for one form of labor only, as is the athlete’s habit of body, but for the pursuits of free men. And these arrangements must be provided alike for men and women. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  And pregnant women also must take care of their bodies, not avoiding exercise nor adopting a low diet; this it is easy for the lawgiver to secure by ordering them to make a journey daily for the due worship of the deities whose office is the control of childbirth. As regards the mind, however, on the contrary it suits them to pass the time more indolently than as regards their bodies; for children before birth are evidently affected by the mother just as growing plants are by the earth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/> As to exposing or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>rearing the children born, let there be a law that no deformed child shall be reared; but on the ground of number of children, if the regular customs hinder any of those born being exposed, there must be a limit fixed to the procreation of offspring, and if any people have a child as a result of intercourse in contravention of these regulations, abortion must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  And since the beginning of the fit age for a man and for a woman, at which they are to begin their union, has been defined, let it also be decided for how long a time it is suitable for them to serve the state in the matter of producing children. For the offspring of too elderly parents, as those of too young ones, are born imperfect both in body and mind, and the children of those that have arrived at old age are weaklings. Therefore the period must be limited to correspond with the mental prime; and this in the case of most men is the age stated by some of the poets, who measure men’s age by periods of seven years,<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Sol. Fr. 27">Solon fr. 27</bibl> </note>—it is about the age of fifty. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_12"/>  Therefore persons exceeding this age by four or five years must be discharged from the duty of producing children for the community, and for the rest of their lives if they have intercourse it must be manifestly for the sake of health or for some other similar reason. As to intercourse with another woman or man, in general it must be dishonorable for them to be known to take any part in it in any circumstances whatsoever as long as they are husband and wife and bear those names, </p></div>

It appears from examining the other animals, and is also shown by the foreign races that make it their aim to keep up the military habit of body, that a diet giving an abundance of milk is mostsuited to the bodies of children, and one that allows rather little wine because of the diseases that it causes.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> Moreover it is advantageous to subject them to as many movements as are practicable with children of that age. To prevent the limbs from being distorted owing to softness, some races even now employ certain mechanical appliances that keep the bodies of infants from being twisted. And it is also advantageous to accustom them at once from early childhood to cold, for this is most useful both for health and with a view to military service. Hence among many non-Greek races it is customary in the case of some peoples to wash the children at birth by dipping them in a cold river, and with others, for instance the Celts, to give them scanty covering.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  For it is better to inure them at the very start to everything possible, but to inure them gradually;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the bodily habit of children is naturally well fitted by warmth to be trained to bear cold. In the earliest period of life then it is expedient to employ this or a similar method of nursing;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  and the next period to this, up to the age of five, which it is not well to direct as yet to any study nor to compulsory labors, in order that they may not hinder the growth, should nevertheless be allowed enough movement to avoid bodily inactivity; and this exercise should be obtained by means of various pursuits, particularly play. But even the games must not be unfit for freemen, nor laborious, nor undisciplined.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>  Also the question of the kind of tales and stories that should be told to children of this age must be attended to by the officials called Children’s Tutors. For all such amusements should prepare the way for their later pursuits; hence most children’s games should be imitations of the serious occupations of later life.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  The legislators in the<title>Laws</title> <note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat.

The lawgiver ought therefore to banish indecent talk, as much as anything else, out of the state altogether (for light talk about anything disgraceful soon passes into action)—so most of all from among the young, so that they may not say nor hear anything of the sort; and anybody found saying or doing any of the things prohibited, if he is of free station but not yet promoted to reclining at the public meals, must be punished with marks of dishonor and with beating, and an older offender must be punished with marks of dishonor degrading to a free man, because of his slavish behavior.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  And since we banish any talk of this kind, clearly we must also banish the seeing of either pictures or representations that are indecent. The officials must therefore be careful that there may be no sculpture or painting that represents indecent actions, except in the temples of a certain class of gods to whom the law allows even scurrility; but in regard to these<note resp="Rackham">The MS. text gives <q rend="single">and in addition to these</q>; and the word <q rend="single">still</q> may be an interpolation.</note> the law permits men still of suitable age to worship the gods both on their own behalf and on behalf of the children and women.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> But the younger ones must not be allowed in the audience at lampoons<note resp="Rackham">Iambic verses, often abusive and indecent, recited at festivals of Dionysus.</note> and at comedy, before they reach the age at which they will now have the right to recline at table in company and to drink deeply, and at which their education will render all of them immune to the harmful effects of such things. For the present therefore we have merely mentioned these matters in passing, but later we must stop to settle them more definitely, first discussing fully whether legislation prohibiting the attendance of the young is desirable or not, and how such prohibition should be put in force; but on the present occasion we have touched on the question only in the manner necessary.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  For perhaps the tragic actor Theodorus<note resp="Rackham">A great Athenian performer of Sophocles; he took the part of Antigone.</note> used to put the matter not badly: he had never once allowed anybody to produce his part<note resp="Rackham">Loosely put for <q rend="single">to appear on the stage.</q></note> before him, not even one of the poor actors, as he said that audiences are attracted by what they hear first; and this happens alike in regard to our dealings with people and to our dealings with things—all that comes first we like better.

Indeed the neglect of this in states is injurious to their constitutions; for education ought to be adapted to the particular form of constitution, since the particular character belonging to each constitution both guards the constitution generally and originally establishes it—for instance the democratic spirit promotes democracy and the oligarchic spirit oligarchy; and the best spirit always causes a better constitution. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  Moreover in regard to all the faculties and crafts certain forms of preliminary education<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and training in their various operations are necessarys o that manifestly this is also requisite in regard to the actions of virtue. And inasmuch as the end for the whole state is one, it is manifest that education also must necessarily be one and the same for all and that the superintendence of this must be public, and not on private lines, in the way in which at present each man superintends the education of his own children, teaching them privately, and whatever special branch of knowledge he thinks fit. But matters of public interest ought to be under public supervision; at the same time we ought not to think that any of the citizens belongs to himself, but that all belong to the state, for each is a part of the state, and it is natural for the superintendence of the several parts to have regard to the superintendence of the whole. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> And one might praise the Spartans in respect of this, for they pay the greatest attention to the training of their children, and conduct it on a public system.</p> 
   <p rend="align(indent)">It is clear then that there should be legislation about education and that it should be conducted on a public system.

At present there are differences of opinion as to the proper tasks to be set; for all peoples do not agree as to the things that the young ought to learn, either with a view to virtue or with a view to the best life, nor is it clear whether their studies should be regulated more with regard to intellect or with regard to character. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  And confusing questions arise out of the education that actually prevails, and it is not at all clear whether the pupils should practise pursuits that are practically morally edifying, or higher accomplishments—for all these views have won the support of some judges; </p></div>

A task and also an art or a science must be deemed vulgar if it renders the body or soul or mind of free men useless for the employments and actions of virtue. Hence we entitle vulgar all such arts as deteriorate the condition of the body, and also the industries that earn wages; for they make the mind preoccupied and degraded.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  And even with the liberal sciences, although it is notilliberal to take part in some of them up to a point, to devote oneself to them too assiduously and carefully is liable to have the injurious results specified. Also it makes much difference what object one has in view in a pursuit or study; if one follows it for the sake of oneself or one’s friends, or on moral grounds, it is not illiberal,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but the man who follows the same pursuit because of other people would often appear to be acting in a menial and servile manner.</p>
  <p rend="align(indent)">The branches of study at present established fall into both classes, as was said before.<note resp="Rackham">1.4.</note>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  There are perhaps fourcustomary subjects of education, reading and writing, gymnastics, music, and fourth, with some people, drawing; reading and writing and drawing being taught as being useful for the purposes of life and very serviceable, and gymnastics as contributing to manly courage; but as to music, here one might raise a question. For at present most people take part in it for the sake of pleasure; but those, who originally included it in education did so because, as has often been said, nature itself seeks to be able not only to engage rightly in business but also to occupy leisure nobly; for—to speak about it yet again<note resp="Rackham">Cf. Book 7, 1334a 2-10.</note>—this is the first principle of all things.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/> For if although both business and leisure are necessary, yet leisure is more desirable and more fully an end than business, we must inquire what is the proper occupation of leisure. For assuredly it should not be employed in play, since it would follow that play is our end in life. But if this is impossible, and sports should rather be employed in our times of business (for a man who is at work needs rest, and rest is the object of play, while business is accompanied by toil and exertion), it follows that in introducing sports we must watch the right opportunity for their employment, since we are applying them to serve as medicine; for the activity of play is a relaxation of the soul, and serves as recreation because of its pleasantness.</p></div>

And this is not possessed by the busy but by the leisured; for the busy man busies himself for the sake of some end as not being in his possession, but happiness is an end achieved, which all men think is accompanied by pleasure and not by pain. But all men do not go on to define this pleasure in the same way, but according to their various natures and to their own characters, and the pleasure with which the best man thinks that happiness is conjoined is the best pleasure and the one arising from the noblest sources. So that it is clear that some subjects must be learnt and acquired merely with a view to the pleasure in their pursuit, and that these studies and these branches of learning are ends in themselves, while the forms of learning related to business are studied as necessary and as means to other things. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/> Hence our predecessors included music in education not as a necessity (for there is nothing necessary about it), nor as useful (in the way in which reading and writing are useful for business and for household management and for acquiring learning and for many pursuits of civil life, while drawing also seems to be useful in making us better judges of the works of artists), nor yet again as we pursue gymnastics, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/> for the sake of health and strength (for we do not see either of these things produced as a result of music); it remains therefore that it is useful as a pastime in leisure, which is evidently the purpose for which people actually introduce it, for they rank it as a form of pastime that they think proper for free men. For this reason Homer wrote thus: <quote type="verse" rend="align(blockquote)"> <l met="dactylic">But him alone</l> <l>’Tis meet to summon to the festal banquet<note resp="Rackham">This line is not in our <title>Odyssey</title>, but apparently followed <bibl n="Hom.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> It is clear therefore that there is a form of education in which boys should be trained not because it is useful or necessary but as being liberal and noble; though whether there is one such subject of education or several, and what these are and how they are to be pursued, must be discussed later,<note resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled.</note> but as it is we have made this much progress on the way, that we have some testimony even from the ancients, derived from the courses of education which they founded—for the point is proved by music. And it is also clear that some of the useful subjects as well ought to be studied by the young not only because of their utility, like the study of reading and writing, but also because they may lead on to many other branches of knowledge;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  and similarly they should study drawing not in order that they may not go wrong in their private purchases and may avoid being cheated in buying and selling furniture, </p></div>

And since it is plain that education by habit must come before education by reason, and training of the body before training of the mind, it is clear from these considerations that the boys must be handed over to the care of the wrestling-master and the trainer; for the latter imparts a certain quality to the habit of the body and the former to its actions.</p>

Cf. 1288b 12 ff.</note> to the detriment of their bodily form and growth, while the Spartans although they have avoided this error yet make their boys animal in nature by their laborious exercises, in the belief that this is most contributory to manly courage. Yet, as has often been said, it is not right to regulate education with a view to one virtue only, or to this one most of all; indeed they do not even investigate the question whether this virtue is to be had in view at all. For neither in the lower animals nor in the case of foreign races do we see that courage goes with the wildest, but rather with the gentler and lion-like temperaments.<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Aristot.

And again we know that even the Spartans, although so long as they persisted by themselves in their laborious exercises they surpassed all other peoples, now fall behind others both in gymnastic and in military contests; for they used not to excel because they exercised their young men in this fashion but only because they trained and their adversaries did not.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> Consequently honor and not animal ferocity should play the first part; for it is not a wolf nor one of the other wild animals that will venture upon any noble hazard, but rather a good man. But those who let boys pursue these hard exercises too much and turn them out untrained in necessary things in real truth render them vulgar, making them available for statesmanship to use for one task only, and even for this task training them worse than others do, as our argument proves. And<note resp="Rackham">This sentence would come better at the end of 3.4.</note> we must not judge them from their former achievements but from the facts of today; for they have rivals in their education now, but they used to have none before.</p>

   <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1339a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for there is no small proof that too severe training can produce this result in the fact that in the list of Olympic victors one would only find two or three persons who have won both as men and as boys, because when people go into training in youththe severe exercises rob them of their strength.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> But when they have spent three years after puberty upon their other studies, then it is suitable to occupy the next period of life with laborious exercises and strict training diet<note resp="Rackham">i.e. compulsion to eat very large rations of prescribed food—the Greek way of training.</note>; for it is wrong to work hard with the mind and the body at the same time; for it is the nature of the two different sorts of exertion to produce opposite effects, bodily toil impeding the development of the mind and mental toil that of the body.</p>
   <p rend="align(indent)">  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  About music on the other hand we have previously raised some questions in the course of our argument, but it is well to take them up again and carry them further now, in order that this may give the key so to speak for the principles which one might advance in pronouncing about it. For it is not easy to say precisely what potency it possesses, nor yet for the sake of what object one should participate in it—whether for amusement and relaxation, as one indulges in sleep and deep drinking (for these in themselves are not serious pursuits but merely pleasant, and <q rend="single">relax our care,</q> as Euripides says<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Eur. Ba. 378">Eur. Ba. 378</bibl> (Bromios) <quote xml:lang="grc">ὃς τάδ’ ἔχει, θιασεύειν τε χόροις μετά τ’ αὐλῶν γελᾶσαι ἀναπαῦσαί τε μερίμνας</quote> </note>; owing to which people actually class music with them and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>employ all of these things, sleep, deep drinking and music, in the same way, and they also place dancing in the same class); 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>
  or whether we ought rather to think that music tends in some degree to virtue (music being capable of producing a certain quality of character just as gymnastics are capable of producing a certain quality of body, music accustoming men to be able to rejoice rightly); or that it contributes something to intellectual entertainment<note resp="Rackham">The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγωγή</foreign>, <q rend="single">pastime,</q> is idiomatically used of the pursuits of cultured leisure—serious conversation, music, the drama.</note> and culture (for this must be set down as a third alternative among those mentioned). Now it is not difficult to see that one must not make amusement the object of the education of the young; for amusement does not go with learning—learning is a painful process. Nor yet moreover is it suitable to assign intellectual entertainment to boys and to the young; for a thing that is an end does not belong to anything that is imperfect. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/>
 But perhaps it might be thought that the serious pursuits of boys are for the sake of amusement when they have grown up to be men. But, if something of this sort is the case, why should the young need to learn this accomplishment themselves, and not, like the Persian and Median kings, participate in the pleasure and the education of music by means of others performing it? for those who have made music a business and profession must necessarily perform better than those who practise only long enough to learn. But if it is proper for them to labor at accomplishments of this sort, then it would also be right for them to prepare the dishes of an elaborate cuisine; but this is absurd. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>
 And the same difficulty also arises as to the question whether learning music can improve their characters; for why should they learn to perform edifying music themselves, </p></div>
  
<div type="textpart" subtype="bekker_page" resp="perseus" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035.perseus-eng2:8" n="1339b">
  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1339b"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>instead of learning to enjoy it rightly and be able to judge it when they hear others performing, as the Spartans do? for the Spartans although they do not learn to perform can nevertheless judge good and bad music correctly, so it is said. And the same argument applies also if music is to be employed for refined enjoyment and entertainment; why need people learn to perform themselves instead of enjoying music played by others? 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> 
And we may consider the conception that we have about the gods: Zeus does not sing and harp to the poets himself. But professional musicians we speak of as vulgar people, and indeed we think it not manly to perform music, except when drunk or for fun.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)"> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_section_5"/> <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_1"/> But perhaps these points will have to be considered afterwards; our first inquiry is whether music ought not or ought to be included in education, and what is its efficacy among the three uses of it that have been discussed—does it serve for education or amusement or entertainment? It is reasonable to reckon it under all of these heads, and it appears to participate in them all. Amusement is for the sake of relaxation, and relaxation must necessarily be pleasant, for it is a way of curing the pain due to laborious work; also entertainment ought admittedly to be not only honorable but also pleasant, for happiness is derived from both honor and pleasure;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but we all pronounce music to be one of the pleasantest things, whether instrumental or instrumental and vocal music together  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/> (at least Musaeus<note resp="Rackham">A semi-legendary bard, to whom a number of oracular verses that were current were attributed.</note> says, <q rend="single">Song is man’s sweetest joy,</q> and that is why people with good reason introduce it at parties and entertainments, for its exhilarating effect), so that for this reason also one might suppose that the younger men ought to be educated in music. For all harmless pleasures are not only suitable for the ultimate object but also for relaxation; and as it but rarely happens for men to reach their ultimate object, whereas they often relax and pursue amusement not so much with some ulterior object but because of the pleasure of it, it would be serviceable to let them relax at intervals in the pleasures derived from music.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/> But it has come about that men make amusements an end; for the end also perhaps contains a certain pleasure, but not any ordinary pleasure, and seeking this they take the other as being this because it has a certain resemblance to the achievement of the end of their undertakings. For the end is desirable not for the sake of anything that will result from it, and also pleasures of the sort under consideration are not desirable for the sake of some future result, but because of things that have happened already, for instance labor and pain. One might then perhaps assume this to be the reason which causes men to seek to procure happiness by means of those pleasures;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  but in the case of taking part in music, this isnot because of this reason only, but also because performing music is useful, as it seems, for relaxation. But nevertheless we must examine whether it is not the case that, although this has come about, </p></div>

   <p> <milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1340a"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>yet the nature of music is more honorable than corresponds with the employment of it mentioned, and it is proper not only to participate in the common pleasure that springs from it, which is perceptible to everybody (for the pleasure contained in music is of a natural kind, owing to which the use of it is dear to those of all ages and characters), but to see if its influence reachesalso in a manner to the character and to the soul. And this would clearly be the case if we are affected in our characters in a certain manner by it. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> But it is clear that we are affected in a certain manner, both by many other kinds of music and not least by the melodies of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName><note resp="Rackham">A Phrygian composer of the seventh century B.C.</note>; for these admittedly make our souls enthusiastic, and enthusiasm is an affection of the character of the soul.

And the same holds good about the rhythms also, for some have a more stable and others a more emotional character, and of the latter some are more vulgar in their emotional effects and others more liberal. From these considerations therefore it is plain that music has the power of producing a certain effect on the moral character of the soul, and if it has the power to do this, it is clear that the young must be directed to music and must be educated in it. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  Also education in music is well adapted to the youthful nature; for the young owing to their youth cannot endure any thing not sweetened by pleasure, and music is by nature a thing that has a pleasant sweetness. And we seem to have a certain affinity with tunes and rhythms; owing to which many wise men say either that the soul is a harmony or that it has harmony.<note resp="Rackham">The former doctrine is Pythagorean, the latter is stated by <bibl n="Plat.

It is not difficult to see that it makes a great difference in the process of acquiring a certain quality whether one takes a part in the actions that impart it oneself; for it is a thing that is impossible, or difficult, to become a good judge of performances if one has not taken part in them. At the same time also boys must have some occupation, and one must think Archytas’s rattle<note resp="Rackham">Archytas a Pythagorean philosopher, mathematician, statesman, and general of <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, contemporary with Plato.

Whereas then a rattle is a suitable occupation for infant children, education serves as a rattle for young people when older. Such considerations therefore prove that children should be trained in music so as actually to take part in its performance; <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_2"/>  and it is not difficult to distinguish what is suitable and unsuitable for various ages, and to refute those who assert that the practice of music is vulgar. For first, inasmuch as it is necessary to take part in the performances for the sake of judging them, it is therefore proper for the pupils when young actually to engage in the performances, though when they get older they should be released from performing, but be able to judge what is beautiful and enjoy it rightly because of the study in which they engaged in their youth. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_3"/>  Then as to the objection raised by some people that music makes peoplevulgar, it is not difficult to solve it by considering how far pupils who are being educated with a view to civic virtue should take part in the actual performance of music, </p></div>

For the solution of the objection depends upon these points, as it is quite possible that some modes of music do produce the result mentioned. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_4"/>  It is manifest therefore that the study of music must not place a hindrance in the way of subsequent activities, nor vulgarize the bodily frame and make it useless for the exercises of the soldier and the citizen, either for their practical pursuit now or for their scientific study later on.<note resp="Rackham">It is difficult not to think that either the nouns or the adverbs in the Greek have been erroneously transposed, and that we should translate <q rend="single">either for learning them now or for practising them later on.</q></note> And this would come about in respect of their study if the pupils did not go on toiling at the exercises that aim at professional competitions, nor the wonderful and elaborate performances which have now entered into the competitions and have passed from the competitions into education, but also only practised exercises not of that sort until they are able to enjoy beautiful tunes and rhythms, and not merely the charm common to all music, which even some lower animals enjoy, as well as a multitude of slaves and children. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_5"/> And it is also clear from these considerations what sort of instruments they should use. Flutes must not be introduced into education, nor any other professional instrument, such as the harp or any other of that sort, but<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>such instruments as will make them attentive pupils either at their musical training or in their other lessons. Moreover the flute is not a moralizing but rather an exciting influence, so that it ought to be used for occasions of the kind at which attendance has the effect of purification rather than instruction.<note resp="Rackham">See 1341a 33 ff.</note> And let us add that the flute happens to possess the additional property telling against its use in education that playing it prevents the employment of speech. Hence former ages rightly rejected its use by the young and the free, although at first they had employed it. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_6"/>  For as they came to have more leisure because of their wealth and grew more high-spirited and valorous, both at a still earlier date and because after the Persian Wars they were filled with pride as a result of their achievements, they began to engage in all branches of learning, making no distinction but pursuing research further.

Now it is not a bad point in the story that the goddess did this out of annoyance because of the ugly distortion of her features; but as a matter of fact it is more likely that it was because education in flute-playing has no effect on the intelligence, whereas we attribute science and art to Athena.</p>

Poet. 1449b">Aristot. Poet. 6</bibl> tragedy is said to purge the emotion of pity and fear by giving them an outlet; the reference here is probably to the lost Second Book of <title>Poetics</title>.</note>—and thirdly it serves for amusement, serving to relax our tension and to give rest from it), </p></div>

Therefore those who go in for theatrical music must be set to compete in harmonies and melodies of this kind <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_7"/> (and since the audience is of two classes, one freemen and educated people, and the other<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the vulgar class composed of mechanics and laborers and other such persons, the latter sort also must be assigned competitions and shows for relaxation; and just as their souls are warped from the natural state, so those harmonies and melodies that are highly strung and irregular in coloration<note resp="Rackham">Said to mean divergent from the regular scale in having smaller intervals.</note> are deviations, but people of each sort receive pleasure from what is naturally suited to them, owing to which the competitors before an audience of this sort must be allowed to employ some such kind of music as this); <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_8"/>  but for education, as has been said,<note resp="Rackham">1342a 2.</note> the ethical class of melodies and of harmonies must be employed. And of that nature is the Dorian mode, as we said before<note resp="Rackham">1343b 3 ff.</note>; but we must also accept any other mode that those who take part in the pursuit of philosophy and in musical education may recommend to us. Socrates in the <title>Republic</title> <note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 399a">Plat.

  <p><milestone unit="page" resp="Bekker" n="1342b"/>  <milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the Phrygian mode has the same effect among harmonies as the flute among instruments—both are violently exciting and emotional. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_9"/>  This is shown by poetry; for all Bacchiac versification and all movement of that sort<note resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <foreign xml:lang="grc">βακχεία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις</foreign> denote bodily movement accompanying the song; or they may denote the emotional frenzy expressed and stimulated by it. The dithyramb was a form of poetry of this class, originally celebrating the birth of Dionysus. Philoxenus, one of the most famous dithyrambic poets, <date from="-0435" to="-0380">435</date>-380 B.C., lived at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, and later at the court of Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</note> belongs particularly to the flute among the instruments, and these meters find their suitable accompaniment in tunes in the Phrygian mode among the harmonies: for example the dithyramb is admittedly held to be a Phrygian meter, and the experts on this subject adduce many instances to prove this, particularly the fact that Philoxenus when he attempted to compose a dithyramb, <title>The Mysians</title>, in the Dorian mode was unable to do so, but merely by the force of nature fell back again into the suitable harmony, the Phrygian. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_10"/>  And all agree that the Dorian mode is more sedate and of a specially manly character. Moreover since we praise and say that we ought to pursue the mean between extremes, and the Dorian mode has this nature in relation to the other harmonies, it is clear that it suits the younger pupils to be educated rather in the Dorian melodies. But there are two objects to aim at, the possible as well as the suitable; for we are bound rather to attempt the things that are possible and those that are suitable for the particular class of people concerned;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in these matters also there are dividing lines drawn by the ages—for instance, those whose powers have waned through lapse of time cannot easily sing the highly strung harmonies, but to persons of that age nature suggests the relaxed harmonies. <milestone unit="section" resp="Rackham" n="loeb_subsection_11"/>  Therefore some musical experts also rightly criticize Socrates<note resp="Rackham"> <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 338e">Plat. Rep. 338e</bibl> </note> because he disapproved of the relaxed harmonies for amusement, taking them to have the character of intoxication, not in the sense of the effect of strong drink, for that clearly has more the result of making men frenzied revellers, but as failing in power. Hence even with a view to the period of life that is to follow, that of the comparatively old, it is proper to engage in the harmonies and melodies of this kind too, and also any kind of harmony that is suited to the age of boyhood because it is capable of being at once decorous and educative, which seems to be the nature of the Lydian mode most of all the harmonies. It is clear therefore that we should lay down these three canons to guide education, moderation, possibility and suitability.</p></div></div></div>
