<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Brethren, we must think of Jesus Christ as of<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The need for thinking highly of Christ, and prizing our salvation</note> God, as of <q>the Judge of the living and the dead</q> and we must not think little of our salvation, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>for if we think little of him we also hope to obtain but little. And those who listen as though it were a little matter are sinning, and we also are sinning, if we do not know whence and by whom, and to what place we were called, and how great sufferings Jesus Christ endured for our sake. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>What return, then, shall we make to him, or what fruit shall we offer worthy of that which he has given us? And how great a debt of holiness do we owe him? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For he gave us the light, he called us <q>son,</q> as a Father, he saved us when we were perishing. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>What praise, then, or what reward shall we give him in return for what we received? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>We were maimed in our understanding, worshipping<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The state of the unconverted</note> stone, and wood, and gold, and silver, and copper, the works of men, and our whole life was nothing else than death. We were covered with darkness, and our eyes were full of mist; but we <pb xml:id="p.131"/> have received our sight, and by his will we have cast off the cloud which covered us.  </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>For he had pity on us, and saved us in his mercy, and regarded the great error and destruction which was in us, and our hopelessness of salvation save from him;	 </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>for he called us when we were not, and it was his will that out of nothing we should come to being.</p></div>
    </div>

		          <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><q>Rejoice thou barren that barest not; break<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Prophecies of the church, and their interpretation</note> forth and cry thou that travailest not; for the children of the deserted are many more than hers that hath a husband.</q> In saying, <q>Rejoice thou barren that barest not,</q> he meant us, for our church was barren before children were given her. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And in saying, <q>Cry thou that travailest not,</q> he means this,—that we should offer our prayers in sincerity to God, and not grow wreary as women that give birth. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And in saying, <q>For the children of the deserted are many more than hers that hath a husband,</q> he meant that our people seemed to be deserted by God, but that now we who have believed have become many more than those who seemed to have God. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And another Scripture also says, <q>I came not to call righteous, but sinners</q>; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>He means that those who are perishing must be saved, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>for it is great and wonderful to give strength, not to the things which are standing, but to those which are falling. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>So Christ also willed to save the perishing, and he saved many, coming and calling us who were already perishing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And he himself also says, <q>Whosoever confessed me before men, I will confess him before my Father</q>; </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>this then is our reward, if we confess him through whom we were saved. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But how do we confess him? By doing what he says, and not disregarding his commandments, arid honouring him not only with our lips, but <q>with all our heart and all our mind.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And he says also in Isaiah, <q>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Let us, then, not merely call him Lord, for this<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The necessity for good works</note> will not save us. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For he says, <q>Not everyone that saith to me Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that doeth righteousness.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>So then, brethren, let us confess him in our deeds, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, nor speaking one against another, nor being jealous, but by being self-controlled, merciful, good; and we ought to <pb xml:id="p.135"/> sympathise with each other, and not to be lovers of money. By these deeds we confess him, and not by the opposite kind. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And we must not fear men rather than God. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For this reason, if you do these things, the Lord said, <q>If ye be gathered together with me in my bosom, and do not my commandments, I will cast you out, and will say to you, Depart from me, I know not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity.</q><note resp="editor" type="footnote">The source of this and the quotation in v. 2-4 is unknown: it is often supposed to have been the Gospel of the Egyptians, but there is no clear evidence of this.</note></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>for the Lord said, <q>Ye shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves,</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>and Peter answered and said to him, <q>If then the wolves tear the lambs?</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Jesus said to Peter, <q>Let the lambs have no fear of the wolves after their death; and do ye have no fear of those that slay you, and can do nothing more to you, but fear him who after your death hath power over body and soul, to cast them into the flames of hell.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And be well assured, brethren, that our sojourning in this world in the flesh is a little thing and lasts a short time, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, and brings us rest, in the kingdom which is to come and in everlasting life. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>What then shall <pb xml:id="p.137"/> we do to attain these things save lead a holy and righteous life, and regard the things of this world as not our own, and not desire them? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>For by desiring to obtain these things we fall from the way of righteousness.</p></div></div>

		      
		      <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And the Lord says:—<q>No servant can serve<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The opposition between this world and the world to come</note> two masters.</q> If we desire to serve both God and Mammon it is unprofitable to us, </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><q>For what is the advantage if a man gain the whole world but lose his soul?</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now the world that is, and the world to come are two enemies. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>This world speaks of adultery, and corruption, and love of money, and deceit, but that world bids these things farewell. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>We cannot then be the friends of both; but we must bid farewell to this world, to consort with that which is to come. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>We reckon that it is better to hate the things which are here, for they are little, and short-lived, and corruptible, but to love the things which are there, the good things which are incorruptible. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>For if we do the will of Christ we shall gain rest; but if not, nothing shall rescue us from eternal punishment, if we neglect his commandments. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And the Scripture also says in Ezekiel that, <q>if Noah and Job and Daniel arise, they shall not rescue their children in the captivity.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>But if even such righteous men as these cannot save their children by their own righteousness, with <pb xml:id="p.139"/>  what confidence shall we enter into the palace of God, if we keep not our baptism pure and undefiled?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Let us then contend that we may all be crowned. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Let us run the straight course, the immortal contest, and let many of us sail to it, and contend, that we may also receive the crown, and if we cannot all receive the crown, let us at least come near to it. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>We must remember that if he who takes part in the contest for a corruptible prize be detected in unfairness, he is flogged, taken up, and thrown off the course. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>What do you think? What shall he suffer who cheats in the contest for that which is incorruptible? </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>For of those who have not kept the seal of baptism he says:—<q>Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall lie a spectacle for all flesh.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For we are clay in the hand of the workman; for just as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be bent or broken in his hand, models it afresh, but if he has come so far as to put it into the fiery oven, he can do nothing to mend it any more; so also let us, so long as we are in this world, repent with all our heart of the wicked deeds which we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have a time for repentance. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For after we have departed from this world, we can no longer make confession, or repent any more in that place. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>So then, brethren, if we do the will of the Father, if we keep the flesh pure, and if we observe the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For the Lord says in the Gospel, <q>If ye did not guard that which is small, who shall give you that which is great? For I tell you that he who is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is much.</q> </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>He means, then, this:— Keep the flesh pure, and the seal of baptism undefiled, that we may obtain eternal life.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>If Christ, the Lord who saved us, though he was originally spirit, became flesh and so called us, so also we shall receive our reward in this flesh. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now if we say that the flesh is the Church, and the Spirit is Christ, of course he who has abused the flesh, has abused the Church. Such a one therefore will not receive the Spirit, which is Christ. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>So great a gift of life and immortality has this flesh the power to receive, if the Holy Spirit be joined to it, nor can any man express or speak of the things <q>which the Lord hath prepared</q> for his elect.</p></div></div>
