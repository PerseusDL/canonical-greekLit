<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And I thought him much aged, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="328c"/> for it was a long time since I had seen him.

Cf. <title>Philebus</title> 28 A and Isocrates xv. 230.</note> For if it were the cause I too should have had the same experience so far as old age is concerned, and so would all others who have come to this time of life. But in fact I have ere now met with others who do not feel in this way, and in particular I remember hearing Sophocles the poet greeted by a fellow who asked, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="329c"/> <q type="spoken">How about your service of Aphrodite, Sophocles—is your natural force still unabated?</q> And he replied, <q type="spoken">Hush, man, most gladly have I escaped this thing you talk of, as if I had run away from a raging and savage beast of a master.</q><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Allusions to the passage are frequent.

And you must look at the matter, my simple-minded Socrates, in this way: that the just man always comes out at a disadvantage in his relation with the unjust. To begin with, in their business dealings in any joint undertaking of the two you will never find that the just man has the advantage over the unjust at the dissolution of the partnership but that he always has the worst of it. Then again, in their relations with the state, if there are direct taxes or contributions to be paid, the just man contributes more from an equal estate and the other less, and when there is a distribution <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="343e"/> the one gains much and the other nothing.

Consider this type of man, then, if you wish to judge how much more profitable it is to him personally to be unjust than to be just. And the easiest way of all to understand this matter will be to turn to the most consummate form of injustice which makes the man who has done the wrong most happy and those who are wronged and who would not themselves willingly do wrong most miserable. And this is tyranny, which both by stealth and by force takes away what belongs to others, both sacred and profane, both private and public, not little by little but at one swoop.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">The order of the words dramatically expressses Thrasymachus’s excitement and the sweeping success of the tyrant.</note>  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="344b"/> For each several part of such wrongdoing the malefactor who fails to escape detection is fined and incurs the extreme of contumely; for temple-robbers, kidnappers, burglars, swindlers, and thieves the appellations of those who commit these partial forms of injustice.

Justice, they tell us, being mid-way between the two, is accepted and approved, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="359b"/> not as a real good, but as a thing honored in the lack of vigor to do injustice, since anyone who had the power to do it and was in reality <q type="emph">a man</q> would never make a compact with anybody either to wrong nor to be wronged; for he would be mad.

If we combine this with a counterfeit decorum, we shall prosper to our heart’s desire, with gods and men in life and death, as the words of the multitude and of men of the highest authority declare. In consequence, then, of all that has been said, what possibility is there, Socrates, that any man  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="366c"/> who has the power of any resources of mind, money, body, or family should consent to honor justice and not rather laugh<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Aristophanes <title>Clouds</title> 1241.</note> when he hears her praised? In sooth, if anyone is able to show the falsity of these arguments, and has come to know with sufficient assurance that justice is best, he feels much indulgence for the unjust, and is not angry with them, but is aware that except a man by inborn divinity of his nature disdains injustice, or, having won to knowledge, refrains from it, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="366d"/> no one else is willingly just, but that it is from lack of manly spirit or from old age or some other weakness<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Cf. <title>Gorgias</title> 492 A.</note> that men dispraise injustice, lacking the power to practise it. The fact is patent. For no sooner does such one come into the power than he works injustice to the extent of his ability. And the sole cause of all this is the fact that was the starting-point of this entire plea of my friend here and of myself to you, Socrates, pointing out how strange it is that of all you  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="366e"/> self-styled advocates of justice, from the heroes of old whose discourses survive to the men of the present day, not one has ever censured injustice or commended justice otherwise than in respect of the repute, the honors, and the gifts that accrue from each. But what each one of them is in itself, by its own inherent force, when it is within the soul of the possessor and escapes the eyes of both gods and men, no one has ever adequately set forth in poetry or prose—the proof that the one is the greatest of all evils that the soul contains within itself, while justice is the greatest good.</q></said></p></div>

But I—  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="367b"/> for I have no reason to hide anything from you—am laying myself out to the utmost on the theory, because I wish to hear its refutation from you. Do not merely show us by argument that justice is superior to injustice, but make clear to us what each in and of itself does to its possessor, whereby the one is evil and the other good. But do away with the repute of both, as Glaucon urged. For, unless you take away from either the true repute and attach to each the false, we shall say that it is not justice that you are praising but the semblance, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="367c"/> nor injustice that you censure, but the seeming, and that you really are exhorting us to be unjust but conceal it, and that you are at one with Thrasymachus in the opinion that justice is other man’s good,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Cf. 343 C.</note> the advantage of the other, and that injustice is advantageous and profitible to oneself but disadvantageous to the inferior. Since, then, you have admitted that justice belongs to the class of those highest goods which are desirable both for their consequences and still more for their own sake, as sight, hearing, intelligence, yes and health too,  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="367d"/> and all other goods that are productive<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Adam’s note on <foreign xml:lang="grc">γόνιμα</foreign>: i.q. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνήσια</foreign> is, I think, wrong.</note> by their very nature and not by opinion, this is what I would have you praise about justice—the benefit which it and the harm which injustice inherently works upon its possessor. But the rewards and the honors that depend on opinion, leave to others to praise. For while I would listen to others who thus commended justice and disparaged injustice, bestowing their praise and their blame on the reputation and the rewards of either, I could not accept that sort of thing from you unless you say I must, because you have passed <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="367e"/> your entire life<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Cf. 506 C.</note> in the consideration of this very matter. Do not then, I repeat, merely prove to us in argument the superiority of justice to injustice, but show us what it is that each inherently does to its possessor—whether he does or does not escape the eyes of gods and men—whereby the one is good and the other evil.</q></said></p></div>

The description of the orderly temperament begins with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ τοιοῦτοι</foreign> refers to the preceding description of the active temperament.

Modern fancy may read what meanings it pleases into the Platonic antithesis of the <q type="emph">real</q> and the <q type="emph">ideal.</q> It has even been treated as an anticipation of the fourth dimension. But Plato never leaves an attentive and critical reader in doubt as to his own intended meaning. there may be at the most a little uncertainty as to which are merely indispensable parts of the picture. The source and first suggestion of Plato’s imagery is an interesting speculation, but it is of no significance for the interpretation of the thought. Cf. John Henry Wright, <q type="title">The Origin of Plato’s Cave</q> in <title>Harvard Studies in Class. Phil.</title> xvii. (<date when="1906">1906</date>) pp. 130-142.

Wright, loc. cit. Wright refers it to the Cave of Vari in <placeName key="tgn,2007642">Attica</placeName>, pp. 140-142.

The argument rests on a remote and strained interpretation of two or three texts of the <title>Republic</title> (cf. e.g. 511 and 533 B-D) which, naturally interpreted, merely affirm the general inferiority of the mathematical method and the intermediate position for education of mathematics as a propaedeutic to dialectics. Plato’s purpose throughout is not to exhort mathematicians as such to question their initiatory postulates, but to mark definitely the boundaries between the mathematical and other sciences and pure dialectics or philosophy. The distinction is a true and useful one today. Aristotle often refers to it with no hint that it could not be abolished by a new and different kind of mathematics. And it is uncritical to read that intention into Plato’s words. He may have contributed, and doubtless did contribute, in other ways to the improvement and precision of mathematical logic. But he had no idea of doing away with the fundamental difference that made dialectics and not mathematics the coping-stone of the higher education—science as such does not question its first principles and dialectic does.

Equally unfair is the practice of comparing Plato unfavorably with Aristotle in this respect, as Grote e.g. frequently does (Cf. <title>Aristotle,</title> p. 233).
