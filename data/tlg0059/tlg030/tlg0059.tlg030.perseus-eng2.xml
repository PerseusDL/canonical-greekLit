                                605. Thrasymachus does not understand what is meant by saying that
                                the art (=the artist qua artist) has no interest save the perfection
                                of its (his) own function. Socrates explains that the body by its
                                very nature needs art to remedy its defects (Herodotus i. 32,
                                    <title>Lysis</title> 217 B). But the nature of art is fulfilled
                                in its service, and it has no other ends to be accomplished by
                                another art and so on ad infinitum. It is idle to cavil and emend
                                the text, because of the shift from the statement (341 D) that art
                                has no interest save its perfection, to the statement that it needs
                                nothing except to be itself (342 A-B). The art and the artist qua
                                artist are ideals whose being by hypothesis is their

                            that the just man always comes out at a disadvantage in his relation

                            advantage over the unjust at the dissolution of the partnership but that
                            he always has the worst of it. Then again, in their relations with the
                            state, if there are direct taxes or contributions to be paid, the just
                            man contributes more from an equal estate and the other less, and when

                                is put as an inference from Thrasymachus’s ready admission that the
                                unjust man is wise and good and is like the wise and good. Jevons
                                says in “Substitution of Similars”; “Whatever is true of a thing is
                                true of its like.” But practical logic requires the qualification
                                “in respect of their likness.” Socrates, however, argues that since
                                the good man is like the good craftsman in not overreaching, and the
                                good craftsman is good, therefore the just man is good. The
                                conclusion is sound, and the analogy may have a basis of

                            assume the perfection of each in his own mode of conduct. In the first

                                Leslie Stephen is thinking. But from a higher point of view Plato
                                eloquently argues (465 B-C) that duty fulfilled will yield truer

                                to higher significance in Plato’s definition. As in the case of
                                bravery, Plato distinguishes the temperamental, the bourgeois, the
                                disciplined, and the philosophical virtue. But he affects to feel

                                the tripartite soul is an important point in Plato’s ethical theory
                                and an essential feature in the structure of the

                                proceeds. Moreover, he is interested in logical method for its own

                                504 B shows that it includes the whole question of the definition of
                                the virtues, and so ultimately the whole of ethical and political
                                philosophy. We are there told again that the definitions of the
                                fourth book are sufficient for the purpose, but that complete
                                insight can be attained only by relating them to the idea of the
                                good. That required a longer and more circuitous way of discipline
                                and training. Plato then does not propose the “longer way” as a
                                method of reasoning which he himself employs to correct the
                                approximations of the present discussion. He merely describes it as
                                the higher education which will enable his philosophical rulers to
                                do that. We may then disregard all idle guesses about a “new logic”
                                hinted at in the longer way, and all fantastic hypotheses about the
                                evolution of Plato’s thought and the composition of the
                                    <title>Republic</title> based on supposed contradictions between
                                this passage and the later books. Cf. Introduction p. xvi, “Idea of
                                Good,” p. 190, <title>Unity of Plato’s Thought</title>, p. 16, n.
                                90; followed by Professor Wilamowitz, ii. p. 218, who, however, does
                                not understand the connection of it all with the idea of good. Plato
                                the logician never commits himself to more than is required by the
                                problem under discussion (cf. on 353 c), and Plato the moralist
                                never admits that the ideal has been adequately expressed, but
                                always points to heights beyond. Cf. 506 E, 533 A,

                            previous statements and inquiries.” “May we acquiesce in that?” he said.
                            “I for my part should be quite satisfied with that for the present.”
                            “And I surely should be more than satisfied,” I replied. “Don’t you

                                That this is the consciously intended meaning may be inferred from
                                the fact that in <title>Timaeus</title> 37 E, where Plato must have

                                are and are not in comparision with the unchanging multitude of

                                good and the beautiful and other moral conceptions change, and both
                                are and are not in comparison with the unalterable ideas of justice
                                and beauty, which the philosopher more nearly apprehends. Thus, for

                                two things that rarely combine are Plato’s two temperaments. The

                                Plato’s contrast of the two temperaments disregards the possible

                                mysticism and no obscurity. The longer way is the higher education,
                                which will enable the philosopher not only like ordinary citizens to
                                do the right from habit and training, but to understand the reasons
                                for it. The outcome of such an education is described as the vision
                                of the idea of good, which for ethics and politics means a
                                restatement of the provisional psychological definition of the
                                cardinal virtues in terms of the ultimate elements of human welfare.
                                For metaphysics and cosmogony the vision of the idea of good may
                                means teleological interpretation of the universe and the
                                interpretation of all things in terms of benevolent design. That is

                                above the plane of ordinary experience for the other two members of
                                the proportion, Plato here goes below and invents a fire and shadows
                                cast from it on the walls of a cave to correspond to the sun and the
                                “real” objects of sense. In such a proportion our “real” world
                                becomes the symbol of Plato’s ideal world. Modern fancy may read

                                and the “ideal.” It has even been treated as an anticipation of the
                                fourth dimension. But Plato never leaves an attentive and critical
                                reader in doubt as to his own intended meaning. there may be at the
                                most a little uncertainty as to which are merely indispensable parts

                                is an interesting speculation, but it is of no significance for the
                                interpretation of the thought. Cf. John Henry Wright, “The Origin of

                                the shadows, and back of the objects to the things of the “real”
                                world of which they are copies. The general meaning, which is quite
                                certain, is that they wold suppose the shadows to be the realities.

                                objects which cast them. They suppose that the names refer to the
                                passing shadows, but (as we know) they really apply to the objects.
                                Ideas and particulars are homonymous. Assuming a slight illogicality
                                we can get somewhat the same meaning from the text <foreign xml:lang="grc">TAU)TA/</foreign>. “Do you not think that they

                                geometry.” There have been some attempts to prove (that of Mr. F. M.
                                Cornford in <title>Mind,</title>April <date when="1932-04">1932</date>, is the most recent) that Plato, if he could not
                                anticipate in detail the modern reduction of mathematics to logic,
                                did postulate something like it as an ideal, the realization of
                                which would abolish his own sharp distinction between mathematics
                                and dialectic. The argument rests on a remote and strained
                                interpretation of two or three texts of the
                                <title>Republic</title>(cf. e.g. 511 and 533 B-D) which, naturally
                                interpreted, merely affirm the general inferiority of the
                                mathematical method and the intermediate position for education of
                                mathematics as a propaedeutic to dialectics. Plato’s purpose
                                throughout is not to exhort mathematicians as such to question their
                                initiatory postulates, but to mark definitely the boundaries between
                                the mathematical and other sciences and pure dialectics or
                                philosophy. The distinction is a true and useful one today.
                                Aristotle often refers to it with no hint that it could not be
                                abolished by a new and different kind of mathematics. And it is
                                uncritical to read that intention into Plato’s words. He may have
                                contributed, and doubtless did contribute, in other ways to the
                                improvement and precision of mathematical logic. But he had no idea
                                of doing away with the fundamental difference that made dialectics
                                and not mathematics the coping-stone of the higher education—science
                                as such does not question its first principles and dialectic does.

                                misapprehension is typical of modern misunderstandings. Glaucon is
                                here the prototype of all sentimental Platonists or anti-Platonists.
                                The meaning of “higher” things in Plato’s allegory is obvious. But
                                Glaucon takes it literally. Similarly, modern critics, taking
                                Plato’s imagery literally and pressing single expressions apart from
                                the total context, have inferred that Plato would be hostile to all
                                the applications of modern science to experience. They refuse to
                                make allowance for his special and avowed educational purpose, and
                                overlook the fact that he is prophesying the mathematical astronomy
                                and science of the future. The half-serious exaggeration of his
                                rhetoric can easily be matched by similar utterances of modern
                                thinkers of the most various schools, from Rousseau’s “écarter tous
                                les faits” to Judd’s “Once we acquire the power to neglect all the

                                are carried by their invisible mathematical orbits. By this way of
                                speaking Plato, it is true, disregards the apparent difficulty that
                                the movement of the visible stars then ought to be mathematically

                                Adam that he would have attached little significance to the
                                perturbations of Neptune and the consequent discovery of Uranus. It
                                is to Plato that tradition attributes the problem of accounting by
                                the simplest hypothesis for the movement of the heavenly bodies and
                                “saving the phenomena.” The alleged contradiction between this and

                                due to a misapprehension. That the stars in their movements do not
                                perfectly express the exactness of mathematical conceptions is no
                                more than modern astronomers say. In the <title>Laws</title> passage
                                Plato protests against the idea that there is no law and order
                                governing the movement of the planets, but that they are “wandering
                                stars,” as irregular in their movements as they seem. In the
                                    <title>Timaeus</title> he is saying that astronomy or science
                                took its beginning from the sight and observation of the heavenly
                                bodies and the changing seasons. In the
                                <title>Republic</title>Plato’s purpose is to predict and encourage a
                                purely mathematical astronomy and the indicate its place in the type
                                of education which he wishes to give his guardians. There is not the
                                slightest contradiction or change of opinion in the three passages

                                usually taken with <foreign xml:lang="grc">A)/TOPON</foreign>(regarded as neuter), the meaning being that the

                                makes <foreign xml:lang="grc">PANTI\ TRO/PW|</foreign> awkward or
                                attributes to Plato the intention of decrying the concrete study of

                                who, using the stars only as “diagrams” or patterns (529 D), seeks

                                could yield. Madvig’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ZHTH/SEI</foreign>
                                implies a like view of the meaning but smooths out the construction.
                                But my interpretation of the passage as a whole does not depend on
                                this construction. If we make <foreign xml:lang="grc">ZHTEI=N</foreign> depend on <foreign xml:lang="grc">A)/TOPON</foreign>(neuter)<foreign xml:lang="grc">H(GH/SETAI</foreign>, the meaning will be that he thinks it

                                writers, loves to emphasize his thought by paradox and surprise, and
                                his postulation and of a mathematical astronomy required emphasis.

                                Plato was unscientific, as many hostile or thoughtless critics have
                                attempted to do. Cf. e.g. the severe strictures of Arthur Platt,

                                of mystic religion.” Woodbridge Riley, <title>From Myth to

                                subtly, counteracted and thwarted the scientific impulse, or at
                                least diverted it into unprofitable channels.” Dampier-Whetham,
                                    <title>A History of Science,</title> pp. 27-28: “Plato was a
                                great philosopher but in the history of experimental science he must
                                be counted a disaster.” Such statements disregard the entire context
                                of the Platonic passages they exploit, and take no account of
                                Plato’s purpose or of other passages which counteract his seemingly
                                unscientific remarks. Equally unfair is the practice of comparing
                                Plato unfavorably with Aristotle in this respect, as Grote e.g.
                                frequently does (Cf. <title>Aristotle,</title> p. 233). Plato was an
                                artist and Aristotle an encyclopaedist; but Plato as a whole is far
                                nearer the point of view of recent science than Aristotle. Cf. my

                                thought by the necessity of securing the understanding and assent of
                                an intelligent interlocutor at every step, and the habit of noting
                                all relevant distinctions, divisions, and ambiguities, in ideas and
                                terms. When the interlocutor is used merely to relieve the strain on
                                the leader’s voice or the reader’s attention, as in some of the
                                later dialogues, dialectic becomes merely a literary
                            form.</note>:</said>

                                Social Science,” edited by Stuart A. Rice, p. 289: “ . . . there was
                                a widely spread belief in an earlier ‘golden age’ of simplicity,
                                which had been followed by a degeneration and decay of the human
                                race. Plato’s theory of degradation set forth a gradual
                                deterioration through the successive stages of timocracy, oligarchy,
                                democracy and despotism. The Greek theory of ‘cycles,’ with its
                                endless, monotonous iteration, excluded the possibility of permanent
                                advance or ‘progress.’” Kurt Singer, <title>Platon der
                                    Gründer,</title> p. 141, says that the timocratic state reminds

                                oligarchic is related to Corinth, and the tyrannical has some
                                Syracusan features. Cicero, <title>De div.</title> ii., uses this

                                revolutions in the Roman state, and Polybius’s theory of the natural

                                Freud’s most remarkable thesis that dreams are manifestations of
                                this emergence of desires and memories from the unconscious into the
                                conscious field.” “The barriers of the Freudian unconscious are less

                                once distinctly more respectable.” Many of the ancients, like some
                                superstitious moderns, exalted the unconscious which reveals itself

                                fact, for Plato as for modern “scientific” ethics, health in the
                                higher sense—the health of the soul—may be said to be the ultimate
                                sanction. Cf. Vol. I. Introd. pp. xvi and xxi, <title>Unity of

                                sometimes expresses itself in the paradox that “not even health,”
                                highest of earthly goods, is of any value compared with the true
                                interests of the soul. Cf. <title>Laws</title> 661 C-E ff., 728 D-E,

                                source of the story from which the Christian Fathers and the Middle
                                Ages derived much edification, that Plato intentionally chose an
