               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No, no, Socrates;  from <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> and the festival there of Asclepius.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Do you mean to say that the Epidaurians honor the god with a contest of rhapsodes also?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Certainly, and of music <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"><q type="soCalled">Music</q> with the Greeks included poetry.</note> in general.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Why then, you were competing in some contest, were you?  And how went your competition?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>We carried off the first prize, Socrates.</p></said>
            
 <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="530b"/>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well done:  so now, mind that we win too at the Panathenaea. <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The Athenian festival of the Great Panathenaea was held every fourth year, and the Small Panathenaea probably every year, about July.</note>
               </p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Why, so we shall, God willing.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>I must say I have often envied you rhapsodes, Ion, for your art:  for besides that it is fitting to your art that your person should be adorned and that you should look as handsome as possible, the necessity of being conversant with a number of good poets, and especially with Homer, the best and divinest poet of all, and of apprehending <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="530c"/> his thought and not merely learning off his words, is a matter for envy;  since a man can never be a good rhapsode without understanding what the poet says.  For the rhapsode ought to make himself an interpreter of the poet’s thought to his audience;  and to do this properly without knowing what the poet means is impossible.  So one cannot but envy all this.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>What you say is true, Socrates:  I at any rate have found this the most laborious part of my art;  and I consider I speak about Homer better than anybody, for neither <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="530d"/> Metrodorus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A friend of the philosopher Anaxagoras who wrote allegorical interpretations of Homer in the first part of the fifth century B.C.</note> of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, nor Stesimbrotus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A rhapsode, interpreter of Homer, and historian who lived in the time of Cimon and Pericles.</note> of <placeName key="tgn,7011078">Thasos</placeName>, nor Glaucon, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Perhaps the Homeric commentator mentioned by Aristotle, <title>Poet.</title> 25. 16.</note> nor any one that the world has ever seen, had so many and such fine comments to offer on Homer as I have.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>That is good news, Ion;  for obviously you will not grudge me an exhibition of them.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>And indeed it is worth hearing, Socrates, how well I have embellished Homer;  so that I think I deserve to be crowned with a golden crown by the Homeridae. <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">There was a society or clan in <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> called Homeridae (<gloss>sons of Homer</gloss>), but the name seems to be used here and elsewhere in Plato for any persons specially devoted to Homer’s poetry.  See Jebb, <title>Homer</title>, p. 78.</note>

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Yes, and I must find myself leisure some time to listen to you; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="531"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="531a"/> but for the moment, please answer this little question:  are you skilled in Homer only, or in Hesiod and Archilochus as well?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No, no, only in Homer;  for that seems to me quite enough.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And is there anything on which Homer and Hesiod both say the same?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes, I think there are many such cases.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Then in those cases would you expound better what Homer says than what Hesiod says?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I should do it equally well in those cases, Socrates, where they say the same.</p></said>
            
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="531b"/>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>But what of those where they do not say the same?  For example, about the seer’s art, on which both Homer and Hesiod say something.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Quite so.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well then, would you, or one of the good seers, expound better what these two poets say, not only alike but differently, about the seer’s art?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>One of the seers.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And if you were a seer, would you not, with an ability to expound what they say in agreement, know also how to expound the points on which they differ?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Of course.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Then how is it that you are skilled in Homer, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="531c"/> and not in Hesiod or the other poets?  Does Homer speak of any other than the very things that all the other poets speak of?  Has he not described war for the most part, and the mutual intercourse of men, good and bad, lay and professional, and the ways of the gods in their intercourse with each other and with men, and happenings in the heavens and in the underworld, and origins of gods and heroes?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="531d"/> Are not these the subjects of Homer’s poetry?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>What you say is true, Socrates.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And what of the other poets?  Do they not treat of the same things?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes;  but, Socrates, not on Homer’s level.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>What, in a worse way?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Far worse.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And Homer in a better?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Better indeed, I assure you.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well now, Ion, dear soul;  when several people are talking about number, and one of them speaks better than the rest, I suppose there is some one who will distinguish the good speaker?</p></said>
            
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="531e"/>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I agree.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And will this some one be the same as he who can distinguish the bad speakers, or different?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>The same, I suppose.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And he will be the man who has the art of numeration?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And again, when several are talking about what kinds of foods are wholesome, and one of them speaks better than the rest, will it be for two different persons to distinguish the superiority of the best speaker and the inferiority of a worse one, or for the same?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Obviously, I should say, for the same.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Who is he?  What is his name?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>A doctor.</p></said></div>
            
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="532">
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And so we may state, in general terms, that the same person will always distinguish, given the same subject and several persons talking about it, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="532"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="532a"/> both who speaks well and who badly:  otherwise, if he is not going to distinguish the bad speaker, clearly he will not distinguish the good one either, where the subject is the same.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>That is so.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And the same man is found to be skilled in both?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And you say that Homer and the other poets, among whom are Hesiod and Archilochus, all speak about the same things, only not similarly;  but the one does it well, and the rest worse?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes, and what I say is true.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And since you distinguish the good speaker, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="532b"/> you could distinguish also the inferiority of the worse speakers.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>So it would seem.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Then, my excellent friend, we shall not be wrong in saying that our Ion is equally skilled in Homer and in the other poets, seeing that you yourself admit that the same man will be a competent judge of all who speak on the same things, and that practically all the poets treat of the same things.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Then what can be the reason, Socrates, why I pay no attention when somebody discusses any other poet, and am unable to offer any remark at all of any value, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="532c"/> but simply drop into a doze, whereas if anyone mentions something connected with Homer I wake up at once and attend and have plenty to say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>That is not difficult to guess, my good friend;  anyone can see that you are unable to speak on Homer with art and knowledge.  For if you could do it with art, you could speak on all the other poets as well;  since there is an art of poetry, I take it, as a whole, is there not?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
            
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="532d"/>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And when one has acquired any other art whatever as a whole, the same principle of inquiry holds through all the arts?  Do you require some explanation from me, Ion, of what I mean by this?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes, upon my word, Socrates, I do;  for I enjoy listening to you wise men.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>I only wish you were right there, Ion:  but surely it is you rhapsodes and actors, and the men whose poems you chant, who are wise;  whereas I speak but the plain truth, as a simple layman might.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="532e"/> For in regard to this question I asked you just now, observe what a trifling commonplace it was that I uttered—a thing that any man might know—namely, that when one has acquired a whole art the inquiry is the same.  Let us just think it out thus:  there is an art of painting as a whole?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And there are and have been many painters, good and bad?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Certainly.</p></said></div>
            
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="533">
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Now have you ever found anybody who is skilled in pointing out the successes and failures among the works of Polygnotus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A celebrated painter who came 488 B.</note> son of Aglaophon, but unable to do so with the works of the other painters;  <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="533"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="533a"/> and who, when the works of the other painters are exhibited, drops into a doze, and is at a loss, and has no remark to offer;  but when he has to pronounce upon Polygnotus or any other painter you please, and on that one only, wakes up and attends and has plenty to say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No, on my honor, I certainly have not.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Or again, in sculpture, have you ever found anyone who is skilled in expounding the successes of Daedalus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">According to legend, the first sculptor:  cf. <title>Euthyphro</title> 11, <title>Meno</title> 97 D.</note> son of Metion, or Epeius <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The maker of the wooden horse at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>  (Homer, <title>Od.</title> 8.493).</note> son of Panopeus, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="533b"/> or Theodorus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A metal-worker (Herodot. 1. 51, 3. 41).</note> of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, or any other single sculptor, but in face of the works of the other sculptors is at a loss and dozes, having nothing to say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No, on my honor, I have not found such a man as that either.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>But further, I expect you have also failed to find one in fluting or harping or minstrelsy or rhapsodizing who is skilled in expounding the art of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>
                   <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">One of the mythical inventors of music:  cf. <title>Symp.</title> 215 E.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="533c"/> or Thamyras, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A Thracian Bard.</note> or Orpheus, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A Thracian Bard.</note> or Phemius, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The minstrel who was forced to sing to the suitors of Penelope (<title>Od</title> 1. 154, 22. 330).</note> the rhapsode of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, but is at a loss and has no remark to offer on the successes or failures in rhapsody of Ion of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I cannot gainsay you on that, Socrates:  but of one thing I am conscious in myself—that I excel all men in speaking on Homer and have plenty to say, and everyone else says that I do it well;  but on the others I am not a good speaker.  Yet now, observe what that means.</p></said>
            <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>I do observe it, Ion, and I am going to point out to you <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="533d"/> what I take it to mean.  For, as I was saying just now, this is not an art in you, whereby you speak well on Homer, but a divine power, which moves you like that in the stone which Euripides named a magnet, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Probably referring to <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, south of which was one of the many places called <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαγνῆτις λίθος</foreign>  occurs in a fragment of Euripides’ <title>Oeneus.</title>
            </note> but most people call <q type="soCalled"><placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> stone.</q>  For this stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a power whereby they in turn are able to do the very same thing as the stone, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="533e"/> and attract other rings;  so that sometimes there is formed quite a long chain of bits of iron and rings, suspended one from another;  and they all depend for this power on that one stone.

Cf.  Eurip. <title>Bacchae.</title></note> worshippers do not dance when in their senses, so the lyric poets do not indite those fine songs in their senses, but when they have started on the melody and rhythm they begin to be frantic, and it is under possession—as the bacchants are possessed, and not in their senses, when they draw honey and milk from the rivers—that the soul of the lyric poets does the same thing, by their own report.  For the poets tell us, I believe, that the songs they bring us are the sweets they cull from honey-dropping founts <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="534b"/> in certain gardens and glades of the Muses—like the bees, and winging the air as these do. <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A beginning of this comparison appears in Aristophanes’ praise of the early tragedian Phrynichus—<cit><quote>he sipped the fruits of ambrosial lays, ever bringing away sweet song.</quote> <bibl>Aristoph. Birds 750f.</bibl></cit></note> And what they tell is true.  For a poet is a light and winged and sacred thing, and is unable ever to indite until he has been inspired and put out of his senses, and his mind is no longer in him:  every man, whilst he retains possession of that, is powerless to indite a verse or chant an oracle.  Seeing then that it is not by art that they compose and utter so many fine things about the deeds of men—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="534c"/> as you do about Homer—but by a divine dispensation, each is able only to compose that to which the Muse has stirred him, this man dithyrambs, another laudatory odes, another dance-songs, another epic or else iambic verse;  but each is at fault in any other kind.  For not by art do they utter these things, but by divine influence;  since, if they had fully learnt by art to speak on one kind of theme, they would know how to speak on all.  And for this reason God takes away the mind of these men and uses them as his ministers, just as he does soothsayers and godly seers, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="534d"/> in order that we who hear them may know that it is not they who utter these words of great price, when they are out of their wits, but that it is God himself who speaks and addresses us through them.  A convincing proof of what I say is the case of Tynnichus, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Nothing else is known of this poet.</note> the Chalcidian, who had never composed a single poem in his life that could deserve any mention, and then produced the paean <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A hymn in honor of a god, usually Apollo.</note> which is in everyone’s mouth, almost the finest song we have, simply—as he says himself—<quote>an invention of the Muses.</quote>  For the god, as it seems to me, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="534e"/> intended him to be a sign to us that we should not waver or doubt that these fine poems are not human or the work of men, but divine and the work of gods;  and that the poets are merely the interpreters of the gods, according as each is possessed by one of the heavenly powers.  To show this forth, the god of set purpose sang the finest of songs through the meanest of poets:  <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="535"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="535a"/> or do you not think my statement true, Ion?</p></said></div>

And, just as from the magnet, there is a mighty chain of choric performers and masters and under-masters suspended by side-connections from the rings that hang down from the Muse.  One poet is suspended from one Muse, another from another: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="536b"/> the word we use for it is <q type="emph">possessed,</q> but it is much the same thing, for he is held.  And from these first rings—the poets—are suspended various others, which are thus inspired, some by Orpheus and others by Musaeus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A legendary bard to whom certain oracular verses were ascribed.</note>;  but the majority are possessed and held by Homer.  Of whom you, Ion, are one, and are possessed by Homer;  and so, when anyone recites the work of another poet, you go to sleep and are at a loss what to say;  but when some one utters a strain of your poet, you wake up at once, and your soul dances, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="536c"/> and you have plenty to say:  for it is not by art or knowledge about Homer that you say what you say, but by divine dispensation and possession;  just as the Corybantian worshippers are keenly sensible of that strain alone which belongs to the god whose possession is on them, and have plenty of gestures and phrases for that tune, but do not heed any other.  And so you, Ion, when the subject of Homer is mentioned, have plenty to say, but nothing on any of the others.  And when you ask me the reason <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="536d"/> why you can speak at large on Homer but not on the rest, I tell you it is because your skill in praising Homer comes not by art, but by divine dispensation.</p></said>

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Do you not remember that you said that the art of the rhapsode was different from that of the charioteer?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I remember.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And you also admitted that, being different, it would know different things?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Then by your own account the rhapsode’s art cannot know everything, nor the rhapsode either.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Let us say, everything except those instances, Socrates.</p></said>

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>By <q type="mentioned">those instances</q> you imply the subjects of practically all the other arts.  Well, as he does not know all of them, which kinds will he know?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Those things, I imagine, that it befits a man to say, and the sort of thing that a woman should say;  the sort for a slave and the sort for a freeman;  and the sort for a subject or for a ruler.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Do you mean that the rhapsode will know better than the pilot what sort of thing a ruler of a storm-tossed vessel at sea should say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No, the pilot knows better in that case.

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well, will the rhapsode know better than the doctor what sort of thing a ruler of a sick man should say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Not in that case either.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>But he will know the sort for a slave, you say?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>For instance, if the slave is a cowherd, you say the rhapsode will know what the other should say to pacify his cows when they get fierce, but the cowherd will not?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>That is not so.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well, the sort of thing that a woman ought to say—a spinning-woman—about the working of wool?

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>But he will know what a man should say, when he is a general exhorting his men?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes, that sort of thing the rhapsode will know.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Well, but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I, at any rate, should know what a general ought to say.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Yes, since I daresay you are good at generalship also, Ion.  For in fact, if you happened to have skill in horsemanship as well as in the lyre, you would know when horses were well or ill managed:  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="540e"/> but if I asked you, <q type="spoken">By which art is it, Ion, that you know that horses are being well managed, by your skill as a horseman, or as a player of the lyre?</q> what would your answer be?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>I should say, by my skill as a horseman.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And if again you were distinguishing the good lyre-players, you would admit that you distinguished by your skill in the lyre, and not by your skill as a horseman.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Yes.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And when you judge of military matters, do you judge as having skill in generalship, or as a good rhapsode?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>To my mind, there is no difference.</p></said></div>

               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>What, no difference, do you say?  Do you mean that the art of the rhapsode and the general is one, not two?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>It is one, to my mind.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>So that anyone who is a good rhapsode is also, in fact, a good general?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Certainly, Socrates.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And again, anyone who happens to be a good general is also a good rhapsode.</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>No there I do not agree.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>But still you agree that anyone who is a good rhapsode <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="541b"/> is also a good general?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>To be sure.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>And you are the best rhapsode in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Far the best, Socrates.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Are you also, Ion, the best general in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>Be sure of it, Socrates and that I owe to my study of Homer.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>Then how, in Heaven’s name, can it be, Ion, that you, who are both the best general and the best rhapsode in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, go about performing as a rhapsode to the Greeks, but not as a general?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="541c"/> Or do you suppose that the Greeks feel a great need of a rhapsode in the glory of his golden crown, but of a general none at all?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>It is because my city, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">
                     <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>.</note> Socrates, is under the rule and generalship of your people, and is not in want of a general;  whilst you and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> would not choose me as a general, since you think you manage well enough for yourselves.</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>My excellent Ion, you are acquainted with Apollodorus <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Nothing else is known of this general.</note> of <placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, are you not?</p></said>
               <said who="#Ion"><label>Ion.</label> <p>What might he be?</p></said>
               <said who="#Socrates"><label>Soc.</label> <p>A man whom the Athenians have often chosen as their general, though a foreigner;  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="541d"/> and Phanosthenes <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Captured the Thurian admiral Dorieus, <date when="-0407">407</date> B.

And will she not choose Ion of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> as her general, and honor him, if he shows himself competent?  Why, you Ephesians are by origin Athenians, <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Androclus of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> founded <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> as the Ionian city known to the Greeks of Plato’s time.</note> are you not, and <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> is inferior to no city?  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="541e"/> But in fact, Ion, if you are right in saying it is by art and knowledge that you are able to praise Homer, you are playing me false:  you have professed to me that you know any amount of fine things about Homer, and you promise to display them;  but you are only deceiving me, and so far from displaying the subjects of your skill, you decline even to tell me what they are, for all my entreaties.</p></said></div>

Now if you are an artist and, as I was saying just now, you only promised me a display about Homer to deceive me, you are playing me false;  whilst if you are no artist, but speak fully and finely about Homer, as I said you did, without any knowledge but by a divine dispensation which causes you to be possessed by the poet, you play quite fair.  Choose therefore which of the two you prefer us to call you, dishonest or divine.</p></said>
