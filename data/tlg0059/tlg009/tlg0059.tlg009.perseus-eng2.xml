	<p><said who="#Cephalus"><label>Ceph.</label> When we came from our home at Clazomenae to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, we met Adeimantus and Glaucon in the market-place.  Adeimantus took me by the hand and said, <said>Welcome, Cephalus if there is anything we can do for you here, let us know.</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Why,</said> said I, <said>that is just why I am here, to ask a favour of you.</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Tell us,</said> said he, <said>what it is.</said>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="126b"/>
			And I said, <said>What was your half-brother’s name?  I don’t remember.  He was only a boy when I came here from Clazomenae before and that is now a long time ago.  His father’s name, I believe, was Pyrilampes.</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes,</said> said he.
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>And what is his own name?</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Antiphon.   Why do you ask?</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>These gentlemen,</said> I said, <said>are fellow-citizens of mine, who are very fond of philosophy.  They have heard that this Antiphon had a good deal to do with a friend of <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>’s named Pythodorus, that Pythodorus often repeated to him the conversation <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="126c"/> which <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, and Parmenides once had together, and that he remembers it.</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is true,</said> said he.
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Well,</said> I said, <said>we should like to hear it.</said>
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>There is no difficulty about that,</said> said he <said>for when he was a youth he studied it with great care though now he devotes most of his time to horses, like his grandfather Antiphon.  If that is what you want, let us go to him.  He has just gone home from here, and he lives close by in Melite.</said></said></p></div>

				<p><said who="#Cephalus" rend="merge">Thereupon we started, and we found Antiphon at home, giving a smith an order to make a bridle. When he had got rid of the smith and his brother told him what we were there for, he remembered me from my former visit and greeted me cordially, and when we asked him to repeat the conversation, he was at first unwilling—for he said it was a good deal of trouble—but afterwards he did so.  Antiphon, then, said that Pythodorus told him <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="127b"/> that <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> and Parmenides once came to the Great Panathenaea; that Parmenides was already quite elderly, about sixty-five years old, very white-haired, and of handsome and noble countenance; <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> was at that time about forty years of age; he was tall and good-looking, and there was a story that Parmenides had been in love with him. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="127c"/> He said that they lodged with Pythodorus outside of the wall, in Cerameicus, and that <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> and many others with him went there because they wanted to hear <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>’s writings, which had been brought to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> for the first time by them.  <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> was then very young.  So <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> himself read aloud to them, and Parmenides was not in the house. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="127d"/> Pythodorus said the reading of the treatises was nearly finished when he came in himself with Parmenides and Aristoteles (the one who was afterwards one of the thirty), so they heard only a little that remained of the written works.  He himself, however, had heard <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> read them before.
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> listened to the end, and then asked that the first thesis of the first treatise be read again. When this had been done, he said: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="127e"/><said><placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>, what do you mean by this?  That if existences are many, they must be both like and unlike, which is impossible; for the unlike cannot be like, nor the like unlike? Is not that your meaning?</said><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>.
		<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Then if it is impossible for the unlike to be like and the like unlike, it is impossible for existences to be many; for if they were to be many, they would experience the impossible.  Is that the purpose of your treatises, to maintain against all arguments that existences are not many?  And you think each of your treatises is a proof of this very thing, and therefore you believe that the proofs you offer that existences are not many are as many as the treatises you have written?  Is that your meaning,
			
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="128"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="128a"/> 
		or have I misunderstood?</said></said></p></div>

				<p><said who="#Cephalos" rend="merge"><label>Ceph.</label>
			    <said>No,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>, <said>you have grasped perfectly the general intent of the work.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>I see, Parmenides,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, <said>that <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> here wishes to be very close to you not only in his friendship, but also in his writing.  For he has written much the same thing as you, but by reversing the process he tries to cheat us into the belief that he is saying something new.  For you, in your poems, say that the all is one, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="128b"/>and you furnish proofs of this in fine and excellent fashion; and he, on the other hand, says it is not many, and he also furnishes very numerous and weighty proofs.  That one of you says it is one, and the other that it is not many, and that each of you expresses himself so that although you say much the same you seem not to have said the same things at all, appears to the rest of us a feat of expression quite beyond our power.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>, <said>but you have not perceived all aspects of the truth about my writings. You follow the arguments with a scent <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="128c"/> as keen as a Laconian hound’s, but you do not observe that my treatise is not by any means so pretentious that it could have been written with the intention you ascribe to it, of disguising itself as a great performance in the eyes of men.  What you mentioned is a mere accident, but in truth these writings are meant to support the argument of Parmenides against those who attempt to jeer at him and assert that <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="128d"/> if the all is one many absurd results follow which contradict his theory.  Now this treatise opposes the advocates of the many and gives them back their ridicule with interest, for its purpose is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.  It was in such a spirit of controversy that I wrote it when I was young, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="128e"/> and when it was written some one stole it, so that I could not even consider whether it should be published or not. So, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, you are not aware of this and you think that the cause of its composition was not the controversial spirit of a young man, but the ambition of an old one.  In other respects, as I said, you guessed its meaning pretty well.</said></said></p></div>

					<said>I see,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, <said>and I accept your explanation.  But tell me, do you not believe there is an idea of likeness in the abstract,

			<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="129"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="129a"/>and another idea of unlikeness, the opposite of the first, and that you and I and all things which we call many partake of these two?  And that those which partake of likeness become like, and those which partake of unlikeness become unlike, and those which partake of both become both like and unlike, all in the manner and degree of their participation? And even if all things partake of both opposites, and are enabled by their participation to be both like and unlike themselves, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="129b"/> what is there wonderful about that?  For if anyone showed that the absolute like becomes unlike, or the unlike like, that would, in my opinion, be a wonder; but if he shows that things which partake of both become both like and unlike, that seems to me, <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>, not at all strange, not even if he shows that all things are one by participation in unity and that the same are also many by participation in multitude; but if he shows that absolute unity is also many and the absolute many again are one, then I shall be amazed. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="129c"/> The same applies to all other things.  If he shows that the kinds and ideas in and by themselves possess these opposite qualities, it is marvellous but if he shows that I am both one and many, what marvel is there in that?  He will say, when he wishes to show that I am many, that there are my right parts and my left parts, my front parts and my back parts, likewise upper and lower, all different; for I do, I suppose, partake of multitude; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="129d"/> and when he wishes to show that I am one, he will say that we here are seven persons, of whom I am one, a man, partaking also of unity and so he shows that both assertions are true.  If anyone then undertakes to show that the same things are both many and one—I mean such things as stones, sticks, and the like—we shall say that he shows that they are many and one, but not that the one is many or the many one; he says nothing wonderful, but only what we should all accept.  If, however, as I was saying just now, he first distinguishes the abstract ideas, such as likeness and unlikeness, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="129e"/> multitude and unity, rest and motion, and the like, and then shows that they can be mingled and separated, I should,</said> said he, <said>be filled with amazement, <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>.</said></said></p></div>

			<p><said who="#Cephalos" rend="merge"><label>Ceph.</label><said rend="merge">Now I think this has been very manfully discussed by you; but I should, as I say, be more amazed if anyone could show in the abstract ideas, which are intellectual conceptions,
			
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="130"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="130a"/>
			this same multifarious and perplexing entanglement which you described in visible objects.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Pythodorus said that he thought at every word, while <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> was saying this, Parmenides and <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> would be angry, but they paid close attention to him and frequently looked at each other and smiled, as if in admiration of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, and when he stopped speaking Parmenides expressed their approval.  
			<said><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>,</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="130b"/> he said, <said>what an admirable talent for argument you have!  Tell me, did you invent this distinction yourself, which separates abstract ideas from the things which partake of them?  And do you think there is such a thing as abstract likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and abstract one and many, and the other abstractions of which you heard <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> speaking just now?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes, I do,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>And also,</said> said Parmenides, <said>abstract ideas of the just, the beautiful, the good, and all such conceptions?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes,</said> he replied. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="130c"/> <said>And is there an abstract idea of man, apart from us and all others such as we are, or of fire or water?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>I have often,</said> he replied, <said>been very much troubled, Parmenides, to decide whether there are ideas of such things, or not.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>And are you undecided about certain other things, which you might think rather ridiculous, such as hair, mud, dirt, or anything else particularly vile and worthless?  Would you say that there is an idea of each of these distinct and different from the things <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="130d"/> with which we have to do, or not?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>By no means,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.  <said>No, I think these things are such as they appear to us, and it would be quite absurd to believe that there is an idea of them; and yet I am sometimes disturbed by the thought that perhaps what is true of one thing is true of all.  Then when I have taken up this position, I run away for fear of falling into some abyss of nonsense and perishing; so when I come to those things which we were just saying do have ideas, I stay and busy myself with them.</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="130e"/> <said>Yes, for you are still young,</said> said Parmenides, <said>and philosophy has not yet taken hold upon you, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, as I think it will later.  Then you will not despise them; but now you still consider people’s opinions, on account of your youth.  Well, tell me do you think that, as you say, there are ideas, and that these other things which partake of them are named from them,
			
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="131"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="131a"/>
			as, for instance, those that partake of likeness become like, those that partake of greatness great, those that partake of beauty and justice just and beautiful?</said></said></p></div>
			
			<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="131">
			<p><said who="#Cephalos" rend="merge"><label>Ceph.</label>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Certainly,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Well then, does each participant object partake of the whole idea, or of a part of it?  Or could there be some other third kind of participation?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>How could there be?</said>  said he.
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Do you think the whole idea, being one, is in each of the many participants, or what?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes, for what prevents it from being in them, Parmenides?</said>  said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="131b"/> <said>Then while it is one and the same, the whole of it would be in many separate individuals at once, and thus it would itself be separate from itself.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>No,</said> he replied, <said>for it might be like day, which is one and the same, is in many places at once, and yet is not separated from itself; so each idea, though one and the same, might be in all its participants at once.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That,</said> said he, <said>is very neat, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> you make one to be in many places at once, just as if you should spread a sail over many persons and then should say it was one and all of it was over many. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="131c"/> Is not that about what you mean?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Perhaps it is,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Would the whole sail be over each person, or a particular part over each?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>A part over each.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Then,</said> said he, <said>the ideas themselves, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, are divisible into parts, and the objects which partake of them would partake of a part, and in each of them there would be not the whole, but only a part of each idea.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>So it appears.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Are you, then, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, willing to assert that the one idea is really divided and will still be one?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>By no means,</said> he replied.
		 	<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>No,</said> said Parmenides, <said>for if you divide absolute greatness, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="131d"/> and each of the many great things is great by a part of greatness smaller than absolute greatness, is not that unreasonable?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Certainly,</said> he said.
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Or again, will anything by taking away a particular small part of equality possess something by means of which, when it is less than absolute equality, its possessor will be equal to anything else?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is impossible.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Or let one of us have a part of the small; the small will be greater than this, since this is a part of it, and therefore the absolute small will be greater; but that to which the part of the small is added will be smaller,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="131e"/>not greater, than before.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That,</said> said he, <said>is impossible.</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>How, then, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, will other things partake of those ideas of yours, if they cannot partake of them either as parts or as wholes?</said>
			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>By Zeus,</said> he replied, <said>I think that is a very hard question to determine.</said>

			<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
			<p><said who="#Cephalos" rend="merge"><label>Ceph.</label><said>I fancy your reason for believing that each idea is one is something like this; when there is a number of things which seem to you to be great, you may think, as you look at them all, that there is one and the same idea in them, and hence you think the great is one.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is true,</said> he said.
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>But if with your mind’s eye you regard the absolute great and these many great things in the same way, will not another great appear beyond, by which all these must appear to be great?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>So it seems.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is, another idea of greatness will appear, in addition to absolute greatness and the objects which partake of it; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="132b"/> and another again in addition to these, by reason of which they are all great; and each of your ideas will no longer be one, but their number will be infinite.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>But, Parmenides,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, <said>each of these ideas may be only a thought, which can exist only in our minds then each might be one, without being exposed to the consequences you have just mentioned.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>But,</said> he said, <said>is each thought one, but a thought of nothing?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is impossible,</said> he replied.
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>But of something?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes.</said> 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="132c"/>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Of something that is, or that is not?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Of something that is.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>A thought of some single element which that thought thinks of as appertaining to all and as being one idea?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Yes.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Then will not this single element, which is thought of as one and as always the same in all, be an idea?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That, again, seems inevitable.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Well then,</said> said Parmenides, <said>does not the necessity which compels you to say that all other things partake of ideas, oblige you also to believe either that everything is made of thoughts, and all things think, or that, being thoughts, they are without thought?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>That is quite unreasonable, too,</said> he said, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="132d"/> <said>but Parmenides, I think the most likely view is, that these ideas exist in nature as patterns, and the other things resemble them and are imitations of them; their participation in ideas is assimilation to them, that and nothing else.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Then if anything,</said> he said, <said>resembles the idea, can that idea avoid being like the thing which resembles it, in so far as the thing has been made to resemble it; or is there any possibility that the like be unlike its like?</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>No, there is none.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>And must not necessarily the like partake of <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="132e"/> the same idea as its like?</said>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>How is that?</said>  said he.
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>There are many reasons,</said> he said, <said>but the greatest is this; if anyone should say that the ideas cannot even be known if they are such as we say they must be, no one could prove to him that he was wrong, unless he who argued that they could be known were a man of wide education and ability and were willing to follow the proof through many long and elaborate details; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="133c"/> he who maintains that they cannot be known would be unconvinced.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Why is that, Parmenides?</said>  said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Because, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, I think that you or anyone else who claims that there is an absolute idea of each thing would agree in the first place that none of them exists in us.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>No, for if it did, it would no longer be absolute,</said> said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>You are right,</said> he said.  <said>Then those absolute ideas which are relative to one another have their own nature in relation to themselves, and not in relation to the likenesses, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="133d"/> or whatever we choose to call them, which are amongst us, and from which we receive certain names as we participate in them.

Therefore he who hears such assertions is confused in his mind and argues that the ideas do not exist, and even if they do exist cannot by any possibility be known by man; and he thinks that what he says is reasonable, and, as I was saying just now, he is amazingly hard to convince.  Only a man of very great natural gifts will be able to understand that everything has a class and absolute essence, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="135b"/> and only a still more wonderful man can find out all these facts and teach anyone else to analyze them properly and understand them.</said>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Pythodorus said that <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> answered with a smile:  <said>Let us ask it of Parmenides himself, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; for there is a great deal in what he says, and perhaps you do not see how heavy a task you are imposing upon him.

		for if anything is moved in any way, in so far as it is moved it is no longer in its former condition, but in a different one.</said> <said>True.</said>  <said>Then in moving, the one changes in nature.</said>  <said>Yes.</said>  <said>And yet when it does not move in any way, it will not change its nature in any way.</said>  <said>No.</said>  <said>Then in so far as the non-existent one moves, it changes, and in so far as it does not move, it does not change.</said>  <said>True.</said>  <said>Then the non-existent one both changes and does not change.</said>  <said>So it appears.</said>  <said>And must not that which changes come into a state of being other than its previous one, and perish, so far as its previous state is concerned; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="163b"/> whereas that which does not change neither comes into being nor perishes?</said>  <said>That is inevitable.</said>  <said>Then the non-existent one, when it is changed, comes into being and perishes, and when it is not changed, neither comes into being nor perishes and thus the non-existent one both comes into being and perishes and neither comes into being nor perishes.</said>  <said>Quite true.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Let us now go back again to the beginning and see whether the conclusions we reach will be the same as at present, or different.</said>  <said>Yes, we should do that.</said>  <said>We ask, then, if the one is not, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="163c"/> what will be the consequences in regard to it?</said>  <said>Yes.</said>  <said>Does the expression <q type="emph">is not</q> denote anything else than the absence of existence in that of which we say that it is not?</said>  <said>No, nothing else.</said>  <said>And when we say that a thing is not, do we mean that it is in a way and is not in a way? Or does the expression <q type="emph">is not</q> mean without any qualifications that the non-existent is not in any way, shape, or manner, and does not participate in being in any way?</said>  <said>Without any qualifications whatsoever.</said>  <said>Then the non-existent cannot be and cannot in any other way partake of existence.</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="163d"/> <said>No.</said>  <said>But were coming into being and perishing anything else than receiving and losing existence.</said>  <said>No, nothing else.</said>  <said>But that which has no participation in it can neither receive it nor lose it.</said>  <said>Of course not.</said>  <said>Then the one, since it does not exist in any way, cannot possess or lose or share in existence at all.</said>  <said>That is reasonable.</said>  <said>Then the non-existent one neither perishes nor comes into being, since it participates in no way in existence.</said>  <said>No; that is clear.</said>  <said>Then it is not changed in nature at all; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="163e"/> for such change involves coming into being and perishing.</said>  <said>True.</said>  <said>And if it is not changed, it cannot move, either, can it?</said>  <said>Certainly not.</said>  <said>And we cannot say that that which is nowhere is at rest; for that which is at rest must always be in some place which is the same.</said>  <said>Yes, of course, the same place.</said>  <said>Thus we shall say again that the non-existent one is neither at rest nor in motion.</said>  <said>No, neither.</said></said></p></div>

			<said>That is plain.</said>  <said>Then neither greatness nor smallness nor equality pertains to it.</said>  <said>No.</said>  <said>Nor likeness nor difference, either in relation to itself or to other things.</said>  <said>Clearly not.</said>  <said>And can other things pertain to it, if nothing pertains to it?</said>  <said>Impossible.</said>  <said>Then the other things are neither like it nor unlike it, nor the same nor different.</said>  <said>No.</said>  <said>Well, then, will the notions <q type="emph">of that</q> or <q type="emph">to that</q> or <q type="emph">some,</q> or <q type="emph">this</q> or <q type="emph">of this</q> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="164b"/> or <q type="emph">of another</q> or <q type="emph">to another</q> or past or future or present or knowledge or opinion or perception or definition or name or anything else which exists pertain to the non-existent?</said>  <said>No.</said>  <said>Then the non-existent one has no state or condition whatsoever.</said>  <said>It appears to have none whatsoever.</said>  <said>Let us then discuss further what happens to the other things, if the one does not exist.</said>  <said>Let us do so.</said>  <said>Well, they must exist; for if others do not even exist, there could be no talking about the others.</said>  <said>True.</said>  <said>But if we talk about the others, the others are different. Or do you not regard the words other and different as synonymous?</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="164c"/> <said>Yes, I do.</said>  <said>And we say that the different is different from the different, and the other is other than the other?</said>  <said>Yes.</said>  <said>Then if the others are to be others, there must be something of which they will be others.</said>  <said>Yes, there must be.</said>  <said>Now what can that be? For they cannot be others of the one, if it does not exist.</said>  <said>No.</said>  <said>Then they are others of each other; for they have no alternative, except to be others of nothing.</said>  <said>True.</said>  <said>They are each, then, others of each other, in groups; for they cannot be so one at a time, if one does not exist. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="164d"/> But each mass of them is unlimited in number, and even if you take what seems to be the smallest bit, it suddenly changes, like something in a dream that which seemed to be one is seen to be many, and instead of very small it is seen to be very great in comparison with the minute fractions of it.</said>  <said>Very true.</said>  <said>Such masses of others would be others of each other, if others exist and one does not exist.</said>  <said>Certainly.</said>  <said>There will, then, be many masses, each of which appears to be one, but is not one, if one does not exist?</said>  <said>Yes.</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="164e"/> <said>And they will seem to possess, number, if each seems to be one and they are many.</said>  <said>Certainly.</said>  <said>And some will seem to be even and others odd, but all that will be unreal, if the one does not exist.</said>  <said>True.</said></said></p></div>

			<said>And there will, we assert, seem to be a smallest among them but this proves to be many and great in comparison with each of the many minute fractions.</said>
			
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="165"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="165a"/>
			<said>Of course.</said>  <said>And each mass will be considered equal to the many minute fractions for it could not appear to pass from greater to smaller, without seeming to enter that which is between them; hence the appearance of equality.</said>  <said>That is reasonable.</said>  <said>And although it has a limit in relation to another mass, it has neither beginning nor limit nor middle in relation to itself?</said>  <said>Why is that?</said>  <said>Because whenever the mind conceives of any of these as belonging to the masses, another beginning appears before the beginning, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="165b"/> another end remains after the end, and in the middle are other more central middles than the middle, but smaller, because it is impossible to conceive of each one of them, since the one does not exist.</said>  <said>Very true.</said>  <said>So all being which is conceived by any mind must, it seems to me, be broken up into minute fractions; for it would always be conceived as a mass devoid of one.</said>  <said>Certainly.</said>  <said>Now anything of that sort, if seen from a distance and dimly, must appear to be one, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="165c"/> but if seen from close at hand and with keen vision, each apparent one must prove to be unlimited in number, if it is really devoid of one, and one does not exist.  Am I right?</said>  <said>That is perfectly conclusive.</said>  <said>Therefore the other things must each and all appear to be unlimited and limited and one and many, if the things other than one exist and one does not.</said>  <said>Yes, they must.</said>  <said>And will they not also appear to be like and unlike?</said>  <said>Why?</said>  <said>Just as things in a picture, when viewed from a distance, appear to be all in one and the same condition and alike.</said> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="165d"/> <said>Certainly.</said>  <said>But when you come close to them they appear to be many and different, and, because of their difference in appearance, different in kind and unlike each other.</said>  <said>Yes.</said>  <said>And so the groups of the other things must appear to be like and unlike themselves and each other.</said>  <said>Certainly.</said>  <said>And also the same and different, and in contact with one another and separated, and in all kinds of motion and in every sort of rest, and coming into being and perishing, and neither of the two, and all that sort of thing, which we can easily mention in detail, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="165e"/> if the many exist and the one does not.</said>  <said>Very true.</said>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><said>Let us, then, go back once more to the beginning and tell the consequences, if the others exist and the one does not.</said>  <said>Let us do so.</said>  <said>Well, the others will not be one?</said>  <said>Of course not.</said>  <said>Nor will they be many for if they were many, one would be contained in them. And if none of them is one, they are all nothing, so that they cannot be many.</said>  <said>True.</said>  <said>If one is not contained in the others, the others are neither many nor one.</said>
