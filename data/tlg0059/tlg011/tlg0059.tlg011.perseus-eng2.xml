                   I believe I have got the story you inquire of pretty well by heart.  The day before yesterday I chanced to be going up to town from my house in Phalerum, when one of my acquaintance caught sight of me from behind, some way off, and called in a bantering tone <q type="spoken">Hullo, Phalerian!  I say, Apollodorus, wait a moment.</q>  So I stopped and waited.  Then, <q type="spoken">Apollodorus,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">do you know, I have just been looking for you, as I want to hear all about the banquet that brought together Agathon <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="172b"/> and Socrates and Alcibiades and the rest of that party, and what were the speeches they delivered upon love.  For somebody else was relating to me the account he had from Phoenix, <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Nothing is known of this man.</note> son of Philip, and he mentioned that you knew it too.  But he could not tell it at all clearly so you must give me the whole story, for you are the most proper reporter of your dear friend’s discourses.  But first tell me this,</q> he went on; <q type="spoken">were you at that party yourself, or not?</q>  To which my answer was:  <q type="spoken">You have had anything but <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="172c"/> a clear account from your informant, if you suppose the party you are asking about to have been such a recent affair that I could be included.</q>  <q type="spoken">So I did suppose,</q> he said.  <q type="spoken">How so, Glaucon <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Probably Plato’s brother (<bibl><title>Rep.</title> 368A</bibl>).</note>?</q> said I.  <q type="spoken">You must know it is many a year that Agathon has been away from home and country, and not yet three years that I have been consorting with Socrates and making it my daily care to know whatever he says or does.</q></said></p></div>
                  
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="173">
        <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge"><label>Ap.</label> <q type="spoken" rend="merge">Before that time,
          <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="173"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="173a"/> what with running about at random and thinking I did things, I was the wretchedest man alive; just as you are at present, thinking philosophy is none of your business.</q>  <q type="spoken">Instead of jeering at me,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">tell me when it was that this party took place.</q>  <q type="spoken">When you and I were only children,</q> I told him; <q type="spoken">on the occasion of Agathon’s victory with his first tragedy:  the day after that of the dedicatory feast which he and his players held for its celebration.</q>  <q type="spoken">Ah, quite a long while ago, it would seem,</q> said he; <q type="spoken">but who gave you the account of it?  Socrates himself?</q>  <q type="spoken">Goodness, no!</q> I answered.  <q type="spoken">It was the person who told Phoenix—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="173b"/>Aristodemus of Cydathenaeum, a little man, who went always barefoot.  He was of the company there, being one of the chief among Socrates’ lovers at that time, I believe.  But all the same, I have since questioned Socrates on some details of the story I had from his friend, and he acknowledged them to be in accordance with his account.</q>  <q type="spoken">Come then,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">let me have it now; and in fact the road up to town is well suited for telling and hearing as we go along.</q>
      <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So on we went, discoursing the while of this affair; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="173c"/> and hence, as I began by saying, I have it pretty well by heart.  So, friends, if you too must hear the whole story, I had better tell it.  For my own part, indeed, I commonly find that, setting aside the benefit I conceive they do me, I take an immense delight in philosophic discourses, whether I speak them myself or hear them from others:  whereas in the case of other sorts of talk—especially that of your wealthy, money-bag friends—I am not only annoyed myself but sorry for dear intimates like you, who think you are doing a great deal when you really do nothing at all. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="173d"/> From your point of view, I daresay, I seem a hapless creature, and I think your thought is true.  I, however, do not think it of you:  I know it for sure.</said></p>
         <p><said who="#Companion"><label>Comp.</label> 
         You are the same as ever, Apollodorus,—always defaming your self and every one else!  Your view, I take it, is that all men alike are miserable, save Socrates, and that your own plight is the worst.  How you may have come by your title of <q type="emph">crazy,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">His friend means:  <q type="emph">I expect you quite deserve your name of crazy fanatic (for your general absorption in philosophy), because your vehement censure of yourself and others suggests it to me</q>.</note> I do not know:  though, of course, you are always like that in your way of speech—raging against yourself and everybody except Socrates.</said></p>

         <p><said who="#Apollodorus"><label>Ap.</label> 
         My dear sir, obviously it must be a mere crazy aberration in me, to hold this opinion of myself and of you all!</said></p>
         <p><said who="#Companion"><label>Comp.</label> 
         It is waste of time, Apollodorus, to wrangle about such matters now.  Come, without more ado, comply with our request and relate how the speeches went.</said></p>
         <p><said who="#Apollodorus"><label>Ap.</label> 
         Well then, they were somewhat as follows,—but stay, I must try and tell you all in order from the beginning, 
         <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="174"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="174a"/> just as my friend told it to me.</said></p></div>

        <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge">                
        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>He said that he met with Socrates fresh from the bath and wearing his best pair of slippers—quite rare events with him—and asked him whither he was bound in such fine trim.
        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">To dinner at Agathon’s,</q> he answered.  <q type="spoken">I evaded him and his celebrations yesterday, fearing the crowd; but I agreed to be present today.  So I got myself up in this handsome style in order to be a match for my handsome host.  Now tell me,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">do you feel in the mood 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="174b"/> for going unasked to dinner?</q>
       <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">For anything,</q> he said he replied, <q type="spoken">that you may bid me do.</q>
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Come along then,</q> he said; <q type="spoken">let us corrupt the proverb with a new version: <quote><l>What if they go of their own accord,</l><l>The good men to our Goodman’s <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The name Agathon resembles the Greek for <gloss>good men’s</gloss> in the proverb, which seems to have been:  <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόματοι δ’ ἀγαθοὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασι</foreign> (Athen. i. 8A;  <bibl>Bacchyl. fr. 33</bibl>).  The <q type="emph">corruption</q> consists in putting the dative <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγάθων(ἰ)</foreign> for  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθῶν</foreign>; though perhaps the reference is to another form of the proverb which had  <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλῶν</foreign> (cravens’) instead of  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθῶν</foreign>.</note> board?</l></quote>
        Though indeed Homer <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 17.587">Hom.

Il. 2.408</bibl> <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόματος δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος</foreign>.</note> may be said to have not merely corrupted the adage, but debauched it:  for after setting forth Agamemnon as a man eminently good at warfare, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="174c"/> and Menelaus as only <quote>a spearman spiritless,</quote> <note resp="perseus" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 17.587">Hom. Il. 17.587</bibl></note> he makes the latter come unbidden to the banquet of the former, who was offering sacrifice and holding a feast; so the worse man was the guest of the better.</q>
       <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To this my friend’s answer, as he told me, was:  <q type="spoken">I am afraid mine, most likely, is a case that fits not your version, Socrates, but Homer’s—a dolt coming unbidden to the banquet of a scholar.  Be sure, then, to have your excuse quite ready when you bring me; for I shall not own to coming unasked, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="174d"/> but only on your invitation.</q>
        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken"><quote>If two go along together,</quote></q> he remarked, <q type="spoken"><quote>there’s one before another</quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Hom.

Well, off we go.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After some such conversation, he told me, they started off.  Then Socrates, becoming absorbed in his own thoughts by the way, fell behind him as they went; and when my friend began to wait for him he bade him go on ahead. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="174e"/> So he came to Agathon’s house, and found the door open; where he found himself in a rather ridiculous position.  For he was met immediately by a servant from within, who took him where the company was reclining, and he found them just about to dine.  However, as soon as Agathon saw him <q type="spoken">Ha, Aristodemus,</q> he cried, <q type="spoken">right welcome to a place at table with us!  If you came on some other errand, put it off to another time:  only yesterday I went round to invite you, but failed to see you.  But how is it you do not bring us Socrates?</q>
       <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At that I turned back for Socrates, he said, but saw no sign of him coming after me:  so I told them how I myself had come along with Socrates, since he had asked me to dine with them.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Very good of you to come,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">but where is the man?</q></said></p></div>

         <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge">    
         <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">He was coming in just now behind me:  I am wondering myself where he can be.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Go at once,</q> said Agathon to the servant, <q type="spoken">and see if you can fetch in Socrates.  You, Aristodemus, take a place by Eryximachus.</q>
           <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So the attendant washed him and made him ready for reclining, when another of the servants came in with the news that our good Socrates had retreated into their neighbors’ porch; there he was standing, and when bidden to come in, he refused.
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">How strange!</q>  said Agathon, <q type="spoken">you must go on bidding him, and by no means let him go.</q> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="175b"/>
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But this Aristodemus forbade:  <q type="spoken">No,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">let him alone; it is a habit he has.  Occasionally he turns aside, anywhere at random, and there he stands.  He will be here presently, I expect.  So do not disturb him; let him be.</q>
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Very well then,</q> said Agathon, <q type="spoken">as you judge best.  Come, boys,</q> he called to the servants, <q type="spoken">serve the feast for the rest of us.  You are to set on just whatever you please, now that you have no one to direct you (a method I have never tried before). <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This clause is probably an <q type="emph">aside</q>to his guests.</note>  Today you are to imagine that I and all the company here have come on your invitation so look after us, and earn our compliments.</q>
                        <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="175c"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thereupon, he said, they all began dinner, but Socrates did not arrive; and though Agathon ever and anon gave orders that they should go and fetch him, my friend would not allow it.  When he did come, it was after what, for him, was no great delay, as they were only about halfway through dinner.  Then Agathon, who happened to be sitting alone in the lowest place, said:  <q type="spoken">Here, Socrates, come sit by me, so that by contact with you <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="175d"/> I may have some benefit from that piece of wisdom that occurred to you there in the porch.  Clearly you have made the discovery and got hold of it for you would not have come away before.</q>
                        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then Socrates sat down, and <q type="spoken">How fine it would be, Agathon,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">if wisdom were a sort of thing that could flow out of the one of us who is fuller into him who is emptier, by our mere contact with each other, as water will flow through wool from the fuller cup into the emptier.  If such is indeed the case with wisdom, I set a great value on my sitting next to you: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="175e"/> I look to be filled with excellent wisdom drawn in abundance out of you.  My own is but meagre, as disputable as a dream; but yours is bright and expansive, as the other day we saw it shining forth from your youth, strong and splendid, in the eyes of more than thirty thousand Greeks.</q>
                       <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">You rude mocker, Socrates!</q>  said Agathon.  <q type="spoken">A little later on you and I shall go to law on this matter of our wisdom, and Dionysus shall be our judge.  For the present, let the dinner be your first concern.</q></said></p></div>
                     
       <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="176">

          <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge"> 
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After this, it seems, when Socrates had taken his place and had dined with the rest, they made libation and sang a chant to the god and so forth, as custom bids, till they betook them to drinking.  Then Pausanias opened a conversation after this manner:  <q type="spoken">Well, gentlemen, what mode of drinking will suit us best?  For my part, to tell the truth, I am in very poor form as a result of yesterday’s bout, and I claim a little relief; it is so, I believe, with most of you, for you were at yesterday’s party:  so consider what method <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="176b"/> of drinking would suit us best.</q>
                        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On this Aristophanes observed:  <q type="spoken">Now that, Pausanias, is a good suggestion of yours, that we make a point of consulting our comfort in our cups:  for I myself am one of those who got such a soaking yesterday.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When Eryximachus, son of Acumenus, heard this; <q type="spoken">You are quite right, sirs,</q> he said; <q type="spoken">and there is yet one other question on which I request your opinion, as to what sort of condition Agathon finds himself in for drinking.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">No, no,</q> said Agathon, <q type="spoken">I am not in good condition for it either.</q>
                        <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="176c"/>
                        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">It would be a piece of luck for us, I take it,</q> the other went on, <q type="spoken">that is, for me, Aristodemus, Phaedrus, and our friends here, if you who are the stoutest drinkers are now feeling exhausted.  We, of course, are known weaklings.  Socrates I do not count in the matter:  he is fit either way, and will be content with whichever choice we make.  Now as it appears that nobody here present is eager for copious draughts, perhaps it will be the less irksome to you if I speak of intoxication, and tell you truly what it is.  The practice of medicine, I find, has made this clear to me—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="176d"/>that drunkenness is harmful to mankind; and neither would I myself agree, if I could help it, to an excess of drinking, nor would I recommend it to another, especially when his head is still heavy from a bout of the day before.</q>
                        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Here Phaedrus of Myrrhinus interrupted him, saying:  <q type="spoken">Why, you know I always obey you, above all in medical matters; and so now will the rest of us, if they are well advised.</q>  Then all of them, on hearing this, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="176e"/> consented not to make their present meeting a tipsy affair, but to drink just as it might serve their pleasure.
                        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Since it has been resolved, then,</q> said Eryximachus, <q type="spoken">that we are to drink only so much as each desires, with no constraint on any, I next propose that the flute-girl who came in just now be dismissed:  let her pipe to herself or, if she likes, to the women-folk within, but let us seek our entertainment today in conversation.  I am ready, if you so desire, to suggest what sort of discussion it should be.</q></said></p></div>

He is constantly complaining to me and saying,—Is it not a curious thing, Eryximachus, that while other gods have hymns and psalms indited in their honor by the poets, the god of Love, so ancient and so great, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="177b"/> has had no song of praise composed for him by a single one of all the many poets that ever have been?  And again, pray consider our worthy professors, and the eulogies they frame of Hercules and others in prose,—for example, the excellent Prodicus. <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The moralizing sophist, famous for his parable of <title>The Choice of Heracles</title> (<bibl n="Xen.

To think of all this bustle about such trifles, and not a single man ever essaying till this day to make a fitting hymn to Love!  So great a god, and so neglected!  Now I think Phaedrus’s protest a very proper one.  Accordingly I am not only desirous of obliging him with a contribution of my own, but I also pronounce the present to be a fitting occasion for us here assembled to honor the god. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="177d"/> So if you on your part approve, we might pass the time well enough in discourses; for my opinion is that we ought each of us to make a speech in turn, from left to right, praising Love as beautifully as he can.  Phaedrus shall open first; for he has the topmost place at table, and besides is father of our debate.</q>

          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus Love is by various authorities allowed to be of most venerable standing; and as most venerable, he is the cause of all our highest blessings.  I for my part am at a loss to say what greater blessing a man can have in earliest youth than an honorable lover, or a lover than an honorable favorite.  For the guiding principle we should choose for all our days, if we are minded to live a comely life, cannot be acquired either by kinship or office or wealth <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="178d"/> or anything so well as by Love.  What shall I call this power?  The shame that we feel for shameful things, and ambition for what is noble; without which it is impossible for city or person to perform any high and noble deeds.  Let me then say that a man in love, should he be detected in some shameful act or in a cowardly submission to shameful treatment at another’s hands, would not feel half so much distress at anyone observing it, whether father or comrade or anyone in the world, as when his favorite did; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="178e"/> and in the selfsame way we see how the beloved is especially ashamed before his lovers when he is observed to be about some shameful business.

Sufficient witness is borne to this statement before the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> by Alcestis, daughter of Pelias, who alone was willing to die for her husband, though he had both father <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="179c"/> and mother.

             <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="180c"/>
             <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such in the main was Phaedrus’ speech as reported to me.  It was followed by several others, which my friend could not recollect at all clearly; so he passed them over and related that of Pausanias, which ran as follows:  
             <said who="#Pausanias" direct="false">I do not consider, Phaedrus, our plan of speaking a good one, if the rule is simply that we are to make eulogies of Love.  If Love were only one, it would be right; but, you see, he is not one, and this being the case, it would be more correct to have it previously announced <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="180d"/> what sort we ought to praise.  Now this defect I will endeavor to amend, and will first decide on a Love who deserves our praise, and then will praise him in terms worthy of his godhead.  We are all aware that there is no Aphrodite or Love-passion without a Love.  True, if that goddess were one, then Love would be one:  but since there are two of her, there must needs be two Loves also.  Does anyone doubt that she is double?  Surely there is the elder, of no mother born, but daughter of Heaven, whence we name her Heavenly; <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hdt. 1.105">Hdt. 1.105</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 1.131">Hdt. 1.131</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 1.14.7">Paus. 1.14.7</bibl>.</note> while the younger was the child of Zeus and Dione, and her we call Popular. <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 1.22.3">Paus. 1.22.3</bibl>.</note> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="180e"/> It follows then that of the two Loves also the one ought to be called Popular, as fellow-worker with the one of those goddesses, and the other Heavenly.  All gods, of course, ought to be praised:  but none the less I must try to describe the faculties of each of these two.  For of every action
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="181"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="181a"/> it may be observed that as acted by itself it is neither noble nor base.</said></said></p></div>

            <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge">  
            <said who="#Pausanias" direct="false" rend="merge">For instance, in our conduct at this moment, whether we drink or sing or converse, none of these things is noble in itself; each only turns out to be such in the doing, as the manner of doing it may be.  For when the doing of it is noble and right, the thing itself becomes noble; when wrong, it becomes base.  So also it is with loving, and Love is not in every case noble or worthy of celebration, but only when he impels us to love in a noble manner.
              <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now the Love that belongs to the Popular Aphrodite is in very truth popular and does his work at haphazard:  this is the Love we see in the meaner sort of men; who, in the first place, love women as well as boys; secondly, where they love, they are set on the body more than the soul; and thirdly, they choose the most witless people they can find, since they look merely to the accomplishment and care not if the manner be noble or no.  Hence they find themselves doing everything at haphazard, good or its opposite, without distinction: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="181c"/> for this Love proceeds from the goddess who is far the younger of the two, and who in her origin partakes of both female and male.  But the other Love springs from the Heavenly goddess who, firstly, partakes not of the female but only of the male; and secondly, is the elder, untinged with wantonness:  wherefore those who are inspired by this Love betake them to the male, in fondness for what has the robuster nature and a larger share of mind.  Even in the passion for boys you may note the way of those who are under the single incitement of this Love: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="181d"/> they love boys only when they begin to acquire some mind—a growth associated with that of down on their chins.  For I conceive that those who begin to love them at this age are prepared to be always with them and share all with them as long as life shall last:  they will not take advantage of a boy’s green thoughtlessness to deceive him and make a mock of him by running straight off to another.  Against this love of boys a law should have been enacted, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="181e"/> to prevent the sad waste of attentions paid to an object so uncertain:  for who can tell where a boy will end at last, vicious or virtuous in body and soul?  Good men, however, voluntarily make this law for themselves, and it is a rule which those <q type="emph">popular</q> lovers ought to be forced to obey,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="182"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="182a"/> just as we force them, so far as we can, to refrain from loving our freeborn women.</said></said></p></div>

          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, it is easy to note the rule with regard to love in other cities:  there it is laid down in simple terms, while ours here is complicated.  For in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="182b"/> and <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and where there is no skill in speech they have simply an ordinance that it is seemly to gratify lovers, and no one whether young or old will call it shameful, in order, I suppose, to save themselves the trouble of trying what speech can do to persuade the youths; for they have no ability for speaking.  But in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> and many other regions where they live under foreign sway, it is counted a disgrace.  Foreigners hold this thing, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="182c"/> and all training in philosophy and sports, to be disgraceful, because of their despotic government; since, I presume, it is not to the interest of their princes to have lofty notions engendered in their subjects, or any strong friendships and communions; all of which Love is pre-eminently apt to create.  It is a lesson that our despots learnt by experience; for Aristogeiton’s love and Harmodius’s friendship grew to be so steadfast that it wrecked their power.  Thus where it was held a disgrace to gratify one’s lover, the tradition is due to the evil ways of those who made such a law—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="182d"/> that is, to the encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled.  But where it was accepted as honorable without any reserve, this was due to a sluggishness of mind in the law-makers.  In our city we have far better regulations, which, as I said, are not so easily grasped.</said></said></p></div>

            Consider, for instance, our saying that it is more honorable to love openly than in secret, especially when the beloved excels not so much in beauty as in nobility and virtue; and again, what a wonderful encouragement a lover gets from us all: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="182e"/> we have no thought of his doing anything unseemly, and success in his pursuit is counted honorable and failure disgraceful; and how in his endeavors for success our law leaves him a free hand for performing such admirable acts as may win him praise; while the same acts, if attempted for any other purpose
                 <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="183"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="183a"/> or effect to which one might be inclined, would bring one nothing in return but the sharpest reproach.  For suppose that with the view of gaining money from another, or some office, or any sort of influence, a man should allow himself to behave as lovers commonly do to their favorites—pressing their suit with supplications and entreaties, binding themselves with vows, sleeping on doorsteps, and submitting to such slavery as no slave would ever endure—both the friends and the enemies of such a man would hinder his behaving in such fashion; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="183b"/> for while the latter would reproach him with adulation and ill-breeding, the former would admonish him and feel ashamed of his conduct.  But in a lover all such doings only win him favor:  by free grant of our law he may behave thus without reproach, as compassing a most honorable end.  Strangest of all, he alone in the vulgar opinion has indulgence from the gods when he forsakes the vow he has sworn; for the vow of love-passion, they say, is no vow.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cf. Sophocles, fr. 694 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρκους δὲ μοιχῶν εἰς τέφραν ἐγὼ γράφω</foreign>, <gloss>the lecher’s vows in ashes I record.</gloss></note>  So true it is that both gods <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="183c"/> and men have given absolute licence to the lover, as our Athenian law provides.  Thus far, then, we have ground for supposing that here in our city both loving some one and showing affection to one’s lover are held in highest honor.  But it happens that fathers put tutors in charge of their boys when they are beloved, to prevent them from conversing with their lovers:  the tutor has strict injunctions on the matter, and when they observe a boy to be guilty of such a thing his playmates and fellows reproach him, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="183d"/> while his reproachers are not in their turn withheld or upbraided by their elders as speaking amiss; and from this it might rather be inferred that his behavior is held to be a great disgrace in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  Yet the truth of it, I think, is this:  the affair is no simple thing; you remember we said that by itself it was neither noble nor base, but that it was noble if nobly conducted, and base if basely.  To do the thing basely is to gratify a wicked man in a wicked manner: <q type="emph">nobly</q> means having to do with a good man in a noble manner.  By <q type="emph">wicked</q> we mean that popular lover, who craves the body rather than the soul: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="183e"/> as he is not in love with what abides, he himself is not abiding.

          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now our law has a sure and excellent test for the trial of these persons, showing which are to be favored and which to be shunned.  In the one case, accordingly, it encourages pursuit, but flight in the other, applying ordeals and tests in each case, whereby we are able to rank the lover and the beloved on this side or on that.  And so it is for this reason that our convention regards a quick capitulation as a disgrace:  for there ought, first, to be a certain interval—the generally approved touchstone—of time; and, second, it is disgraceful if the surrender is due to gold or public preferment, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="184b"/> or is a mere cowering away from the endurance of ill-treatment, or shows the youth not properly contemptuous of such benefits as he may receive in pelf or political success.  For in these there appears nothing steadfast or abiding, unless it be the impossibility of their producing a noble friendship.  One way remains in our custom whereby a favorite may rightly gratify his lover: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="184c"/> it is our rule that, just as in the case of the lovers it was counted no flattery or scandal for them to be willingly and utterly enslaved to their favorites, so there is left one sort of voluntary thraldom which is not scandalous; I mean, in the cause of virtue.
           <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is our settled tradition that when a man freely devotes his service to another in the belief that his friend will make him better in point of wisdom, it may be, or in any of the other parts of virtue, this willing bondage also is no sort of baseness or flattery.  Let us compare the two rules—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="184d"/>one dealing with the passion for boys, and the other with the love of wisdom and all virtuous ways:  by this we shall see if we are to conclude it a good thing that a favorite should gratify his lover.  For when lover and favorite come together, each guided by his own rule—on the one side, of being justified in doing any service to the favorite who has obliged him, and on the other, of being justified in showing any attentions to the friend who makes him wise and good; the elder of his plenty contributing to intellectual <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="184e"/> and all other excellence, the younger in his paucity acquiring education and all learned arts:  only then, at the meeting of these two principles in one place, only then and there, and in no other case, can it befall that a favorite may honorably indulge his lover.  To have such hopes deceived is no disgrace; while those of any other sort must be disgraceful, whether deceived or not.</said></said></p></div>

By the same token, when a youth gratifies a friend, supposing him to be a good man and expecting to be made better himself as a result of his lover’s affection, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="185b"/> and then finds he is deceived, since his friend proves to be vile and destitute of virtue; even so the deception is honorable.  For this youth is also held to have discovered his nature, by showing that he would make anyone the object of his utmost ardor for the sake of virtuous improvement; and this by contrast is supremely honorable.  Thus by all means it is right to bestow this favor for the sake of virtue.
             <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This is the Love that belongs to the Heavenly Goddess, heavenly itself and precious to both public and private life:  for this compels lover and beloved alike <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="185c"/> to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue.

                <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
                 Then Eryximachus spoke as follows:  
                 <said who="#Eryximachus" direct="false">Well then, since Pausanias did not properly finish off 
               <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="186"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="186a"/> the speech he began so well, I must do my best to append a conclusion thereto.  His division of Love into two sorts appears to me a good one:  but medicine, our great mystery, has taught me to observe that Love is not merely an impulse of human souls towards beautiful men but the attraction of all creatures to a great variety of things, which works in the bodies of all animals and all growths upon the earth, and practically in everything that is; and I have learnt <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="186b"/> how mighty and wonderful and universal is the sway of this god over all affairs both human and divine. <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This cosmic theory was derived from Empedocles, who spoke of Love as the combining, and Strife as the disruptive, force pervading the universe.</note>  Reverence for my profession prompts me to begin with the witness of medicine.  This double Love belongs to the nature of all bodies:  for between bodily health and sickness there is an admitted difference or dissimilarity, and what is dissimilar craves and loves dissimilar things.  Hence the desire felt by a sound body is quite other than that of a sickly one.  Now I agree with what Pausanias was just saying, that it is right to gratify <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="186c"/> good men, base to gratify the dissolute:  similarly, in treating actual bodies it is right and necessary to gratify the good and healthy elements of each, and this is what we term the physician’s skill; but it is a disgrace to do aught but disappoint the bad and sickly parts, if one aims at being an adept.  For the art of medicine may be summarily described as a knowledge of the love-matters of the body in regard to repletion and evacuation; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="186d"/> and the master-physician is he who can distinguish there between the nobler and baser Loves, and can effect such alteration that the one passion is replaced by the other; and he will be deemed a good practitioner who is expert in producing Love where it ought to flourish but exists not, and in removing it from where it should not be.  Indeed he must be able to make friends and happy lovers of the keenest opponents in the body.  Now the most contrary qualities are most hostile to each other—cold and hot, bitter and sweet, dry and moist, and the rest of them.  It was by knowing how to foster <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="186e"/> love and unanimity in these that, as our two poets<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Aristophanes and Agathon.</note> here relate, and as I myself believe, our forefather Asclepius composed this science of ours.</said></said></p></div>
                     
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="187"> 
         <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge">  
         <said who="#Eryximachus" direct="false" rend="merge">And so not merely is all medicine governed, as I propound it, through the influence of this god, but likewise athletics and agriculture.
                    
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="187"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="187a"/> Music also, as is plain to any the least curious observer, is in the same sort of case:  perhaps Heracleitus intends as much by those perplexing words,  <quote>The One at variance with itself is drawn together, like harmony of bow or lyre.</quote><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Heracl. fr. (Bywater).  The universe is held together by the strain of opposing forces, just as the right use of bow or lyre depends on opposite tension.</note>  Now it is perfectly absurd to speak of a harmony at variance, or as formed from things still varying.  Perhaps he meant, however, that <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="187b"/> from the grave and acute which were varying before, but which afterwards came to agreement, the harmony was by musical art created.  For surely there can be no harmony of acute and grave while still at variance:  harmony is consonance, and consonance is a kind of agreement; and agreement of things varying, so long as they are at variance, is impossible.  On the other hand, when a thing varies with no disability of agreement, then it may be harmonized; just as rhythm <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="187c"/> is produced by fast and slow, which in the beginning were at variance but later came to agree.  In all these cases the agreement is brought about by music which, like medicine in the former instance, introduces a mutual love and unanimity.  Hence in its turn music is found to be a knowledge of love-matters relating to harmony and rhythm.  In the actual system of harmony or rhythm we can easily distinguish these love-matters; as yet the double Love is absent:  but when we come to the application <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="187d"/> of rhythm and harmony to social life, whether we construct what are called <q type="emph">melodies</q> or render correctly, by what is known as <q type="emph">training,</q> tunes and measures already constructed, we find here a certain difficulty and require a good craftsman.  Round comes the same conclusion:  well-ordered men, and the less regular only so as to bring them to better order, should be indulged in this Love, and this is the sort we should preserve; this is the noble, the Heavenly Love, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="187e"/> sprung from the Heavenly Muse.  But the Popular Love comes from the Queen of Various Song; in applying him we must proceed with all caution, that no debauchery be implanted with the reaping of his pleasure, just as in our craft we set high importance on a right use of the appetite for dainties of the table, that we may cull the pleasure without disease.</said></said></p></div>

             <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Note how even the system of the yearly seasons is full of these two forces; how the qualities I mentioned just now, heat and cold, drought and moisture, when brought together by the orderly Love, and taking on a temperate harmony as they mingle, become bearers of ripe fertility and health to men and animals and plants, and are guilty of no wrong.  But when the wanton-spirited Love gains the ascendant in the seasons of the year, great destruction <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="188b"/> and wrong does he wreak.  For at these junctures are wont to arise pestilences and many other varieties of disease in beasts and herbs; likewise hoar-frosts, hails, and mildews, which spring from mutual encroachments and disturbances in such love-connections as are studied in relation to the motions of the stars and the yearly seasons by what we term astronomy.  So further, all sacrifices and ceremonies controlled by divination, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="188c"/> namely, all means of communion between gods and men, are only concerned with either the preservation or the cure of Love.  For impiety is usually in each case the result of refusing to gratify the orderly Love or to honor and prefer him in all our affairs, and of yielding to the other in questions of duty towards one’s parents whether alive or dead, and also towards the gods.  To divination is appointed the task of supervising and treating the health of these Loves; wherefore that art, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="188d"/> as knowing what human love-affairs will lead to seemliness and pious observance, is indeed a purveyor of friendship betwixt gods and men.
               <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus Love, conceived as a single whole, exerts a wide, a strong, nay, in short, a complete power:  but that which is consummated for a good purpose, temperately and justly, both here on earth and in heaven above, wields the mightiest power of all and provides us with a perfect bliss; so that we are able to consort with one another and have friendship with the gods who are above us. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="188e"/> It may well be that with the best will in the world I have omitted many points in the praise I owe to Love; but any gaps which I may have left it is your business, Aristophanes, to fill:  or if you intend some different manner of glorifying the god, let us hear your eulogy, for you have stopped your hiccough now.</said></said></p></div>

For in my opinion humanity has entirely failed to perceive the power of Love:  if men did perceive it, they would have provided him with splendid temples and altars, and would splendidly honor him with sacrifice; whereas we see none of these things done for him, though they are especially his due. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="189d"/> He of all gods is most friendly to men; he succors mankind and heals those ills whose cure must be the highest happiness of the human race.  Hence I shall try and introduce you to his power, that you may transmit this teaching to the world at large.  You must begin your lesson with the nature of man and its development.  For our original nature was by no means the same as it is now.  In the first place, there were three kinds of human beings, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="189e"/> not merely the two sexes, male and female, as at present:  there was a third kind as well, which had equal shares of the other two, and whose name survives though, the thing itself has vanished.  For <q type="emph">man-woman</q> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. <q type="emph">hermaphrodite</q>; cf. Lucret. v. 837ff.</note> was then a unity in form no less than name, composed of both sexes and sharing equally in male and female; whereas now it has come to be merely a name of reproach.</said></said></p></div>

              <said who="#Aristophanes" direct="false" rend="merge">Secondly, the form of each person was round all over, with back and sides encompassing it every way; each had four arms, and legs to match these, and two faces perfectly alike
                     
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="190"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="190a"/> on a cylindrical neck.  There was one head to the two faces, which looked opposite ways; there were four ears, two privy members, and all the other parts, as may be imagined, in proportion.  The creature walked upright as now, in either direction as it pleased and whenever it started running fast, it went like our acrobats, whirling over and over with legs stuck out straight; only then they had eight limbs to support and speed them <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="190b"/> swiftly round and round.  The number and features of these three sexes were owing to the fact that the male was originally the offspring of the sun, and the female of the earth; while that which partook of both sexes was born of the moon, for the moon also partakes of both.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The double sex of the moon is mentioned in an Orphic hymn (ix. 4): cf. Macrob. iii. 8.</note>  They were globular in their shape as in their progress, since they took after their parents.  Now, they were of surprising strength and vigor, and so lofty in their notions that they even conspired against the gods; and the same story is told of them as Homer relates of <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="190c"/> Ephialtes and Otus, <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

         <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thereat Zeus and the other gods debated what they should do, and were perplexed:  for they felt they could not slay them like the Giants, whom they had abolished root and branch with strokes of thunder—it would be only abolishing the honors and observances they had from men; nor yet could they endure such sinful rioting.  Then Zeus, putting all his wits together, spoke at length and said:  <q type="spoken">Methinks I can contrive that men, without ceasing to exist, shall give over their iniquity through a lessening of their strength. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="190d"/> I propose now to slice every one of them in two, so that while making them weaker we shall find them more useful by reason of their multiplication; and they shall walk erect upon two legs.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="191"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="191a"/> For the rest, he smoothed away most of the puckers and figured out the breast with some such instrument as shoemakers use in smoothing the wrinkles of leather on the last; though he left there a few which we have just about the belly and navel, to remind us of our early fall.  Now when our first form had been cut in two, each half in longing for its fellow would come to it again; and then would they fling their arms about each other and in mutual embraces <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="191b"/> yearn to be grafted together, till they began to perish of hunger and general indolence, through refusing to do anything apart.  And whenever on the death of one half the other was left alone, it went searching and embracing to see if it might happen on that half of the whole woman which now we call a woman, or perchance the half of the whole man.  In this plight they were perishing away, when Zeus in his pity provided a fresh device.  He moved their privy parts to the front—for until then they had these, like all else, on the outside, and did their begetting and bringing forth not on each other but on the earth, like the crickets.  These parts he now shifted to the front, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="191c"/> to be used for propagating on each other—in the female member by means of the male; so that if in their embracements a man should happen on a woman there might be conception and continuation of their kind; and also, if male met with male they might have satiety of their union and a relief, and so might turn their hands to their labors and their interest to ordinary life.  Thus anciently is mutual love ingrained <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="191d"/> in mankind, reassembling our early estate and endeavoring to combine two in one and heal the human sore.

Some say they are shameless creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come to man’s estate <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="192b"/> they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children, but only do these things under stress of custom; they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.

Well, when one of them—whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="192c"/>happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be induced to leave each other’s side for a single moment.

No one could imagine this to be the mere amorous connection, or that such alone could be the reason why each rejoices in the other’s company with so eager a zest:  obviously the soul of each is wishing for something else that it cannot express, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="192d"/> only divining and darkly hinting what it wishes.

Bethink yourselves if this is your heart’s desire, and if you will be quite contented with this lot.</q>  No one on hearing this, we are sure, would demur to it or would be found wishing for anything else:  each would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time, namely, to be so joined and fused with his beloved that the two might be made one.</said></said></p></div>

                  <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I propose first to speak of the plan most proper for my speaking, and after that to speak.  Every one of the previous speakers, instead of eulogizing the god, has merely, as it seems to me, felicitated humanity on the benefits he bestows:  not one of them has told us what is the nature 
                  <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="195"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="195a"/> of the benefactor himself.  There is but one correct method of giving anyone any kind of praise, namely to make the words unfold the character of him, and of the blessings brought by him, who is to be our theme.  Hence it is meet that we praise him first for what he is and then for what he gives.
                <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So I say that, while all gods are blissful, Love—with no irreverence or offence be it spoken—is the most blissful, as being the most beautiful and the best.  How most beautiful, I will explain.  First of all, Phaedrus, he is youngest of the gods.  He himself supplies <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="195b"/> clear evidence of this; for he flies and flees from old age—a swift thing obviously, since it gains on us too quickly for our liking.  Love hates it by nature, and refuses to come within any distance of it.  He is ever consorting with the young, and such also is he:  well says the old saw, <q type="spoken">Like and like together strike.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">So <bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.218">Hom. Od. 17.218</bibl>  <quote>Heaven ever bringeth like and like together.</quote></note>  And though in much else I agree with Phaedrus, in this I agree not, that Love by his account is more ancient than Cronos and Iapetus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">These two Titans, the sons of Heaven and Earth, were proverbially the original inhabitants of the world</note>: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="195c"/> I say he is youngest of the gods and ever young, while those early dealings with the gods which Hesiod <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hes. Th. 176">Hes. Th. 176ff</bibl>., <bibl n="Hes. Th. 746">Hes. Th. 746ff</bibl>.  There are no such stories in the remaining fragments of Parmenides.</note> and Parmenides relate, I take to have been the work of Necessity, not of Love, if there is any truth in those stories.  For there would have been no gelding or fettering of each other, nor any of those various violences, if Love had been amongst them; rather only amity and peace, such as now subsist ever since Love has reigned over the gods.  So then he is young, and delicate withal:  he requires a poet such as Homer to set forth his delicacy divine. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="195d"/> Homer it is who tells of Ate as both divine and delicate; you recollect those delicate feet of hers, where he says—<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Yet delicate are her feet, for on the ground</l><l>She speeds not, only on the heads of men.</l></quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 19.92">Hom. Il. 19.92-93</bibl></note> So I hold it convincing proof of her delicacy that she goes not on hard things but on soft. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="195e"/> The same method will serve us to prove the delicacy of Love.  Not upon earth goes he, nor on our crowns, which are not very soft; <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Perhaps here he smiles at or touches the bald head of Socrates.</note> but takes his way and abode in the softest things that exist.  The tempers and souls of gods and men are his chosen habitation:  not indeed any soul as much as another; when he comes upon one whose temper is hard, away he goes, but if it be soft, he makes his dwelling there.</said></said></p></div>

         <p><said who="#Apollodorus" rend="merge">

          <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="196"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="196a"/> he needs must be most delicate.  Youngest, then, and most delicate is he, and withal pliant of form:  for he would never contrive to fold himself about us every way, nor begin by stealing in and out of every soul so secretly, if he were hard.  Clear evidence of his fit proportion and pliancy of form is found in his shapely grace, a quality wherein Love is in every quarter allowed to excel:  unshapeliness and Love are ever at war with one another.  Beauty of hue in this god <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="196b"/> is evinced by his seeking his food among flowers:  for Love will not settle on body or soul or aught else that is flowerless or whose flower has faded away; while he has only to light on a plot of sweet blossoms and scents to settle there and stay.
          <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Enough has now been said, though much remains unsaid, of the beauty of our god; next shall Love’s goodness be my theme.  The strongest plea for this is that neither to a god he gives nor from a god receives any injury, nor from men receives it nor to men gives it.  For neither is the usage he himself gets a violent usage, since violence <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="196c"/> takes not hold of Love; nor is there violence in his dealings, since Love wins all men’s willing service; and agreements on both sides willingly made are held to be just by <quote type="prose">our city’s sovereign, the law.</quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Quoted from Alcidamas, a stylist of the school of Gorgias; <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 3.3">Aristot. Rh. 3.1406a</bibl>.</note>  Then, over and above his justice, he is richly endowed with temperance.  We all agree that temperance is a control of pleasures and desires, while no pleasure is stronger than Love:  if they are the weaker, they must be under Love’s control, and he is their controller; so that Love, by controlling pleasures and desires, must be eminently temperate.  And observe how in valor <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="196d"/> <quote>not even the God of War withstands</quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> <bibl>Soph. Thyest. Fr. 235</bibl> <quote>Necessity, whom not the God of War withstands.</quote></note> him; for we hear, not of Love caught by Ares, but of Ares caught by Love—of Aphrodite.  The captor is stronger than the caught; and as he controls what is braver than any other, he must be bravest of all.  So much for justice and temperance and valor in the god:  it remains to speak of skill; and here I must try my best to be adequate.  First, if I in turn may dignify our craft as Eryximachus did his, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="196e"/> the god is a composer so accomplished that he is a cause of composing in others:  every one, you know, becomes a poet, <quote>though alien to the Muse before,</quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl>Eur. Sthen. Fr. 663</bibl></note> when Love gets hold of him.  This we may fitly take for a testimony that Love is a poet well skilled—I speak summarily—in all composing that has to do with music;
                     <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="197"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="197a"/> for whatever we have not or know not we can neither give to another nor teach our neighbor.</said></said></p></div>

             <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At the end of Agathon’s speech, as Aristodemus told me, there was tumultuous applause from all present, at hearing the youngster speak in terms so appropriate to himself and to the god.  Then Socrates, with a glance at Eryximachus, said:  <q type="spoken">Son of Acumenus, do you really call it an unfearful fear that has all this while affrighted me, and myself no prophet in saying just now that Agathon would make a marvellous speech, and I be hard put to it?</q>
             <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">In one part of your statement, that he would speak finely,</q> replied Eryximachus, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="198b"/> <q type="spoken">I think you were a true prophet; but as to your being hard put to it, I do not agree.</q>

The greater part of it was not so very astounding; but when we drew towards the close, the beauty of the words and phrases could not but take one’s breath away.  For myself, indeed, I was so conscious that I should fail to say anything <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="198c"/> half as fine, that for very shame I was on the point of slinking away, had I had any chance.  For his speech so reminded me of Gorgias that I was exactly in the plight described by Homer: <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.632">Hom.

Agathon has just displayed his addiction to the elegant rhetoric of Gorgias.</note>  I feared that Agathon in his final phrases would confront me with the eloquent Gorgias’ head, and by opposing his speech to mine would turn me thus dumbfounded into stone.  And so in that moment I realized what a ridiculous fool I was to fall in with your proposal that I should take my turn in your eulogies of Love, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="198d"/> and to call myself an expert in love-matters, when really I was ignorant of the method in which eulogies ought to be made at all.  For I was such a silly wretch as to think that one ought in each case to speak the truth about the person eulogized; on this assumption I hoped we might pick out the fairest of the facts and set these forth in their comeliest guise.  I was quite elated with the notion of what a fine speech I should make, for I felt that I knew the truth.  But now, it appears that this is not what is meant by a good speech of praise; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="198e"/> which is rather an ascription of all the highest and fairest qualities, whether the case be so or not; it is really no matter if they are untrue.  Our arrangement, it seems, was that each should appear to eulogize Love, not that he should make a real eulogy.</q></said></p></div>

Well, I also had my lesson from her in love-matters; so now I will try and follow up the points on which Agathon and I have just agreed by narrating to you all on my own account, as well as I am able, the speech she delivered to me.  So first, Agathon, I must unfold, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="201e"/> in your manner of exposition, who and what sort of being is Love, and then I shall tell of his works.  The readiest way, I think, will be to give my description that form of question and answer which the stranger woman used for hers that day.  For I spoke to her in much the same terms as Agathon addressed just now to me, saying Love was a great god, and was of beautiful things; and she refuted me with the very arguments I have brought against our young friend, showing that by my account that god was neither beautiful nor good.

            <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">From what father and mother sprung?</q> I asked.
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="203b"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">That is rather a long story,</q> she replied; <q type="spoken">but still, I will tell it you.  When Aphrodite was born, the gods made a great feast, and among the company was Resource the son of Cunning.  And when they had banqueted there came Poverty abegging, as well she might in an hour of good cheer, and hung about the door.  Now Resource, grown tipsy with nectar—for wine as yet there was none—went into the garden of Zeus, and there, overcome with heaviness, slept.  Then Poverty, being of herself so resourceless, devised the scheme of having a child by Resource, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="203c"/> and lying down by his side she conceived Love.  Hence it is that Love from the beginning has been attendant and minister to Aphrodite, since he was begotten on the day of her birth, and is, moreover, by nature a lover bent on beauty since Aphrodite is beautiful.  Now, as the son of Resource and Poverty, Love is in a peculiar case.  First, he is ever poor, and far from tender or beautiful as most suppose him: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="203d"/> rather is he hard and parched, shoeless and homeless; on the bare ground always he lies with no bedding, and takes his rest on doorsteps and waysides in the open air; true to his mother’s nature, he ever dwells with want.  But he takes after his father in scheming for all that is beautiful and good; for he is brave, strenuous and high-strung, a famous hunter, always weaving some stratagem; desirous and competent of wisdom, throughout life ensuing the truth; a master of jugglery, witchcraft, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="203e"/> >and artful speech.  By birth neither immortal nor mortal, in the selfsame day he is flourishing and alive at the hour when he is abounding in resource; at another he is dying, and then reviving again by force of his father’s nature:  yet the resources that he gets will ever be ebbing away; so that Love is at no time either resourceless or wealthy, and furthermore, he stands midway betwixt wisdom and ignorance.</q></said></said></p></div>

         The position is this:  no gods ensue wisdom or desire to be made wise;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="204"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="204a"/> such they are already; nor does anyone else that is wise ensue it.  Neither do the ignorant ensue wisdom, nor desire to be made wise:  in this very point is ignorance distressing, when a person who is not comely or worthy or intelligent is satisfied with himself.

              <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Why, a child could tell by this time,</q> she answered, <q type="spoken">that they are the intermediate sort, and amongst these also is Love.  For wisdom has to do with the fairest things, and Love is a love directed to what is fair; so that Love must needs be a friend of wisdom, and, as such, must be between wise and ignorant.  This again is a result for which he has to thank his origin:  for while he comes of a wise and resourceful father, his mother is unwise and resourceless.  Such, my good Socrates, is the nature of this spirit.  That you should have formed your other notion of Love <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="204c"/> is no surprising accident.  You supposed, if I am to take your own words as evidence, that the beloved and not the lover was Love.  This led you, I fancy, to hold that Love is all-beautiful.

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Well, I will tell you,</q> said she; <q type="spoken">it is begetting on a beautiful thing by means of both the body and the soul.</q>

                     <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Let me put it more clearly,</q> she said.  <q type="spoken">All men are pregnant, Socrates, both in body and in soul:  on reaching a certain age our nature yearns to beget.  This it cannot do upon an ugly person, but only on the beautiful:  the conjunction of man and woman is a begetting for both. <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The argument requires the application of <q type="emph">begetting</q> and other such terms indifferently to either sex.</note>  It is a divine affair, this engendering and bringing to birth, an immortal element in the creature that is mortal; and it cannot occur in the discordant. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="206d"/> The ugly is discordant with whatever is divine, whereas the beautiful is accordant.  Thus Beauty presides over birth as Fate and Lady of Travail; and hence it is that when the pregnant approaches the beautiful it becomes not only gracious but so exhilarate, that it flows over with begetting and bringing forth; though when it meets the ugly it coils itself close in a sullen dismay:  rebuffed and repressed, it brings not forth, but goes in labor with the burden of its young.  Therefore when a person is big and teeming-ripe <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="206e"/> he feels himself in a sore flutter for the beautiful, because its possessor can relieve him of his heavy pangs.  For you are wrong, Socrates, in supposing that love is of the beautiful.</q>
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">What then is it?</q>
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">It is of engendering and begetting upon the beautiful.</q>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="207"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="207a"/> From what has been admitted, we needs must yearn for immortality no less than for good, since love loves good to be one’s own for ever.  And hence it necessarily follows that love is of immortality.</q>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>All this instruction did I get from her at various times when she discoursed of love-matters; and one time she asked me, <q type="spoken">What do you suppose, Socrates, to be the cause of this love and desire?  For you must have observed the strange state into which all the animals are thrown, whether going on earth or winging the air, when they desire to beget:  they are all sick <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="207b"/> and amorously disposed, first to have union one with another, and next to find food for the new-born; in whose behalf they are ready to fight hard battles, even the weakest against the strongest, and to sacrifice their lives; to be racked with starvation themselves if they can but nurture their young, and be put to any sort of shift.  As for men,</q> said she, <q type="spoken">one might suppose they do these things on the promptings of reason; but what is the cause <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="207c"/> of this amorous condition in the animals?  Can you tell me?</q>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Once more I replied that I did not know; so she proceeded:  <q type="spoken">How do you design ever to become a master of love-matters, if you can form no notion of this?</q>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Why, it is just for this, I tell you, Diotima—as I stated a moment ago—that I have come to see you, because I noted my need of an instructor.  Come, tell me the cause of these effects as well as of the others that have relation to love.</q>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Well then,</q> she said, <q type="spoken">if you believe that love is by nature bent on what we have repeatedly admitted, you may cease to wonder.  For here, too, on the same principle as before, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="207d"/> the mortal nature ever seeks, as best it can, to be immortal.  In one way only can it succeed, and that is by generation; since so it can always leave behind it a new creature in place of the old.  It is only for a while that each live thing can be described as alive and the same, as a man is said to be the same person from childhood until he is advanced in years:  yet though he is called the same he does not at any time possess the same properties; he is continually becoming a new person, and there are things also which he loses, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="207e"/> as appears by his hair, his flesh, his bones, and his blood and body altogether.  And observe that not only in his body but in his soul besides we find none of his manners or habits, his opinions, desires, pleasures, pains or fears, ever abiding the same in his particular self; some things grow in him, while others perish.</q></said></said></p></div>

          <q type="spoken" rend="merge">And here is a yet stranger fact:
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="208"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="208a"/> with regard to the possessions of knowledge, not merely do some of them grow and others perish in us, so that neither in what we know are we ever the same persons; but a like fate attends each single sort of knowledge.  What we call <q type="emph">conning</q> implies that our knowledge is departing; since forgetfulness is an egress of knowledge, while conning substitutes a fresh one in place of that which departs, and so preserves our knowledge enough to make it seem the same.  Every mortal thing is preserved in this way; not by keeping it exactly the same for ever, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="208b"/> like the divine, but by replacing what goes off or is antiquated with something fresh, in the semblance of the original.  Through this device, Socrates, a mortal thing partakes of immortality, both in its body and in all other respects; by no other means can it be done.  So do not wonder if everything naturally values its own offshoot; since all are beset by this eagerness and this love with a view to immortality.</q>
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On hearing this argument I wondered, and said: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="208c"/> <q type="spoken">Really, can this in truth be so, most wise Diotima?</q>
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Whereat she, like the professors in their glory:  <q type="spoken">Be certain of it, Socrates; only glance at the ambition of the men around you, and you will have to wonder at the unreasonableness of what I have told you, unless you are careful to consider how singularly they are affected with the love of winning a name, <q type="spoken">and laying up fame immortal for all time to come.</q> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Diotima, like Agathon, breaks into verse of her own composing.</note>  For this, even more than for their children, they are ready to run all risks, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="208d"/> to expend money, perform any kind of task, and sacrifice their lives.  Do you suppose,</q> she asked, <q type="spoken">that Alcestis would have died for Admetus, or Achilles have sought death on the corpse of Patroclus, or your own Codrus <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A legendary king of Athens who exposed his life because an oracle had said that the Dorian invaders would conquer if they did not slay the Athenian king.</note> have welcomed it to save the children of his queen, if they had not expected to win <q type="spoken">a deathless memory for valor,</q> which now we keep?  Of course not.  I hold it is for immortal distinction and <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="208e"/> for such illustrious renown as this that they all do all they can, and so much the more in proportion to their excellence.  They are in love with what is immortal.</q></said></said></p></div>

            <q type="spoken" rend="merge">Now those who are teeming in body betake them rather to women, and are amorous on this wise:  by getting children they acquire an immortality, a memorial, and a state of bliss, which in their imagining they <q type="spoken">for all succeeding time procure.</q>
   <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="209"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="209a"/> But pregnancy of soul—for there are persons,</q> she declared, <q type="spoken">who in their souls still more than in their bodies conceive those things which are proper for soul to conceive and bring forth; and what are those things?  Prudence, and virtue in general; and of these the begetters are all the poets and those craftsmen who are styled <q type="emph">inventors.</q>  Now by far the highest and fairest part of prudence is that which concerns the regulation of cities and habitations; it is called sobriety <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="209b"/> and justice.  So when a man’s soul is so far divine that it is made pregnant with these from his youth, and on attaining manhood immediately desires to bring forth and beget, he too, I imagine, goes about seeking the beautiful object whereon he may do his begetting, since he will never beget upon the ugly.  Hence it is the beautiful rather than the ugly bodies that he welcomes in his pregnancy, and if he chances also on a soul that is fair and noble and well-endowed, he gladly cherishes the two combined in one; and straightway in addressing such a person he is resourceful in discoursing of virtue and of what should be <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="209c"/> the good man’s character and what his pursuits; and so he takes in hand the other’s education.  For I hold that by contact with the fair one and by consorting with him he bears and brings forth his long-felt conception, because in presence or absence he remembers his fair.  Equally too with him he shares the nurturing of what is begotten, so that men in this condition enjoy a far fuller community with each other than that which comes with children, and a far surer friendship, since the children of their union are fairer and more deathless.  Every one would choose to have got children such as these rather than the human sort—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="209d"/>merely from turning a glance upon Homer and Hesiod and all the other good poets, and envying the fine offspring they leave behind to procure them a glory immortally renewed in the memory of men.

However I will speak of them,</q> she said, <q type="spoken">and will not stint my best endeavors; only you on your part must try your best to follow.  He who would proceed rightly in this business must not merely begin from his youth to encounter beautiful bodies.  In the first place, indeed, if his conductor guides him aright, he must be in love with one particular body, and engender beautiful converse therein; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="210b"/> but next he must remark how the beauty attached to this or that body is cognate to that which is attached to any other, and that if he means to ensue beauty in form, it is gross folly not to regard as one and the same the beauty belonging to all; and so, having grasped this truth, he must make himself a lover of all beautiful bodies, and slacken the stress of his feeling for one by contemning it and counting it a trifle.  But his next advance will be to set a higher value on the beauty of souls than on that of the body, so that however little the grace that may bloom in any likely soul <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="210c"/> it shall suffice him for loving and caring, and for bringing forth and soliciting such converse as will tend to the betterment of the young; and that finally he may be constrained to contemplate the beautiful as appearing in our observances and our laws, and to behold it all bound together in kinship and so estimate the body’s beauty as a slight affair.  From observances he should be led on to the branches of knowledge, that there also he may behold a province of beauty, and by looking thus on beauty in the mass may escape from the mean, meticulous slavery of a single instance, where he must center all his care, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="210d"/> like a lackey, upon the beauty of a particular child or man or single observance; and turning rather towards the main ocean of the beautiful may by contemplation of this bring forth in all their splendor many fair fruits of discourse and meditation in a plenteous crop of philosophy; until with the strength and increase there acquired he descries a certain single knowledge connected with a beauty which has yet to be told.

         <q type="spoken" rend="merge">When a man has been thus far tutored in the lore of love, passing from view to view of beautiful things, in the right and regular ascent, suddenly he will have revealed to him, as he draws to the close of his dealings in love, a wondrous vision, beautiful in its nature; and this, Socrates, is the final object of all those previous toils.  First of all, it is ever-existent

       <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="211"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="211a"/> and neither comes to be nor perishes, neither waxes nor wanes; next, it is not beautiful in part and in part ugly, nor is it such at such a time and other at another, nor in one respect beautiful and in another ugly, nor so affected by position as to seem beautiful to some and ugly to others.  Nor again will our initiate find the beautiful presented to him in the guise of a face or of hands or any other portion of the body, nor as a particular description or piece of knowledge, nor as existing somewhere in another substance, such as an animal or <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="211b"/> the earth or sky or any other thing; but existing ever in singularity of form independent by itself, while all the multitude of beautiful things partake of it in such wise that, though all of them are coming to be and perishing, it grows neither greater nor less, and is affected by nothing.  So when a man by the right method of boy-loving ascends from these particulars and begins to descry that beauty, he is almost able to lay hold of the final secret.  Such is the right approach <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="211c"/> or induction to love-matters.  Beginning from obvious beauties he must for the sake of that highest beauty be ever climbing aloft, as on the rungs of a ladder, from one to two, and from two to all beautiful bodies; from personal beauty he proceeds to beautiful observances, from observance to beautiful learning, and from learning at last to that particular study which is concerned with the beautiful itself and that alone; so that in the end he comes to know <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="211d"/> the very essence of beauty.  In that state of life above all others, my dear Socrates,</q> said the Mantinean woman, <q type="spoken">a man finds it truly worth while to live, as he contemplates essential beauty.  This, when once beheld, will outshine your gold and your vesture, your beautiful boys and striplings, whose aspect now so astounds you and makes you and many another, at the sight and constant society of your darlings, ready to do without either food or drink if that were any way possible, and only gaze upon them and have their company. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="211e"/> But tell me, what would happen if one of you had the fortune to look upon essential beauty entire, pure and unalloyed; not infected with the flesh and color of humanity, and ever so much more of mortal trash?

    <label>Alcibiades’ praise of Socrates</label>
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>
   <said who="#Alcibiades" direct="false">The way I shall take, gentlemen, in my praise of Socrates, is by similitudes.  Probably he will think I do this for derision; but I choose my similitude for the sake of truth, not of ridicule.  For I say <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="215b"/> he is likest to the Silenus-figures that sit in the statuaries’ shops; those, I mean, which our craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their hands:  when their two halves are pulled open, they are found to contain images of gods.  And I further suggest that he resembles the satyr Marsyas.  Now, as to your likeness, Socrates, to these in figure, I do not suppose even you yourself will dispute it; but I have next to tell you that you are like them in every other respect.  You are a fleering fellow, eh?  If you will not confess it, I have witnesses at hand.  Are you not a piper? <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="215c"/> Why, yes, and a far more marvellous one than the satyr.  His lips indeed had power to entrance mankind by means of instruments; a thing still possible today for anyone who can pipe his tunes:  for the music of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>’ flute belonged, I may tell you, to Marsyas his teacher.  So that if anyone, whether a fine flute-player or paltry flute-girl, can but flute his tunes, they have no equal for exciting a ravishment, and will indicate by the divinity that is in them who are apt recipients of the deities and their sanctifications.  You differ from him in one point only—that you produce the same effect with simple prose unaided by instruments.  For example, when we hear any other person—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="215d"/>quite an excellent orator, perhaps—pronouncing one of the usual discourses, no one, I venture to say, cares a jot; but so soon as we hear you, or your discourses in the mouth of another,—though such person be ever so poor a speaker, and whether the hearer be a woman or a man or a youngster—we are all astounded and entranced.  As for myself, gentlemen, were it not that I might appear to be absolutely tipsy, I would have affirmed on oath all the strange effects I personally have felt from his words, and still feel even now.  For when I hear him <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="215e"/> I am worse than any wild fanatic; I find my heart leaping and my tears gushing forth at the sound of his speech, and I see great numbers of other people having the same experience.  When I listened to Pericles and other skilled orators I thought them eloquent, but I never felt anything like this; my spirit was not left in a tumult and had not to complain of my being in the condition of a common slave:  whereas the influence of our Marsyas here has often thrown me into such a state
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="216"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="216a"/> that I thought my life not worth living on these terms.</said></said></p></div>

         <said who="#Alcibiades" direct="false" rend="merge">In all this, Socrates, there is nothing that you can call untrue.  Even now I am still conscious that if I consented to lend him my ear, I could not resist him, but would have the same feeling again.  For he compels me to admit that, sorely deficient as I am, I neglect myself while I attend to the affairs of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  So I withhold my ears perforce as from the Sirens, and make off as fast as I can, for fear I should go on sitting beside him till old age was upon me. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="216b"/> And there is one experience I have in presence of this man alone, such as nobody would expect in me; and that is, to be made to feel ashamed; he alone can make me feel it.  For he brings home to me that I cannot disown the duty of doing what he bids me, but that as soon as I turn from his company I fall a victim to the favors of the crowd.  So I take a runaway’s leave of him and flee away; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="216c"/> when I see him again I think of those former admissions, and am ashamed.  Often I could wish he had vanished from this world; yet again, should this befall, I am sure I should be more distressed than ever; so I cannot tell what to do with the fellow at all.
   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such then is the effect that our satyr can work upon me and many another with his piping; but let me tell you how like he is in other respects to the figures of my comparison, and what a wondrous power he wields.  I assure you, not one of you knows him; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="216d"/> well, I shall reveal him, now that I have begun.  Observe how Socrates is amorously inclined to handsome persons; with these he is always busy and enraptured.  Again, he is utterly stupid and ignorant, as he affects.  Is not this like a Silenus?  Exactly.  It is an outward casing he wears, similarly to the sculptured Silenus.  But if you opened his inside, you cannot imagine how full he is, good cup-companions, of sobriety.  I tell you, all the beauty a man may have is nothing to him; he despises it <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="216e"/> more than any of you can believe; nor does wealth attract him, nor any sort of honor that is the envied prize of the crowd.  All these possessions he counts as nothing worth, and all of us as nothing, I assure you; he spends his whole life in chaffing and making game of his fellow-men.</said></said></p></div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="217"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="217a"/> divine and golden, so perfectly fair and wondrous, that I simply had to do as Socrates bade me.  And believing he had a serious affection for my youthful bloom, I supposed I had here a godsend and a rare stroke of luck, thinking myself free at any time by gratifying his desires to hear all that our Socrates knew; for I was enormously proud of my youthful charms.  So with this design <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="217b"/> I dismissed the attendant whom till then I invariably brought to my meetings with Socrates, and I would go and meet him alone:  I am to tell you the whole truth; you must all mark my words, and, Socrates, you shall refute me if I lie.  Yes, gentlemen, I went and met him, and the two of us would be alone; and I thought he would seize the chance of talking to me as a lover does to his dear one in private, and I was glad.  But nothing of the sort occurred at all:  he would merely converse with me in his usual manner, and when he had spent the day with me he would leave me and go his way.  After that I proposed he should go with me to the trainer’s, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="217c"/> and I trained with him, expecting to gain my point there.  So he trained and wrestled with me many a time when no one was there.  The same story!  I got no further with the affair.  Then, as I made no progress that way, I resolved to charge full tilt at the man, and not to throw up the contest once I had entered upon it:  I felt I must clear up the situation.  Accordingly I invited him to dine with me, for all the world <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="217d"/> like a lover scheming to ensnare his favorite.  Even this he was backward to accept; however, he was eventually persuaded.  The first time he came, he wanted to leave as soon as he had dined.  On that occasion I was ashamed and let him go.  The second time I devised a scheme:  when we had dined I went on talking with him far into the night, and when he wanted to go I made a pretext of the lateness of the hour and constrained him to stay.  So he sought repose on the couch next to me, on which he had been sitting at dinner, and no one was sleeping in the room but ourselves.

Now I have been bitten by a more painful creature, in the most painful way that one can be bitten:  in my heart, or my soul, or whatever one is to call it, I am stricken and stung by his philosophic discourses, which adhere more fiercely than any adder when once they lay hold of a young and not ungifted soul, and force it to do or say whatever they will; I have only to look around me, and there is a Phaedrus, an Agathon, an Eryximachus, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="218b"/> a Pausanias, an Aristodemus, and an Aristophanes—I need not mention Socrates himself—and all the rest of them; every one of you has had his share of philosophic frenzy and transport, so all of you shall hear.

      <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well, after I had exchanged these words with him and, as it were, let fly my shafts, I fancied he felt the wound:  so up I got, and without suffering the man to say a word more I wrapped my own coat about him—it was winter-time; drew myself under his cloak, so; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="219c"/> wound my arms about this truly spiritual and miraculous creature; and lay thus all the night long.  Here too, Socrates, you are unable to give me the lie.  When I had done all this, he showed such superiority and contempt, laughing my youthful charms to scorn, and flouting the very thing on which I prided myself, gentlemen of the jury—for you are here to try Socrates for his lofty disdain:  you may be sure, by gods—and goddesses—that when I arose I had in no more particular sense slept a night <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="219d"/> with Socrates than if it had been with my father or my elder brother.

Of this power I expect we shall have a good test in a moment.  But it was in his endurance of winter—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="220b"/>in those parts the winters are awful—that I remember, among his many marvellous feats, how once there came a frost about as awful as can be:  we all preferred not to stir abroad, or if any of us did, we wrapped ourselves up with prodigious care, and after putting on our shoes we muffled up our feet with felt and little fleeces.

The troops were in utter disorder, and he was retreating along with Laches, when I chanced to come up with them and, as soon as I saw them, passed them the word to have no fear, saying I would not abandon them.  Here, indeed, I had an even finer view of Socrates than at Potidaea—for personally I had less reason for alarm, as I was mounted; and I noticed, first, how far he outdid Laches in collectedness, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="221b"/> and next I felt—to use a phrase of yours, Aristophanes—how there he stepped along, as his wont is in our streets, <quote>strutting like a proud marsh-goose, with ever a side-long glance,</quote> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Aristoph.

   <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There are many more quite wonderful things that one could find to praise in Socrates:  but although there would probably be as much to say about any other one of his habits, I select his unlikeness to anybody else, whether in the ancient or in the modern world, as calling for our greatest wonder.  You may take the character of Achilles and see his parallel in Brasidas or others; you may couple <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="221d"/> Nestor, Antenor, or others I might mention, with Pericles; and in the same order you may liken most great men; but with the odd qualities of this person, both in himself and in his conversation, you would not come anywhere near finding a comparison if you searched either among men of our day or among those of the past, unless perhaps you borrowed my words and matched him, not with any human being, but with the Silenuses and satyrs, in his person and his speech.

Besides, I take his sitting down between us two as an obvious attempt to draw us apart.  See, he shall not gain his point:  I will come and sit by your side.</q>

      <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="223b"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So Agathon was getting up in order to seat himself by Socrates, when suddenly a great crowd of revellers arrived at the door, which they found just opened for some one who was going out.  They marched straight into the party and seated themselves:  the whole place was in an uproar and, losing all order, they were forced to drink a vast amount of wine.  Then, as Aristodemus related, Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and some others took their leave and departed; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="223c"/> while he himself fell asleep, and slumbered a great while, for the nights were long.  He awoke towards dawn, as the cocks were crowing; and immediately he saw that all the company were either sleeping or gone, except Agathon, Aristophanes, and Socrates, who alone remained awake and were drinking out of a large vessel, from left to right; and Socrates was arguing with them.  As to most of the talk, Aristodemus had no recollection, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="223d"/> for he had missed the beginning and was also rather drowsy; but the substance of it was, he said, that Socrates was driving them to the admission that the same man could have the knowledge required for writing comedy and tragedy—that the fully skilled tragedian could be a comedian as well.  While they were being driven to this, and were but feebly following it, they began to nod; first Aristophanes dropped into a slumber, and then, as day began to dawn, Agathon also.  When Socrates had seen them comfortable, he rose and went away,—followed in the usual manner by my friend; on arriving at the Lyceum, he washed himself, and then spent the rest of the day in his ordinary fashion; and so, when the day was done, he went home for the evening and reposed.</said></p></div>
