<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="624"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="624a"/><label>Ath.</label> To whom do you ascribe the authorship of your legal arrangements, Strangers?  To a god or to some man?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> To a god, Stranger, most rightfully to a god.  We Cretans call Zeus our lawgiver; while in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where our friend here has his home, I believe they claim Apollo as theirs.  Is not that so, Megillus?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do you then, like Homer,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.178">Hom. Od. 19.178</bibl>.</note> say that
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="624b"/> Minos used to go every ninth year to hold converse with his father Zeus, and that he was guided by his divine oracles in laying down the laws for your cities?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="625">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So our people say.  And they say also that his brother Rhadamanthys,—no doubt you have heard the name,—was exceedingly just.  And certainly we Cretans
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="625"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="625a"/> would maintain that he won this title owing to his righteous administration of justice in those days.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, his renown is indeed glorious and well befitting a son of Zeus.  And, since you and our friend Megillus were both brought up in legal institutions of so noble a kind, you would, I imagine, have no aversion to our occupying ourselves as we go along in discussion on the subject of government and laws.  Certainly, as I am told, the road from Cnosus
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="625b"/> to the cave<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The grotto of Dicte on Mt. Ida.</note> and temple of Zeus is a long one, and we are sure to find, in this sultry weather, shady resting-places among the high trees along the road:  in them we can rest ofttimes, as befits our age, beguiling the time with discourse, and thus complete our journey in comfort.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True, Stranger;  and as one proceeds further one finds in the groves cypress-trees of wonderful height and beauty,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="625c"/> and meadows too, where we may rest ourselves and talk.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You say well.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, indeed:  and when we set eyes on them we shall say so still more emphatically.  So let us be going, and good luck attend us.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Amen!  And tell me now, for what reason did your law ordain the common meals you have, and your gymnastic schools and military equipment?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Our Cretan customs, Stranger, are, as I think, such as anyone may grasp easily.  As you may notice, <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, as a whole,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="625d"/> is not a level country, like <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>:  consequently, whereas the Thessalians mostly go on horseback, we Cretans are runners, since this land of ours is rugged and more suitable for the practice of foot-running.  Under these conditions we are obliged to have light armour for running and to avoid heavy equipment;  so bows and arrows are adopted as suitable because of their lightness.  Thus all these customs of ours are adapted for war, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="625e"/> and, in my opinion, this was the object which the lawgiver had in view when he ordained them all.  Probably this was his reason also for instituting common meals:  he saw how soldiers, all the time they are on campaign, are obliged by force of circumstances to mess in common, for the sake of their own security.  And herein, as I think, he condemned the stupidity of the mass of men in failing to perceive that all are involved ceaselessly in a lifelong war against all States.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="626">
<p><said who="#Clinias" rend="merge"><label>Clin.</label>If, then, these practices are necessary in war,—namely, messing in common for safety’s sake, and the appointment of relays of officers and privates to act as guards,—
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="626"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="626a"/> they must be carried out equally in time of peace.  For (as he would say) <q type="emph">peace,</q> as the term is commonly employed, is nothing more than a name, the truth being that every State is, by a law of nature, engaged perpetually in an informal war with every other State.  And if you look at the matter from this point of view you will find it practically true that our Cretan lawgiver ordained all our legal usages, both public and private, with an eye to war, and that he therefore charged us with the task of guarding our laws safely,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="626b"/> in the conviction that without victory in war nothing else, whether possession or institution, is of the least value, but all the goods of the vanquished fall into the hands of the victors.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Your training, Stranger, has certainly, as it seems to me, given you an excellent understanding of the legal practices of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>.  But tell me this more clearly still:  by the definition you have given of the well-constituted State
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="626c"/> you appear to me to imply that it ought to be organized in such a way as to be victorious in war over all other States.  Is that so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly it is;  and I think that our friend here shares my opinion.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> No Lacedaemonian, my good sir, could possibly say otherwise.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If this, then, is the right attitude for a State to adopt towards a State, is the right attitude for village towards village different?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is the same, you say?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, is the same attitude right also for one house in the village towards another, and for each man towards every other?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="626d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And must each individual man regard himself as his own enemy?  Or what do we say when we come to this point?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> O Stranger of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, for I should be loth to call you a man of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, since methinks you deserve rather to be named after the goddess Athena, seeing that you have made the argument more clear by taking it back again to its starting-point;  whereby you will the more easily discover the justice of our recent statement that, in the mass, all men are both publicly and privately the enemies of all, and individually also each man is his own enemy.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="626e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What is your meaning, my admirable sir?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is just in this war, my friend, that the victory over self is of all victories the first and best while self-defeat is of all defeats at once the worst and the most shameful.  For these phrases signify that a war against self exists within each of us.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl>Plat. Rep. 430e ff</bibl>.: <title>Proverbs</title> xiv 32.</note></said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="627">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now let us take the argument back in the reverse direction.  Seeing that individually each of us is partly superior to himself
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="627"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="627a"/> and partly inferior, are we to affirm that the same condition of things exists in house and village and State, or are we to deny it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Do you mean the condition of being partly self-superior and partly self-inferior?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That, too, is a proper question;  for such a condition does most certainly exist, and in States above all.  Every State in which the better class is victorious over the populace and the lower classes would rightly be termed <q type="emph">self-superior,</q> and would be praised most justly for a victory of this kind;  and conversely, when the reverse is the case.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="627b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, leaving aside the question as to whether the worse element is ever superior to the better (a question which would demand a more lengthy discussion), what you assert, as I now perceive, is this,—that sometimes citizens of one stock and of one State who are unjust and numerous may combine together and try to enslave by force those who are just but fewer in number, and wherever they prevail such a State would rightly be termed <q type="emph">self-inferior</q> and bad, but <q type="emph">self-superior</q> and good wherever they are worsted.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="627c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> This statement is indeed most extraordinary, Stranger;  none the less we cannot possibly reject it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Stay a moment:  here too is a case we must further consider.  Suppose there were a number of brothers, all sons of the same parents, it would not be at all surprising if most of them were unjust and but few just.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It would not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And, moreover, it would ill beseem you and me to go a-chasing after this form of expression, that if the bad ones conquered the whole of this family and house should be called <q type="emph">self-inferior,</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="627d"/> but <q type="emph">self-superior</q> if they were defeated;  for our present reference to the usage of ordinary speech is not concerned with the propriety or impropriety of verbal phrases but with the essential rightness or wrongness of laws.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> And finely spoken, too, up to this point, as I agree.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us also look at this point:  the brothers we have just described would have, I suppose, a judge?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Which of the two would be the better—a judge who destroyed
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="627e"/> all the wicked among them and charged the good to govern themselves, or one who made the good members govern and, while allowing the bad to live, made them submit willingly to be governed?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="628">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>And there is a third judge we must mention (third and best in point of merit),—if indeed such a judge can be found,—<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="628"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="628a"/> who in dealing with a single divided family will destroy none of them but reconcile them and succeed, by enacting laws for them, in securing amongst them thenceforward permanent friendliness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A judge and lawgiver of that kind would be by far the best.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But mark this:  his aim, in the laws he enacted for them, would be the opposite of war.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And what of him who brings the State into harmony?  In ordering its life would he have regard to external warfare
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="628b"/> rather than to the internal war, whenever it occurs, which goes by the name of <q type="emph">civil</q> strife?  For this is a war as to which it would be the desire of every man that, if possible, it should never occur in his own State, and that, if it did occur, it should come to as speedy an end as possible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Evidently he would have regard to civil war.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And would anyone prefer that the citizens should be obliged to devote their attention to external enemies after internal concord had been secured by the destruction of one section and the victory of their opponents rather than after the establishment of friendship and peace
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="628c"/> by terms of conciliation?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Everyone would prefer the latter alternative for his own State rather than the former.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And would not the lawgiver do the same?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Would not every lawgiver in all his legislation aim at the highest good?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Assuredly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The highest good, however, is neither war nor civil strife—which things we should pray rather to be saved from—but peace one with another and friendly feeling.  Moreover, it would seem that the victory
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="628d"/> we mentioned of a State over itself is not one of the best things but one of those which are necessary.  For imagine a man supposing that a human body was best off when it was sick and aged with physic, while never giving a thought to the case of the body that needs no physic at all!  Similarly, with regard to the well-being of a State or an individual, that man will never make genuine statesman who pays attention primarily solely to the needs of foreign warfare, nor will he make a finished lawgiver unless he designs his legislation for peace
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="628e"/> rather than his peace legislation for war.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> This statement, Stranger, is apparently true;  yet, unless I am much mistaken, our legal usages in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> too, are wholly acted towards war.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="629">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very possibly;  but we must not now attack them violently,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="629"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="629a"/> but mildly interrogate them, since both we and your legislators are earnestly interested in these matters.  Pray follow the argument closely.  Let us take the opinion of Tyrtaeus (an Athenian by birth and afterwards a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>), above all men, was keenly interested in our subject.  This is what he says:<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> <bibl>Tyrt. 12 (Bergk)</bibl>.  Tyrtaeus wrote war-songs at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> about <date when="-0880">880</date> B.C.</note>  <quote type="verse"><l met="elegiac">Though a man were the richest of men,</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus 12 Bergk</bibl>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="629b"/><quote type="verse">though a man possessed goods in plenty (and he specifies nearly every good there is), if he failed to prove himself at all times most valiant in war, no mention should I make of nor take account of him at all.</quote>  No doubt you also have heard these poems;  while our friend Megillus is, I imagine, surfeited with them.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I certainly am.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And I can assure you they have reached <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> also, shipped over from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, let us jointly interrogate this poet somehow on this wise:
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="629c"/><q type="spoken">O Tyrtaeus, most inspired of poets (for assuredly you seem to us both wise and good in that you have eulogized excellently those who excel in war), concerning this matter we three Megillus, Clinias of Cnosus and myself are already in entire accord with you, as we suppose;  but we wish to be assured that both we and you are alluding to the same persons.  Tell us then:  do you clearly recognize, as we do, two distinct kinds of war?</q>  In reply to this I suppose that even a much less able man than Tyrtaeus would state the truth,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="629d"/> that there are two kinds, the one being that which we all call <q type="emph">civil,</q> which is of all wars the most bitter, as we said just now, while the other kind, as I suppose we shall all agree, is that which we engage in when we quarrel with foreigners and aliens—a kind much milder than the former.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come, then, which kind of warriors, fighting in which kind of war, did you praise so highly, while blaming others?  Warriors, apparently, who fight in war abroad.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="629e"/> At any rate, in your poems you have said that you cannot abide men who dare not <quote type="verse">face the gory fray</quote> <bibl>Tyrtaeus</bibl> <quote type="verse"><l met="elegiac">and smite the foe in close combat.</l></quote> <bibl>Tyrtaeus</bibl> Then we should proceed to say, <q type="spoken">It appears, O Tyrtaeus, that you are chiefly praising those who achieve distinction in foreign and external warfare.</q>  To this, I presume, he would agree, and say <q type="spoken">Yes</q>?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="630">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="630"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="630a"/><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet, brave though these men are, we still maintain that they are far surpassed in bravery by those who are conspicuously brave in the greatest of wars;  and we also have a poet for witness,—Theognis (a citizen of Sicilian Megara), who says: <quote type="verse"><l met="elegiac">In the day of grievous feud, O Cyrnus, the loyal warrior is worth his weight in silver and gold.</l></quote><bibl>Theognis 5.77-8 Bergk</bibl><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">He wrote sententious poetry about <date when="-0550">550</date> B.C.</note> Such a man, in a war much more grievous, is, we say, ever so much better than the other—nearly as much better, in fact, as the union of justice, prudence and wisdom
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="630b"/> with courage is better than courage by itself alone.  For a man would never prove himself a loyal and sound in civil war if devoid of goodness in its entirety;  whereas in the war of which Tyrtaeus speaks there are vast numbers of mercenaries ready to die fighting<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Tyrt. xi. 21.</note> <quote>with well-planted feet apart,</quote> of whom the majority, with but few exceptions, prove themselves reckless, unjust, violent, and pre-eminently foolish.  What, then, is the conclusion to which our present discourse is tending, and what point is it trying to make clear by these statements?  Plainly it is this:  both the Heaven-taught legislator of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="630c"/> and every legislator who is worth his salt will most assuredly legislate always with a single eye to the highest goodness and to that alone;  and this (to quote Theognis) consists in <quote>loyalty in danger,</quote> and one might term it <q type="emph">complete righteousness.</q>  But that goodness which Tyrtaeus specially praised,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="630d"/> fair though it be and fitly glorified by the poet, deserves nevertheless to be placed no higher than fourth in order and estimation.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. courage comes after wisdom, prudence and justice.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We are degrading our own lawgiver, Stranger, to a very low level!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Nay, my good Sir, it is ourselves we are degrading, in so far as we imagine that it was with a special view to war that Lycurgus and Minos laid down all the legal usages here and in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How, then, ought we to have stated the matter?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In the way that is, as I think, true and proper <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="630e"/> when talking of a divine hero.  That is to say, we should state that he enacted laws with an eye not to some one fraction, and that the most paltry, of goodness, but to goodness as a whole, and that he devised the laws themselves according to classes, though not the classes which the present devisers propound.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="631">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>For everyone now brings forward and devises just the class which he needs:  one man deals with inheritances and heiresses, another with cases of battery, and so on
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="631"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="631a"/> in endless variety.  But what we assert is that the devising of laws, when rightly conducted, follows the procedure which we have now commenced.  Indeed, I greatly admire the way you opened your exposition of the laws;  for to make a start with goodness and say that that was the aim of the lawgiver is the right way.  But in your further statement that he legislated wholly with reference to a fraction of goodness, and that the smallest fraction, you seemed to me to be in error, and all this latter part of my discourse was because of that.  What then is the manner of exposition I should have liked to have heard from you?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="631b"/> Shall I tell you?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, by all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <q type="spoken">O Stranger</q> (thus you ought to have said), <q type="spoken">it is not for nothing that the laws of the Cretans are held in superlatively high repute among all the Hellenes.  For they are true laws inasmuch as they effect the well-being of those who use them by supplying all that are good.  Now goods are of two kinds, human and divine;  and the human goods are dependent on the divine, and he who receives the greater acquires also the less, or else he is bereft of both.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="631c"/> The lesser goods are those of which health ranks first, beauty second;  the third is strength, in running and all other bodily exercises;  and the fourth is wealth—no blind god Plutus, but keen of sight, provided that he has wisdom for companion.  And wisdom, in turn, has first place among the goods that are divine, and rational temperance of soul comes second;  from these two, when united with courage, there issues justice, as the third;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="631d"/> and the fourth is courage.  Now all these are by nature ranked before the human goods, and verily the law-giver also must so rank them.  Next, it must be proclaimed to the citizens that all the other instructions they receive have these in view;  and that, of these goods themselves, the human look up to the divine, and the divine to reason as their chief.  And in regard to their marriage connections, and to their subsequent breeding and rearing of children, male and female, both during youth and in later life <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="631e"/> up to old age, the lawgiver must supervise the citizens, duly apportioning honor and dishonor;</q></said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="632">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> <q type="spoken" rend="merge">and in regard to all their forms of intercourse he must observe and watch their pains and pleasures and desires and
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="632"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="632a"/> all intense passions, and distribute praise and blame correctly by the means of the laws themselves.  Moreover, in the matter of anger and of fear, and of all the disturbances which befall souls owing to misfortune, and of all the avoidances thereof which occur in good-fortune, and of all the experiences which confront men through disease or war or penury or their opposites,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="632b"/> in regard to all these definite instruction must be given as to what is the right and what the wrong disposition in each case.  It is necessary, in the next place, for the law-giver to keep a watch on the methods employed by the citizens in gaining and spending money, and to supervise the associations they form with one another, and the dissolutions thereof, whether they be voluntary or under compulsion;  he must observe the manner in which they conduct each of these mutual transactions, and note where justice obtains and where it is lacking.  To those that are obedient he must assign honors by law, but on the disobedient he must impose
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="632c"/> duly appointed penalties.  Then finally, when he arrives at the completion of the whole constitution, he has to consider in what manner in each case the burial of the dead should be carried out, and what honors should be assigned to them.  This being settled, the framer of the laws will hand over all his statutes to the charge of Wardens—guided some by wisdom, others by true opinion—to the end that Reason, having bound all into one single system, may declare them to be ancillary neither to wealth nor ambition, but to temperance and justice.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="632d"/> In this manner, Strangers, I could have wished (and I wish it still) that you had fully explained how all these regulations are inherent in the reputed laws of Zeus and in those of the Pythian Apollo which were ordained by Minos and Lycurgus, and how their systematic arrangement is quite evident to him who, whether by art or practice, is an expert in law, although it is by no means obvious to the rest of us.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What then, Stranger, should be the next step in our argument?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We ought, as I think, to do as we did at first—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="632e"/> start from the beginning to explain first the institutions which have to do with courage;  and after that we shall, if you wish,  deal with a second and a third form of goodness.  And as soon as we have completed our treatment of the first theme, we shall take that as our model and by a discussion of the rest on similar lines beguile the way;  and at the end of our treatment of goodness in all its forms we shall make it clear, if God will, that the rules we discussed just now had goodness for their aim.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="633">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="633"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="633a"/><label>Meg.</label> A good suggestion!  And begin with our friend here, the panegyrist of Zeus—try first to put him to the test.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Try I will, and to test you too and myself;  for the argument concerns us all alike.  Tell me then:  do we assert that the common meals and the gymnasia were devised by the lawgiver with a view to war?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And is there a third institution of the kind, and a fourth?  For probably one ought to employ this method of enumeration also in dealing with the subdivisions (or whatever we ought to call them) of the other forms of goodness, if only one makes oneÕs meaning clear.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="633b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> The third thing he devised was hunting:  so I and every Lacedaemonian would say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us attempt also to state what comes fourth,—and fifth too, if possible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> The fourth also I may attempt to state:  it is the training, widely prevalent amongst us, in hardy endurance of pain, by means both of manual contests and of robberies carried out every time at the risk of a sound drubbing;  moreover, the <q type="foreign">Crypteia,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Or <gloss>Secret Service.</gloss>  Young Spartans policed the country to suppress risings among the Helots.</note> as it is called, affords a wonderfully severe training
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="633c"/> in hardihood, as the men go bare-foot in winter and sleep without coverlets and have no attendants, but wait on themselves and rove through the whole countryside both by night and by day.  Moreover in our games,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> The <q type="soCalled">Naked Games,</q> held about midsummer.</note> we have severe tests of endurance, when men unclad do battle with the violence of the heat,—and there are other instances so numerous that the recital of them would be well-nigh endless.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Splendid, O Stranger of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>!  But come now, as to courage, how shall we define it?  Shall we define it quite simply as battling against fears and pains only,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="633d"/> or as against desires also and pleasures, with their dangerous enticements and flatteries, which melt men’s hearts like wax—even men most reverenced in their own conceit.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> The latter definition is, I think, the right one:  courage is battling against them all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Earlier in our discourse (if I am not mistaken) Clinias here used the expression <q type="emph">self-inferior</q> of a State or an individual:  did you not do so, O Stranger of Cnosus?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="633e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> At present do we apply the term <q type="emph">bad</q> to the man who is inferior to pains, or to him also who is inferior to pleasures?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> To the man who is inferior to pleasures more than to the other, in my opinion.  All of us, indeed, when we speak of a man who is shamefully self-inferior, mean one who is mastered by pleasures rather than one who is mastered by pains.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="634">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="634"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="634a"/><label>Ath.</label> Then surely the lawgiver of Zeus and he of Apollo did not enact by law a lame kind of courage, able only to defend itself on the left and unable to resist attractions and allurements on the right, but rather one able to resist on both sides?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> On both sides, as I would maintain.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us, then, mention once more the State institutions in both your countries which give men a taste of pleasures instead of shunning them,—just as they did not shun pains but plunged their citizens into the midst of them and so compelled them,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="634b"/> or induced them by rewards, to master them.  Where, pray, in your laws is the same policy adopted in regard to pleasures?  Let us declare what regulation of yours there is which causes the same men to be courageous toward pains and pleasures alike, conquering where they ought to conquer and in no wise worsted by their nearest and most dangerous enemies.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Although, Stranger, I was able to mention a number of laws that dealt with mastery over pains, in the case of pleasures I may not find it equally easy to produce important and conspicuous examples;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="634c"/> but I might perhaps furnish some minor instances.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Neither could I in like manner give myself clear examples from the Cretan laws.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And no wonder, my most excellent friends.  If then, in his desire to discover what is true and superlatively good, any one of us should find fault with any domestic law of his neighbors, let us take one another’s remarks in good part and without resentment.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="634d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are right, Stranger:  that is what we must do.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, for resentment would ill become men of our years.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Ill indeed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Whether men are right or wrong in their censures of the Laconian polity and the Cretan—that is another story;  anyhow, what is actually said by most men I, probably, am in a better position to state than either of you.  For in your case (your laws being wisely framed) one of the best of your laws will be that which enjoins that none of the youth shall inquire which laws are wrong
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="634e"/> and which right, but all shall declare in unison, with one mouth and one voice, that all are rightly established by divine enactment, and shall turn a deaf ear to anyone who says otherwise;  and further, that if any old man has any stricture to pass on any of your laws, he must not utter such views in the presence of any young man, but before a magistrate or one of his own age.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="635">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A very sound observation, Stranger;  and just like a diviner,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="635"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="635a"/> far away though you are from the original lawgiver, you have fairly spotted, as I think, his intention, and described it with perfect truth.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, there are no young people with us now;  so we may be permitted by the lawgiver, old as we are, to discuss these matters among ourselves privately without offence.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is so.  Do you, then, have no scruple in censuring our laws;  for there is nothing discreditable in being told of some flaw;  rather it is just this which leads to a remedy, if the criticism be accepted not peevishly
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="635b"/> but in a friendly spirit.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Good!  But until I have investigated your laws as carefully as I can I shall not censure them but rather express the doubts I feel.  You alone of Greeks and barbarians, so far as I can discover, possess a lawgiver who charged you to abstain from the greatest of pleasures and amusements and taste them not;  but concerning pains and fears, as we said before, he held the view that anyone who shuns them continuously from childhood onward, when confronted with
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="635c"/> unavoidable hardships and fears and pains, will be put to flight by the men who are trained in such things, and will become their slave.  Now I presume that this same lawgiver should have held the same view about pleasures as well, and should have argued with himself that, if our citizens grow up from their youth unpracticed in the greatest pleasures, the consequence must be that, when they find themselves amongst pleasures without being trained in the duty of resisting them and of refusing to commit any disgraceful act,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="635d"/> because of the natural attraction of pleasures, they will suffer the same fate as those who are worsted by fears:  they will, that is to say, in another and still more shameful fashion be enslaved by those who are able to hold out amidst pleasures and those who are versed in the art of pleasure,—people who are sometimes wholly vicious:  thus their condition of soul will be partly enslaved and partly free, and they will not deserve to be called, without qualification, free men and men of courage.  Consider, then, whether you at all approve these remarks of mine.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="635e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> On the face of them, we are inclined to approve;  but to yield quick and easy credence in matters of such importance would, I fear, be rash and thoughtless.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="636">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, O Clinias, and thou, Stranger of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, suppose we discuss the second of the subjects we proposed, and take temperance next after courage:  shall we discover any point in which these polities are superior to those framed at random,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="636"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="636a"/> as we found just now in regard to their military organization?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Hardly an easy matter!  Yet probably the common meals and the gymnasia are well devised to foster both these virtues.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In truth, Strangers, it seems a difficult thing for State institutions to be equally beyond criticism both in theory and in practice.  Their case resembles that of the human body, where it seems impossible to prescribe any given treatment for each case without finding that this same prescription is partly beneficial and partly injurious to the body.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="636b"/> So these common meals, for example, and these gymnasia, while they are at present beneficial to the States in many other respects, yet in the event of civil strife they prove dangerous (as is shown by the case of the youth of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, Bocotia and <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName>);<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Plato here ascribes the revolutions which occurred in these places to the intensive military training of the youth.  <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName> was a Greek town in S. Italy, an off-shoot of Syhsris.</note>  and, moreover, this institution, when of old standing, is thought to have corrupted the pleasures of love which are natural not to men only but also natural to beasts.  For this your States are held primarily responsible, and along with them all others
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="636c"/> that especially encourage the use of gymnasia.  And whether one makes the observation in earnest or in jest, one certainly should not fail to observe that when male unites with female for procreation the pleasure experienced is held to be due to nature, but contrary to nature when male mates with male or female with female, and that those first guilty of such enormities were impelled by their slavery to pleasure.  And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="636d"/> Because it was the belief that they derived their laws from Zeus, they added on this story about Zeus in order that they might be following his example in enjoying this pleasure as well.  Now with the story itself we have no more concern;  but when men are investigating the subject of laws their investigation deals almost entirely with pleasures and pains, whether in States or in individuals.  These are the two fountains which gush out by nature’s impulse;  and whoever draws from them a due supply at the due place and time is blessed—be it a State <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="636e"/> or an individual or any kind of creature;  but whosoever does so without understanding and out of due season will fare contrariwise.</said></p></div>
   
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="637">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What you say, Stranger, is excellent, I suppose;  nonetheless I am at a loss to know what reply I should make to it.  Still, in my opinion, the Lacedaemonian lawgiver was right in ordaining the avoidance of pleasures, while as to the laws of Cnosus—our friend Clinias, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="637"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="637a"/> if he thinks fit, will defend them.  The rules about pleasures at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> seem to me the best in the world.  For our law banished entirely from the land that institution which gives the most occasion for men to fall into excessive pleasures and riotous and follies of every description;  neither in the country nor in the cities controlled by Spartiates is a drinking-club to be seen nor any of the practices which belong to such and foster to the utmost all kinds of pleasure.  Indeed there is not a man who would not punish at once and most severely any drunken reveller he chanced to meet with,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="637b"/> nor would even the feast of Dionysus serve as an excuse to save him—a revel such as I once upon a time witnessed <q type="emph">on the wagons</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">At the Feast of Dionysus in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> it was customary for revellers mounted on wagons to indulge in scurrilous language during the processions.</note> in your country;  and at our colony of <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, too, saw the whole city drunk at the Dionysia.  But with us no such thing is possible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> O Stranger of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, all such indulgences are praiseworthy where there exists a strain of firm moral fiber,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="637c"/> but where this is relaxed they are quite stupid.  An Athenian in self-defence might at once retaliate by pointing to the looseness of the women in your country.  Regarding all such practices, whether in <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, there is one answer that is held to vindicate their propriety.  The universal answer to the stranger who is surprised at seeing in a State some unwonted practice is this:  <q type="spoken">Be not surprised, O Stranger:  such is the custom with us: with you, perhaps, the custom in these matters is different.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="637d"/> But, my dear Sirs, our argument now is not concerned with the rest of mankind but with the goodness or badness of the lawgivers themselves.  So let us deal more fully with the subject of drunkenness in general for it is a practice of no slight importance, and it requires no mean legislator to understand it.  I am now referring not to the drinking or non-drinking of wine generally, but to drunkenness pure and simple, and the question is—ought we to deal with it as the Scythians and Persians do and the Carthaginians also, and Celts,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="637e"/> Iberians and Thracians, who are all warlike races, or as you Spartans do;  for you, as you say, abstain from it altogether, whereas the Scythians and Thracians, both men and women, take their wine neat and let it pour down over their clothes, and regard this practice of theirs as a noble and splendid practice; and the Persians indulge greatly in these and other luxurious habits which you reject, albeit in a more orderly fashion than the others.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="638">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="638"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="638a"/><label>Meg.</label> But we, my good Sir, when we take arms in our hands, put all these people to rout.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Say not so, my dear Sir;  for there have been, in fact, in the past and there will be in the future many a flight and many a pursuit which are past explaining, so that victory or defeat in battle could never be called a decisive, but rather a questionable, test of the goodness or badness of an institution.  Larger States, for example, are victorious in battle over smaller States,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="638b"/> and we find the Syracusans subjugating the Locrians, who are reputed to have been the best-governed of the peoples in that part of the world:  and the Athenians the Ceians,—and we could find countless other instances of the same kind.  So let us leave victories and defeats out of account for the present, and discuss each several institution on its own merits in the endeavor to convince ourselves, and explain in what way one kind is good and another had.  And to begin with, listen to my account of the right method of inquiring into the merits and demerits of institutions.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="638c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What is your account of it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In my opinion all those who take up an institution for discussion and propose, at its first mention, to censure it or commend it, are proceeding in quite the wrong way.  Their action is like that of a man who, when he hears somebody praising cheese as a good food, at once starts to disparage it, without having learnt either its effects or its mode of administration—in what form it should be administered and by whom and with what accompaniments, and in what condition and to people in what condition.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="638d"/> This, as it seems to me, is exactly what we are now doing in our discourse.  At the first mention of the mere name of drunkenness, straightway we fall, some of us to blaming it, others to praising it;  which is most absurd.  Each party relies on the aid of witnesses, and while the one party claims that its statement is convincing on the ground of the large number of witnesses produced, the other does so on the ground that those who abstain from wine are seen to be victorious in battle;  and then this point also gives rise to a dispute.  Now it would not be at all to my taste to go through all the rest of the legal arrangements in this fashion;
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="638e"/> and about our present subject, drunkenness, I desire to speak in quite another fashion (in my opinion, the right fashion), and I shall endeavor, if possible, to exhibit the correct method for dealing with all such subjects for indeed the view of them adopted by your two States would be assailed and controverted by thousands upon thousands of nations.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="639">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Assuredly, if we know of a right method of investigating these matters, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="639"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="639a"/> we are bound to give it a ready hearing.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us adopt some such method as this.  Suppose that a man were to praise the rearing of goats, and the goat itself as a fine thing to own, and suppose also that another man, who had seen goats grazing without a herd and doing damage on cultivated land, were to run them down, and find fault equally with every animal he saw that was without a master or under a bad master,—would such a man’s censure, about any object whatsoever, be of the smallest value?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly not.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="639b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do we call the man who possesses only nautical science, whether or not he suffers from sea-sickness, a good commander on a ship—or what?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> By no means good, if along with his skill he suffers in the way you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And how about the army commander?  Is a man fit for command, provided that he has military science, even though he be a coward and sea-sick with a kind of tipsy terror when danger comes?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And suppose he has no military skill, besides being a coward?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> You are describing an utterly worthless fellow, not a commander of men at all, but of the most womanish of women.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="639c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now take the case of any social institution whatsoever which naturally has a commander and which, under its commander, is beneficial;  and suppose that someone, who had never seen the conduct of the institution under its commander, but seen it only when with no commander or bad commanders, were to commend the institution or censure it:  do we imagine that either the praise or the blame of such an observer of such an institution is of any value?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly not, when the man has never seen nor shared in an institution of the kind
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="639d"/> that was properly conducted.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now stay a moment!  Shall we lay it down that, of the numerous kinds of social institutions, that of banqueters and banquetings forms one?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now has anyone ever yet beheld this institution rightly conducted?  Both of you can easily make answer—<q type="spoken">Never yet at all,</q> for with you this institution is neither customary nor legal;  but I have come across many modes of banqueting in many places, and I have also inquired into nearly all of them, and I have scarcely seen or heard of <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="639e"/> a single one that was in all points rightly conducted;  for if any were right at all, it was only in a few details, and most of them were almost entirely on the wrong lines.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="640">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean by that, Stranger?  Explain yourself more clearly;  for since we are (as you observed) without any experience of such institutions, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="640"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="640a"/> even if we did come across them, we would probably fail to see at once what was right in them and what wrong.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That is very probable.  Try, however, to learn from my description.  This you understand—that in all gatherings and associations for any purpose whatsoever it is right that each group should always have a commander.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, we have recently said that the commander of fighting men must be courageous.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The courageous man is less perturbed by alarms than the coward.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is true, too.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now if there had existed any device for putting an army in charge of a general who was absolutely impervious to fear or perturbation, should we not have made every effort to do so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But what we are discussing now is not the man who is to command an army in time of war, in meetings of foe with foe, but the man who is to command friends in friendly association with friends in time of peace.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite so.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="640c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Such a gathering, if accompanied by drunkenness, is not free from disturbance, is it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly not;  quite the reverse, I imagine.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So those people also need, in the first place, a commander?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly—they above all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Should we, if possible, provide them with a commander who is imperturbable?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Naturally, also, he should be wise about social gatherings.  For he has both to preserve
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="640d"/> the friendliness which already exists among the company and to see that the present gathering promotes it still further.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then the commander we set over drunken men should be sober and wise, rather than the opposite?  For a commander of drunkards who was himself drunken, young, and foolish would be very lucky if he escaped doing some serious mischief.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Uncommonly lucky.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Suppose, then, that a man were to find fault with such institutions in States where they are managed in the best possible way, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="640e"/> having an objection to the institution in itself, he might perhaps be right in doing so but if a man abuses an institution when he sees it managed in the worst way possible, it is plain that he is ignorant, first, of the fact that it is badly conducted, and secondly, that every institution will appear similarly bad when it is carried on without a sober ruler and commander.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="641">  
 <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>For surely you perceive
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="641"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="641a"/> that a sea-captain, and every commander of anything, if drunk, upsets everything, whether it be a ship or a chariot or an army or anything else that under his captaincy.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you say, Stranger, is perfectly true.  In the next place, then, tell us this:—suppose this institution of drinking were rightly conducted, of what possible benefit would it be to us?  Take the case of an army, which we mentioned just now:  there, given a right leader, his men will win victory in war, which is no small benefit;  and so too with the other cases:  but what solid advantage would accrue
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="641b"/> either to individuals or to a State from the right regulation of a wine-party?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, what great gain should we say would accrue to the State from the right control of one single child or even of one band of children?  To the question thus put to us we should reply that the State would benefit but little from one;  if, however, you are putting a general question as to what solid advantage the State gains from the education of the educated, then it is quite simple to reply that well-educated men will prove good men, and being good they will conquer their foes in battle,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="641c"/> besides acting nobly in other ways.  Thus, while education brings also victory, victory sometimes brings lack of education for men have often grown more insolent because of victory in war, and through their insolence they have become filled with countless other vices;  and whereas education has never yet proved to be <q type="emph">Cadmeian,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e.  involving more loss than gain—a proverbial expression, possibly derived from the fate of the <q type="emph"><placeName key="tgn,7011065">Sparti</placeName></q> (sprung from the dragon’s teeth sown by Cadmus, founder of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>) who slew one another:  cp. <q type="emph">Pyrrhic</q> victory.</note> the victories which men win in war often have been, and will be, <q type="emph">Cadmeian.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are implying, my friend, as it seems to us, that the convivial gathering,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="641d"/> when rightly conducted, is an important element in education.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Assuredly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Could you then show us, in the next place, how this statement is true?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The truth of my statement, which is disputed by many, it is for God to assert;  but I am quite ready to give, if required, my own opinion, now that we have, in fact, embarked on a discussion of laws and constitutions.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, it is precisely your opinion
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="641e"/> about the questions now in dispute that we are trying to learn.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus, then, we must do,—you must brace yourself in the effort to learn the argument, and I to expound it as best I can.  But, first of all, I have a preliminary observation to make:  our city, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is, in the general opinion of the Greeks, both fond of talk and full of talk, but <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> is scant of talk, while <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> is more witty<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A polite way of alluding to the proverbial mendacity of the Cretans (cp.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="642">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="642"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="642a"/><label>Ath.</label> so I am afraid of making you think that I am a great talker about a small matter, if I spin out a discourse of prodigious length about the small matter of drunkenness.  But the fact is that the right ordering of this could never be treated adequately and clearly in our discourse apart from rightness in music, nor could music, apart from education as a whole;  and these require  lengthy discussions.  Consider, then, what we are to do:  suppose we leave these matters over for the present,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="642b"/> and take up some other legal topic instead.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> O Stranger of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, you are not, perhaps, aware that our family is, in fact, a <q type="term">proxenus</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A <q type="term">proxenus</q> was a native who acted as official representative of a foreign State.</note> of your State.  It is probably true of all children that, when once they have been told that they are <q type="term">proxeni</q> of a certain State, they conceive an affection for that State even from infancy, and each of them regards it as a second mother-land, next after his own country.  That is precisely the feeling I now experience.  For through hearing mere children crying out—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="642c"/> whenever they, being the Lacedaemonians, were blaming the Athenians for anything or praising them—<q type="spoken">Your State, Megillus, has done us a bad turn or a good one,</q>—through hearing such remarks, I say, and constantly fighting your battles against those who were thus decrying your State, I acquired a deep affection for it;  so that now not only do I delight in your accent, but I regard as absolutely true the common saying that <q type="spoken">good Athenians are always incomparably good,</q> for they alone are good
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="642d"/> not by outward compulsion but by inner disposition.  Thus, so far as I am concerned, you may speak without fear and say all you please.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> My story, too, Stranger, when you hear it, will show you that you may boldly say all you wish.  You have probably heard how that inspired man Epimenides, who was a family connection of ours, was born in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>;  and how ten years<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Epimenides really lived about 600 B.C.</note> before the Persian War, in obedience to the oracle of the god, he went to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and offered certain sacrifices which the god had ordained;  and how, moreover, when the Athenians were alarmed at the Persians’ expeditionary force,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="642e"/> he made this prophecy—<q type="spoken">They will not come for ten years, and when they do come, they will return back again with all their hopes frustrated, and after suffering more woes than they inflict.</q></said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="643">
<p><said who="#Clinias" rend="merge"><label>Clin.</label>  Then our forefathers became guest-friends of yours, and ever since both my fathers and I myself
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="643"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="643a"/> have cherished an affection for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Evidently, then, you are both ready to play your part as listeners.  But as for my part, though the will is there, to compass the task is hard:  still, I must try.  In the first place, then, our argument requires that we should define education and describe its effects:  that is the path on which our present discourse must proceed until it finally arrives at the god of Wine.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means let us do so, since it is your wish.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="643b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then while I am stating how education ought to be defined, you must be considering whether you are satisfied with my statement.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Proceed with your statement.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I will.  What I assert is that every man who is going to be good at any pursuit must practice that special pursuit from infancy, by using all the implements of his pursuit both in his play and in his work.  For example, the man who is to make a good builder
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="643c"/> must play at building toy houses, and to make a good farmer he must play at tilling land;  and those who are rearing them must provide each child with toy tools modelled on real ones.  Besides this, they ought to have elementary instruction in all the necessary subjects,—the carpenter, for instance, being taught in play the use of rule and measure, the soldier taught riding or some similar accomplishment.  So, by means of their games, we should endeavor to turn the tastes and desires of the children in the direction of that object which forms their ultimate goal.  First and foremost,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="643d"/> education, we say, consists in that right nurture which most strongly draws the soul of the child when at play to a love for that pursuit of which, when he becomes a man, he must possess a perfect mastery.  Now consider, as I said before, whether, up to this point, you are satisfied with this statement of mine.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly we are.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But we must not allow our description of education to remain indefinite.  For at present, when censuring or commending a man’s upbringing, we describe one man
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="643e"/> as educated and another as uneducated, though the latter may often be uncommonly well educated in the trade of a pedlar or a skipper, or some other similar occupation.  But we, naturally, in our present discourse are not taking the view that such things as these make up education:  the education we speak of is training from childhood in goodness, which makes a man eagerly desirous of becoming a perfect citizen, understanding how both to rule and be ruled righteously.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="644">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>This is the special form of nurture
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="644"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="644a"/> to which, as I suppose, our present argument would confine the term <q type="emph">education</q> whereas an upbringing which aims only at money-making or physical strength, or even some mental accomplishment devoid of reason and justice, it would term vulgar and illiberal and utterly unworthy of the name <q type="emph">education.</q>  Let us not, however, quarrel over a name, but let us abide by the statement we agreed upon just now, that those who are rightly educated become, as a rule, good,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="644b"/> and that one should in no case disparage education, since it stands first among the finest gifts that are given to the best men;  and if ever it errs from the right path, but can be put straight again, to this task every man, so long as he lives, must address himself with all his might.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are right, and we agree with what you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Further, we agreed long ago that if men are capable of ruling themselves, they are good, but if incapable, bad.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us, then, re-state more clearly
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="644c"/> what we meant by this.  With your permission, I will make use of an illustration in the hope of explaining the matter.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Go ahead.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> May we assume that each of us by himself is a single unit?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And that each possesses within himself two antagonistic and foolish counsellors, whom we call by the names of pleasure and pain?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And that, besides these two, each man possesses opinions about the future, which go by the general name of <q type="emph">expectations</q>;  and of these, that which precedes pain bears the special name of <q type="emph">fear,</q> and that which precedes pleasure the special name of <q type="emph">confidence</q>;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="644d"/> and in addition to all these there is <q type="emph">calculation,</q> pronouncing which of them is good, which bad;  and <q type="emph">calculation,</q> when it has become the public decree of the State, is named <q type="emph">law.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I have some difficulty in keeping pace with you:  assume, however, that I do so, and proceed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I am in exactly the same predicament.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us conceive of the matter in this way.  Let us suppose that each of us living creatures is an ingenious puppet of the gods, whether contrived by way of a toy of theirs or for some serious purpose—for as to that we know nothing; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="644e"/> but this we do know, that these inward affections of ours, like sinews or cords, drag us along and, being opposed to each other, pull one against the other to opposite actions;  and herein lies the dividing line between goodness and badness.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="645">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>For, as our argument declares, there is one of these pulling forces which every man should always follow and nohow leave hold of, counteracting thereby the pull of the other sinews:
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="645"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="645a"/> it is the leading-string, golden and holy, of <q type="emph">calculation,</q> entitled the public law of the State;  and whereas the other cords are hard and steely and of every possible shape and semblance, this one is flexible and uniform, since it is of gold.  With that most excellent leading-string of the law we must needs co-operate always;  for since calculation is excellent, but gentle rather than forceful, its leading-string needs helpers to ensure that the golden kind within us may vanquish the other kinds.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="645b"/> In this way our story comparing ourselves to puppets will not fall flat, and the meaning of the terms <q type="emph">self-superior</q> and <q type="emph">self-inferior</q> will become somewhat more clear, and also how necessary it is for the individual man to grasp the true account of these inward pulling forces and to live in accordance therewith, and how necessary for the State (when it has received such an account either from a god or from a man who knows) to make this into a law for itself and be guided thereby in its intercourse both with itself and with all other States.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="645c"/> Thus both badness and goodness would be differentiated for us more clearly;  and these having become more evident, probably education also and the other institutions will appear less obscure;  and about the institution of the wine-party in particular it may very likely be shown that it is by no means, as might be thought, a paltry matter which it is absurd to discuss at great length but rather a matter which folly merits prolonged discussion.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite right:  let us go through with every topic that seems important for the present discussion.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="645d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Tell me now:  if we give strong drink to this puppet of ours, what effect will it have on its character?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In reference to what particular do you ask this question?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> To no particular, for the moment:  I am putting the question in general terms—<q type="spoken">when this shares in that, what sort of thing does it become in consequence?</q>  I will try to convey my meaning still more clearly:  what I ask is this—does the drinking of wine intensify pleasures and pains and passions and lusts?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, greatly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="645e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And how about sensations and recollections and opinions and thoughts?  Does it make them likewise more intense?  Or rather, do not these quit a man entirely if he becomes surfeited with drink?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, they quit him entirely.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> He then arrives at the same condition of soul as when he was a young child?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> He does.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So at that moment he will have very little control of himself?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="646">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="646"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="646a"/><label>Clin.</label> Very little.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And such a man is, we say, very bad?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very, indeed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It appears, then, that not the grey-beard only may be in his <q type="emph">second childhood,</q> but the drunkard as well.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> An admirable observation, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is there any argument which will undertake to persuade us that this is a practice we ought to indulge in, instead of shunning it with all our might so far as we possibly can?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It appears that there is:  at any rate you assert this, and you were ready just now to argue it.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="646b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are right in your reminder, and I am still ready to do so, now that you and Megillus have both expressed your willingness to listen to me.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course we shall listen, if only on account of the surprising paradox that, of his own free will, a man ought to plunge into the depths of depravity.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Depravity of soul, you mean, do you not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And how about plunging into a bad state of body, such as leanness or ugliness or impotence?  Should we be surprised if a man of his own free will ever
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="646c"/> got into such a state?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course we should.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, do we suppose that persons who go of themselves to dispensaries to drink medicines are not aware that soon afterwards, and for many days to come, they will find themselves in a bodily condition such as would make life intolerable<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Evidently, drastic purgatives were commonly prescribed.</note> if it were to last for ever?  And we know, do we not, that men who go to the gymnasia for hard training commence by becoming weaker?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> All this we know.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We know also that they go there voluntarily for the sake of the subsequent benefit ?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="646d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Should one not take the same view of the other institutions also?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then one must also take the same view of the practice of wine-drinking, if one can rightly class it amongst the others.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course one must.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If then this practice should be shown to be quite as beneficial for us as bodily training, certainly at the outset it is superior to it, in so far as it is not, like bodily training, accompanied by pain.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="646e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is true;  but I should be surprised if we succeeded in discovering in it any benefit.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That is precisely the point which we must at once try to make plain.  Tell me now:  can we discern two kinds of fear, of which the one is nearly the opposite of the other?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kinds do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> These:  when we expect evils to occur, we fear them.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="647">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And often we fear reputation, when we think we shall gain a bad repute for doing or saying something base; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="647"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="647a"/> and this fear we (like everybody else, I imagine) call shame.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> These are the two fears I was meaning;  and of these the second is opposed to pains and to all other objects of fear, and opposed also to the greatest and most numerous pleasures.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. shame, which is fear of disgrace, induces fortitude under pain and the power of resisting vicious pleasures.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Does not, then, the lawgiver, and every man who is worth anything, hold this kind of fear in the highest honor, and name it <q type="emph">modesty</q>;  and to the confidence which is opposed to it does he not give the name  <q type="emph">immodesty,</q> and pronounce it to be for all,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="647b"/> both publicly and privately, a very great evil?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And does not this fear, besides saving us in many other important respects, prove more effective than anything else in ensuring for us victory in war and security?  For victory is, in fact, ensured by two things, of which the one is confidence towards enemies, the other, fear of the shame of cowardice in the eyes of friends.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus each one of us ought to become both fearless and fearful;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="647c"/> and that for the several reasons we have now explained.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, when we desire to make a person fearless in respect of a number of fears, it is by drawing him, with the help of the law, into fear that we make him such.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Apparently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And how about the opposite case, when we attempt with the aid of justice to make a man fearful?  Is it not by pitting him against shamelessness and exercising him against it that we must make him victorious in the fight against his own pleasures?  Or shall we say that, whereas in the case of courage it is only by fighting and conquering his innate cowardice
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="647d"/> that a man can become perfect, and no one unversed and unpracticed in contests of this sort can attain even half the excellence of which he is capable,—in the case of temperance, on the other hand, a man may attain perfection without a stubborn fight against hordes of pleasures and lusts which entice towards shamelessness and wrong-doing, and without conquering them by the aid of speech and act and skill, alike in play and at work,—and, in fact, without undergoing any of these experiences?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It would not be reasonable to suppose so.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="647e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then: </said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="648">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>in the case of fear does there exist any specific, given by God to men, such that, the more a man likes to drink of it, the more,

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What potion of the kind can we mention, Stranger, as existing anywhere?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> There is none.  Supposing, however, that there had been one, would it have been of any service to the lawgiver for promoting courage?  For instance, we might quite well have addressed him concerning it in this wise:  <q type="spoken">Come now, O lawgiver,—whether it be Cretans you are legislating for
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="648b"/> or anyone else, would not your first desire be to have a test of courage and of cowardice which you might apply to your citizens?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Obviously everyone of them would say <q type="spoken">Yes.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <q type="spoken">And would you desire a test that was safe and free from serious risks, or the reverse?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> All will agree, also, that the test must be safe.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <q type="spoken">And would you utilize the test by bringing men into these fears and proving them while thus affected, so as to compel them to become fearless;  employing exhortations admonitions and rewards,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="648c"/> but degradation for all those that refused to conform wholly to the character you prescribed?  And would you acquit without penalty everyone who had trained himself manfully and well, but impose a penalty on everyone who had done so badly?  Or would you totally refuse to employ the potion as a test, although you have no objection to it on other grounds?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course he would employ it, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> At any rate, my friend, the training involved would be wonderfully simple, as compared with our present methods, whether it were applied to individuals singly, or to small groups,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="648d"/> or to groups ever so large.  Suppose, then, that a man, actuated by a feeling of shame and loth to show himself in public before he was in the best of condition, should remain alone by himself while undergoing this training against fears and relying on the potion alone for his solitary equipment, instead of endless exercises,—he would be acting quite rightly:  so too would he who, trusting in himself that by nature and practice he is already well equipped, should have no hesitation in training in company with a number of drinking companions and showing off how for speed and strength he is superior to the potency of the draughts he is obliged to drink, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="648e"/> with the result that because of his excellence he neither commits any grave impropriety nor loses his head, and who, before they came to the last round, should quit the company, through fear of the defeat inflicted on all men by the wine-cup.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="649">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, Stranger, this man too would be acting temperately.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="649"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="649a"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Once more let us address the lawgiver and say:  <q type="spoken">Be it so, O lawgiver, that for producing fear no such drug apparently has been given to men by God, nor have we devised such ourselves (for quacks I count not of our company);  but does there exist a potion for inducing fearlessness and excessive and untimely confidence,—of what shall we say about this?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Presumably, he will assert that there is one,—naming wine.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And is not this exactly the opposite of the potion described just now?  For, first, it makes the person who drinks it more jovial than he was before, and the more he imbibes it, the more
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="649b"/> he becomes filled with high hopes and a sense of power, till finally, puffed up with conceit, he abounds in every kind of licence of speech and action and every kind of audacity, without a scruple as to what he says or what he does.  Everyone, I imagine, would agree that this is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us recall our previous statement that we must cultivate in our souls two things—namely,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="649c"/> the greatest possible confidence, and its opposite, the greatest possible fear.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Which you called, I think, the marks of modesty.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Your memory serves you well.  Since courage and fearlessness ought to be practised amidst fears, we have to consider whether the opposite quality ought to be cultivated amidst conditions of the opposite kind.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It certainly seems probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It appears then that we ought to be placed amongst those conditions which naturally tend to make us exceptionally confident and audacious when we are practising how to be as free as possible from shamelessness
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="649d"/> and excessive audacity, and fearful of ever daring to say or suffer or do anything shameful.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So it appears.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And are not these the conditions in which we are of the character described,—anger, lust, insolence, ignorance, covetousness, and extravagance;  and these also,—wealth, beauty, strength, and everything which intoxicates a man with pleasure and turns his head?  And for the purpose, first, of providing a cheap and comparatively harmless test of these conditions, and, secondly, of affording practice in them, what more suitable pleasure can we mention than wine, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="649e"/> with its playful testing—provided that it is employed at all carefully?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="650">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> For consider:  in the case of a man whose disposition is morose and savage (whence spring numberless iniquities), is it not more dangerous to test him by entering into money transactions with him, at one’s own personal risk, than by associating with him with the help of Dionysus and his festive insight?
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="650"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="650a"/> And when a man is a slave to the pleasures of sex, is it not a more dangerous test to entrust to him one’s own daughters and sons and wife, and thus imperil one’s own nearest and dearest, in order to discover the disposition of his soul?  In fact, one might quote innumerable instances in a vain endeavor to show the full superiority of this playful method of inspection which is without either serious consequence or costly damage.  Indeed, so far as that is concerned, neither the Cretans,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="650b"/> I imagine, nor any other people would dispute the fact that herein we have a fair test of man by man, and that for cheapness, security and speed it is superior to all other tests.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That certainly is true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This then—the discovery of the natures and conditions of men’s souls—will prove one of the things most useful to that art whose task it is to treat them;  and that art is (as I presume we say) the art of politics:  is it not so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p></div></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="2">

<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="652"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="652a"/><label>Ath.</label> In the next place, we probably ought to enquire, regarding this subject, whether the discerning of men’s natural dispositions is the only gain to be derived from the right use of wine-parties, or whether it entails benefits so great as to be worthy of serious consideration.  What do we say about this?  Our argument evidently tends to indicate that it does entail such benefits; so how and wherein it does so let us now hear,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="652b"/> and that with minds attentive, lest haply we be led astray by it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Say on.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="653">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I want us to call to mind again
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="653"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="653a"/> our definition of right education.  For the safekeeping of this depends, as I now conjecture, upon the correct establishment of the institution mentioned.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is a strong statement!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What I state is this,—that in children the first childish sensations are pleasure and pain, and that it is in these first that goodness and badness come to the soul;  but as to wisdom and settled true opinions, a man is lucky if they come to him even in old age and;  he that is possessed of these blessings, and all that they comprise,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="653b"/> is indeed a perfect man.  I term, then, the goodness that first comes to children <q type="emph">education.</q>  When pleasure and love, and pain and hatred, spring up rightly in the souls of those who are unable as yet to grasp a rational account;  and when, after grasping the rational account, they consent thereunto that they have been rightly trained in fitting practices:—this consent, viewed as a whole, is goodness, while the part of it that is rightly trained in respect of pleasures and pains, so as to hate what ought to be hated, right from the beginning
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="653c"/> up to the very end, and to love what ought to be loved, if you were to mark this part off in your definition and call it <q type="emph">education,</q> you would be giving it, in my opinion, its right name.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are quite right, Stranger, as it seems to us, both in what you said before and in what you say now about education.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very good.  Now these forms of child-training, which consist in right discipline in pleasures and pains, grow slack and weakened to a great extent
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="653d"/> in the course of men’s lives;  so the gods, in pity for the human race thus born to misery, have ordained the feasts of thanksgiving as periods of respite from their troubles;  and they have granted them as companions in their feasts the Muses and Apollo the master of music, and Dionysus, that they may at least set right again their modes of discipline by associating in their feasts with gods.  We must consider, then, whether the account that is harped on nowadays is true to nature?  What it says is that, almost without exception, every young creature is able of keeping either its body or its tongue quiet, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="653e"/> and is always striving to move and to cry, leaping and skipping and delighting in dances and games, and uttering, also, noises of every description.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="654">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Now, whereas all other creatures are devoid of any perception of the various kinds of order and disorder in movement (which we term rhythm and harmony), to men the very gods, who were given, as we said, to be our fellows in the dance, have granted the pleasurable perception of rhythm and harmony, whereby they cause us to move
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="654"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="654a"/> and lead our choirs, linking us one with another by means of songs and dances;  and to the choir they have given its name from the <q type="emph">cheer</q> implanted therein.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορός</foreign> is fancifully derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρά</foreign>, <gloss>joy.</gloss>  For similar etymologies, see the <title>Cratylus</title>, passim.</note>   Shall we accept this account to begin with, and  postulate that education owes its origin to Apollo and the Muses?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we assume that the uneducated man is without choir-training,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="654b"/> and the educated man fully choir-trained?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Choir-training, as a whole, embraces of course both dancing and song.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So the well-educated man will be able both to sing and dance well.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Evidently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us now consider what this last statement of ours implies.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Which statement?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Our words are,—<q type="spoken">he sings well and dances well</q>:
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="654c"/> ought we, or ought we not, to add,—<q type="spoken">provided that he sings good songs and dances good dances</q>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We ought to add this.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How  then, if a  man takes the good for good and the bad for bad and treats them accordingly?  Shall we regard such a man as better trained in choristry and music when he is always able both with gesture and voice to represent adequately that which he conceives to be good, though he feels neither delight in the good nor hatred of the bad,—or when, though not wholly able to represent his conception rightly by voice and gesture,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="654d"/> he yet keeps right in his feelings of pain and pleasure, welcoming everything good and abhorring everything not good.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> There is a vast difference between the two cases, Stranger, in point of education.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If, then, we three understand what constitutes goodness in respect of dance and song, we also know who is and who is not rightly educated but without this knowledge we shall never be able to discern whether there exists any safeguard for education
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="654e"/> or where it is to be found.  Is not that so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What we have next to track down, like hounds on the trail, is goodness of posture and tunes in relation to song and dance;  if this eludes our pursuit, it will be in vain for us to discourse further concerning right education, whether of Greeks or of barbarians.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="655">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, however shall we define goodness of posture or of tune?  Come, consider:  when a manly soul is beset by troubles,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="655"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="655a"/> and a cowardly soul by troubles identical and equal, are the postures and utterances that result in the two cases similar?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How could they be, when even their complexions differ in color?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well said, my friend.  But in, fact, while postures and tunes do exist in music,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="mentioned">Music</q> comprises both dance and song (including instrumental accompaniment), whether executed by single performers or by groups (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χορεία</foreign>).  The <q type="mentioned">postures</q> are those of the dancer, the <q type="mentioned">tunes</q> those of the singer.</note> which deals with rhythm and harmony, so that one can rightly speak of a tune or posture being <q type="emph">rhythmical</q> or <q type="emph">harmonious,</q> one cannot rightly apply the choir masters metaphor <q type="emph">well-colored</q> to tune and posture;  but one can use this language about the posture and tune of the brave man and the coward,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="655b"/> and one is right in calling those of the brave man good, and those of the coward bad.  To avoid a tediously long disquisition, let us sum up the whole matter by saying that the postures and tunes which attach to goodness of soul or body, or to some image thereof, are universally good,  while those which attach to badness are exactly the reverse.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Your pronouncement is correct, and we now formally endorse it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Another point:—do we all delight equally
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="655c"/> in choral dancing, or far from equally?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very far indeed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then what are we to suppose it is that misleads us?  Is it the fact that we do not all regard as good the same things, or is it that, although they are the same, they are thought not to be the same?  For surely no one will maintain that the choric performance of vice are better than those of virtue, or that he himself enjoys the postures of turpitude, while all others delight in music of the opposite kind.  Most people, however, assert that the value of music consists in its power
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="655d"/> of affording pleasure to the soul.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e.  music is commonly judged solely by the amount of pleasure it affords, without any regard to the quality of the pleasure.  The <title>Athenian</title> proceeds to show how dangerous a doctrine this is:  music, he maintains, should not be used merely to pander to the low tastes of the populace, but rather treated  as an educational instrument for the elevation of public morals.</note>  But such an assertion is quite intolerable, and it is blasphemy even to utter it.  The fact which misleads us is more probably the following—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Inasmuch as choric performances are representations of character, exhibited in actions and circumstances of every kind, in which, the several performers enact their parts by habit and imitative art, whenever the choric performances are congenial to them in point of diction, tune or other features (whether from natural bent or from habit, or from all these causes combined), <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="655e"/> then these performers invariably delight in such, performances and extol them as excellent;  whereas those who find them repugnant to their nature, disposition or habits cannot possibly delight in them or praise them, but call them bad.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="656">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>And when men are right in their natural tastes but wrong in those acquired by habituation, or right in the latter but wrong in the former, then by their expressions of praise they convey the opposite of their real sentiments;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="656"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="656a"/> for whereas they say of a performance that it is pleasant but bad, and feel ashamed to indulge in such bodily motions before men whose wisdom they respect, or to sing such songs (as though they seriously approved of them), they really take a delight in them in private.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Does the man who delights in bad postures and tunes suffer any damage thereby, or do those who take pleasure in the opposite gain therefrom any benefit?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Probably.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="656b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is it not probable or rather inevitable that the result here will be exactly the same as what takes place when a man who is living amongst the bad habits of wicked men, though he does not really abhor but rather accepts and delights in those habits, yet censures them casually, as though dimly aware of his own turpitude?  In such a case it is, to be sure, inevitable that the man thus delighted becomes assimilated to those habits, good or bad, in which he delights, even though he is ashamed to praise them.  Yet what blessing could we name, or what curse, greater than that of assimilation which befalls us so inevitably?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> There is none, I believe.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="656c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now where laws are, or will be in the future, rightly laid down regarding musical education and recreation, do we imagine that poets will be granted such licence that they may teach whatever form of rhythm or tune they best like themselves to the children of law-abiding citizens and the young men in the choirs, no matter what the result may be in the way of virtue or depravity?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That would be unreasonable, most certainly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="656d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But at present this licence is allowed in practically every State, with the exception of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How, then, does the law stand in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is marvellous, even in the telling.  It appears that long ago they determined on the rule of which we are now speaking, that the youth of a State should practise in their rehearsals postures and tunes that are good:  these they prescribed in detail and posted up in the temples, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="656e"/> and outside this official list it was, and still is, forbidden to painters and all other producers of postures and representations to introduce any innovation or invention, whether in such productions or in any other branch of music, over and above the traditional forms.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="657">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And if you look there, you will find that the things depicted or graven there 10,000 years ago (I mean what I say,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="657"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="657a"/> not loosely but literally 10,000) are no whit better or worse than the productions of today, but wrought with the same art.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A marvellous state of affairs!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Say rather, worthy in the highest degree of a statesman and a legislator.  Still, you would find in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> other things that are bad.  This, however, is a true and noteworthy fact, that as regards music it has proved possible for the tunes which possess a natural correctness to be enacted by law and permanently consecrated.  To effect this would be the task of a god or a godlike man,—even as in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> they say that the tunes preserved throughout
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="657b"/> all this lapse of time are the compositions of Isis.  Hence, as I said, if one could by any means succeed in grasping no principle of correctness in tune, one might then with confidence reduce them to legal form and prescription, since the tendency of pleasure and pain to indulge constantly in fresh music has, after all, no very great power to corrupt choric forms that are consecrated, by merely scoffing at them as antiquated.  In <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, at any rate, it seems to have had no such power of corrupting,—in fact, quite the reverse.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="657c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Such would evidently be the case, judging from what you now say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> May we confidently describe the correct method in music and play, in connection with choristry, in some such terms as this:  we rejoice whenever we think we are prospering, and, conversely, whenever we rejoice we think we are prospering?  Is not that so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, that is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, when in this state of joy we are unable to keep still.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="657d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now while our young men are fitted for actually dancing themselves, we elders regard ourselves as suitably employed in looking on at them, and enjoying their sport and merrymaking, now that our former nimbleness is leaving us;  and it is our yearning regret for this that causes us to propose such contests for those who can best arouse in us through recollection, the dormant emotions of youth.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus we shall not dismiss as entirely groundless the opinion now <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="657e"/> commonly expressed about merrymakers,—namely, that he who best succeeds in giving us joy and pleasure should be counted the most skilful and be awarded the prize.  For, seeing that we give ourselves up on such occasions of recreation, surely the highest honor and the prize of victory, as I said just now, should be awarded to the performer who affords the greatest enjoyment to the greatest number.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="658">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Is not this the right view,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="658"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="658a"/> and the right mode of action too, supposing it were carried out?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Possibly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But, my dear sir, we must not decide this matter hastily;  rather we must analyze it thoroughly and examine it in some such fashion as this:  suppose a man were to organize a competition, without qualifying or limiting it to gymnastic, musical or equestrian sports;  and suppose that he should assemble the whole population of the State and, proclaiming that this is purely a pleasure-contest in which anyone who chooses may compete, should offer a prize to the competitor who gives the greatest amusement to the spectators,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="658b"/> without any restrictions as to the methods employed,—and who excels others just in doing this in the highest possible degree, and is adjudged the most pleasure-giving of the competitors:  what do we suppose would be the effect of such a proclamation?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what respect do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The natural result would be that one man would, like Homer, show up a rhapsody, another a harp-song, one a tragedy and another a comedy;  nor should we be surprised if someone were even to fancy
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="658c"/> that he had the best chance of winning with a puppet-show.  So where such as these and thousands others enter the competition, can we say who will deserve to win the prize?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> An absurd question;  for who could possibly pretend to know the answer before he had himself actually heard each of the competitors?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very well, then;  do you wish me to supply you with the answer to this absurd question?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If the tiniest children are to be the judges, they will award the prize to the showman of puppets, will they not?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="658d"/></said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And we old men would very likely take most delight in listening to a rhapsode giving a fine recitation of the Iliad or the Odyssey or of a piece from Hesiod, and declare that he is easily the winner.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="658e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Evidently we three cannot avoid saying that those who are adjudged the winners by our own contemporaries would win rightly.  For in our opinion epic poetry is by far the best to be found nowadays anywhere in any State in the world.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus much I myself am willing to concede to the majority of men,—that the criterion of music should be pleasure not, however, the pleasure of any chance person;  rather I should regard that music which pleases the best men
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="659"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="659a"/> and the highly educated as about the best, and as quite the best if it pleases the one man who excels all others in virtue and education.  And we say that the judges of these matters need virtue for the reason that they need to possess not only wisdom in general, but especially courage.  For the true judge should not take his verdicts from the dictation of the audience, nor yield weakly to the uproar of the crowd or his own lack of education;  nor again, when he knows the truth, should he give his verdict carelessly through cowardice and lack of spirit, thus swearing falsely out of the same mouth with which he invoked Heaven when he first took his seat as judge.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Judges at musical and gymnastic contests, like all state officials, took an oath to discharge their duties with fidelity.  See further, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 6.764">Plat. Laws 6.764</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="659b"/> For, rightly speaking, the judge sits not as a pupil, but rather as a teacher of the spectators, being ready to oppose those who offer them pleasure in a way that is unseemly or wrong;  and that is what the present law of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and Italy actually does:  by entrusting the decision to the spectators, who award the prize by show of hands, not only has it corrupted the poets
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="659c"/>(since they adapt their works to the poor standard of pleasure of the judges, which means that the spectators are the teachers of the poets), but it has corrupted also the pleasures of the audience;  for whereas they ought to be improving their standard of pleasure by listening to characters superior to their own, what they now do has just the opposite effect.  What, then, is the conclusion to be drawn from this survey?  Is it this, do you suppose?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This is, I imagine, the third or fourth time that our discourse has described a circle <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="659d"/> and come back to this same point—namely, that education is the process of drawing and guiding children towards that principle which is pronounced right by the law and confirmed as truly right by the experience of the oldest and the most just.  So in order that the soul of the child may not become habituated to having pains and pleasures in contradiction to the law and those who obey the law, but in conformity thereto, being pleased and pained at the same things as the old man,—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="659e"/> for this reason we have what we call <q type="emph">chants,</q> which evidently are in reality incantations<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e.  charms or magic formulae, canted over sick persons (or over snakes, <title>Euthyd.</title>  290A):  cp.  664 B.</note> seriously designed to produce in souls that conformity and harmony of which we speak.  But inasmuch as the souls of the young are unable to endure serious study, we term these <q type="emph">plays</q> and <q type="emph">chants,</q> and use them as such,—</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="660">

Similarly in dealing with the poet, the good legislator will use noble and laudable phrases to persuade him—and, failing persuasion, he will compel him—to portray by his rhythms the gestures, and by his harmonies the tunes, of men who are temperate, courageous, and good in all respects, and thereby to compose poems aright.<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="660b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In Heaven’s name, Stranger, do you believe that that is the way poetry is composed nowadays in other States?  So far as my own observation goes, I know of no practices such as you describe except in my own country and in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>;  but I do know that novelties are always being introduced in dancing and all other forms of music, which changes due not to the laws, but to disorderly tastes and these are so far from being constantly uniform and stable—like the Egyptian ones you describe—that they are never for a moment uniform.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="660c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Nobly spoken, O Clinias!  If, however, I seemed to you to say that the practices you refer to are in use now, very likely our mistake arose from my own failure to express my meaning clearly;  probably I stated my own desires with regard to music in such a way that you imagined me to be stating present facts.  To denounce things that are beyond remedy and far gone in error is a task that is by no means pleasant;  but at times it is unavoidable.  And now that you hold the same opinion on this subject, come, tell me, do you assert that such practices are more general among the Cretans
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="660d"/> and the Lacedaemonians than among the other Greeks?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Suppose now that they were to become general among the rest also,—should we say that the method of procedure then would be better than it is now?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> The improvement would be immense, if things were done as they are in my country and in that of our friends here, and as, moreover, you yourself said just now they ought to be done.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, let us come to an understanding on this matter.  In all <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="660e"/> education and music in your countries, is not this your teaching?  You oblige the poets to teach that the good man, since he is temperate and just, is fortunate and happy, whether he be great or small, strong or weak, rich or poor;  whereas, though he be richer even <quote>than Cinyras or Midas,</quote><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Tyrtaeus xii.  6;  see Bk.  i.  629.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="661">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>Your poet says—if he speaks the truth—<q type="written">I would spend no word on the man, and hold him in no esteem,</q> who without justice performs or acquires all the things accounted good;  and again he describes how the just man
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="661"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="661a"/><q type="written">drives his spear against the foe at close quarters,</q> whereas the unjust man dares not <q type="written">to look upon the face of bloody death,</q> nor does he outpace in speed of foot <q type="written">the north wind out of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,</q> nor acquire any other of the things called <q type="emph">good.</q>  For the things which most men call good are wrongly so described.  Men say that the chief good is health, beauty the second, wealth the third;  and they call countless other things <q type="emph">goods</q>—such as sharpness of sight and hearing,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="661b"/> and quickness in perceiving all the objects of sense;  being a king, too, and doing exactly as you please;  and to possess the whole of these goods and become on the spot an immortal, that, as they say, is the crown and top of all felicity.  But what you and I say is this,—that all these things are very good as possessions for men who are just and holy, but for the unjust they are (one and all, from health downwards) very bad;  and we say too that sight and hearing and
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="661c"/> sensation and even of itself are very great evils for the man endowed with all the so-called goods, but lacking in justice and all virtue, if he is immortal forever, but a lesser evil for such a man if he survives but a short time.  This, I imagine, is what you (like myself) will persuade or compel your poets to teach, and compel them also to educate your youth by furnishing them with rhythms and harmonies in consonance with this teaching.  Am I not right?  Just consider: <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="661d"/> what I assert is that what are called <q type="emph">evils</q> are good for the unjust, but evil for the just, while the so-called <q type="emph">goods</q>  are really good for the good, but bad for the bad.  Are you in accord with me, then,—that was my question,—or how stands the matter?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We are, apparently, partly in accord, but partly quite the reverse.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <q type="spoken">How?</q> do you ask?  Only (as it seems, my friend)
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="662b"/> if some god were to grant us concord, since at present we are fairly at discord one with another.  In my opinion these facts are quite indisputable even more plainly so, my dear Clinias, than the fact that <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> is an island;  and were I a legislator, I should endeavor to compel the poets and all the citizens to speak in this sense;  and I should impose all but the heaviest of penalties on anyone in the land who should declare that
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="662c"/> any wicked men lead pleasant lives, or that things profitable and lucrative are different from things just;  and there are many other things contrary to what is now said, as it seems, by Cretans and Lacedaemonians,—and of course by the rest of mankind,—which I should persuade my citizens to proclaim.  For, come now, my most excellent sirs, in the name of Zeus and Apollo, suppose we should interrogate those very gods themselves who legislated for you, and ask:  <q type="spoken">Is the most just life the most pleasant;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="662d"/> or are there two lives, of which the one is most pleasant, the other most just?</q>  If they replied that there were two, we might well ask them further, if we were to put the correct question;  <q type="spoken">Which of the two ought one to describe as the happier, those that live the most just or those that live the most pleasant life?</q>  If they replied, <q type="spoken">Those that live the most pleasant life,</q> that would be a monstrous statement in their mouths.  But I prefer not to ascribe such statements to gods, but rather to ancestors and lawgivers:
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="662e"/> imagine, then, that the questions I have put have been put to an ancestor and lawgiver, and that he has stated that the man who lives the most pleasant life is the happiest.  In the next place I would say to him this:  <q type="spoken">O father, did you not desire me to live as happily as possible?  Yet you never ceased bidding me constantly to live as justly as possible.</q></said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="663">  
    <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And hereby, as I think, our lawgiver or ancestor would be shown up as illogical and incapable of speaking consistently with himself, but if, on the other hand, he were to declare the most just life to be the happiest, everyone who heard him would, I suppose, enquire what is the good and charm it contains which is superior to pleasure, for which the lawgiver praises it.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="663"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="663a"/> For, apart from pleasure, what good could accrue to a just man?  <q type="spoken">Come, tell me, is fair fame and praise from the mouths of men and gods a noble and good thing, but unpleasant, while ill-fame is the opposite?</q>  <q type="spoken">By no means, my dear lawgiver,</q> we shall say.  And is it unpleasant, but noble and good, neither to injure anyone nor be injured by anyone, while the opposite is pleasant, but ignoble and bad?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So then the teaching which refuses to separate the pleasant from the just helps,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="663b"/> if nothing else, to induce a man to live the holy and just life, so that any doctrine which denies this truth is, in the eyes of the lawgiver, most shameful and most hateful;  for no one would voluntarily consent to be induced to commit an act, unless it involves as its consequence more pleasure than pain.  Now distance has the effect of befogging the vision of nearly everybody, and of children especially;  but our lawgiver will reverse the appearance by removing the fog,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e.  the lawgiver will make justice clear and distinct by bringing citizens close up to it:  discipline in just actions will give them a near and true view of it, and correct the wrong impression due to distance.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="663c"/> and by one means or another—habituation, commendation, or argument—will persuade people that their notions of justice and injustice are illusory pictures, unjust objects appearing pleasant and just objects most unpleasant to him who is opposed to justice, through being viewed from his own unjust and evil standpoint, but when seen from the standpoint of justice, both of them appear in all ways entirely the opposite.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So it appears.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In point of truth, which of the two judgements shall we say is the more authoritative,—that of the worse soul or that of the better.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That of the better, undoubtedly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="663d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Undoubtedly, then, the unjust life is not only more base and ignoble, but also in very truth more unpleasant, than the just and holy life.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It would seem so, my friends, from our present argument.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And even if the state of the case were different from what it has now been proved to be by our argument, could a lawgiver who was worth his salt find any more useful fiction than this (if he dared to use any fiction at all in addressing the youths for their good), or one more effective in persuading all men to act justly in all things
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="663e"/> willingly and without constraint?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Truth is a noble thing, Stranger, and an enduring;  yet to persuade men of it seems no easy matter.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Be it so;  yet it proved easy to persuade men of the Sidonian fairy-tale,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> About Cadmus;  cp. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 414c">Plat. Rep. 414c</bibl>.</note> incredible though it was, and of numberless others.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What tales?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="664">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The tale of the teeth that were sown, and how armed men sprang out of them.  Here, indeed, the lawgiver has a notable example
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="664"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="664a"/> of how one can, if he tries, persuade the souls of the young of anything, so that the only question he has to consider in his inventing is what would do most good to the State, if it were believed;  and then he must devise all possible means to ensure that the whole of the community constantly, so long as they live, use exactly the same language, so far as possible, about these matters, alike in their songs, their tales, and their discourses.  If you, however, think otherwise, I have no objection to your arguing in the opposite sense.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="664b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Neither of us, I think, could possibly argue against your view.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Our next subject I must handle myself.  I maintain that all the three choirs<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> At Spartan festivals it was customary to have three choirs—of boys, young men, and older men.</note> must enchant the souls of the children, while still young and tender, by rehearsing all the noble things which we have already recounted, or shall recount hereafter;  and let this be the sum of them:  in asserting that one and the same life is declared by the gods to be both most pleasant and most just, we shall not only be saying what is most true,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="664c"/> but we shall also convince those who need convincing more forcibly than we could by any other assertion.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We must assent to what you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> First, then, the right order of procedure will be for the Muses’ choir of children to come forward first to sing these things with the utmost vigor and before the whole city;  second will come the choir of those under thirty, invoking Apollo Paian<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. <gloss>the Healer.</gloss>  Cp.  the medicinal sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπᾴδειν</foreign>, <gloss>enchant,</gloss> in B4 above.  Music is to be a medicine of the soul.</note> as witness of the truth of what is said, and praying him of grace to persuade the youth.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="664d"/> The next singers will be the third choir, of those over thirty and under sixty;  and lastly, there were left those who, being no longer able to uplift the song, shall handle the same moral themes in stories and by oracular speech.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Whom do you mean, Stranger, by these third choristers.  For we do not grasp very clearly what you intend to convey about them.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet they are in fact the very people to whom most of our previous discourse was intended to lead up.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="664e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We are still in the dark:  try to explain yourself more clearly still.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> At the commencement of our discourse we said, if we recollect, that since all young creatures are by nature fiery, they are unable to keep still either body or voice, but are always crying and leaping in disorderly fashion;  we said also that none of the other creatures attains a sense of order, bodily and vocal, and that this is possessed by man alone; </said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="665">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> and that the order
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="665"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="665a"/> of motion is called <q type="emph">rhythm,</q> while the order of voice (in which acute and grave are blended together) is termed <q type="emph">harmony,</q> and to the combination of these two the name <q type="emph">choristry</q> is given.  We stated also that the gods, in pity for us, have granted to us as fellow-choristers and choir-leaders Apollo and the Muses,—besides whom we mentioned, if we recollect, a third, Dionysus.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly we recollect.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The choir of Apollo and that of the Muses have been described, and the third and remaining
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="665b"/> choir must necessarily be described, which is that of Dionysus.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?  Tell us;  for at the first mention of it, a Dionysiac choir of old men sounds mighty strange,—if you mean that men over thirty, and even men over fifty and up to sixty, are really going to dance in his honor.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That is, indeed, perfectly true.  It needs argument, I fancy, to show how such a procedure would be reasonable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It does.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are we agreed about our previous proposals?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="665c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what respect?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That it is the duty of every man and child—bond and free, male and female,—and the duty of the whole State, to charm themselves unceasingly with the chants we have described, constantly changing them and securing variety in every way possible, so as to inspire the singers with an insatiable appetite for the hymns and with pleasure therein.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Assuredly we would agree as to the duty of doing this.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="665d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then where should we put the best element in the State,—that which by age and judgment alike is the most influential it contains,—so that by singing its noblest songs it might do most good?  Or shall we be so foolish as to dismiss that section which possesses the highest capacity for the noblest and most useful songs?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We cannot possibly dismiss it, judging from what you now say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What seemly method can we adopt about it?  Will the method be this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Every man as he grows older becomes reluctant to sing songs, and takes less pleasure in doing so;  and when compelled to sing,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="665e"/> the older he is and the more temperate, the more he will feel ashamed.  Is it not so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Surely, then, he will be more than ever ashamed to get up and sing in the theater, before people of all sorts.  Moreover, if old men like that were obliged to do as the choristers do, who go lean and fasting when training their voices for a competition, they would assuredly find singing an unpleasant and degrading task, and they would undertake it with no great readiness.</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="666"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="666a"/><label>Clin.</label> That is beyond a doubt.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How then shall we encourage them to take readily to singing?  Shall we not pass a law that, in the first place, no children under eighteen may touch wine at all, teaching that it is wrong to pour fire upon fire either in body or in soul, before they set about tackling their real work, and thus guarding against the excitable disposition of the young?  And next, we shall rule that the young man under thirty may take wine in moderation,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="666b"/> but that he must entirely abstain from intoxication and heavy drinking.  But when a man has reached the age of forty, he may join in the convivial gatherings and invoke Dionysus, above all other gods, inviting his presence at the rite (which is also the recreation) of the elders, which he bestowed on mankind as a medicine potent against the crabbedness of old age, that thereby we men may renew our youth, and that, through forgetfulness of care, the temper of our souls
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="666c"/> may lose its hardness and become softer and more ductile, even as iron when it has been forged in the fire.   Will not this softer disposition, in the first place, render each one of them more ready and less ashamed to sing chants and <q type="emph">incantations</q> (as we have often called them), in the presence, not of a large company of strangers, but of a small number of intimate friends?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes!  much more ready.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So then, for the purpose of inducing them

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What manner of song will the men raise?  Will it not, evidently, be one that suits their own condition in every case?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What song, then, would suit godlike men?  Would a choric song<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. a song suited for singing by a chorus at a festival or other public occasion.</note>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> At any rate, Stranger, we and our friends here would be unable to sing any other song than that which we learnt by practice in choruses.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Naturally;  for in truth you never attained to <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="666e"/> the noblest singing.  For your civic organization is that of an army rather than that of city-dwellers, and you keep your young people massed together like a herd of colts at grass: </said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="667"> 
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> none of you takes his own colt, dragging him away from his fellows, in spite of his fretting and fuming, and puts a special groom in charge of him, and trains him by rubbing him down and stroking him and using all the means proper to child-nursing, that so he may turn out not only a good soldier, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="667"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="667a"/> but able also to manage a State and cities—in short, a man who (as we said at the first) is more of a warrior than the warriors of Tyrtaeus, inasmuch as always and everywhere, both in States and in individuals, he esteems courage as the fourth in order of the virtues, not the first.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Once again, Stranger, you are—in a sort of a way—disparaging our lawgivers.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is not intentionally, my friend, that I do so—if I am doing it  but whither the argument leads us, thither, if you please, let us go.  If we know of a music that is superior to that of the choirs or to that of the public theaters,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="667b"/> let us try to supply it to those men who, as we said, are ashamed of the latter, yet are eager to take a part in that music which is noblest.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> The following passage (down to 669 B) deals with the considerations of which a competent judge must take account in the sphere of music and art.  He must have regard to three things—<q type="emph">correctness</q> (the truth of the copy to the original), moral effect or <q type="emph">utility,</q> and <q type="emph">charm</q> or pleasure.  Though this last, by itself, is no criterion of artistic excellence, it is a natural <q type="emph">concomitant</q> (in the mind of the competent judge) when the work of art in question possesses a high degree of both <q type="emph">utility</q> and <q type="emph">correctness.</q></note>  Now, in the first place, must it not be true of everything which possesses charm as its concomitant, that its most important element is either this charm in itself, or some form of correctness, or, thirdly, utility?  For instance, meat and drink and nutriment in general have, as I say, for concomitant that charm which we should term pleasure;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="667c"/> but as regards their correctness and utility, what we call the wholesomeness of each article administered is precisely the most perfect element they contain.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Learning, too, is accompanied by the element of charm, which is pleasure;  but that which produces its correctness and utility, its goodness and nobleness, is truth.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite so.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="667d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then how about the imitative arts which produce likenesses?  If they succeed in their productions, should not any concomitant pleasure which results therefrom be most properly called <q type="emph">charm</q>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But, speaking generally, the correctness of these things would be the result not, primarily, of pleasure, but of equality in respect of both quality and quantity.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. a <q type="emph">likeness</q> must be <q type="emph">equal</q> to its original both in character and size.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Excellent.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then we shall rightly judge by the criterion of pleasure
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="667e"/> that object only which, in its effects, produces neither utility nor truth nor similarity, nor yet harm, and which exists solely for the sake of the concomitant element of charm,—which element will best be named <q type="emph">pleasure</q> whenever it is accompanied by none of the other qualities mentioned.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You mean only harmless pleasure.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, and I say that this same pleasure is also play, whenever the harm or good it does is negligible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="668">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Should we not then assert, as a corollary, that no imitation should be judged by the criterion of pleasure
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="668"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="668a"/> or of untrue opinion, nor indeed should any kind of equality be so judged?  The reason why the equal is equal, or the symmetrical symmetrical, is not at all because a man so opines, or is charmed thereby, but most of all because of truth, and least of all for any other reason.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We assert, do we not, that all music is representative and imitative?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So whenever a man states that pleasure is the criterion of music, we shall decisively reject his statement;  and we shall regard such music as the least important of all (if indeed any music
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="668b"/> is important) and prefer that which possesses similarity in its imitation of the beautiful.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus those who are seeking the best singing and music must seek, as it appears, not that which is pleasant, but that which is correct;  and the correctness of imitation consists, as we say, in the reproduction of the original in its own proper quantity and quality.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And this is certainly true of music, as everyone would allow,—that all its productions are
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="668c"/> imitative and representative;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp.  <bibl n="Plat. Laws 655d">Plat. Laws 655d</bibl>, above.  The music (songs and tunes) of dramatic compositions is specially alluded to.</note>  that much, at least, they would all admit,—poets, audience, and actors alike, would they not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They would.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now the man who is to judge a poem<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Or musical composition.</note> unerringly must know in each particular case the exact nature of the poem;  for if he does not know its essence,—what its intention is and what the actual original which it represents,—then he will hardly be able to decide how far it succeeds or fails in fulfilling its intention.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Hardly, to be sure.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="668d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And would a man who does not know what constitutes perfection be able to decide as to the goodness or badness of a poem?  But I am not making myself quite clear:  it might be clearer if I put it in this way—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As regards objects of sight we have, of course, thousands of representations.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How, then, if in this class of objects a man were to be ignorant of the nature of each of the bodies represented could he ever know whether it is perfectly executed?  What I mean is this:  whether it preserves the proper dimensions and the positions of each of the bodily parts,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="668e"/> and has caught their exact number and the proper order in which one is placed next another, and their colors and shapes as well,—or whether all these things are wrought in a confused manner.  Do you suppose that anyone could possibly decide these points if he were totally ignorant as to what animal was being represented?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How could he?</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="669">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, suppose we should know that the object painted or moulded is a man, and know that art has endowed him with all his proper parts, colors,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="669"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="669a"/> and shapes,—is it at once inevitable that the person who knows this can easily discern also whether the work is beautiful, or wherein it is deficient in beauty?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> If that were so, Stranger, practically all of us would know what animals are beautiful.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are quite right.  In regard, then, to every representation—whether  in painting, music or any other art—must not the judicious critic possess these three requisites:
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="669b"/> first, a knowledge of the nature of the original;  next, a knowledge of the correctness of the copy;  and thirdly, a knowledge of the excellence with which the copy is executed?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It would seem so, certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us not hesitate, then, to mention the point wherein lies the difficulty of music. Just because it is more talked about than any other form of representation, it needs more caution than any. The man who blunders in this art will do himself the greatest harm, by welcoming base morals; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="669c"/> and, moreover, his blunder is very hard to discern, inasmuch as our poets are inferior as poets to the Muses themselves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> In what follows, the main features censured are—incongruity, when the words, tunes and gestures of an acted piece of music are out of harmony; senselessness, when tunes and gestures are divorced from words; barbarousness, when the thing represented is paltry or uncouth (such as a duck’s quack); virtuosity, when the performer makes a display of the control he has over his limbs and instruments, like a mountebank or <q type="emph">contortionist.</q> All these are marks of bad music from the point of view of the educationist and statesman, since they are neither <q type="emph">correct</q> nor morally elevating.</note> For the Muses would never blunder so far as to assign a feminine tune and gesture to verses composed for men, or to fit the rhythms of captives and slaves to gestures framed for free men, or conversely, after constructing the rhythms and gestures of free men, to assign to the rhythms <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="669d"/> a tune or verses of an opposite style. Nor would the Muses ever combine in a single piece the cries of beasts and men, the clash of instruments, and noises of all kinds, by way of representing a single object; whereas human poets, by their senselessness in mixing such things and jumbling them up together, would furnish a theme for laughter to all the men who, in Orpheus’ phrase, <q type="written">have attained the full flower of joyousness.</q> For they behold all these things jumbled together, and how, also, the poets rudely sunder rhythm and gesture from tune, putting tuneless words into meter, or leaving time and rhythm <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="669e"/> without words, and using the bare sound of harp or flute, wherein it is almost impossible to understand what is intended by this wordless rhythm and harmony, or what noteworthy original it represents.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="670">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Such methods, as one ought to realize, are clownish in the extreme in so far as they exhibit an excessive craving for speed, mechanical accuracy, and the imitation of animals’ sounds, and consequently employ the pipe and the harp without the accompaniment of dance and song; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="670"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="670a"/> for the use of either of these instruments by itself is the mark of the mountebank or the boor. Enough, then, of that matter: now as to ourselves. What we are considering is, not how those of us who are over thirty years old, or beyond fifty, ought not to make use of the Muses, but how they ought to do so. Our argument already indicates, I think, this result from our discussion,—that all men of over fifty that are fit to sing ought to have a training that is better than that of the choric Muse. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="670b"/> For they must of necessity possess knowledge and a quick perception of rhythms and harmonies; else how shall a man know which tunes are correct?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Obviously he cannot know this at all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is absurd of the general crowd to imagine that they can fully understand what is harmonious and rhythmical, or the reverse, when they have been drilled to sing to the flute or step
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="670c"/> in time;  and they fail to comprehend that, in doing each of these things, they do them in ignorance.  But the fact is that every tune which has its appropriate elements is correct, but incorrect if the elements are inappropriate.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What then of the man who does not know in the least what the tune’s elements are?  Will he ever know about any tune, as we said, that it is correct?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> There is no possible means of his doing so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We are now once more, as it appears, discovering the fact that these singers of ours (whom we are now inviting
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="670d"/> and compelling, so to say, of their own free will to sing) must almost necessarily be trained up to such a point that every one of them may be able to follow both the steps<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. dance-steps and gestures:  <q type="emph">chords</q> nearly equals <q type="emph">notes,</q> with which the <q type="mentioned">steps</q> should <q type="emph">keep time.</q></note> of the rhythms and the chords of the tunes, so that, by observing the harmonies and rhythms, they may be able to select those of an appropriate kind, which it is seemly for men of their own age and character to sing, and may in this wise sing them, and in the singing may not only enjoy innocent pleasure themselves at the moment, but also may serve as leaders to the younger men in their seemly adoption of noble manners. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="670e"/> If they were trained up to such a point, their training would be more thorough than that of the majority, or indeed of the poets themselves.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="671">  
     <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> For although it is almost necessary for a poet to have a knowledge of harmony and rhythm, it is not necessary for him to know the third point also—namely, whether the representation is noble or ignoble<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. the composer, as such, is not concerned with the moral (or psychological) effect of the piece.</note>;  but for our older singers a knowledge of all these three points is necessary,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="671"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="671a"/> to enable them to determine what is first, what second in order of nobility;  otherwise none of them will ever succeed in attracting the young to virtue by his incantations.  The primary intention of our argument, which was to demonstrate that our defence of the Dionysiac chorus was justifiable, has now been carried out to the best of our ability.  Let us consider if that is really so.  Such a gathering inevitably tends, as the drinking proceeds, to grow ever more and more uproarious;  and in the case of the present day gatherings that is, as we said at the outset, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="671b"/> an inevitable result.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Inevitable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Everyone is uplifted above his normal self, and is merry and bubbles over with loquacious audacity himself, while turning a deaf ear to his neighbors, and regards himself as competent to rule both himself and everyone else.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> To be sure.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And did we not say that when this takes place, the souls of the drinkers turn softer, like iron, through being heated, and younger too;  whence they become ductile, just as when they were young,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="671c"/> in the hands of the man who has the skill and the ability to train and mould them.  And now, even as then, the man who is to mould them is the good legislator;  he must lay down banqueting laws, able to control that banqueter who becomes confident and bold and unduly shameless, and unwilling to submit to the proper limits of silence and speech, of drinking and of music, making him consent to do in all ways the opposite,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="671d"/> laws able also, with the aid of justice, to fight against the entrance of such ignoble audacity, by bringing in that most noble fear which we have named <q type="emph">modesty</q> and <q type="emph">shame.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And as law-wardens of these laws and cooperators therewith, there must be sober and sedate men to act as commanders over the un-sober;  for to fight drunkenness without these would be a more formidable task than to fight enemies without sedate leaders.  Any man who refuses willingly to obey these men and the officers
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="671e"/> of Dionysus (who are over sixty years of age) shall incur as much disgrace as the man who disobeys the officers of Ares, and even more.</said></p>
 <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite right.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="672">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If such was the character of the drinking and of the recreation, would not such fellow-drinkers be the better for it, and part from one another better friends than before, instead of enemies, as now?  For they would be guided by laws in all their intercourse,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="672"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="672a"/> and would listen to the directions given to the un-sober by the sober.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True, if it really were of the character you describe.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then we must no longer, without qualification, bring that old charge against the gift of Dionysus, that it is bad and unworthy of admittance into a State.  Indeed, one might enlarge considerably on this subject;  for the greatest benefit that gift confers is one which one hesitates to declare to the multitude, since,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="672b"/> when declared, it is misconceived and misunderstood.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> There is a secret stream of story and report to the effect that the god Dionysus was robbed of his soul’s judgment by his stepmother Hera, and that in vengeance therefor he brought in Bacchic rites and all the frenzied choristry, and with the same aim bestowed also the gift of wine.  These matters, however, I leave to those who think it safe to say them about deities<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. the <q type="mentioned">frenzied</q> motion ascribed to Dionysus is, rather a natural instinct exhibited in all child-life, and D. helps to reduce it to rhythm.</note>;  but this much I know,—that no creature is ever born in possession of that reason, or that amount of reason,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="672c"/> which properly belongs to it when fully developed;  consequently, every creature, during the period when it is still lacking in its proper intelligence, continues all in a frenzy, crying out wildly, and, as soon as it can get on its feet, leaping wildly.  Let us remember how we said that in this we have the origin of music and gymnastic.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp.  <bibl n="Plat. Laws 653d">Plat. Laws 653d ff</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We remember that, of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do we not also remember how we said that from this origin there was implanted
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="672d"/> in us men the sense of rhythm and harmony, and that the joint authors thereof were Apollo and the Muses and the god Dionysus?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly we remember.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, as to wine, the account given by other people apparently is that it was bestowed on us men as a punishment, to make us mad;  but our own account, on the contrary, declares that it is a medicine given for the purpose of securing modesty of soul and health and strength of body.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You have recalled our account admirably, Stranger.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="672e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We may say, then, that the one half of the subject of choristry has now been disposed of.  Shall we proceed at once to deal with the other half in whatever way seems best, or shall we leave it alone?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What halves do you mean?  How are you dividing the subject?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In our view, choristry as a whole is identical with education as a whole;  and the part of this concerned with the voice consists of rhythms and harmonies.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="673">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And the part concerned with bodily motion possesses, in common with vocal motion, rhythm;  besides which it possesses gesture as its own peculiar attribute, just as tune is the peculiar attribute of vocal
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="673"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="673a"/> motion.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now the vocal actions which pertain to the training of the soul in excellence we ventured somehow to name <q type="emph">music.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And rightly so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As regards the bodily actions which we called playful dancing,—if such action attains to bodily excellence, we  may term the technical guidance of the body to this end <q type="emph">gymnastic.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="673b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite rightly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As to music, which was referred to when we said a moment ago that the one half of choristry had been described and disposed of,—let us say the same of it now;  but as to the other half, are we to speak about it, or what are we to do?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> My good sir, you are conversing with Cretans and Lacedaemonians, and we have discussed the subject of music;  what reply, then, to your question do you suppose that either of us will make, when the subject left still untouched is gymnastic?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You have given me a pretty clear answer, I should say,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="673c"/> in putting this question;  although it is a question, I understand it to be also (as I say) an answer—or rather, an actual injunction to give a full account of gymnastic.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You have grasped my meaning excellently:  please do so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do it I must;  and indeed it is no very hard task to speak of things well known to you both.  For you are far better acquainted with this art than with the other.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is about true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The origin of the play<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. playful motion, or dancing, as contrasted with <q type="emph">music</q> (or <q type="emph">harmony</q>) which springs from the tendency to cry outc.</note> we are speaking of
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="673d"/> is to be found in the habitual tendency of every living creature to leap;  and the human creature, by acquiring, as we said, a sense of rhythm, generated and brought forth dancing;  and since the rhythm is suggested and awakened by the tune, the union of these two brought forth choristry and play.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Of choristry we have already discussed the one part, and we shall next endeavor to discuss the other part.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But, if you both agree, let us first put the finishing stroke
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="673e"/> to our discourse on the use of drink.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What, or what kind of, finish do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If a State shall make use of the institution now mentioned in a lawful and orderly manner, regarding it in a serious light and practising it with a view to temperance, and if in like manner and with a like object, aiming at the mastery of them, it shall allow indulgence in all other pleasures,—then they must all be made use of in the manner described.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="674">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> But if, on the other hand, this institution is regarded in the light of play, and if anyone that likes is to be allowed to drink whenever he likes
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="674"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="674a"/> and with any companions he likes, and that in conjunction with all sorts of other institutions,—then I would refuse to vote for allowing such a State or such an individual ever to indulge in drink, and I would go even beyond the practice of the Cretans and Lacedaemonians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 1.637a">Plat. Laws 1.637a, 637b</bibl>.</note>;  and to the Carthaginian law, which ordains that no soldier on the march should ever taste of this potion, but confine himself for the whole of the time to water-drinking only, I would add this, that in the city also no bondsman or bondsmaid should ever taste of it;  and that magistrates
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="674b"/> during their year of office, and pilots and judges while on duty, should taste no wine at all;  nor should any councillor, while attending any important council;  nor should anyone whatever taste of it at all, except for reasons of bodily training or health, in the daytime;  nor should anyone do so by night—be he man or woman—when proposing to procreate children.  Many other occasions, also, might be mentioned when wine should not be drunk by men who are swayed by right reason and law.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="674c"/> Hence, according to this argument, there would be no need for any State to have a large number of vineyards;  and while all the other agricultural products, and all the foodstuffs, would be controlled, the production of wine especially would be kept within the smallest and most modest dimensions.  Let this, then, Strangers, if you agree, be the finishing stroke which we put to our discourse concerning wine.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What standpoint?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That from which one should always observe the progress of States as they move towards either goodness or badness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What point is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The observation, as I suppose, of an infinitely long period of time

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Explain your meaning.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Tell me now:  do you think you could ever ascertain the space of time that has passed since cities came into existence and men lived under civic rule?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly it would be no easy task.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But you can easily see that it is vast and immeasurable?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That I most certainly can do.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> During this time, have not thousands upon thousands of States come into existence, and, on a similar computation, just as many perished?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="676c"/> And have they not in each case exhibited all kinds of constitutions over and over again?  And have they not changed at one time from small to great, at another from great to small, and changed also from good to bad and from bad to good?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Necessarily.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Of this process of change let us discover, if we can, the cause; for this, perhaps, would show us what is the primary origin of constitutions, as well as their transformation.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What tales?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That the world of men has often been destroyed by floods, plagues, and many other things, in such a way that only a small portion of the human race has survived.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Everyone would regard such accounts as perfectly credible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, let us picture to ourselves one of the many catastrophes,—namely, that which occurred once upon a time through the Deluge.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Deucalion’s Flood:  cp. <title>Polit</title>. 270 C.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And what are we to imagine about it?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="677b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That the men who then escaped destruction must have been mostly herdsmen of the hills, scanty embers of the human race preserved somewhere on the mountain-tops.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Evidently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, men of this kind must necessarily have been unskilled in the arts generally, and especially in such contrivances as men use against one another in cities for purposes of greed and rivalry and all the other villainies which they devise one against another.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="677c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is certainly probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we assume that the cities situated in the plains and near the sea were totally destroyed at the time?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Let us assume it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And shall we say that all implements were lost, and that everything in the way of important arts or inventions that they may have had,—whether concerned with politics or other sciences,— perished at that time?  For, supposing that things had remained all that time ordered just as they are now, how, my good sir, could anything new have ever been invented?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="677d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Do you mean that these things were unknown to the men of those days for thousands upon thousands of years, and that one or two thousand years ago some of them were revealed to Daedalus, some to Orpheus, some to Palamedes, musical arts to Marsyas and <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, lyric to Amphion, and, in short, a vast number of others to other persons—all dating, so to say, from yesterday or the day before?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are you aware, Clinias, that you have left out your friend who was literally a man of yesterday?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Is it Epimenides<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 642d">Plat. Laws 642d</bibl>.</note> you mean?</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, I mean him.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We do say so.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="678">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we, then, state that, at the time when the destruction took place, human affairs were in this position:  there was fearful and widespread desolation over a vast tract of land; most of the animals were destroyed, and the few herds of oxen and flocks of goats that happened to survive afforded at the first but scanty sustenance
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="678"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="678a"/> to their herdsmen?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And as to the matters with which our present discourse is concerned—States and statecraft and legislation,—do we think they could have retained any memory whatsoever, broadly speaking, of such matters?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So from those men, in that situation, there has sprung the whole of our present order—States and constitutions, arts and laws, with a great amount both of evil and of good?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="678b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do we imagine, my good Sir, that the men of that age, who were unversed in the ways of city life—many of them noble, many ignoble,—were perfect either in virtue or in vice?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well said!  We grasp your meaning.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As time went on and our race multiplied, all things advanced—did they not?—to the condition which now exists.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But, in all probability, they advanced, not all at once, but by small degrees, during an immense space of time.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="678c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, that is most likely.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> For they all, I fancy, felt as it were still ringing in their ears a dread of going down from the highlands to the plains.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And because there were so few of them round about in those days, were they not delighted to see one another, but for the fact that means of transport, whereby they might visit one another by sea or land, had practically all perished along with the arts?  Hence intercourse, I imagine, was not very easy.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="678d"/> For iron and bronze and all the metals in the mines had been flooded and had disappeared; so that it was extremely difficult to extract fresh metal; and there was a dearth, in consequence, of felled timber.  For even if there happened to be some few tools still left somewhere on the mountains, these were soon worn out, and they could not be replaced by others until men had rediscovered the art of metal-working.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They could not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now, how many generations, do we suppose, had passed before this took place?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="678e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A great many, evidently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And during all this period, or even longer, all the arts that require iron and bronze and all such metals must have remained in abeyance?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, civil strife and war also disappeared during that time, and that for many reasons.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="679">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In the first place, owing to their desolate state, they were kindly disposed and friendly towards one another; and secondly, they had no need to quarrel about food. <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="679"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="679a"/> For they had no lack of flocks and herds (except perhaps some of them at the outset), and in that age these were what men mostly lived on:  thus they were well supplied with milk and meat, and they procured further supplies of food, both excellent and plentiful, by hunting.  They were also well furnished with clothing and coverlets and houses, and with vessels for cooking and other kinds; for no iron is required for the arts of moulding and weaving,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="679b"/> which two arts God gave to men to furnish them with all these necessaries, in order that the human race might have means of sprouting and increase whenever it should fall into such a state of distress.  Consequently, they were not excessively poor, nor were they constrained by stress of poverty to quarrel one with another; and, on the other hand, since they were without gold and silver, they could never have become rich.  Now a community which has no communion with either poverty or wealth is generally the one in which the noblest characters will be formed;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="679c"/> for in it there is no place for the growth of insolence and injustice, of rivalries and jealousies. So these men were good, both for these reasons and because of their simple-mindedness, as it is called; for, being simple-minded, when they heard things called bad or good, they took what was said for gospel-truth and believed it.  For none of them had the shrewdness of the modern man to suspect a falsehood; but they accepted as true the statements made about gods and men, and ordered their lives by them.  Thus they were entirely of the character we have just described.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="679d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly Megillus and I quite agree with what you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And shall we not say that people living in this fashion for many generations were bound to be unskilled, as compared with either the antediluvians or the men of today, and ignorant of arts in general and especially of the arts of war as now practised by land and sea, including those warlike arts which, disguised under the names of law-suits and factions, are peculiar to cities, contrived as they are with every device of word and deed to inflict mutual hurt and injury;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="679e"/> and that they were also more simple and brave and temperate, and in all ways more righteous?  And the cause of this state of things we have already explained.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite true.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="680">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We must bear in mind that the whole purpose of what we have said and of what we are going to say next is this,—that we may understand
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="680"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="680a"/> what possible need of laws the men of that time had, and who their lawgiver was.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Excellent.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we suppose that those men had no need of lawgivers, and that in those days it was not as yet usual to have such a thing?  For those born in that age of the world’s history did not as yet possess the art of writing, but lived by following custom and what is called patriarchal law.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is certainly probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But this already amounts to a kind of government.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kind?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="680b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Everybody, I believe, gives the name of <q type="emph">headship</q> to the government which then existed,—and it still continues to exist to-day among both Greeks and barbarians in many quarters.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.  <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 1.1252b.17">Aristot. Pol. 1252b 17ff</bibl>.  This <q type="emph">headship,</q> which is the hereditary personal authority of the father of a family or chief of a clan, we should term <q type="emph">patriarchy.</q></note> And, of course, Homer mentions its existence in connection  with the household system of the Cyclopes, where he says— <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">No halls of council and no laws are theirs,</l><l>But within hollow caves on mountain heights</l><l>Aloft they dwell, each making his own law.</l></quote>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> This poet of yours seems to have been a man of genius.  We have also read other verses of his, and they were extremely fine; though in truth we have not read much of him, since we Cretans do not indulge much in foreign poetry.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> But we Spartans do, and we regard Homer as the best of them; all the same, the mode of life he describes is always Ionian rather than Laconian.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="680d"/> And now he appears to be confirming your statement admirably, when in his legendary account he ascribes the primitive habits of the Cyclopes to their savagery.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, his testimony supports us; so let us take him as evidence that polities of this sort do sometimes come into existence.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Did they not originate with those people who lived scattered in separate clans or in single households, owing to the distress which followed after the catastrophes; for amongst these the eldest holds rule, owing to the fact that the rule proceeds from the parents,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="680e"/> by following whom they form a single flock, like a covey of birds, and live under a patriarchal government and a kingship which is of all kingships the most just?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="681">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Next, they congregate together in greater numbers, and form larger droves; and first they turn to farming on the hill-sides,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="681"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="681a"/> and make ring-fences of rubble and walls to ward off wild beasts, till finally they have constructed a single large common dwelling.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is certainly probable that such was the course of events.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, is not this also probable?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That, while these larger settlements were growing out of the original small ones, each of the small settlements continued to retain, clan by clan, both the rule of the eldest
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="681b"/> and also some customs derived from its isolated condition and peculiar to itself.  As those who begot and reared them were different, so these customs of theirs, relating to the gods and to themselves, differed, being more orderly where their forefathers had been orderly, and more brave where they had been brave; and as thus the fathers of each clan in due course stamped upon their children and children’s children their own cast of mind, these people came (as we say) into the larger community furnished each with their own peculiar laws.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="681c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And no doubt each clan was well pleased with its own laws, and less well with those of its neighbors.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Unwittingly, as it seems, we have now set foot, as it were, on the starting-point of legislation.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We have indeed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The next step necessary is that these people should come together and choose out some members of each clan who, after a survey of the legal usages of all the clans, shall notify publicly to the tribal leaders and chiefs (who may be termed their <q type="emph">kings</q>) which of those usages please them best,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="681d"/> and shall recommend their adoption.  These men will themselves be named <q type="emph">legislators,</q> and when they have established the chiefs as <q type="emph">magistrates,</q> and have framed an aristocracy, or possibly even a monarchy, from the existing plurality of <q type="emph">headships,</q> they will live under the constitution thus transformed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> The next steps would certainly be such as you describe.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us go on to describe the rise of a third form of constitution, in which are blended all kinds and varieties of constitutions, and of States as well.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For this <q type="emph">mixed</q> polity of the <q type="emph">city of the plain,</q> cp. the description of democracy in <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What form is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The same that Homer himself mentioned next to the second, when he said that the third form arose in this way.  His verses run thus— <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Dardania he founded when as yet</l><l>The Holy keep of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> was not built</l><l>Upon the plain, a town for mortal folk,</l><l>But still they dwelt upon the highland slopes</l><l>Of many-fountained Ida.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

For being divinely inspired in its chanting, the poetic tribe, with the aid of Graces and Muses, often grasps the truth of history.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It certainly does.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now let us advance still further in the tale that now engages us; for possibly it may furnish some hint regarding the matter we have in view.  Ought we not to do so?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="682b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> was founded, we say, after moving from the highlands down to a large and noble plain, on a hill of no great height which had many rivers flowing down from Ida above.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So they say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And do we not suppose that this took place many ages after the Deluge?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Many ages after, no doubt.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> At any rate they seem to have been strangely forgetful
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="682c"/> of the catastrophe now mentioned, since they placed their city, as described, under a number of rivers descending from the mount, and relied for their safety upon hillocks of no great height.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So it is evident that they were removed by quite a long interval from that calamity.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> By this time, too, as mankind multiplied, many other cities had been founded.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And these cities also made attacks on <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, probably by sea too, as well as by land, since by this time all made use of the sea fearlessly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> So it appears.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now during this period of ten years, while the siege lasted, the affairs of each of the besiegers at home suffered much owing to the seditious conduct of the young men.  For when the soldiers returned to their own cities and homes,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="682e"/> these young people did not receive them fittingly and justly, but in such a way that there ensued a vast number of cases of death, slaughter, and exile.  So they, being again driven out, migrated by sea; and because Dorieus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">We do not hear of him elsewhere; and the account here is so vague that it is hard to say what events (or traditions) are alluded to.  The usual story is that Dorian invaders drove out the Achaeans from S.

<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Quite true.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="683">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And now—as it were by divine direction—we have returned once more to the very point in our discourse on laws where we made our digression,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 638d">Plat.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="683"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="683a"/> about which you said truly that it and <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> were settled under kindred laws.  From the wandering course of our argument, and our excursion through various polities and settlements, we have now gained this much:  we have discerned a first, a second and a third State,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., (1) the family or clan, under patriarchal <q type="emph">headship</q>; (2) the combination of clans under an aristocracy (or monarchy); (3) the <q type="emph">mixed</q> state (or <q type="emph">city of the plain,</q> like <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>); and (4) the confederacy, consisting, in the example, of three States leagued together.</note> all, as we suppose, succeeding one another in the settlements which took place during vast ages of time.  And now there has emerged this fourth State—or <q type="emph">nation,</q> if you so prefer—which was once upon a time in course of establishment and is now established.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="683b"/> Now, if we can gather from all this which of these settlements was right and which wrong, and which laws keep safe what is kept safe, and which laws ruin what is mined, and what changes in what particulars would effect the happiness of the State,—then, O Megillus and Clinias, we ought to describe these things again, making a fresh start from the beginning,—unless we have some fault to find with our previous statements.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I can assure you, Stranger, that if some god were to promise us that,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="683c"/> in making this second attempt to investigate legislation, we shall listen to a discourse that is no worse and no shorter than that we have just been listening to, I for one would go a long way to hear it; indeed, this would seem quite a short day, although it is, as a matter of fact, close on midsummer.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So it seems that we must proceed with our enquiry.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us, then, place ourselves in imagination at that epoch when <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, together with <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and the adjoining districts, had become completely subject,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="683d"/> Megillus, to your forefathers. They determined next, according to the tradition, to divide their host into three parts, and to establish three States,—<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And Temenus became King of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Cresphontes of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and Proclus and Eurysthenes of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And all the men of that time swore that they would assist these kings
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="683e"/> if anyone should try to wreck their kingdoms.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Quite so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is the dissolution of a kingdom, or of any government that has ever yet been dissolved, caused by any other agency than that of the rulers themselves?  Or, though we made this assertion a moment ago when we happened upon this subject, have we now forgotten it?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Laws 682d">Plat.

 <p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> How could we possibly have forgotten?</said></p></div>
 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="684">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we further confirm that assertion now?  For we have come to the same view now, as it appears, in dealing with facts of history; so that we shall be examining it with reference not to a mere abstraction,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="684"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="684a"/> but to real events.  Now what actually took place was this:  each of the three royal houses, and the cities under their sway, swore to one another,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Laws 692b">Plat. Laws 692b</bibl>.</note> according to the laws, binding alike on ruler and subject, which they had made,—the rulers that, as time went on and the nation advanced, they would refrain from making their rule more severe, and the subjects that, so long as the rulers kept fast to their promise, they would never upset the monarchy themselves, nor would they allow others to do so; and they swore that the kings should aid both kings and peoples
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="684b"/> when wronged, and the peoples aid both peoples and kings.  Was not that the way of it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> It was.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In the polities legally established—whether by the kings or others—in the three States, was not this the most important principle?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That the other two States should always help against the third, whenever it disobeyed the laws laid down.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Evidently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And surely most people insist on this,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="684c"/> that the lawgivers shall enact laws of such a kind that the masses of the people accept them willingly; just as one might insist that trainers or doctors should make their treatments or cures of men’s bodies pleasurable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Exactly so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But in fact one often has to be content if one can bring a body into a sound and healthy state with no great amount of pain.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Very true.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="684d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The men of that age possessed also another advantage which helped not a little to facilitate legislation.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 736c">Plat. Laws 736c</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What was that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Their legislators, in their efforts to establish equality of property, were free from that worst of accusations which is commonly incurred in States with laws of a different kind, whenever anyone seeks to disturb the occupation of land, or to propose the abolition of debts, since he perceives that without these measures equality could never be fully secured.  In such cases, if the lawgiver attempts to disturb any of these things,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="684e"/> everyone confronts him with the cry, <q type="spoken">Hands off,</q> and they curse him for introducing redistributions of land and remissions of debts, with the result that every man is rendered powerless.  But the Dorians had this further advantage, that they were free from all dread of giving offence, so that they could divide up their land without dispute; and they had no large debts of old standing.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e., the Dorian settlers, by right of conquest, were free to do as they pleased:  none of the old owners or creditors could assert rights or claims.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> True</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How was it then, my good sirs, that their settlement and legislation turned out so badly?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="685">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="685"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="685a"/><label>Meg.</label> What do you mean?  What fault have you to find with it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This, that whereas there were three States settled, two of the three<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">viz., <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>,—the third being <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. </note> speedily wrecked their constitution and their laws, and one only remained stable—and that was your State, Megillus.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> The question is no easy one.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet surely in our consideration and enquiry into this subject, indulging in an old man’s sober play with laws, we ought to proceed on our journey
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="685b"/> painlessly, as we said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 625b">Plat. Laws 625b</bibl>.</note> when we first started out.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly, we must do as you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, what laws would offer a better subject for investigation than the laws by which those States were regulated?  Or what larger or more famous States are there about whose settling we might enquire?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> It would be hard to mention better instances than these.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is fairly evident that the men of that age intended this organization of theirs to serve as an adequate protection
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="685c"/> not only for the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, but for the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> as well, in case any of the barbarians should attack them just as the former dwellers around <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> were emboldened to embark on the Trojan War through reliance on the Assyrian power as it had been in the reign of <placeName key="tgn,7017998">Ninus</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> The mythical founder of the Assyrian empire, husband of Semiramis, and builder of <placeName key="tgn,7017998">Nineveh</placeName> (dated about <date when="-2200">2200</date> B.C.).</note> For much of the splendor of that empire still survived and the people of that age stood in fear of its confederate power, just as we men of today dread the Great King.  For since <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was a part of the Assyrian empire, the second<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The first <q type="emph">capture</q> was by Heracles, in the reign of Laomedon, father of Priam.  Cp. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.640">Hom. Il. 5.640 ff</bibl>.</note> capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="685d"/> formed a grave charge against the Greeks.  It was in view of all this that the Dorian host was at that time organizes and distributed amongst three States under brother princes, the sons of Heracles<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">viz., Temenus, king of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Procles and Eurystheus of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, Cresphontes of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>.</note>; and men thought it admirably devised, and in its equipment superior even to the host that had sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.  For men reckoned, first, that in the sons of Heracles they had better chiefs than the Pelopidae,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">viz., Agamemnon and Menelaus.</note> and further,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="685e"/> that this army was superior in valor to the army which went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, since the latter, which was Achaean, was worsted by the former, which was Dorian.  Must we not suppose that it was in this way, and with this intention, that the men of that age organized themselves?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="686">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is it not also probable that they would suppose this to be a stable arrangement, and likely to continue quite a long time,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="686"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="686a"/> since they had shared together many toils and dangers, and were marshalled under leaders of a single family (their princes being brothers), and since, moreover, they had consulted a number of diviners and, amongst others, the Delphian Apollo?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> That is certainly probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But it seems that these great expectations speedily vanished, except only, as we said, in regard to that small fraction, your State of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="686b"/> and ever since, up to the present day, this fraction has never ceased warring against the other two.  For if the original intention had been realized, and if they had been in accord about their policy, it would have created a power invincible in war.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> It certainly would.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How then, and by what means, was it destroyed?  Is it not worth while to enquire by what stroke of fortune so grand a confederacy was wrecked?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Yes for, if one passed over these examples,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="686c"/> one would not be likely to find elsewhere either laws or constitutions which preserve interests thus fair and great, or, on the contrary, wreck them totally.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus by a piece of good luck, as it seems, we have embarked on an enquiry of some importance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now, my dear sir, do not men in general, like ourselves at the present moment, unconsciously fancy that every fine object they set eyes on would produce marvellous results, if only a man understood the right way to make a fine use of it?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="686d"/> But for us to hold such an idea in regard to the matter before us would possibly be both wrong and against nature; and the same is true of all other cases where men hold such ideas.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What is it you mean?  And what shall we say is the special point of your remarks ?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Why, my dear sir, I had a laugh at my own expense just now.  For when I beheld this armament of which we are speaking, I thought it an amazingly fine thing, and that, if anyone had made a fine use of it at that time, it would have proved, as I said,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="686e"/> a wonderful boon to the Greeks.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> And was it not quite right and sensible of you to say this, and of us to endorse it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Possibly; I conceive, however, that everyone, when he beholds a thing that is large, powerful and strong, is instantly struck by the conviction that, if its possessor knew how to employ an instrument of that magnitude and quality, he could make himself happy by many wonderful achievements.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="687">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="687"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="687a"/><label>Meg.</label> Is not that a right conviction?  Or what is your view?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Just consider what one ought to have in view in every instance, in order to justify the bestowal of such praise.  And first, with regard to the matter now under discussion,—if the men who were then marshalling the army knew how to organize it properly, how would they have achieved success?  Must it not have been by consolidating it firmly and by maintaining it perpetually, so that they should be both free themselves and masters over all others whom they chose, and so that both they and their children should do
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="687b"/> in general just what they pleased throughout the world of Greeks and barbarians alike?  Are not these the reasons why they would be praised?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And in every case where a man uses the language of eulogy on seeing great wealth or eminent family distinctions or anything else of the kind, would it not be true to say that, in using it, he has this fact specially in mind,—that the possessor of such things is likely, just because of this, to realize all, or at least the most and greatest, of his desires.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> That is certainly probable.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="687c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, is there one object of desire—that now indicated by our argument—which is common to all men?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The desire that, if possible, everything,—or failing that, all that is humanly possible—should happen in accordance with the demands of one’s own heart.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> To he sure.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Since this, then, is what we all wish always, alike in childhood and manhood and old age, it is for this, necessarily, that we should pray continually.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Of course.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="687d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, on behalf of our friends we will join in making the same prayer which they make on their own behalf.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> To be sure.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And a son is a friend to his father, the boy to the man.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet the father will often pray the gods that the things which the son prays to obtain may in no wise he granted according to the son’s prayers.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Do you mean, when the son who is praying is still young and foolish?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, and also when the father, either through age or through the hot temper of youth,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="687e"/> being devoid of all sense of right and justice, indulges in the vehement prayers of passion (like those of Theseus against Hippolytus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Hippolytus was accused by his stepmother, Phaedra, of attempting to dishonor her:  therefore his father (Theseus) invoked a curse upon him, and Poseidon (father of Theseus) sent a bull which scared the horses of H.’s chariot so that they upset the chariot and dragged him till he was dead.</note>, when he met his luckless end), while the son, on the contrary, has a sense of justice,—in this case do you suppose that the son will echo his father’s prayers?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I grasp your meaning.  You mean, as I suppose, that what a man ought to pray and press for is not that everything should follow his own desire, while his desire in no way follows his own reason; but it is the winning of wisdom that everyone of us, States and individuals alike, ought to pray for and strive after.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="688">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="688"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="688a"/><label>Ath.</label> Yes.  And what is more, I would recall to your recollection, as well as to my own, how it was said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 630d">Plat. Laws 630d ff</bibl>.</note> (if you remember) at the outset that the legislator of a State, in settling his legal ordinances, must always have regard to wisdom.  The injunction you gave was that the good lawgiver must frame all his laws with a view to war:  I, on the other hand, maintained that, whereas by your injunction the laws would be framed with reference to one only of the four virtues, it was really essential
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="688b"/> to look to the whole of virtue, and first and above all to pay regard to the principal virtue of the four, which is wisdom and reason and opinion, together with the love and desire that accompany them.  Now the argument has come hack again to the same point, and I now repeat my former statement,—in jest, if you will, or else in earnest; I assert that prayer is a perilous practice for him who is devoid of reason, and that what he obtains is the opposite of his desires.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="688c"/> For I certainly expect that, as you follow the argument recently propounded, you will now discover that the cause of the ruin of those kingdoms, and of their whole design, was not cowardice or ignorance of warfare on the part either of the rulers or of those who should have been their subjects; but that what ruined them was badness of all other kinds, and especially ignorance concerning the greatest of human interests.  That this was the course of events then, and is so still,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="688d"/> whenever such events occur, and will be so likewise in the future,—this, with your permission, I will endeavor to discover in the course of the coming argument, and to make it as clear as I can to you, my very good friends.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Verbal compliments are in poor taste, Stranger; but by deed, if not by word, we shall pay you the highest of compliments by attending eagerly to your discourse; and that is what best shows whether compliments are spontaneous or the reverse.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Capital, Clinias!  Let us do just as you say. 
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="688e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It shall be so, God willing.  Only say on.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, to advance further on the track of our discourse,—we assert that it was ignorance, in its greatest form, which at that time destroyed the power we have described, and which naturally produces still the same results; and if this is so, it follows that the lawgiver must try to implant in States as much wisdom as possible, and to root out folly to the utmost of his power.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Obviously.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="689">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="689"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="689a"/><label>Ath.</label> What kind of ignorance would deserve to be called the <q type="emph">greatest</q>?  Consider whether you will agree with my description; I take it to be ignorance of this kind,—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kind?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That which we see in the man who hates, instead of loving, what he judges to be noble and good, while he loves and cherishes what he judges to be evil and unjust.  That want of accord, on the part of the feelings of pain and pleasure, with the rational judgment is, I maintain, the extreme form of ignorance, and also the <q type="emph">greatest</q> because it belongs to the main mass of the soul,—
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="689b"/> for the part of the soul that feels pain and pleasure corresponds to the mass of the populace in the State.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In this comparison between the Soul and the State both are regarded as consisting of two parts or elements, the ruling and the ruled, of which the former is the noblest, but the latter the <q type="emph">greatest</q> in bulk and extent.  The ruling element in the Soul is Reason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς, λόγος</foreign>), and in the State it is Law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) and its exponents:  the subject element in the Soul consists of sensations, emotions and desires, which (both in hulk and in irrationality) correspond to the mass of the <q type="foreign">volgus</q> in the State.  Plato’s usual division of the Soul is into three parts—reason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>), passion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμός</foreign>), and desire (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθυμία</foreign>):  cp. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 435a">Plat. Rep. 435ff</bibl>.</note> So whenever this part opposes what are by nature the ruling principles—knowledge, opinion, or reason,—this condition I call folly, whether it be in a State, when the masses disobey the rulers and the laws, or in an individual, when the noble elements of reason existing in the soul produce no good effect, but quite the contrary.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="689c"/> All these I would count as the most discordant forms of ignorance, whether in the State or the individual, and not the ignorance of the artisan,—if you grasp my meaning, Strangers.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We do, my dear sir, and we agree with it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then let it be thus resolved and declared, that no control shall be entrusted to citizens thus ignorant, but that they shall be held in reproach for their ignorance, even though they be expert calculators, and trained in all accomplishments and in everything that fosters agility
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="689d"/> of soul, while those whose mental condition is the reverse of this shall be entitled <q type="emph">wise,</q> even if—as the saying goes—<q type="spoken">they spell not neither do they swim</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., are ignorant of even the most ordinary accomplishments. </note>; and to these latter, as to men of sense, the government shall be entrusted.  For without harmony,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 430e">Plat. Rep. 430e; 591d</bibl>.</note> my friends, how could even the smallest fraction of wisdom exist? It is impossible.  But the greatest and best of harmonies would most properly be accounted the greatest wisdom; and therein he who lives rationally has a share, whereas he who is devoid thereof
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="689e"/> will always prove to be a home-wrecker and anything rather than a saviour of the State, because of his ignorance in these matters.  So let this declaration stand, as we recently said, as one of our axioms.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, let it stand.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is it not plain that what those kings strove for first was to get the better of the established laws, and that they were not in accord with one another about the pledge which they had approved both by word and by oath; and this discord—reputed to be wisdom, but really, as we affirm, the height of ignorance, owing to its grating dissonance and lack of harmony, brought the whole Greek world to ruin?</said></p>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="691b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very well then: what precaution ought the legislator to have taken at that time in his enactments, to guard against the growth of this disorder?  Verily, to perceive that now requires no great sagacity, nor is it a hard thing to declare; but the man who foresaw it in those days—if it could possibly have been foreseen—would have been a wiser man than we.</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If one neglects the rule of due measure, and gives things too great in power to things too small—sails to ships, food to bodies, offices of rule to souls—then everything is upset, and they run, through excess of insolence, some to bodily disorders, others to that offspring of insolence, injustice.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Soph.

There does not exist, my friends, a mortal soul whose nature, when young and irresponsible, will ever be able to stand being in the highest ruling position upon earth without getting surfeited in mind with that greatest of disorders,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="691d"/> folly, and earning the detestation of its nearest friends; and when this occurs, it speedily ruins the soul itself and annihilates the whole of its power.  To guard against this, by perceiving the due measure, is the task of the great lawgiver.

In the next place, some man,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Lycurgus.</note> in whom human nature was blended with power divine, observing your government to be still swollen with fever, blended the self-willed force
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="692"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="692a"/> of the royal strain with the temperate potency of age, by making the power of the eight-and-twenty elders of equal weight with that of the kings in the greatest matters.

Thus, in your case, according to this account, owing to its being blended of the right elements and possessed of due measure, the kingship not only survived itself but ensured the survival of all else.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="692b"/> For if the matter had lain with Temenus and Cresphontes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> See <bibl n="Plat. Laws 683d">Plat.

But when I say <q type="emph">disgraceful,</q> I do not imply that they did not win fine victories both by land and sea in those victorious campaigns:  what I call <q type="emph">disgraceful</q> is this,—that, in the first place, one only of those three States defended Greece, while the other two were so basely corrupt that one of them<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName></note> actually prevented <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> from assisting Greece by warring against her with all its might, and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the other,—which stood first of the three in the days of the Dorian settlement—

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="693">

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="693"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="693a"/> and Lacedaemonians, practically all the Greek races would have been confused together by now, and barbarians confused with Greeks and Greeks with barbarians,—just as the races under the Persian empire today are either scattered abroad or jumbled together and live in a miserable plight.  Such, O Megillus and Clinias, are the charges we have to make against the so-called statesmen and lawgivers, both of the past and of the present, in order that, by investigating their causes, we may discover
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="693b"/> what different course ought to have been pursued; just as, in the case before us, we called it a blunder to establish by law a government that is great or unblended, our idea being that a State ought to be free and wise and in friendship with itself, and that the lawgiver should legislate with a view to this.  Nor let it surprise us that, while we have often already proposed ends which the legislator should, as we say, aim at in his legislation,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="693c"/> the various ends thus proposed are apparently different.  One needs to reflect that wisdom and friendship, when stated to be the aim in view, are not really different aims, but identical and, if we meet with many other such terms, let not this fact disturb us.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We shall endeavor to bear this in mind as we traverse the arguments again.  But for the moment, as regards friendship, wisdom and freedom,—tell us,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="693d"/> what was it you intended to say that the lawgiver ought to aim at?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Listen.  There are two mother-forms of constitution, so to call them, from which one may truly say all the rest are derived.  Of these the one is properly termed monarchy, the other democracy, the extreme case of the former being the Persian polity, and of the latter the Athenian; the rest are practically all, as I said, modifications of these two.  Now it is essential for a polity to partake of both these two forms, if it is to have freedom and friendliness combined with wisdom.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="693e"/> And that is what our argument intends to enjoin, when it declares that a State which does not partake of these can never be rightly constituted.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It could not.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="694">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Since the one embraced monarchy and the other freedom, unmixed and in excess, neither of them has either in due measure:  your Laconian and Cretan States are better in this respect, as were the Athenian and Persian in old times—
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="694"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="694a"/> in contrast to their present condition.  Shall we expound the reasons for this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means—that is if we mean to complete the task we have set ourselves.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us attend then.  When the Persians, under Cyrus, maintained the due balance between slavery and freedom, they became, first of all, free themselves, and, after that, masters of many others. For when the rulers gave a share of freedom to their subjects and advanced them to a position of equality, the soldiers were more friendly
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="694b"/> towards their officers and showed their devotion in times of danger; and if there was any wise man amongst them, able to give counsel, since the king was not jealous but allowed free speech and respected those who could help at all by their counsel,—such a man had the opportunity of contributing to the common stock the fruit of his wisdom.  Consequently, at that time all their affairs made progress, owing to their freedom, friendliness and mutual interchange of reason.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Probably that is pretty much the way in which the matters you speak of took place.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="694c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How came it, then, that they were ruined in Cambyses’ reign, and nearly restored again under Darius?  Shall I use a kind of divination to picture this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes that certainly will help us to gain a view of the object of our search.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What I now divine regarding Cyrus is this,—that, although otherwise a good and patriotic commander, he was entirely without a right education, and had paid no attention to household management.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What makes us say this?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="694d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Probably he spent all his life from boyhood in soldiering, and entrusted his children to the women folk to rear up; and they brought them up from earliest childhood as though they had already attained to Heaven’s favour and felicity, and were lacking in no celestial gift; and so by treating them as the special favorites of Heaven, and forbidding anyone to oppose them, in anything, and compelling everyone to praise their every word and deed, they reared them up into what they were.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A fine rearing, I should say!
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="694e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Say rather, a womanish rearing by royal women lately grown rich, who, while the men were absent, detained by many dangers and wars, reared up the children.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That sounds reasonable.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="695">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And their father, while gaining flocks and sheep and plenty of herds, both of men and of many other chattels,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="695"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="695a"/> yet knew not that the children to whom he should bequeath them were without training in their father’s craft, which was a hard one, fit to turn out shepherds of great strength, able to camp out in the open and to keep watch and, if need be, to go campaigning.  He overlooked the fact that his sons were trained by women and eunuchs and that the indulgence shown them as <q type="soCalled">Heaven’s darlings</q> had ruined their training, whereby they became
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="695b"/> such as they were likely to become when reared with a rearing that <q type="emph">spared the rod.</q>  So when, at the death of Cyrus, his sons took over the kingdom, over-pampered and undisciplined as they were, first, the one killed the other,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., Cambyses killed Smerdis.</note> through annoyance at his being put on an equality with himself, and presently, being mad with drink and debauchery, he lost his own throne at the hands of the Medes, under the man then called the Eunuch,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., the Magian, Gomates, who personated Smerdis and claimed the kingdom.  After seven months’ reign this usurper was slain by seven Persian nobles, of whom Darius was one (<date when="-0521">521</date> B.C.).</note> who despised the stupidity of Cambyses.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That, certainly, is the story, and probably it is near to
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="695c"/> the truth.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Further, the story tells how the kingdom was restored to the Persians through Darius and the Seven.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It does.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us follow the story and see how things went.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 3.68">Hdt. 3.68-88</bibl>.</note> Darius was not a king’s son, nor was he reared luxuriously.  When he came and seized the kingdom, with his six companions, he divided it into seven parts, of which some small vestiges remain even to this day;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="695d"/> and he thought good to manage it by enacting laws into which he introduced some measure of political equality, and also incorporated in the law regulations about the tribute-money which Cyrus had promised the Persians, whereby he secured friendliness and fellowship amongst all classes of the Persians, and won over the populace by money and gifts; and because of this, the devotion of his armies won for him as much more land as Cyrus had originally bequeathed.  After Darius came Xerxes, and he again was brought up with the luxurious rearing of a royal house:  <q type="spoken">O Darius</q>—for it is thus one may rightly address the father—<q type="spoken">how is it that you have ignored the blunder of Cyrus, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="695e"/> and have reared up Xerxes in just the same habits of life in which Cyrus reared Cambyses?</q>  And Xerxes, being the product of the same training, ended by repeating almost exactly the misfortunes of Cambyses.  Since then there has hardly ever been a single Persian king who was really, as well as nominally, <q type="emph">Great.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Persian monarch was commonly styled <q type="soCalled">the Great King.</q></note></said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="696">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And, as our argument asserts, the cause of this does not lie in luck,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="696"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="696a"/> but in the evil life which is usually lived by the sons of excessively rich monarchs; for such an upbringing can never produce either boy or man or greybeard of surpassing goodness.  To this, we say, the lawgiver must give heed,—as must we ourselves on the present occasion.  It is proper, however, my Lacedaemonian friends, to give your State credit for this at least,—that you assign no different honor or training whatsoever to poverty or wealth, to the commoner or the king,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="696b"/> beyond what your original oracle<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The laws of Lycurgus.</note> declared at the bidding of some god.  Nor indeed is it right that pre-eminent honors in a State should be conferred on a man because he is specially wealthy, any more than it is right to confer them because he is swift or comely or strong without any virtue, or with a virtue devoid of temperance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What do you mean by that, Stranger?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But justice, surely, is not bred apart from temperance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Impossible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Nor is he whom we recently proposed<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 689d">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="696d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Here is a further point we must consider, in order to judge about the conferment of honors in States, when they are right and when wrong.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What point?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If temperance existed alone in a man’s soul, divorced from all the rest of virtue, would it justly be held in honor or the reverse?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I cannot tell what reply to make.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet, in truth, you have made a reply, and a reasonable one.  For if you had declared for either of the alternatives in my question, you would have said what is, to my mind, quite out of tune.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> So it has turned out to be all right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very good.  Accordingly, the additional element in objects deserving of honor
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="696e"/> or dishonor will be one that demands not speech so much as a kind of speechless silence.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., <q type="emph">temperance,</q> regarded as merely an adjunct to civic merit, requires no further discussion at this point.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> I suppose you mean temperance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes.  And of the rest, that which, with the addition of temperance, benefits us most would best deserve to be held in the highest honor, and the second in degree of benefit put second in order of honor; and so with each of the others in succession—to each it will be proper to assign the honor due to its rank.</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Is it your wish that we should hand over the whole distribution to him, to deal with every case and all the details, while we—as legal enthusiasts ourselves also—confine ourselves to making a threefold division, and endeavor to distinguish what comes first in importance, and what second and third?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="697b"/> and to be as happy as it is possible for man to be, must of necessity dispense honors rightly.  And the right way is this:  it shall be laid down that the goods of the soul are highest in honor and come first, provided that the soul possesses temperance; second come the good and fair things of the body; and third the so-called goods of substance and property.  And if any law-giver or State transgresses these rules, either by promoting wealth to honors, or by raising one of the lower goods
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="697c"/> to a higher rank by means of honors, he will be guilty of a breach both of religion and of statesmanship.  Shall this be our declaration, or what?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It was our investigation of the polity of the Persians that caused us to discuss these matters at greater length.  We find that they grew still worse, the reason being, as we say, that by robbing the commons unduly of their liberty and introducing despotism in excess, they destroyed
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="697d"/> in the State the bonds of friendliness and fellowship.  And when these are destroyed, the policy of the rulers no longer consults for the good of the subjects and the commons, but solely for the maintenance of their own power; if they think that it will profit them in the least degree, they are ready at any time to overturn States and to overturn and burn up friendly nations; and thus they both hate and are hated with a fierce and ruthless hatred.  And when they come to need the commons, to fight in their support, they find in them no patriotism <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="697e"/> or readiness to endanger their lives in battle; so that, although they possess countless myriads of men, they are all useless for war, and they hire soldiers from abroad as though they were short of men, and imagine that their safety will be secured by hirelings and aliens.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="698">  
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And besides all this, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="698"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="698a"/> they inevitably display their ignorance, inasmuch as by their acts they declare that the things reputed to be honorable and noble in a State are never anything but dross compared to silver and gold.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So let this be the conclusion of our account of the Persian empire, and how its present evil administration is due to excess of slavery and of despotism.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> By all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We ought to examine next, in like manner, the Attic polity, and show how complete liberty, unfettered by any authority, is vastly inferior to a moderate form of government under elected magistrates.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="698b"/> At the time when the Persians made their onslaught upon the Greeks—and indeed one might say on nearly all the nations of Europe—we Athenians had an ancient constitution,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That of Solon.</note> and magistrates based on a fourfold grading; and we had Reverence, which acted as a kind of queen, causing us to live as the willing slaves of the existing laws.  Moreover, the vastness of the Persian armament that threatened us both by sea and land, by the desperate fear it inspired, bound us still more closely in the bonds of slavery
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="698c"/> to our rulers and our laws; and because of all this, our mutual friendliness and patriotism was greatly intensified.  It was just about ten years before the seafight at <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> that the Persian force arrived under Datis, whom Darius had despatched expressly against the Athenians and Eretrians, with orders to bring them back in chains, and with the warning that death would be the penalty of failure.  So within a very short time
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="698d"/> Datis, with his many myriads, captured by force the whole of the Eretrians; and to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> he sent on an alarming account of how not a man of the Eretrians had escaped him:  the soldiers of Datis had joined hands and swept the whole of <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> clean as with a draw-net.  This account—whether true, or whatever its origin—struck terror into the Greeks generally, and especially the Athenians; but when they sent out embassies in every direction to seek aid, all refused,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="698e"/> except the Lacedaemonians; and they were hindered by the war they were then waging against <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and possibly by other obstacles, about which we have no information, with the result that they arrived too late by one single day for the battle which took place at Marathon.  After this, endless threats and stories of huge preparations kept arriving from the Persian king.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="699">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Then, as time went on, news came that Darius was dead, and that his son, who had succeeded to the throne, was a young hothead, and still keen on the projected expedition.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="699"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="699a"/> The Athenians imagined that all these preparations were aimed against them because of the affair at Marathon; and when they heard of how the canal had been made through <placeName key="tgn,7002722">Athos</placeName>, and the bridge thrown over the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, and were told of the vast number of vessels in the Persian flotilla, then they felt that there was no salvation for them by land, nor yet by sea.  By land they had no hopes that anyone would come to their aid; for they remembered how, on the first arrival of the Persians and their subjugation of <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>, nobody helped them or
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="699b"/> ventured to join in the fight with them; and so they expected that the same thing would happen again on this occasion.  By sea, too, they saw no hope of safety, with more than a thousand war-ships bearing down against them.  One solitary hope of safety did they perceive—a slight one, it is true, and a desperate, yet the only hope—and it they derived from the events of the past, when victory in battle appeared to spring out of a desperate situation; and buoyed up by this hope, they discovered that they must rely for refuge on themselves only and on the gods.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="699c"/> So all this created in them a state of friendliness one towards another—both the fear which then possessed them, and that begotten of the past, which they had acquired by their subjection to the former laws—the fear to which, in our previous discussions,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Unless this fear had then seized upon our people, they would never have united in self-defence, nor would they have defended their temples and tombs and fatherland, and their relatives and friends as well,

Just reflect:  seeing that we Athenians suffered practically the same fate as the Persians—they through reducing their people to the extreme of slavery, we, on the contrary, by urging on our populace to the extreme of liberty—what are we to say was the sequel, if our earlier statements have been at all nearly correct?</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="700c"/> The authority whose duty it was to know these regulations, and, when known, to apply them in its judgments and to penalize the disobedient, was not a pipe nor, as now, the mob’s unmusical shoutings, nor yet the clappings which mark applause:  in place of this, it was a rule made by those in control of education that they themselves should listen throughout in silence, while the children and their ushers and the general crowd were kept in order by the discipline of the rod.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="700d"/> In the matter of music the populace willingly submitted to orderly control and abstained from outrageously judging by clamor; but later on, with the progress of time, there arose as leaders of unmusical illegality poets who, though by nature poetical, were ignorant of what was just and lawful in music; and they, being frenzied and unduly possessed by a spirit of pleasure, mixed dirges with hymns and paeans with dithyrambs, and imitated flute-tunes with harp-tunes, and blended every kind of music with every other;
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="700e"/> and thus, through their folly, they unwittingly bore false witness against music, as a thing without any standard of correctness, of which the best criterion is the pleasure of the auditor, be he a good man or a bad.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

But in this respect
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="705b"/> our State has compensation in the fact that it is all-productive;  and since it is hilly, it cannot be highly productive as well as all-productive;  if it were, and supplied many exports, it would be flooded in return with gold and silver money—the one condition of all, perhaps, that is most fatal, in a State, to the acquisition of noble and just habits of life,—as we said, if you remember, in our previous discourse.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

It asserted that those laws aimed at one single object;  and whereas you declared that this object was military strength, I made the rejoinder that, while it was right that such enactments should have virtue for their aim, I did not at all approve of that aim being restricted to a part, instead of applying to the whole.
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="705e"/> So do you now, in turn, keep a watch on my present lawmaking, as you follow it, in case I should enact any law either not tending to virtue at all, or tending only to a part of it.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="706">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> For I lay it down as an axiom that no law is rightly enacted which does not aim always, like an archer, at that object, and that alone, which is constantly
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="706"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="706a"/> accompanied by something ever-beautiful,—passing over every other object, be it wealth or anything else of the kind that is devoid of beauty.  To illustrate how the evil imitation of enemies, which I spoke of, comes about, when people dwell by the sea and are vexed by enemies, I will give you an example (though with no wish, of course, to recall to you painful memories).  When Minos, once upon a time, reduced the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="706b"/> to a grievous payment of tribute, he was very powerful by sea, whereas they possessed no warships at that time such as they have now, nor was their country so rich in timber that they could easily supply themselves with a naval force.  Hence they were unable quickly to copy the naval methods of their enemies and drive them off by becoming sailors themselves.  And indeed it would have profited them to lose seventy times seven children
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="706c"/> rather than to become marines instead of staunch foot-soldiers;  for marines are habituated to jumping ashore frequently and running back at full speed to their ships, and they think no shame of not dying boldly at their posts when the enemy attack;  and excuses are readily made for them, as a matter of course, when they fling away their arms and betake themselves to what they describe as <q type="emph">no dishonorable flight.</q>  These <q type="emph">exploits</q> are the usual result of employing naval soldiery, and they merit, not <q type="emph">infinite praise,</q> but precisely the opposite;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="706d"/> for one ought never to habituate men to base habits, and least of all the noblest section of the citizens.  That such an institution is not a noble one might have been learnt even from Homer.  For he makes Odysseus abuse Agamemnon for ordering the Achaeans to haul down their ships to the sea, when they were being pressed in fight by the Trojans;  and in his wrath he speaks thus:—
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="706e"/><quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Dost bid our people hale their fair-benched ships</l><l>Seaward, when war and shouting close us round?</l><l>So shall the Trojans see their prayers fulfilled,</l><l>And so on us shall sheer destruction fall!</l><l>For, when the ships are seaward drawn, no more</l><l>Will our Achaeans hold the battle up,</l><l>But, backward glancing, they will quit the fray:</l></quote> <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="707"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="707a"/><cit><quote type="verse"><l met="c">Thus baneful counsel such as thine will prove.</l></quote><bibl>Hom.

     <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> So Homer, too, was aware of the fact that triremes lined up in the sea alongside of infantry fighting on land are a bad thing:  why, even lions, if they had habits such as these, would grow used to running away from does!  Moreover, States dependent upon navies for their power give honors, as rewards for their safety, to a section of their forces that is not the finest;  for they owe their safety to the arts of the pilot, the captain and the rower—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="707b"/> men of all kinds and not too respectable,—so that it would be impossible to assign the honors to each of them rightly.

Since, however,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="707d"/> our present object is political excellence, it is the natural character of a country and its legal arrangements that we are considering;  so that we differ from most people in not regarding mere safety and existence as the most precious thing men can possess, but rather the gaining of all possible goodness and the keeping of it throughout life.

For you are not;  I presume, collecting all who wish to go from Greece; </said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="708">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> although I do, indeed, see in your country settlers from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="708"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="708a"/> and other parts of Greece.  So tell us now from what quarters the present expedition of citizens is likely to be drawn.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It will probably be from the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and of the rest of the Greeks, they seem most ready to admit people from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> as fellow-settlers.  For it is quite true, as you said just now, that we have some here from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, amongst them being the most famous of our clans, the Gortynian, which is a colony from <placeName key="perseus,Gortys">Gortys</placeName>, in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="708b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It would not be equally easy for States to conduct settlements in other cases as in those when, like a swarm of bees, a single clan goes out from a single country and settles, as a friend coming from friends, being either squeezed out by lack of room or forced by some other such pressing need.  At times, too, the violence of civil strife might compel a whole section of a State to emigrate;  and on one occasion an entire State went into exile, when it was totally crushed by an overpowering attack.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="708c"/> All such cases are in one way easier to manage, as regards settling and legislation, but in another way harder.  In the case where the race is one, with the same language and laws, this unity makes for friendliness, since it shares also in sacred rites and all matters of religion;  but such a body does not easily tolerate laws or polities which differ from those of its homeland.  Again, where such a body has seceded owing to civil strife due to the badness of the laws, but still strives to retain, owing to long habit, the very customs which caused its former ruin, then, because of this, it proves a difficult and intractable subject for the person who has control of its settlement and its laws.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="708d"/> On the other hand, the clan that is formed by fusion of various elements would perhaps be more ready to submit to new laws, but to cause it to share in one spirit and pant (as they say) in unison like a team of horses would be a lengthy task and most difficult.  But in truth legislation and the settlement of States are tasks that require men perfect above all other men in goodness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very probably;  but tell us still more clearly the purport of these observations.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="708e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> My good Sir, in returning to the subject of lawgivers in our investigation, I may probably have to cast a slur on them;  but if what I say is to the point, then there will be no harm in it.  Yet why should I vex myself?  For practically all human affairs seem to be in this same plight.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it you refer to?</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="709">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I was on the point of saying that no man ever makes laws,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="709"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="709a"/> but chances and accidents of all kinds, occurring in all sorts of ways, make all our laws for us.  For either it is a war that violently upsets polities and changes laws, or it is the distress due to grievous poverty.  Diseases, too, often force on revolutions, owing to the inroads of pestilences and recurring bad seasons prolonged over many years.  Foreseeing all this, one might deem it proper to say—as I said just now—that no mortal man frames any law,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="709b"/> but human affairs are nearly all matters of pure chance.  But the fact is that, although one may appear to be quite right in saying this about sea-faring and the arts of the pilot, the physician, and the general, yet there really is something else that we may say with equal truth about these same things.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That God controls all that is, and that Chance and Occasion co-operate with God in the control of all human affairs.  It is, however, less harsh to admit that these two must be accompanied by a third factor, which is Art.  For that the pilots’ art
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="709c"/> should cooperate with Occasion—verily I, for one, should esteem that a great advantage.  Is it not so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then we must grant that this is equally true in the other cases also, by parity of reasoning, including the case of legislation.  When all the other conditions are present which a country needs to possess in the way of fortune if it is ever to be happily settled, then every such State needs to meet with a lawgiver who holds fast to truth.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="709d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Would not, then, the man who possessed art in regard to each of the crafts mentioned be able to pray aright for that condition which, if it were given by Chance, would need only the supplement of his own art?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And if all the other craftsmen mentioned just now were bidden to state the object of their prayers, they could do so, could they not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And the lawgiver, I suppose, could do likewise?</said></p>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="710"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="710a"/> on our monarch’s soul, if the rest of his qualities are to be of any value.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Temperance, as I think, Megillus, is what the Stranger indicates as the necessary accompaniment.  Is it not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, Clinias;  temperance, that is, of the ordinary kind<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 698a">Plat. Laws 698a</bibl>;<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 82a">Plat. Phaedo 82a ff</bibl>.  The <q type="emph">academic</q> (or philosophic) identification of <q type="emph">virtue</q> with <q type="emph">wisdom</q> was a main feature in the ethics of Socrates;  cp.<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 430d">Plat. Rep. 430d ff</bibl>.</note> not the kind men mean when they use academic language and identify temperance with wisdom, but that kind which by natural instinct springs up at birth in children and animals, so that some are not incontinent, others continent, in respect of pleasures;  and of this we said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 696d">Plat. Laws 696d</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="710b"/> that, when isolated from the numerous so-called <q type="emph">goods,</q> it was of no account.  You understand, of course, what I mean.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let our monarch, then, possess this natural quality in addition to the other qualities mentioned, if the State is to acquire in the quickest and best way possible the constitution it needs for the happiest kind of life.  For there does not exist, nor could there ever arise, a quicker and better form of constitution than this.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="710c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How and by what argument, Stranger, could one convince oneself that to say this is to speak the truth?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is quite easy to perceive at least this, Clinias, that the facts stand by nature’s ordinance in the way described.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way do you mean?  On condition, do you say, that there should be a monarch who was young, temperate, quick at learning, with a good memory, brave and of a noble manner?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Add also <q type="emph">fortunate,</q>—not in other respects, but only in this, that in his time there should arise a praiseworthy lawgiver, and that, by a piece of good fortune,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="710d"/> the two of them should meet;  for if this were so, then God would have done nearly everything that he does when he desires that a State should be eminently prosperous.  The second best condition is that there should arise two such rulers;  then comes the third best, with three rulers;  and so on, the difficulty increasing in proportion as the number becomes greater, and vice versa.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You mean, apparently, that the best State would arise from a monarchy, when it has a first-rate lawgiver and a virtuous monarch, and these are the conditions under which the change into such a State could be effected most easily and quickly;  and, next to this, from an oligarchy—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="710e"/> or what is it you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Not at all:  the easiest step is from a monarchy, the next easiest from a monarchic constitution, the third from some form of democracy.  An oligarchy, which comes fourth in order, would admit of the growth of the best State only with the greatest difficulty, since it has the largest number of rulers.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="711">
<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> What I say is that the change takes place when nature supplies a true lawgiver, and when it happens that his policy is shared by the most powerful persons in the State;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="711"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="711a"/> and wherever the State authorities are at once strongest and fewest in number, then and there the changes are usually carried out with speed and facility.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?  We do not understand.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet surely it has been stated not once, I imagine, but many times over.  But you, very likely, have never so much as set eyes on a monarchical State.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No, nor have I any craving for such a sight.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="711b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You would, however, see in it an illustration of what we spoke of just now.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What was that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The fact that a monarch, when he decides to change the moral habits of a State, needs no great efforts nor a vast length of time, but what he does need is to lead the way himself first along the desired path, whether it be to urge the citizens towards virtue’s practices or the contrary;  by his personal example he should first trace out the right lines, giving praise and honor to these things,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="711c"/> blame to those, and degrading the disobedient according to their several deeds.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, we may perhaps suppose that the rest of the citizens will quickly follow the ruler who adopts such a combination of persuasion and force.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let none, my friends, persuade us that a State could ever change its laws more quickly or more easily by any other way than by the personal guidance of the rulers:  no such thing could ever occur, either now or hereafter.  Indeed, that is not the result which we find it difficult or impossible
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="711d"/> to bring about;  what is difficult to bring about is rather that result which has taken place but rarely throughout long ages, and which, whenever it does take place in a State, produces in that State countless blessings of every kind.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What result do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Whenever a heaven-sent desire for temperate and just institutions arises in those who hold high positions,—whether as monarchs, or because of conspicuous eminence
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="711e"/> of wealth or birth, or, haply, as displaying the character of Nestor, of whom it is said that, while he surpassed all men in the force of his eloquence, still more did he surpass them in temperance.  That was, as they say, in the Trojan age, certainly not in our time;  still, if any such man existed, or shall exist, or exists among us now, blessed is the life he leads, and blessed are they who join in listening to the words of temperance that proceed out of his mouth.</said></p></div>  
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="712">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> So likewise of power in general, the same rule holds good:
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="712"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="712a"/> whenever the greatest power coincides in man with wisdom and temperance, then the germ of the best polity is planted;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Regard this as a myth oracularly uttered, and let us take it as proved that the rise of a well-governed State is in one way difficult, but in another way—given, that is, the condition we mention—it is easier by far and quicker than anything else.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No doubt.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="712b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us apply the oracle to your State, and so try, like greybeard boys, to model its laws by our discourse.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 746a">Plat. Laws 746a</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, let us proceed, and delay no longer.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us invoke the presence of the God at the establishment of the State;  and may he hearken, and hearkening may he come, propitious and kindly to us-ward, to help us in the fashioning of the State and its laws.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, may he come!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, what form of polity is it that we intend to impose
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="712c"/> upon the State?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What, in particular, do you refer to?  Explain still more clearly.  I mean, is it a democracy, an oligarchy, an aristocracy, or a monarchy?  For certainly you cannot mean a tyranny:  that we can never suppose.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, which of you two would like to answer me first and tell me to which of these kinds his own polity at home belongs?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Is it not proper that I, as the elder, should answer first?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="712d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No doubt.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> In truth, Stranger, when I reflect on the Lacedaemonian polity, I am at a loss to tell you by what name one should describe it.  It seems to me to resemble a tyranny, since the board of ephors it contains is a marvellously tyrannical feature;  yet sometimes it strikes me as, of all States, the nearest to a democracy.  Still, it would be totally absurd to deny that it is an aristocracy;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="712e"/> while it includes, moreover, a life monarchy, and that the most ancient of monarchies, as is affirmed, not only by ourselves, but by all the world.  But now that I am questioned thus suddenly, I am really, as I said, at a loss to say definitely to which of these polities it belongs.</said></p>
 <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And I, Megillus, find myself equally perplexed;  for I find it very difficult to affirm that our Cnosian polity is any one of these.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="713">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, my good Sirs;  for you do, in fact, partake in a number of polities.  But those we named just now are not polities, but arrangements of States which rule or serve
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="713"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="713a"/> parts of themselves, and each is named after the ruling power.  But if the State ought to be named after any such thing, the name it should have borne is that of the God who is the true ruler of rational men.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Who is that God?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> May we, then, do a little more story-telling, if we are to answer this question suitably?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Should we not do so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We should.  Long ages before even those cities existed
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="713b"/> whose formation we have described above, there existed in the time of Cronos, it is said, a most prosperous government and settlement, on which the best of the States now existing is modelled.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Plt. 271a">Politic. 271</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Evidently it is most important to hear about it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I, for one, think so;  and that is why I have introduced the mention of it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> You were perfectly right to do so;  and, since your story
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="713c"/> is pertinent, you will be quite right in going on with it to the end.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I must do as you say.  Well, then, tradition tells us how blissful was the life of men in that age, furnished with everything in abundance, and of spontaneous growth.  And the cause thereof is said to have been this:  Cronos was aware of the fact that no human being (as we have explained<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 691c">Plat. Laws 691c, 691d</bibl>.</note>) is capable of having irresponsible control of all human affairs without becoming filled with pride and injustice;  so, pondering this fact, he then appointed as kings
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="713d"/> and rulers for our cities, not men, but beings of a race that was nobler and more divine, namely, daemons.  He acted just as we now do in the case of sheep and herds of tame animals:  we do not set oxen as rulers over oxen, or goats over goats, but we, who are of a nobler race, ourselves rule over them.  In like manner the God, in his love for humanity, set over us at that time the nobler race of daemons who, with much comfort to themselves and much to us, took charge of us and furnished peace
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="713e"/> and modesty and orderliness and justice without stint, and thus made the tribes of men free from feud and happy.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="714">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And even today this tale has a truth to tell, namely, that wherever a State has a mortal, and no god, for ruler, there the people have no rest from ills and toils;  and it deems that we ought by every means to imitate the life of the age of Cronos, as tradition paints it, and order both
    
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="714"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="714a"/> our homes and our States in obedience to the immortal element within us, giving to reason’s ordering the name of <q type="emph">law.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A double word-play:<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διανομάς</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονας</foreign>.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="714b"/> no means of salvation.  This, then, is the statement, Clinias, which we have to examine, to see whether we believe it, or what we are to do.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We must, of course, believe it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are you aware that, according to some, there are as many kinds of laws as there are kinds of constitutions?

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="714c"/> that the laws ought not to aim either at war or at goodness in general, but ought to have regard to the benefit of the established polity, whatever it may be, so that it may keep in power forever and never be dissolved;  and that the natural definition of justice is best stated in this way.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That justice is <q type="emph">what benefits the stronger.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 1.338">Plat. Rep. 1.338, 2.367</bibl>.</note>.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Explain yourself more clearly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This is how it is:—the laws (they say) in a State are always enacted by the stronger power? Is it not so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is quite true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do you suppose, then (so they argue), that a democracy
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="714d"/> or any other government—even a tyrant—if it has gained the mastery, will of its own accord set up laws with any other primary aim than that of securing the permanence of its own authority?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then the lawgiver will style these enactments <q type="emph">justice,</q> and will punish every transgressor as guilty of injustice.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Where offices of rule are open to contest, the victors in the contest monopolize power in the State so completely that they offer not the smallest share in office to the vanquished party or their descendants;  and each party keeps a watchful eye on the other,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="715b"/> lest anyone should come into office and, in revenge for the former troubles, cause a rising against them.  Such polities we, of course, deny to be polities, just as we deny that laws are true laws unless they are enacted in the interest of the common weal of the whole State.  But where the laws are enacted in the interest of a section, we call them feudalities<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A word coined (like the Greek) to suggest a constitution based on <q type="emph">feuds</q> or party-divisions.</note> rather than polities;  and the <q type="emph">justice</q> they ascribe to such laws is, we say, an empty name.  Our reason for saying this is that in your State we shall assign office to a man, not because he is wealthy,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="715c"/> nor because he possesses any other quality of the kind—such as strength or size or birth;  but the ministration of the laws must be assigned, as we assert, to that man who is most obedient to the laws and wins the victory for obedience in the State,—the highest office to the first, the next to him that shows the second degree of mastery, and the rest must similarly be assigned, each in succession, to those that come next in order.  And those who are termed <q type="emph">magistrates</q> I have now called <q type="emph">ministers</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="mentioned">Magistrates</q> = rulers;  <q type="mentioned">ministers</q> = subjects, or servants.</note> of the laws, not for the sake of coining a new phrase,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="715d"/> but in the belief that salvation, or ruin, for a State hangs upon nothing so much as this.  For wherever in a State the law is subservient and impotent, over that State I see ruin impending;  but wherever the law is lord over the magistrates, and the magistrates are servants to the law, there I descry salvation and all the blessings that the gods bestow on States.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Aye, by Heaven, Stranger;  for, as befits your age, you have keen sight.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us, then, speak to them thus:—<q type="spoken">O men, that God who, as old tradition<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Probably Orphic, quoted thus by the scholiast:<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς ἀρχή, Ζεὺς μέσσα, Διὸς δ’ ἐκ πάντα τέτυκται.</foreign></note> tells, holdeth the beginning, the end, and the center of all things that exist,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="716"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="716a"/> completeth his circuit by nature’s ordinance in straight, unswerving course.  With him followeth Justice, as avenger of them that fall short of the divine law;  and she, again, is followed by every man who would fain be happy, cleaving to her with lowly and orderly behavior;  but whoso is uplifted by vainglory, or prideth himself on his riches or his honors or his comeliness of body, and through this pride joined to youth and folly, is inflamed in soul with insolence, dreaming that he has no need of ruler or guide, but rather is competent himself to guide others,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="716b"/> such an one is abandoned and left behind by the God, and when left behind he taketh to him others of like nature, and by his mad prancings throweth all into confusion:  to many, indeed, he seemeth to be some great one, but after no long time he payeth the penalty, not unmerited, to Justice, when he bringeth to total ruin himself, his house, and his country.  Looking at these things, thus ordained, what ought the prudent man to do, or to devise, or to refrain from doing?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> The answer is plain:  Every man ought so to devise as to be of the number of those who follow in the steps of the God.

    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What conduct, then, is dear to God and in his steps?  One kind of conduct, expressed in one ancient phrase,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.218">Hom. Od. 17.218</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς αἰεὶ τὸν ὁμοῖον ἄγει θεὸς ὡς τὸν ὁμοῖον.</foreign> The expression <q type="emph">like to like</q> became proverbial, like our <q type="emph">Birds of a feather,</q> etc.  Usually it was applied more to the bad than to the good (or <q type="emph">moderate</q>) to which Plato here restricts it.</note> namely, that <q type="emph">like is dear to like</q> when it is moderate, whereas immoderate things are dear neither to one another nor to things moderate.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="716d"/> since he is like him, while he that is not temperate is unlike and at enmity,—as is also he who is unjust, and so likewise with the rest, by parity of reasoning.  On this there follows, let us observe, this further rule,—and of all rules it is the noblest and truest,—that to engage in sacrifice and communion with the gods continually, by prayers and offerings and devotions of every kind, is a thing most noble and good and helpful towards the happy life, and superlatively fitting also, for the good man; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="716e"/> but for the wicked, the very opposite.</said></p></div>

Here, then, is the mark at which we must aim;  but as to shafts we should shoot, and (so to speak) the flight of them,—what kind of shafts, think you, would fly most straight to the mark?  First of all, we say, if—after the honors paid to the Olympians and the gods who keep the State—we should assign the Even and the Left as their honors to the gods of the under-world, we would be aiming most straight at the mark of piety—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="717b"/> as also in assigning to the former gods the things superior, the opposites of these.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This account of the ritual proper to the worship of the various deities is obscure.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What terms?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="719c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> These:—<q type="spoken">There is, O lawgiver, an ancient saying—constantly repeated by ourselves and endorsed by everyone else—that whenever a poet is seated on the Muses’ tripod, he is not in his senses, but resembles a fountain, which gives free course to the upward rush of water and, since his art consists in imitation, he is compelled often to contradict himself, when he creates characters of contradictory moods;  and he knows not which of these contradictory utterances is true.  But it is not possible for the lawgiver in his law
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="719d"/> thus to compose two statements about a single matter;  but he must always publish one single statement about one matter.  Take an example from one of your own recent statements.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 717e">Plat.

Just as is the way with doctors, one treats us in this fashion, and another in that:  they have two different methods, which we may recall, in order that, like children who beg the doctor to treat them by the mildest method, so we may make a like request of the lawgiver.  Shall I give an illustration of what I mean?  There are men that are doctors, we say, and others that are doctors’ assistants;  but we call the latter also, to be sure, by the name of <q type="emph">doctors.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="720b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We do.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> These, whether they be free-born or slaves, acquire their art under the direction of their masters, by observation and practice and not by the study of nature—which is the way in which the free-born doctors have learnt the art themselves and in which they instruct their own disciples.  Would you assert that we have here two classes of what are called <q type="soCalled">doctors</q>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are also aware that, as the sick folk in the cities comprise both slaves and free men,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="720c"/> the slaves are usually doctored by slaves, who either run round the town or wait in their surgeries;  and not one of these doctors either gives or receives any account of the several ailments of the various domestics, but prescribes for each what he deems right from experience, just as though he had exact knowledge, and with the assurance of an autocrat;  then up he jumps and off he rushes to another sick domestic, and thus he relieves his master in his attendance on the sick.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="720d"/> But the free-born doctor is mainly engaged in visiting and treating the ailments of free men, and he does so by investigating them from the commencement and according to the course of nature;  he talks with the patient himself and with his friends, and thus both learns himself from the sufferers and imparts instruction to them, so far as possible;  and he gives no prescription until he has gained the patient’s consent, and only then, while securing the patient’s continued docility by means of persuasion,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="720e"/> does he attempt to complete the task of restoring him to health.  Which of these two methods of doctoring shows the better doctor, or of training, the better trainer?  Should the doctor perform one and the same function in two ways, or do it in one way only<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 634d">Plat. Laws 634d, 634e</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So it seems that, if the marriage laws were the first to be enacted, that would be the right course in every State.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most assuredly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us state the law in its simple form first:  how will it run?  Probably like this:—<q type="written">A man shall marry when he is thirty years old
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="721b"/> and under five and thirty;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">But cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 772d">Plat. Laws 772d</bibl>.</note> if he fails to do so, he shall be punished both by a fine in money and by degradation, the fine being of such and such an amount, and the degradation of such and such a kind.</q>  Such shall be the simple form of marriage law.  The double form shall be this,—<q type="written">A man shall marry when he is thirty years old and under thirty-five, bearing in mind that this is the way by which the human race, by nature’s ordinance, shares in immortality, a thing for which nature has implanted in everyone a keen desire.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="721c"/> The desire to win glory, instead of lying in a nameless grave, aims at a like object.  Thus mankind is by nature coeval with the whole of time, in that it accompanies it continually both now and in the future;  and the means by which it is immortal is this:—by leaving behind it children’s children and continuing ever one and the same, it thus by reproduction shares in immortality.  That a man should deprive himself thereof voluntarily is never an act of holiness;  and he who denies himself wife and children is guilty of such intentional deprivation.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="721d"/> He who obeys the law may be dismissed without penalty, but he that disobeys and does not marry when thirty-five years old shall pay a yearly fine of such and such an amount,—lest he imagine that single life brings him gain and ease,—and he shall have no share in the honors which are paid from time to time by the younger men in the State to their seniors.</q>  When one hears and compares this law with the former one, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="721e"/> it is possible to judge in each particular case whether the laws ought to be at least double in length, through combining threats with persuasion, or only single in length, through employing threats alone.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="722">
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Our Laconian way, Stranger, is to prefer brevity always.  But were I bidden to choose which of these two statutes I should desire to have enacted in writing in my State, I should choose the longer;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="722"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="722a"/> and what is more, I should make the same choice in the case of every law in which, as in the example before us, these two alternatives were offered.  It is necessary, however, that the laws we are now enacting should have the approval of our friend Clinias also;  for it is his State which is now proposing to make use of such things.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I highly approve of all you have said, Megillus.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Still, it is extremely foolish to argue about the length or brevity of writings, for what we should value, I suppose, is not their extreme brevity or prolixity,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="722b"/> but their excellence;  and in the case of the laws mentioned just now, not only does the one form possess double the value of the other in respect of practical excellence, but the example of the two kinds of doctors, recently mentioned,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 720c">Plat. Laws 720c</bibl>.</note> presents a very exact analogy.  But as regards this, it appears that no legislator has ever yet observed that, while it is in their power to make use in their law-making of two methods,—namely, persuasion and force,—in so far as that is feasible in dealing with the uncultured populace, they actually employ one method only:  in their legislation they do not temper compulsion
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="722c"/> with persuasion, but use untempered force alone.  And I, my dear sirs, perceive still a third requisite which ought to be found in laws, but which is nowhere to be found at present.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it you allude to?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> A matter which, by a kind of divine direction, has sprung out of the subjects we have now been discussing.  It was little more than dawn when we began talking about laws, and now it is high noon, and here we are in this entrancing resting-place;  all the time we have been talking of nothing but laws,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="722d"/> yet it is only recently that we have begun, as it seems, to utter laws, and what went before was all simply preludes to laws.  What is my object in saying this?  It is to explain that all utterances and vocal expressions have preludes and tunings-up (as one might call them), which provide a kind of artistic preparation which assists towards the further development of the subject.  Indeed, we have examples before us of preludes, admirably elaborated,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="722e"/> in those prefixed to that class of lyric ode called the <q type="term">nome,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

But for the <q type="term">nomes</q> (i.e. laws) which are real nomes—and which we designate <q type="emph">political</q>—no one has ever yet uttered a prelude, or composed or published one, just as though there were no such thing.  But our present conversation proves, in my opinion, that there is such a thing;  and it struck me just now that the laws we were then stating are something more than simply double, and consist of these two things combined—law, and prelude to law.</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="723b"/> the right term for it would be, not legal <q type="emph">statement,</q> but <q type="emph">prelude,</q> and no other word.  Having said this, what is the next statement I would desire to make?  It is this:  that the lawgiver must never omit to furnish preludes, as prefaces both to the laws as a whole and to each individual statute, whereby they shall surpass their original form by as much as the <q type="emph">double</q> examples recently given surpassed the <q type="emph">single.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I, for my part, would charge the expert in these matters to legislate thus, and not otherwise.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are right, I believe, Clinias, in asserting at least thus much,—that all laws have preludes, and that, in commencing each piece of legislation, one ought to preface each enactment with the prelude that naturally belongs to it—for the statement that is to follow the prelude is one of no small importance, and it makes a vast difference whether these statements are distinctly or indistinctly remembered;  still, we should be wrong if we prescribed that all statutes, great and small, should be equally provided with preludes.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="723d"/> For neither ought that to be done in the case of songs and speeches of every kind;  for they all naturally have preludes, but we cannot employ them always;  that is a thing which must be left in each case to the judgment of the actual orator or singer or legislator.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you say is, I believe, very true.  But let us not spend more time, Stranger, in delay, but return to our main subject, and start afresh (if you agree) from the statements you made above—and made not
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="723e"/> by way of prelude.  Let us, then, repeat from the start the second thoughts that are <q type="emph">best</q> (to quote the players’ proverb), treating them throughout as a prelude, and not, as before, as a chance discourse;  and let us handle the opening part as being confessedly a prelude.  As to the worship of the gods and the attention to be paid to ancestors, our previous statement<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 716b">Plat.

Of all a man’s own belongings, the most divine is his soul, since it is most his own.

But there is hardly a man of us all who pays honor rightly, although he fancies he does so;  for honor paid to a thing divine is beneficent, whereas nothing that is maleficent confers honor;  and he that thinks to magnify his soul by words or gifts or obeisances, while he is improving it no whit in goodness, fancies indeed that he is paying it honor, but in fact does not do so.  Every boy, for example, as soon as he has grown to manhood, deems himself capable of learning all things, and supposes that by lauding his soul he honors it,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="727b"/> and by eagerly permitting it to do whatsoever it pleases.  But by acting thus, as we now declare, he is not honoring his soul, but injuring it;  whereas, we affirm, he ought to pay honor to it next after the gods.  Again, when a man counts not himself but others responsible always for his own sins and for the most and greatest evils, and exempts himself always from blame, thereby honoring, as he fancies, his own soul,—then he is far indeed from honoring it,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="727c"/> since he is doing it injury.  Again, when a man gives way to pleasures contrary to the counsel and commendation of the lawgiver, he is by no means conferring honor on his soul, but rather dishonor, by loading it with woes and remorse.  Again, in the opposite case, when toils, fears, hardships and pains are commended, and a man flinches from them, instead of stoutly enduring them,—then by his flinching he confers no honor on his soul;  for by all such actions he renders it dishonored.  Again, when a man deems life at any price to be a good thing,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="727d"/> then also he does not honor, but dishonor, to his soul;  for he yields to the imagination of his soul that the conditions in Hades are altogether evil, instead of opposing it, by teaching and convincing his soul that, for all it knows, we may find, on the contrary, our greatest blessings in the realm of the gods below.  Again, when a man honors beauty above goodness, this is nothing else than a literal and total dishonoring of the soul;  for such a statement asserts that the body is more honorable than the soul,—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="727e"/> but falsely, since nothing earth-born is more honorable than the things of heaven, and he that surmises otherwise concerning the soul knows not that in it he possesses, and neglects, a thing most admirable.</said></p></div>

To speak shortly:—in respect of the things which the lawgiver enumerates and describes as either, on the one hand, base and evil, or, on the other hand, noble and good, if any man refuses to avoid by every means the one kind, and with all his power to practise the other kind,—such a man knows not that
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="728b"/> everyone who acts thus is treating most dishonorably and most disgracefully that most divine of things, his soul.  Hardly anyone takes account of the greatest <q type="emph">judgment</q> (as men call it) upon evil-doing;  that greatest judgment is this,—to grow like unto men that are wicked, and, in so growing, to shun good men and good counsels and cut oneself off from them,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="728c"/> Now such a resultant condition is not a <q type="emph">judgment</q>  (for justice and judgment are things honorable) , but a punishment, an infliction that follows on injustice;  both he that undergoes this and he that undergoes it not are alike wretched,—the one in that he remains uncured, the other in that he is destroyed in order to secure the salvation of many others.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="728d"/> the avoidance of evil and the tracking and taking of what is best of all, and living in fellowship therewith, when he has taken it, for all his life thereafter.  Wherefore the soul is put second<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The first place belongs to the gods (i.e. to Divine Reason) .</note> in order of honor;  as for the third, everyone would conceive that this place naturally belongs to the honor due to the body.  But here again one has to investigate the various forms of honor,—which of them are genuine, which spurious;  and this is the lawgiver’s task.  Now he, as I suppose, declares that the honors are these and of these kinds:—the honorable body is not the fair body nor the strong nor <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="728e"/> the swift nor the large, nor yet the body that is sound in health, although this is what many believe;  neither is it a body of the opposite kind to any of these;  rather those bodies which hold the mean position between all these opposite extremes are by far the most temperate and stable;  for while the one extreme makes the souls puffed up and proud, the other makes them lowly and spiritless.</said></p></div>

        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> The same holds good of the possession of goods and chattels, and they are to be valued on a similar scale.  In each case, when they are in excess,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="729"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="729a"/> they produce enmities and feuds both in States and privately, while if they are deficient they produce, as a rule, serfdom.  And let no man love riches for the sake of his children, in order that he may leave them as wealthy as possible;  for that is good neither for them nor for the State.  For the young the means that attracts no flatterers, yet is not lacking in things necessary, is the most harmonious of all and the best;  for it is in tune with us and in accord, and thus it renders our life in all respects painless.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="729b"/> To his children it behoves a man to bequeath modesty, not money, in abundance.  We imagine that chiding the young for their irreverence is the way to bequeath this;  but no such result follows from the admonition commonly given nowadays to the young, when people tell them that <q type="spoken">youth must reverence everyone.</q>  Rather will the prudent lawgiver admonish the older folk to reverence the young, and above all to beware lest any of them be ever seen or heard by any of the young either doing or saying anything shameful;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="729c"/> for where the old are shameless, there inevitably will also the young be very impudent.  The most effective way of training the young—as well as the older people themselves—is not by admonition, but by plainly practising throughout one’s own life the admonitions which one gives to others.  By paying honor and reverence to his kinsfolk, and all who share in the worship of the tribal gods and are sprung from the same blood, a man will, in proportion to his piety, secure the goodwill of the gods of Birth to bless his own begetting of children.  Moreover,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="729d"/> a man will find his friends and companions kindly disposed, in regard to life’s intercourse, if he sets higher than they do the value and importance of the services he receives from them, while counting the favors he confers on them as of less value than they are deemed by his companions and friends themselves.  In relation to his State and fellow-citizens that man is by far the best who, in preference to a victory at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> or in any other contest of war or peace, would choose to have a victorious reputation for service to his native laws, as being the one man above all others who has served them with distinction throughout his life. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="729e"/> Further, a man should regard contracts made with strangers as specially sacred;  for practically all the sins against Strangers are—as compared with those against citizens—connected more closely with an avenging deity.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="730">
     <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> For the stranger, inasmuch as he is without companions or kinsfolk, is the more to be pitied by men and gods;  wherefore he that is most able to avenge succors them most readily, and the most able of all, in every case, is the Strangers’ daemon and god, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="730"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="730a"/> and these follow in the train of Zeus Xenios.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The supreme Guardian of the rights of hospitality.</note> Whoso, then, is possessed of but a particle of forethought will take the utmost care to go through life to the very end without committing any offence in respect of Strangers.  Of offences against either Strangers or natives, that which touches suppliants is in every case the most grave;  for when a suppliant, after invoking a god as witness, is cheated of his compact, that god becomes the special guardian of him who is wronged, so that he will never be wronged without vengeance being taken for his wrongs.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="730b"/> As concerns a man’s social relations towards his parents, himself and his own belongings, towards the State also and friends and kindred,—whether foreign relations or domestic,—our exposition is now fairly complete.  It remains to expound next the character which is most conducive to nobility of life;  and after that we shall have to state all the matters which are subject, not to law, but rather to praise or blame,—as the instruments whereby the citizens are educated individually and rendered more tractable and well-inclined towards the laws which are to be imposed on them.  Of all the goods,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="730c"/> for gods and men alike, truth stands first.  Thereof let every man partake from his earliest days, if he purposes to become blessed and happy, that so he may live his life as a true man so long as possible.  He is a trusty man;  but untrustworthy is the man who loves the voluntary lie;  and senseless is the man who loves the involuntary lie;  and neither of these two is to be envied.  For everyone that is either faithless or foolish is friendless;  and since, as time goes on, he is found out, he is making for himself, in his woeful old-age, at life’s close,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="730d"/> a complete solitude, wherein his life becomes almost equally desolate whether his companions and children are living or dead.  He that does no wrong is indeed a man worthy of honor;  but worthy of twice as much honor as he, and more, is the man who, in addition, consents not to wrongdoers when they do wrong;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="730e"/> Upon temperance and upon wisdom one should bestow the same praise, and upon all the other goods which he who possesses them can not only keep himself but can share also with others.</said></p></div>

Let every one of us be ambitious to gain excellence, but without jealousy.  For a man of this character enlarges a State, since he strives hard himself and does not thwart the others by calumny;  but the jealous man, thinking that calumny of others is the best way to secure his own superiority, makes less effort himself to win true excellence, and disheartens his rivals by getting them unjustly blamed;  whereby he causes the whole State
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="731b"/> to be ill-trained for competing in excellence, and renders it, for his part, less large in fair repute.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="731d"/> possessing it all his life long.  Now while in general the wrong-doer and he that has these evils are to be pitied, it is permissible to show pity to the man that has evils that are remediable, and to abate one’s passion and treat him gently, and not to keep on raging like a scolding wife;  but in dealing with the man who is totally and obstinately perverse and wicked one must give free course to wrath.  Wherefore we affirm that it behoves the good man to be always at once passionate and gentle. There is an evil, great above all others, which most men have, implanted in their souls, and which each one of them excuses in himself and makes no effort to avoid.

In these hopes, and in the recollections of all these truths, it behoves every man to live, sparing no pains, but constantly recalling them clearly to the recollection both of himself and of his neighbor, alike when at work and when at play. Thus, as regards the right character of institutions
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="732e"/> and the right character of individuals, we have now laid down practically all the rules that are of divine sanction.  Those that are of human origin we have not stated as yet, but state them we must;  for our converse is with men, not gods.  Pleasures, pains and desires are by nature especially human;  and from these, of necessity, every mortal creature is, so to say, suspended and dependent by the strongest cords of influence.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="733">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Thus one should commend the noblest life, not merely because it is of superior fashion in respect of fair repute,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="733"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="733a"/> but also because, if a man consents to taste it and not shun it in his youth, it is superior likewise in that which all men covet,—an excess, namely, of joy and a deficiency of pain throughout the whole of life.  That this will clearly be the result, if a man tastes of it rightly, will at once be fully evident.  But wherein does this <q type="emph">rightness</q> consist?  That is the question which we must now, under the instruction of our Argument, consider;  comparing the more pleasant life with the more painful, we must in this wise consider whether this mode is natural to us, and that other mode unnatural.  We desire that pleasure should be ours,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="733b"/> but pain we neither choose nor desire;  and the neutral state we do not desire in place of pleasure, but we do desire it in exchange for pain;  and we desire less pain with more pleasure, but we do not desire less pleasure with more pain;  and when the two are evenly balanced, we are unable to state any clear preference.  Now all these states—in their number, quantity, intensity, equality, and in the opposites thereof—have, or have not, influence on desire,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="733c"/> to govern its choice of each.  So these things being thus ordered of necessity, we desire that mode of life in which the feelings are many, great, and intense, with those of pleasure predominating, but we do not desire the life in which the feelings of pain predominate;  and contrariwise, we do not desire the life in which the feelings are few, small, and gentle, if the painful predominate, but if the pleasurable predominate, we do desire it.  Further, we must regard the life in which there is an equal balance of pleasure and pain as we previously regarded the neutral state:  we desire the balanced life in so far as it exceeds
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="733d"/> the painful life in point of what we like, but we do not desire it in so far as it exceeds the pleasant lives in point of the things we dislike.  The lives of us men must all be regarded as naturally bound up in these feelings, and what kinds of lives we naturally desire is what we must distinguish;  but if we assert that we desire anything else, we only say so through ignorance and inexperience of the lives as they really are. What, then, and how many are the lives in which a man—when he has chosen the desirable and voluntary in preference to the undesirable and the involuntary, and has made it into a private law for himself, by choosing <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="733e"/> what is at once both congenial and pleasant and most good and noble—may live as happily as man can?  Let us pronounce that one of them is the temperate life, one the wise, one the brave, and let us class the healthy life as one; </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="734">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> and to these let us oppose four others—the foolish, the cowardly, the licentious, and the diseased.  He that knows the temperate life will set it down as gentle in all respects,

Whence it necessarily results that the one life must be naturally more pleasant, the other more painful to us;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="734b"/> and it is no longer possible for the man who desires a pleasant life voluntarily to live a licentious life, but it is clear by now (if our argument is right) that no man can possibly be licentious voluntarily:  it is owing to ignorance or incontinence, or both, that the great bulk of mankind live lives lacking in temperance.  Similarly with regard to the diseased life and the healthy life, one must observe that while both have pleasures and pains, the pleasures exceed
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="734c"/> the pains in health, but the pains the pleasures in disease.  Our desire in the choice of lives is not that pain should be in excess, but the life we have judged the more pleasant is that in which pain is exceeded by pleasure.  We will assert, then, that since the temperate life has its feelings smaller, fewer and lighter than the licentious life, and the wise life than the foolish, and the brave than the cowardly, and since the one life is superior to the other in pleasure, but inferior in pain,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="734d"/> the brave life is victorious over the cowardly and the wise over the foolish;  consequently the one set of lives ranks as more pleasant than the other:  the temperate, brave, wise, and healthy lives are more pleasant than the cowardly, foolish, licentious and diseased.  To sum up, the life of bodily and spiritual virtue, as compared with that of vice, is not only more pleasant, but also exceeds greatly in nobility, rectitude, virtue and good fame, so that it causes the man who lives it to live ever so much more happily than he who lives
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="734e"/> the opposite life.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="735"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="735a"/> whereas the woof is softer and shows a due degree of flexibility<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In weaving the ancients used an upright loom, in which the fixed, vertical threads of the <q type="emph">warp</q> were of coarser fiber than the transverse threads of the <q type="emph">woof.</q> </note>—from this we may see that in some such way we must mark out those who are to hold high offices in the State and those who are to hold low offices,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Aristot.

For of State organization there are two divisions, of which the one is the appointment of individuals to office, the other the assignment of laws to the offices. But, in truth, before we deal with all these matters we must observe the following.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="735b"/> In dealing with a flock of any kind, the shepherd or cowherd, or the keeper of horses or any such animals, will never attempt to look after it until he has first applied to each group of animals the appropriate purge—which is to separate the sound from the unsound, and the well-bred from the ill-bred,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 410a">Plat. Rep. 410a</bibl>.</note> and to send off the latter to other herds, while keeping the former under his own care;  for he reckons that his labor would be fruitless and unending if it were spent on bodies and souls which nature and
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="735c"/> ill-nurture have combined to ruin, and which themselves bring ruin on a stock that is sound and clean both in habit and in body,—whatever the class of beast,—unless a thorough purge be made in the existing herd.  This is a matter of minor importance in the case of other animals, and deserves mention only by way of illustration;  but in the case of man it is of the highest importance for the lawgiver to search out and to declare what is proper for each class both as regards purging out and all other modes of treatment.  For instance, in respect of civic purgings,
           <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="735d"/> this would be the way of it.  Of the many possible modes of purging, some are milder, some more severe;  those that are severest and best a lawgiver who was also a despot<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 709e">Plat. Laws 709e</bibl>.</note> might be able to effect, but a lawgiver without despotic power might be well content if, in establishing a new polity and laws, he could effect even the mildest of purgations.  The best purge is painful, like all medicines of a drastic nature,—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="735e"/> the purge which hales to punishments by means of justice linked with vengeance, crowning the vengeance with exile or death:  it, as a rule, clears out the greatest criminals when they are incurable and cause serious damage to the State. </said></p></div>

        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> A milder form of purge is one of the following kind:—when, owing to scarcity of food, people are in want, and display a readiness
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="736"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="736a"/> to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the wealthy,—then the lawgiver, regarding all such as a plague inherent in the body politic, ships them abroad as gently as possible, giving the euphemistic title of <q type="emph">emigration</q> to their evacuation.  By some means or other this must be done by every legislator at the beginning, but in our case the task is now even more simple;  for we have no need to contrive for the present either a form of emigration or any other purgative selection;  but just as
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="736b"/> when there is a confluence of floods from many sources—some from springs, some from torrents—into a single pool we have to take diligent precautions to ensure that the water may be of the utmost possible purity, by drawing it off in some cases, and in others by making channels to divert its course.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The citizens who are to form the new Magnesian colony are to be drawn from various quarters, and they must be carefully tested (like streams flowing into a reservoir) before being admitted.</note> Yet toil and risk, it would appear, are involved in every exercise of statecraft.  Since, however, our present efforts are verbal rather than actual, let us assume that our collection of citizens is now completed, and its purity secured to our satisfaction;  for we shall test thoroughly by every kind of test and by length of time the vicious among those
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="736c"/> who attempt to enter our present State as citizens, and so prevent their arrival, whereas we shall welcome the virtuous with all possible graciousness and goodwill. And let us not omit to notice this piece of good luck—that, just as we said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 684e">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="736d"/> to settle such strife by law, it can neither leave vested interests unaltered nor yet can it in any wise alter them, and no way is left save what one might term that of <q type="emph">pious aspiration</q> and cautious change, little by little, extended over a long period, and that way is this:—there must already exist a supply of men to effect the change, who themselves, on each occasion, possess abundance of land and have many persons in their debt, and who are kind enough to wish to give a share of these things to those of them who are in want,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="736e"/> partly by remissions and partly by distributions, making a kind of rule of moderation and believing that poverty consists, not in decreasing one’s substance, but in increasing one’s greed. </said></p></div>

This difficulty, as we say, we avoid;  it is better, however, that we should explain the means by which, if we had not actually avoided it, we might have found a way of escape.  Be it explained, then, that that means consists in renouncing avarice by the aid of justice, and that there is no way of escape, broad or narrow, other than this device.  So let this stand fixed for us now as a kind of pillar of the State.  The properties of the citizens must be established somehow or other on a basis that is secure from intestine disputes;

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="737c"/> What then would be the plan of a right distribution?  First, we must fix at the right total the number of citizens;  next, we must agree about the distribution of them,—into how many sections, and each of what size, they are to be divided;  and among these sections we must distribute, as equally as we can, both the land and the houses.  An adequate figure for the population could not be given without reference to the territory and to the neighboring States.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="737d"/> Of land we need as much as is capable of supporting so many inhabitants of temperate habits, and we need no more;  and as to population, we need a number such that they will be able to defend themselves against injury from adjoining peoples, and capable also of lending some aid to their neighbors when injured.  These matters we shall determine, both verbally and actually, when we have inspected the territory and its neighbors;  but for the present it is only a sketch in outline of our legislation that our argument will now proceed to complete.

Let us choose that which contains the most numerous and most consecutive sub-divisions.  Number as a whole comprises every division for all purposes;  whereas the number 5,040, for purposes of war, and in peace for all purposes connected with contributions and distributions, will admit of division
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="738b"/> into no more than 59 sections, these being consecutive from one up to ten.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The number 5,040 is here chosen because, for a number of moderate size, it has the greatest possible number of divisors (59) , including all the digits from 1 to 10.</note> These facts about numbers must be grasped firmly and with deliberate attention by those who are appointed by law to grasp them:  they are exactly as we have stated them, and the reason for stating them when founding a State is this:—in respect of gods, and shrines, and the temples which have to be set up for the various gods in the State, and the gods and daemons they are to be named after, no man of sense,—whether he be framing a new State or reforming an old one that has been corrupted,—will attempt to alter

Nothing of all these <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="738d"/> should the lawgiver alter in the slightest degree;  to each section he should assign a god or daemon, or at the least a hero;  and in the distribution of the land he should assign first to these divinities choice domains with all that pertains to them, so that, when assemblies of each of the sections take place at the appointed times, they may provide an ample supply of things requisite, and the people may fraternize with one another at the sacrifices and gain knowledge and intimacy, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="738e"/> since nothing is of more benefit to the State than this mutual acquaintance;  for where men conceal their ways one from another in darkness rather than light, there no man will ever rightly gain either his due honor or office, or the justice that is befitting.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="739b"/> This plan let us now adopt:  let us state the polities which rank first, second, and third in excellence;  and the choice let us hand over to Clinias and to whosoever else may at any time wish, ill proceeding to the selection of such things, to take over, according to his own disposition, what he values in his own country.

In such a State,—be it gods or sons of gods that dwell in it,—they dwell pleasantly, living such a life as this.  Wherefore one should not look elsewhere

And let the apportionment be made with this intention,—that the man who receives the portion should still regard it as common property of the whole State, and should tend the land, which is his fatherland, more diligently than a mother tends her children, inasmuch as it, being a goddess, is mistress over its mortal population, and should observe the same attitude also towards the local gods
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="740b"/> and daemons.  And in order that these things may remain in this state for ever, these further rules must be observed:  the number of hearths, as now appointed by us, must remain unchanged, and must never become either more or less.  This will be securely effected, in the case of every State, in the following way:  the allotment-holder shall always leave behind him one son, whichever he pleases, as the inheritor of his dwelling, to be his successor in the tendance of the deified ancestors
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="740c"/> both of family and of State, whether living or already deceased;  as to the rest of the children, when a man has more than one, he should marry off the females according to the law that is to be ordained,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Moreover, as a final step,—in case we are in absolute desperation about the unequal condition of our 5,040 households, and are faced with a superabundance of citizens, owing to the mutual affection of those who cohabit with one another, which drives us to despair,—there still remains that ancient device which we have often mentioned, namely, the sending forth, in friendly wise from a friendly nation, of colonies consisting of such people as are deemed suitable. </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="741c"/> or refuse an allotment on the understanding that, first, the land is sacred to all the gods, and further, that prayers shall be made at the first, second, and third sacrifices by the priests and priestesses,—therefore the man who buys or sells the house-plot or land-plot allotted to him must suffer the penalty attached to this sin.  The officials shall inscribe on tablets of cypress-wood written records for future reference, and shall place them in the shrines;  furthermore,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="741d"/> they shall place the charge of the execution of these matters in the hands of that magistrate who is deemed to be most keen of vision, in order that all breaches of these rules may be brought to their notice, and they may punish the man who disobeys both the law and the god.  How great a blessing the ordinance now described—when the appropriate organization accompanies it—proves to all the States that obey it—that is a thing which, as the old proverb<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The proverb was, perhaps,<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς ἄπειρος εἴσεται</foreign>,—like <q type="foreign">experientia docet</q>.</note> says, none that is evil shall know, but only he that has become experienced and practised in virtuous habits.

For these reasons we say that our people should possess coined money which is legal tender among themselves, but vaIueless elsewhere.  As regards the universal Hellenic coinage,—for the sake of expeditions and foreign visits, as well as of embassies or any other missions necessary for the State, if there be need to send someone abroad,—for such objects as these it is necessary that the State should always possess Hellenic money.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="742b"/> If a private citizen ever finds himself obliged to go abroad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

In marrying or giving in marriage, no one shall give or receive any dowry at all.  No one shall deposit money with anyone he does not trust, nor lend at interest, since it is permissible for the borrower to refuse entirely to pay back either interest or principal. That these are the best rules for a State to observe in practice, one would perceive rightly <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="742d"/> if one viewed them in relation to the primary intention.  The intention of the judicious statesman is, we say, not at all the intention which the majority would ascribe to him;  they would say that the good Iawgiver should desire that the State, for which he is benevolentIy legislating, should be as large and as rich as possible, possessed of silver and gold, and bearing rule over as many people as possible both by land and sea;  and they would add that he should desire the State to be as good and as happy as possible, if he is a true legislator. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="742e"/> Of these objects some are possible of attainment, some impossible;  such as are possible the organizer of the State will desire;  the impossible he will neither vainly desire nor attempt.  That happiness and goodness should go together is well-nigh inevitable,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. if the citizens are to be happy they must be good.

Because, we would reply, the gain derived from both right and wrong is more than double that from right alone, whereas the expenditure of those who refuse to spend either nobly or ignobIy is only one-half the expenditure of those who are noble and like spending on noble objects; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="743b"/> consequently, the wealth of men who double their gains and halve their expenditure will never be exceeded by the men whose procedure in both respects is just the opposite.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">e.g.<emph>A</emph> (a good man) gains (justly) £300, of which he spends £100 on necessaries and £100 on noble objects, leaving him a balance of £l00. <emph>B</emph> (a not-good man) gains (justly and unjustly) £600, of which he spends £l00 on necessaries, and nothing on noble objects, leaving him a balance of £500.  The third type (<emph>C</emph>) is worse than <emph>B</emph> because he not only gains but also spends wrongly.  Type <emph>A</emph> shows how the good man is neither very rich nor very poor,—<emph>B</emph>, how the bad man may be very rich,—<emph>C</emph>, how the bad may be very poor.</note> Now of these men, the one is good, and the other not bad, so long as he is niggardly, but utterly bad when he is not niggardly, and (as we have just said) at no time good.  For while the one man, since he takes both justly and unjustly and spends neither justly nor unjustly, is rich (and the utterly bad man, being lavish as a rule, is very poor) ,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="743c"/> the other man, who spends on noble objects, and gains by just means only, is never likely to become either superlatively rich or extremely poor.  Accordingly, what we have stated is true,—that the very rich are not good, and not being good, neither are they happy. Now the fundamental purpose of our laws was this,—that the citizens should be as happy as possible, and in the highest degree united in mutual friendship.  Friendly the citizens will never be where they have frequent legal actions with one another and frequent illegal acts, but rather where these are
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="743d"/> the fewest and least possible.  We say that in the State there must be neither gold nor silver, nor must there be much money-making by means of vulgar trading or usury or the fattening of gelded beasts, but only such profit as farming offers and yields, and of this only so much as will not drive a man by his money-making to neglect the objects for which money exists:  these objects are the soul and the body, which without gymnastic and the other branches of education
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="743e"/> would never become things of value.  Wherefore we have asserted (and that not once only)<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 631c">Plat. Laws 631c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 697b">Plat.

        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Accordingly, if it prescribes its honors in this order, the polity which we are describing has its laws correctly laid down;  but if any of the laws therein enacted shall evidently make health <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="744"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="744a"/> of more honor in the State than temperance, or wealth than health and temperance, it will quite clearly be a wrong enactment.  Thus the lawgiver must ofttimes put this question to himself— <q type="thought">What is it that I intend?</q> and, <q type="thought">Am I succeeding in this, or am I wide of the mark?</q> In this way he might, perhaps, get through the task of legislation himself, and save others the trouble of it;  but in no other way could he ever possibly do so. The man who has received an allotment shall hold it, as we say,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="744b"/> on the terms stated.  It would indeed have been a splendid thing if each person, on entering the colony, had had all else equal as well.  Since this, however, is impossible, and one man will arrive with more money and another with less, it is necessary for many reasons, and for the sake of equaIizing chances in public life, that there should be unequal valuations, in order that offices and contributions may be assigned in accordance with the assessed valuation in each case,—being framed not in proportion only to the moral excellence of a man’s ancestors or of himself, nor to his bodily strength
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="744c"/> and comeliness, but in proportion also to his wealth or poverty,—so that by a rule of symmetrical inequality<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. of, proportional distribution: cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 757a">Plat. Laws 757a</bibl> for <q type="emph">political</q> as distinct from <q type="emph">arithmetical,</q> equality.</note> they may receive offices and honors as equally as possible, and may have no quarrelling.  For these reasons we must make four classes, graded by size of property, and called first, second, third and fourth (or by some other names) , alike when the individuals remain in the same class and when, through a change from poverty to wealth or from wealth to poverty, they pass over each to that class to which he belongs.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="744d"/> The kind of law that I would enact as proper to follow next after the foregoing would be this:  It is, as we assert, necessary in a State which is to avoid that greatest of plagues, which is better termed disruption than dissension,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or <q type="emph">class discord.</q> </note> that none of its citizens should be in a condition of either painful poverty or wealth, since both these conditions produce both these results; consequently the lawgiver must now declare a limit for both these conditions.  The limit of poverty shall be the value of the allotment:
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="744e"/> this must remain fixed, and its diminution in any particular instance no magistrate should overlook, nor any other citizen who aspires to goodness.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="745">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And having set this as the (inferior) limit, the lawgiver shall allow a man to possess twice this amount, or three times, or four times.  Should anyone acquire more than this—whether by discovery or gift or money-making, or through gaining a sum exceeding
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="745"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="745a"/> the due measure by some other such piece of luck, if he makes the surplus over to the State and the gods who keep the State, he shall be well-esteemed and free from penalty.  But if anyone disobeys this law, whoso wishes may get half by laying information, and the man that is convicted shall pay out an equal share of his own property, and the half shall go to the gods.  All the property of every man over and above his allotment shall be publicly written out and be in the keeping of the magistrates appointed by law,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="745b"/> so that legal rights pertaining to all matters of property may be easy to decide and perfectly clear. In the next place, the lawgiver must first plant his city as nearly as possible in the center of the country, choosing a spot which has all the other conveniences also which a city requires, and which it is easy enough to perceive and specify.  After this, he must divide off twelve portions of land,—when he has first set apart a sacred glebe for Hestia, Zeus and Athena, to which he shall give the name <q type="emph">acropolis</q> and circle it round with a ring-wall;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="745c"/> starting from this he must divide up both the city itself and all the country into the twelve portions.  The twelve portions must be equalized by making those consisting of good land small, and those of inferior land larger.  He must mark off 5,040 allotments, and each of these he must cut in two and join two pieces to form each several allotment, so that each contains a near piece and a distant piece,—joining the piece next the city with the piece furthest off, the second nearest with the second furthest, and so on with all the rest.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 776a">Plat. Laws 776a</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="745d"/> And in dealing with these separate portions, they must employ the device we mentioned a moment ago, about poor land and good, and secure equality by making the assigned portions of larger or smaller size.  And he must divide the citizens also into twelve parts, making all the twelve parts as equal as possible in respect of the value of the rest of their property, after a census has been made of all.  After this they must also appoint twelve allotments for the twelve gods, and name and consecrate the portion allotted to each god,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="745e"/> giving it the name of <q type="term">phyle.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. <gloss>tribe.</gloss></note> And they must also divide the twelve sections of the city in the same manner as they divided the rest of the country;  and each citizen must take as his share two dwellings, one near the center of the country the other near the outskirts.  Thus the settlement shall be completed. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="746">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> But we must by all means notice this,—that all the arrangements now described will never be likely to meet with such favorable conditions that the whole program can be carried out
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="746"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="746a"/> according to plan.  This requires that the citizens will raise no objection to such a mode of living together, and will tolerate being restricted for life to fixed and limited amounts of property and to families such as we have stated, and being deprived of gold and of the other things which the lawgiver is clearly obliged by our regulations to forbid, and will submit also to the arrangements he has defined for country and city, with the dwellings set in the center and round the circumference,—almost as if he were telling nothing but dreams, or moulding, so to say, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="746b"/> a city and citizens out of wax.  These criticisms are not altogether unfair, and the lawgiver should reconsider the points that follow.  So he that is legislating speaks to us again in this wise: <q type="spoken">Do not suppose, my friends, that I in these my discourses fail to observe the truth of what is now set out in this criticism.  But in dealing with all schemes for the future, the fairest plan, I think, is this—that the person who exhibits the pattern on which the undertaking is to be modelled should omit no detail of perfect beauty and truth;  but where any of them is impossible of realization, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="746c"/> that particular detail he should omit and leave unexecuted, but contrive to execute instead whatever of the remaining details comes nearest to this and is by nature most closely akin to the right procedure;  and he should allow the lawgiver to express his ideal completely;  and when this is done, then and then only should they both consult together as to how far their proposals are expedient and how much of the legislation is impracticable.  For the constructor of even the most trivial object, if he is to be of any merit, must make it in all points
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="746d"/> consistent with itself.</q>  So now we must endeavor to discern—after we have decided on our division into twelve parts—in what fashion the divisions that come next to these and are the offspring of these, up to the ultimate figure, 5,040, (determining as they do, the phratries and demes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="mentioned">Phratries</q> and <q type="mentioned">demes</q> were sub-divisions of the <q type="foreign">phyle</q> or tribe.</note> and villages, as well as the military companies and platoons, and also the coinage-system, dry and liquid measures, and weights),— <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="746e"/> how, I say, all these numerations are to be fixed by the law so as to be of the right size and consistent one with another.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="747">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, he should not hesitate, through fear of what might appear to be peddling detail, to prescribe that, of all the utensils which the citizens may possess, none shall be allowed to be of undue size. <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="747"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="747a"/> He must recognize it as a universal rule that the divisions and variations of numbers are applicable to all purposes—both to their own arithmetical variations and to the geometrical variations of surfaces and solids, and also to those of sounds, and of motions, whether in a straight line up and down or circular.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the laws of arithmetic apply also to plane and solid geometry, acoustics, and kinetics.</note> The lawgiver must keep all these in view and charge all the citizens to hold fast, so far as they can,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="747b"/> to this organized numerical system.  For in relation to economics, to politics and to all the arts, no single branch of educational science possesses so great an influence as the study of numbers:  its chief advantage is that it wakes up the man who is by nature drowsy and slow of wit, and makes him quick to learn, mindful and sharp-witted, progressing beyond his natural capacity by art divine.  All these subjects of education will prove fair and fitting, provided that you can remove illiberality and avarice, by means of other laws and institutions, from the souls of those
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="747c"/> who are to acquire them adequately and to profit by them;  otherwise you will find that you have unwittingly turned out a <q type="emph">sharper,</q> as we call him, instead of a sage:  examples of this we can see today in the effect produced on the Egyptians and Phoenicians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Rep. 436a</bibl>.</note> and many other nations by the illiberal character of their property, and their other institutions,—whether these results are due to their having had a bad lawgiver, or to some adverse fortune that befell them, or else, possibly, to some natural disadvantage.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="747d"/> For that, too, is a point, O Megillus and Clinias, which we must not fail to notice,—that some districts are naturally superior to others for the breeding of men of a good or bad type;  and we must not conflict with this natural difference in our legislation.  Some districts are ill-conditioned or well-conditioned owing to a variety of winds or to sunshine, others owing to their waters, others owing simply to the produce of the soil,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="747e"/> which offers produce either good or bad for their bodies, and equally able to effect similar results in their souls as well.  Of all these, those districts would be by far the best which have a kind of heavenly breeze, and where the portions of land are under the care of daemons,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 745d">Plat. Laws 745d ad fin</bibl>.</note> so that they receive those that come from time to time to settle there either graciously or ungraciously.  These districts the judicious lawgiver will examine, so far as examination of such matters is possible for mere man;  and he will try to frame his laws accordingly.  And you too, Clinias, must adopt the same course;  when you are proposing to colonize the country, you must attend to these matters first.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What statement is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is this:— It is a fact clear to everyone that, the work of legislation being a great one, the placing of unfit officers in charge of well-framed laws in a well-equipped State not only robs those laws of all their value and gives rise to widespread ridicule,

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us then, my friend, mark this result in dealing now with your polity and State.  You see that it is necessary, in the first place, that those who rightly undertake official functions should in every case have been fully tested— both themselves and their families— from their earliest years up to the time of their selection;  and, secondly, that those who are to be the selectors should have been reared in law-abiding habits,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="751d"/> and be well trained for the task of rightly rejecting or accepting those candidates who deserve their approval or disapproval.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is now specially in your mind, and what makes you say so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The fact that we are legislating lightheartedly and boldly for inexperienced men, in the hope that they will accept the laws we have now enacted.  Thus much at least is plain, Clinias, to almost everyone—even to the meanest intelligence—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="752c"/> that they will not readily accept any of those laws at the start;  but if those laws could remain unchanged until those who have imbibed them in infancy, and have been reared up in them and grown fully used to them, have taken part in elections to office in every department of State,—then, when this has been effected (if any means or method can be found to effect it rightly) , we have, as I think, a strong security that, after this transitional period of disciplined adolescence, the State will remain firm.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is certainly reasonable to suppose so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us then consider whether we might succeed in providing an adequate means to this end on the following lines.  For I declare, Clinias, that you Cnosians, above all other Cretans, not only ought to deal in no perfunctory manner with the soil which you are now settling, but ought also to take the utmost care that the first officials are appointed in the best and most secure way possible.  The selection of the rest of them will be a less serious task;  but it is imperatively necessary
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="752e"/> for you to choose your Law-wardens first with the utmost care.</said></p>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="753b"/> to whom also our recent remarks about you apply.  Let us, then, assume that this would be the most equitable arrangement under the conditions at present existing.  Later on, if the constitution still remains, the selection of officials shall take place as follows:—In the selection of officials all men shall take part who carry arms, as horse-soldiers or foot-soldiers, or who have served in war so far as their age and ability allowed.  They shall make the selection in that shrine which the State shall deem the most sacred;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="753c"/> and each man shall bring to the altar of the god, written on a tablet, the name of his nominee, with his father’s name and that of his tribe and of the deme he belongs to, and beside these he shall write also his own name in like manner.  Any man who chooses shall be permitted to remove any tablet which seems to him to be improperly written, and to place it in the market-place for not less than thirty days.  The officials shall publicly exhibit, for all the State to see,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="753d"/> those of the tablets that are adjudged to come first, to the number of 300;  and all the citizens shall vote again in like manner, each for whomsoever of these he wishes.  Of these, the officials shall again exhibit publicly the names of those who are adjudged first, up to the number of 100.  The third time, he that wishes shall vote for whomsoever he wishes out of the hundred, passing between slain victims<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An ancient method of solemnly ratifying an agreement;  cp.<title>Genesis</title> 15. 9 ff.</note> as he does so:  then they shall test the thirty-seven men who have secured most votes, and declare them to be magistrates.
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="753e"/> Who, then, are the men, O Clinias and Megillus, who shall establish in our State all these regulations concerning magisterial offices and tests?  We perceive (do we not?) that for States that are thus getting into harness for the first time some such persons there must necessarily be;  but who they can be, before any officials exist, it is impossible to see.  Yet somehow or other they must be there—and men, too, of no mean quality, but of the highest quality possible.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What statement is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I assert that the State for whose settlement we are planning has nobody in the way of parents except
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="754b"/> that State which is founding it, though I am quite aware that many of the colony-States often have been, and will be, at feud with those which founded them.  But now, on the present occasion, just as a child in the present helplessness of childhood—in spite of the likelihood of his being at enmity with his parents at some future date—loves his parents and is loved by them, and always flies for help to his kindred and finds in them, and them alone, his allies,—so now, as I assert, this relationship exists ready-made for the Cnosians towards the young State, owing to their care for it, and for the young State
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="754c"/> towards the Cnosians. I state once more, as I stated just now,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 752d">Plat.

This joint body<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This body of 200 is to be appointed, as a temporary expedient, to give the State a start by selecting its first necessary officials.</note> must, I say, go to the new State and arrange in common that the magistrates
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="754d"/> be appointed according to the laws and be tested after appointment.

    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="754e"/> omitting four minae if he be of the highest property-class, three if he be of the second class, two if he be of the third, and one if he be of the fourth class.  And should anyone be proved to possess anything else beyond what is registered, all such surplus shall be confiscated;  and in addition he shall be liable to be brought to trial by anyone who wishes to prosecute—a trial neither noble nor fair of name, if he be convicted of despising law because of lucre.  So he that wishes shall charge him with profiteering, and prosecute him by law before the Law-wardens themselves;  </said></p></div>

A Law-warden shall hold office for no more than twenty years, and he shall be voted into office when he is not under fifty years of age. If he is elected at the age of sixty, he shall hold office for ten years only;  and by the same rule, the more he exceeds the minimum age, the shorter shall be his term of office;  so that if he lives
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="755b"/> beyond the age of seventy, he must no longer fancy that he can remain among these officials holding an office of such high importance. So, for the Law-wardens, let us state that these three duties are imposed on them, and as we proceed with the laws, each fresh law will impose upon these men whatever additional duties they ought to be charged with beyond those now stated.  And now we may go on to describe the selection of the other officials.  Commanders must be selected next,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="755c"/> and as subordinates to them, for purposes of war, hipparchs, phylarchs, and officers to marshal the ranks of the foot-phylae,—to whom the name of <q type="term">taxiarchs,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. <gloss>rank-leaders.</gloss> </note> which is in fact the very name which most men give to them, would be specially appropriate.  Of these, commanders shall be nominated by the Law-wardens from among the members of our State only;  and from those nominated the selection shall be made by all who either are serving or have served in war, according to their several ages.  And if anyone deems that someone of the men not nominated is better
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="755d"/> than one of those nominated, he shall state the name of his nominee and of the man whom he is to replace, and, taking the oath about the matter, he shall propose his substitute;  and whichever of the two is decided on by vote shall be included in the list for selection.  And the three men, who have been appointed by the majority of votes to serve as commanders and controllers of military affairs, shall be tested as were the Law-wardens.  The selected commanders shall nominate for themselves taxiarchs, twelve for each tribe;
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="755e"/> and here, in the case of the taxiarchs, just as in the case of the commanders, there shall be a right of counter-nomination, and a similar procedure of voting and testing.

            <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The selection of officials that is thus made will form a mean between a monarchic constitution and a democratic;  and midway between these our constitution should always stand.  For slaves will never
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="757"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="757a"/> be friends with masters, nor bad men with good, even when they occupy equal positions—for when equality is given to unequal things, the resultant will be unequal, unless due measure is applied;  and it is because of these two conditions that political organizations are filled with feuds.  There is an old and true saying that <q type="spoken">equality produces amity,</q> which is right well and fitly spoken;  but what the equality is which is capable of doing this is a very troublesome question, since it is very far from being clear.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="757b"/> For there are two kinds of equality<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 508a">Plat. Gorg. 508a ff</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 508b">Plat. Gorg. 508b ff</bibl>;  <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1301b.29">Aristot. Pol. 1301b 29 ff.</bibl>;<bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131b.20">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131b 27</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1158b.20">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1158b 30 ff</bibl>.  The <q type="emph">arithmetical</q> equality which merely counts heads and treats all alike is here contrasted with that truer <q type="emph">proportional</q> equality which takes account of human inequality, and on which <q type="term">distributive justice</q>  (as Aristotle terms it) is based:  cp. also 744 C.</note> which, though identical in name, are often almost opposites in their practical results.  The one of these any State or lawgiver is competent to apply in the assignment of honors,—namely, the equality determined by measure, weight and number,—by simply employing the lot to give even results in the distributions;  but the truest and best form of equality is not an easy thing for everyone to discern. It is the judgment of Zeus, and men it never assists save in small measure, but in so far as it does assist either States or individuals, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="757c"/> it produces all things good;  for it dispenses more to the greater and less to the smaller, giving due measure to each according to nature;  and with regard to honors also, by granting the greater to those that are greater in goodness, and the less to those of the opposite character in respect of goodness and education, it assigns in proportion what is fitting to each.  Indeed, it is precisely this which constitutes for us <q type="term">political justice,</q> which is the object we must strive for, Clinias;  this equality is what we must aim at, now that we are settling the State
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="757d"/> that is being planted.  And whoever founds a State elsewhere at any time must make this same object the aim of his legislation,—not the advantage of a few tyrants, or of one, or of some form of democracy, but justice always;  and this consists in what we have just stated, namely, the natural equality given on each occasion to things unequal.  None the less, it is necessary for every State at times to employ even this equality in a modified degree, if it is to avoid involving itself in intestine discord, in one section or another,—for the reasonable and considerate, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="757e"/> wherever employed, is an infringement of the perfect and exact, as being contrary to strict justice;  for the same reason it is necessary to make use also of the equality of the lot, on account of the discontent of the masses, and in doing so to pray, calling upon God and Good Luck to guide for them the lot aright towards the highest justice. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="758">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Thus it is that necessity compels us to employ both forms of equality; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="758"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="758a"/> but that form, which needs good luck, we should employ as seldom as possible. The State which means to survive must necessarily act thus, my friends, for the reasons we have stated.  For just as a ship when sailing on the sea requires continual watchfulness both by night and day, so likewise a State, when it lives amidst the surge of surrounding States and is in danger of being entrapped by all sorts of plots, requires to have officers linked up with officers from day to night and from night to day,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="758b"/> and guardians succeeding guardians, and being succeeded in turn, without a break.  But since a crowd of men is incapable of ever performing any of these duties smartly, the bulk of the Councillors must necessarily be left to stay most of their time at their private business, to attend to their domestic affairs;  and we must assign a twelfth part of them to each of the twelve months, to furnish guards in rotation, so as promptly to meet any person coming either from somewhere abroad or <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="758c"/> from their own State, in case he desires to give information or to make enquiries about some matter of international importance;  and so as to make replies, and, when the State has asked questions, to receive the replies;  and above all, in view of the manifold innovations that are wont to occur constantly in States, to prevent if possible their occurrence, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="758d"/> and in case they do occur, to ensure that the State may perceive and remedy the occurrence as quickly as possible.  For these reasons, this presidential section of the State must always have the control of the summoning and dissolving of assemblies, both the regular legal assemblies and those of an emergency character.  Thus a twelfth part of the Council will be the body that manages all these matters, and each such part shall rest in turn for eleven-twelfths of the year:  in common with the rest of the officials, this twelfth section of the Council must keep its watch in the State over these matters continually. This disposition of affairs in the city will prove a reasonable arrangement.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="758e"/> But what control are we to have, and what system, for all the rest of the country?  Now that all the city and the whole country have each been divided up into twelve parts, must not supervisors be appointed for the roads of the city itself, the dwellings, buildings, harbors, market, springs, and for the sacred glebes also and the temples, and all such things?</said></p>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="761"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="761a"/> and its wealth;  and for these purposes they shall make use of the beasts of burden and the servants in each district, employing the former and supervising the latter, and choosing always, so far as possible, the times when these people are free from their own business.  In all respects they must make movement as difficult as possible for enemies, but for friends—whether men, mules or cattle—as easy as possible, by attending to the roads, that they all may become as level as possible, and to the rain-waters, that they may benefit instead of injuring the country, as they flow down from the heights into all the

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="761c"/> and by connecting the pools by hewn tunnels they shall make them all abundant, and by using water-pipes they shall beautify at all seasons of the year any sacred glebe or grove that may be close at hand, by directing the streams right into the temples of the gods.  And everywhere in such spots the young men should erect gymnasia both for themselves and for the old men—providing warm baths for the old:  they should keep there a plentiful supply of dry wood,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="761d"/> and give a kindly welcome and a helping hand to sick folk and to those whose bodies are worn with the toils of husbandry—a welcome far better than a doctor who is none too skilful.

The mode of life of the officers and land-stewards during their two years of service shall be of the following kind.  First,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="762c"/> in each of the districts there shall be common meals, at which all shall mess together.  If a man absents himself by day, or by sleeping away at night, without orders from the officers or some urgent cause, and if the Five inform against him and post his name up in the market-place as guilty of deserting his watch, then he shall suffer degradation for being a traitor to his public duty, and whoever meets him and desires to punish him may give him a beating
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="762d"/> with impunity.  And if any one of the officers themselves commits any such act, it will be proper for all the Sixty to keep an eye on him;  and if any of them notices or hears of such an act, but fails to prosecute, he shall be held guilty under the same laws, and shall be punished more severely than the young men;  he shall be entirely disqualified from holding posts of command over the young men.  Over these matters the Law-wardens shall exercise most careful supervision, to prevent if possible their occurrence, and, where they do occur, to ensure that they meet with the punishment they deserve. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="762e"/> Now it is needful that every man should hold the view, regarding men in general, that the man who has not been a servant will never become a praiseworthy master, and that the right way to gain honor is by serving honorably rather than by ruling honorably—doing service first to the laws, since this is service to the gods, and, secondly, the young always serving the elder folk and those who have lived honorable lives.  In the next place, he who is made a land-steward must have partaken of the daily rations, which are coarse and uncooked, during the two years of service.  </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="763b"/> under arms, for the purpose both of fencing and of learning each several district.  For that all should have an accurate knowledge of their own country is a branch of learning that is probably second to none:  so the young men ought to practise running with hounds and all other forms of hunting, as much for this reason as for the general enjoyment and benefit derived from such sports.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="764b"/> The market-stewards must see to it that the market is conducted as appointed by law:  they must supervise the temples and fountains in the market, to see that no one does any damage;  in case anyone does damage, if he be a slave or a stranger, they shall punish him with stripes and bonds, while if a native is guilty of such misconduct, they shall have power to inflict a fine up to a hundred drachmae of their own motion, and to fine a wrongdoer
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="764c"/> up to twice that amount, when acting in conjunction with the city-stewards.  Similarly, the city-stewards shall have power of fining and punishing in their own sphere, fining up to a mina of their own motion, and up to twice that sum in conjunction with the market-stewards. It will be proper next to appoint officials for music and gymnastics,—two grades for each department, the one for education, the other for managing competitions.  By education-officers the law means supervisors of gymnasia and schools, both in respect of their discipline <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="764d"/> and teaching and of the control of the attendances and accommodation both for girls and boys.  By competition-officers it means umpires for the competitors both in gymnastic and in music, these also being of two grades.  For competitions there should be the same umpires both for men and for horses;  but in the case of music it will be proper to have separate umpires for solos and for mimetic performances,—<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="764e"/> I mean, for instance, one set chosen for rhapsodists, harpers, flute-players, and all such musicians, and another set for choral performers.  We ought to choose first the officials for the playful exercise of choirs of children and lads and girls in dances and all other regular methods of music;  </said></p></div>

The officer and manager of the choirs they must appoint in the following way.  All those who are devoted to these subjects shall attend the assembly, and if they refuse to attend they shall be liable to a fine—a matter which the Law-wardens shall decide:  any others who are unwilling to attend shall be subject to no compulsion.  Every elector must make his nomination from the list of those who are experts:
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="765b"/> in the scrutiny, affirmation and negation shall be confined to one point only—on the one side, that the candidate is expert, on the other side, that he is not expert;  and whichever of the ten who come first on votes is elected after the scrutiny shall be the officer for the year in charge of the choirs according to law.  In the same way as these they shall appoint the officer elected to preside for the year over those who enter for competitions in solos and joint performances on the flute.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="765c"/> Next it is proper to choose umpires for the athletic contests of horses and men from among the third and the second property-classes:  this election it shall be compulsory for the first three classes to attend, but the lowest class shall be exempt from fines for non-attendance.  Three shall be appointed:  twenty having been first selected by show of hand, three out of the twenty shall be chosen by lot;  and they shall be subject also to the approval of the scrutineers.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="765d"/> Should any candidate be disqualified in any voting or testing for office, they shall elect a substitute, and carry out the scrutiny by the same method as in the case of the original candidate. In the department we have been dealing with, we have still to appoint an officer who shall preside over the whole range of education of both boys and girls.  For this purpose there shall be one officer legally appointed:  he shall not be under fifty years of age, and shall be the father of legitimate children of either sex, or preferably of both sexes.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="765e"/> Both the candidate that is put first, and the elector who puts him first, must be convinced that of the highest offices of State this is by far the most important. </said></p> </div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="766"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="766a"/> Man, as we affirm, is a tame creature:  none the less, while he is wont to become an animal most godlike and tame when he happens to possess a happy nature combined with right education, if his training be deficient or bad, he turns out the wildest of all earth’s creatures.  Wherefore the lawgiver must not permit them to treat the education of children as a matter of secondary or casual importance;  but, inasmuch as the presiding official must be well selected, he must begin first by charging them to appoint as president, to the best of their power,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="766b"/> that one of the citizens who is in every way the most excellent.  Therefore all the officials—excepting the Council and the prytaneis—shall go to the temple of Apollo, and shall each cast his vote for whichever one of the Law-wardens he deems likely best to control educational affairs.  He who gains most votes, after passing a scrutiny held by the selecting officials, other than the Law-wardens, shall hold office for five years:  in the sixth year they shall elect another man for this office <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="766c"/> in a similar manner. If anyone holding a public office dies more than thirty days before his office terminates, those whose proper duty it is must appoint a substitute in the same manner.  If a guardian of orphans dies, the relations, who are residents, on both the father’s and mother’s side, as far as cousin’s children, shall appoint a substitute within ten days, failing which they shall each be fined one drachma per diem
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="766d"/> until they have appointed the guardian for the children. A State, indeed, would be no State if it had no law-courts properly established;  but a judge who was dumb and who said as little as litigants at a preliminary inquiry,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. an inquiry into the grounds of a proposed action at law, to decide whether or not it should be brought into court.</note> as do arbitrators,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. persons appointed to settle points in dispute, so as to avoid a legal trial in the regular courts.</note> would never prove efficient in deciding questions of justice;  consequently it is not easy for a large body of men to judge well, nor yet for a small one, if of poor ability.  The matter in dispute on either side <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="766e"/> must always be made clear, and for elucidating the point at issue, lapse of time, deliberation and frequent questionings are of advantage. </said></p></div>

In a sense we may say that the establishment of law-courts coincides with the election of officials;  for every official must be also a judge of certain matters, while a judge, even if not an official, may be said to be an official of no little importance on the day when he concludes a suit by pronouncing his judgment.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="767b"/> Assuming then that the judges are officials, let us declare who will make suitable judges, and of what matters, and how many shall deal with each case. The most elementary form of court is that which the two parties arrange for themselves, choosing judges by mutual agreement;  of the rest, there shall be two forms of trial,—the one when a private person accuses a private person of injuring him and desires to gain a verdict by bringing him to trial, and the other when a person believes that the State is being injured by one of the citizens
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="767c"/> and desires to succor the common weal.  Who and what sort the judges are must now be explained.  First, we must have a court common to all private persons who are having their third<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Apparently, this refers to the third court (of appeal) mentioned above, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 767a">Plat. Laws 767a 2 ff</bibl>.</note> dispute with one another.  It shall be formed in this way.  On the day preceding the commencement of a new year of office—which commences with the month next after the summer solstice—all the officials, whether holding office for one year only or longer, shall assemble in the same temple and, after adjuring the god,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="767d"/> they shall dedicate, so to say, one judge from each body of officials, namely, that member of each body whom they deem the best man and the most likely to decide the suits for his fellow-citizens during the ensuing year in the best and holiest way.  These being chosen, they shall undergo a scrutiny before those who have chosen them;  and should any be disqualified, they shall choose a substitute in like manner.  Those who pass the scrutiny shall act as judges for those who have escaped the other courts, and they shall cast their votes openly.
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="767e"/> The Councillors, and all the other officials, who have elected them, shall be obliged to attend these trials, both to hear and to see;  and anyone else that wishes may attend.  Anyone who accuses a judge of deliberately giving an unjust judgment shall go to the Law-wardens and lay his charge before them:  a judge that is convicted on such a charge shall submit to pay double the amount of the damage done to the injured party;  and if he be held to deserve a greater penalty, the judges of the case shall estimate what additional punishment must be inflicted, or what payment made to the State and to the person who took proceedings.  </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="768b"/> the choice of each of them.  In private suits also, so far as possible, all the citizens must have a share;  for the man that has no share in helping to judge imagines that he has no part or lot in the State at all.  Therefore there must also be courts for each tribe, and judges appointed by lot and to meet the sudden occasion must judge the cases, unbiased by appeals;  but the final verdict in all such cases must rest with that court which we declare to be organized in the most incorruptible way that is humanly possible,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="768c"/> specially for the benefit of those who have failed to obtain a settlement of their case either before the neighbors or in the tribal courts.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The whole of this account (<bibl n="Plat.

(1) local courts (composed of neighbors) , (2) tribal courts, (3) courts of appeal.</note> Thus as concerns the law-courts—which, as we say, cannot easily be called either <q type="emph">offices</q> or <q type="emph">non-offices</q> without ambiguity—this outline sketch serves to describe them in part, though there is a good deal it omits;  for detailed legislation and definition concerning suits would most properly be placed at the conclusion of the legislative code.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it, and whom does it concern?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You know how, for instance, the painter’s art in depicting each several subject seems never to get to an end, and in its embellishing it seems as if it would never stop

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="769c"/> Suppose that a man should propose to paint an object of extreme beauty, and that this should never grow worse, but always better, as time went on, do you not see that, since the painter is mortal, unless he leaves a successor who is able to repair the picture if it suffers through time, and also in the future to improve it by touching up any deficiency left by his own imperfect craftsmanship, his interminable toil will have results of but short duration?</said></p>

He purposes, first, to write down the laws, so far as he can, with complete precision;  next, when in the course of time he puts his decrees to the test of practice, you cannot suppose that any lawgiver will be so foolish as not to perceive that very many things must necessarily be left over, which it will be the duty of some successor to make right, in order that the constitution and the system of the State he has organized may always grow better,

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us address them thus:— <q type="spoken">Beloved Keepers of the Laws, in many departments of our legislation we shall leave out a vast number of matters (for we needs must do so) ;  yet, notwithstanding, all important matters, as well as the general description, we shall include, so far as we can, in our outline sketch.  Your help will be required to fill in this outline;  and you must listen
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="770c"/> to what I say about the aim you should have before you in doing so.  Megillus, Clinias and I have often stated to one another that aim, and we agree that it is rightly stated;  so we desire you to be in immediate unison with us, as our disciples, and to aim at those objects at which, as we three have agreed, the lawgiver and Law-warden ought to aim.  The sum and substance of our agreement was simply this:  that whatsoever be the way
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="770d"/> in which a member of our community—be he of the male or female sex, young or old,—may become a good citizen, possessed of the excellence of soul which belongs to man, whether derived from some pursuit or disposition, or from some form of diet, or from desire or opinion or mental study, to the attainment of this end all his efforts throughout the whole of his life shall be directed;  and not a single person shall show himself preferring any object which impedes this aim; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="770e"/> in fine, even as regards the State, he must allow it to be revolutionized, if it seems necessary, rather than voluntarily submit to the yoke of slavery under the rule of the worse, or else he must himself quit the State as an exile:  all such sufferings men must endure rather than change to a polity which naturally makes men worse.</q></said></p></div>

All other practices, which tend towards <q type="emph">goods</q>  (so-called), other than these, you must bid farewell to.</q>  For a beginning of the laws which are to follow, we must commence with things sacred.  First, we must consider anew<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 737e">Plat. Laws 737e</bibl>.</note> the number 5,040, and the number of convenient subdivisions which we found it to contain
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="771b"/> both as a whole and when divided up into tribes:  the tribal number is, as we said, a twelfth part of the whole number, being in its nature precisely 20 X 21.  Our whole number has twelve subdivisions, and the tribal number also has twelve;  and each such portion must be regarded as a sacred gift of God, conformed to the months and to the revolution of the universe.  Wherefore also every State is guided by native instinct to hold them sacred, although some men possibly have made their divisions more correctly than others, or have consecrated them
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="771c"/> more happily.  We, in any case, affirm now that we are perfectly correct in first selecting the number 5,040, which admits of division by all the numbers from 1 to 12, excepting only 11—and this omission is very easily remedied, since the mere subtraction of two hearths from the total restores an integral number as quotient:<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">5,040 = (11 X 458) + 2.</note> that this is really true we could show, at our leisure, by a fairly short explanation.  For the present, then, we shall trust to the oracular statement just delivered,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="771d"/> and we shall employ these subdivisions, and give to each portion the name of a God, or of a child of Gods, and bestow on it altars and all that belongs thereto;  and at these we shall appoint two assemblies every month for sacrifice—of which twelve (yearly) shall be for the whole tribal division, and twelve for its urban section only;  the object of these shall be, first, to offer thanksgiving to the gods and their attendants, and secondly, to promote fellowship amongst ourselves and the mutual acquaintance we spoke of, and association of every sort.
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="771e"/> For, in view of the fellowship and intercourse of marriage, it is necessary to eliminate ignorance, both on the part of the husband concerning the woman he marries and the family she comes from, and on the part of the father concerning the man to whom he gives his daughter;  for it is all-important in such matters to avoid, if possible, any mistake.</said></p>  </div>

        To achieve this serious purpose, sportive dances should be arranged for boys and girls;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="772"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="772a"/> and at these they should both view and be viewed, in a reasonable way and on occasions that offer a suitable pretext, with bodies unclad, save so far as sober modesty prescribes.  Of all such matters the officers of the choirs shall be the supervisors and controllers, and also, in conjunction with the Law-wardens, the lawgivers of all that we leave unprescribed.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="772b"/> and that rules and amendments should be made from year to year by those who have constant experience of them from year to year and are taught by practice, until it be decided that a satisfactory code has been made out to regulate all such proceedings.  A fair and sufficient period to assign for such experimental work would be ten years, both for sacrifices and for dances in all their several details;  each body of officials, acting in conjunction with the original lawgiver,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="772c"/> if he be still alive, or by themselves, if he be dead, shall report to the Law-wardens whatever is omitted in their own department, and shall make it good, until each detail seems to have reached its proper completion:  this done, they shall decree them as fixed rules, and employ them as well as the rest of the laws originally decreed by the law-giver.  In these they must never make any change voluntarily;  but if it should ever be thought that a necessity for change
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="772d"/> has arisen, all the people must be consulted, as well as all the officials, and they must seek advice from all the divine oracles;  and if there is a general consent by all, then they may make a change, but under no other conditions at any time;  and the objector to change shall always prevail according to law. When any man of twenty-five<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">But cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 721b">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="772e"/> but first let him hearken to the direction as to how he should seek what is proper and fitting, for, as Clinias maintains, one ought to introduce each law by a prelude suitable thereto.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

So let us say to the son of noble sires: <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="773"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="773a"/> My child, you must make a marriage that will commend itself to men of sense, who would counsel you neither to shun entirely connection with a poor family, nor to pursue connection with a rich one, but, other things being equal, to prefer always an alliance with a family of moderate means.  Such a course will benefit both the State and the united families,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Plt. 310c"> Pol. 310c ff</bibl>.</note> since in respect of excellence what is evenly balanced and symmetrical is infinitely superior to what is untempered.  The man who knows he is unduly hasty and violent in all his actions should win a bride
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="773b"/> sprung from steady parents;  while the man that is of a contrary nature should proceed to mate himself with one of the opposite kind.  Regarding marriage as a whole there shall be one general rule:  each man must seek to form such a marriage as shall benefit the State, rather than such as best pleases himself.  There is a natural tendency for everyone to make for the mate that most resembles himself, whence it results that the whole State becomes ill-balanced
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="773c"/> both in wealth and in moral habits;  and because of this, the consequences we least desire are those that generally befall most States.  To make express enactments about these matters by law—that, for instance, a rich man must not marry into a rich family, nor a man of wide power with a powerful family, or that man of hasty tempers must be obliged to seek alliances with those of slower tempers, and the slow with the hasty—this, besides being ridiculous, would cause widespread resentment;  for people do not find it easy to perceive
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="773d"/> that a State should be like a bowl of mixed wine, where the wine when first poured in foams madly, but as soon as it is chastened by the sober deity of water, it forms a fair alliance, and produces a potion that is good and moderate.  That this is precisely what happens in the blending of children is a thing which hardly anyone is capable of perceiving;  therefrom in the legal code we must omit such rules, and merely try by the spell of words to persuade each one
   <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="773e"/> to value the equality of his children more highly than the equality of a marriage with inordinate wealth, and by means of reproaches to divert from his object him who has set his heart on marrying for money, although we may not compel him by a written law. </said></p></div>

For probably the most vexed problem in all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> is the problem of the Helot-system of the Lacedaemonians, which some maintain to be good, others bad;  a less violent dispute rages round the subjection of the Mariandyni<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">These ancient inhabitants of N.E.

We know, of course, that we would all agree that one ought to own slaves that are as docile and good as possible;  for in the past many slaves have proved themselves better in every form of excellence than brothers or sons, and have saved their masters and their goods and
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="776e"/> their whole houses.  Surely we know that this language is used about slaves?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And is not the opposite kind of language also used,—that the soul of a slave has no soundness in it, and that a sensible man should never trust that class at all?  And our wisest poet, too, in speaking of Zeus,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="777"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="777a"/> declared that—<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Of half their wits far-thundering Zeus bereaves</l><l>Those men on whom the day of bondage falls.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well now, Clinias, since man is an intractable creature, it is plain that he is not at all likely to be or become easy to deal with in respect of the necessary distinction between slave and free-born master in actual experience.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is evident.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The slave is no easy chattel.  For actual experience shows
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="777c"/> how many evils result from slavery,—as in the frequent revolts in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, and in the States where there are many servants kept who speak the same tongue, not to speak of the crimes of all sorts committed by the <q type="soCalled">Corsairs,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The peculiar term <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδινοι</foreign> (<gloss>circling round</gloss>) seems to have been applied especially to these sea-rovers of the Tarentine coast.</note> as they are called, who haunt the coasts of Italy, and the reprisals therefor.  In view of all these facts, it is really a puzzle to know how to deal with all such matters.  Two means only are left for us to try—the one is,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="777d"/> not to allow the slaves, if they are to tolerate slavery quietly, to be all of the same nation, but, so far as possible, to have them of different races,—and the other is to accord them proper treatment, and that not only for their sakes, but still more for the sake of ourselves.  Proper treatment of servants consists in using no violence towards them, and in hurting them even less, if possible, than our own equals.  For it is his way of dealing with men whom it is easy for him to wrong that shows most clearly whether a man is genuine or hypocritical in his reverence for justice and hatred of injustice.  He, therefore, that in dealing with slaves proves himself, in his character and action,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="777e"/> undefiled by what is unholy or unjust will best be able to sow a crop of goodness,—and this we may say, and justly say, of every master, or king, and of everyone who possesses any kind of absolute power over a person weaker than himself.  </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="778b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It would seem that our city, being new and houseless hitherto, must provide for practically the whole of its house-building, arranging all the details of its architecture, including temples and walls.  These things are really, Clinias, prior to marriage;  but since our construction is now a verbal one, this is a very suitable place to deal with them;  when we come to the actual construction of the State, we shall, God willing,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="778c"/> make the houses precede marriage, and crown all our architectural work with our marriage-laws.  For the present we shall confine ourselves to a brief outline of our building regulations.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The temples we must erect all round the market-place, and in a circle round the whole city, on the highest spots, for the sake of ease in fencing them and of cleanliness:  beside the temples we will set the houses of the officials and the law-courts, in which, as being most holy places, they will give and receive judgments,—
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="778d"/> partly because therein they deal with holy matters, and partly because they are the seats of holy gods;  and in these will fittingly be held trials for murder and for all crimes worthy of death.  As to walls, Megillus, I would agree with your <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> in letting the walls lie sleeping in the ground, and not wake them up, and that for the following reasons.  It is a fine saying of the poet,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Unknown.  Cp. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 7.1330b.32">Aristot.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="779">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> But our plan, in addition to this, would deserve to raise roars of laughter,—I mean the plan of sending young men into the country every year to dig and trench and build, so as to keep the enemy out<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 760e">Plat. Laws 760e</bibl>.</note> and prevent their ever setting foot on the borders of the land—if we were also to build a wall round;  for, in the first place, a wall is by no means an advantage to a city as regards health, and, moreover, it usually causes a soft habit of soul in the inhabitants, by inviting them to seek refuge within it instead of repelling the enemy;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="779"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="779a"/> instead of securing their safety by keeping watch night and day, it tempts them to believe that their safety is ensured if they are fenced in with walls and gates and go to sleep, like men born to shirk toil, little knowing that ease is really the fruit of toil, whereas a new crop of toils is the inevitable outcome, as I think, of dishonorable ease and sloth.  But if men really must have a wall,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="779b"/> then the building of the private houses must be arranged from the start in such a way that the whole city may form a single wall;  all the houses must have good walls, built regularly and in a similar style, facing the roads,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">These <q type="mentioned">roads</q>  (or streets) would divide the city into blocks, surrounded by continuous walls formed by the outer circle of houses, all of the same size and shape.</note> so that the whole city will have the form of a single house, which will render its appearance not unpleasing, besides being far and away the best plan for ensuring safety and ease for defence.  To see that the original buildings remain will fittingly be the special charge of the inmates;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="779c"/> and the city-stewards should supervise them, and compel by fines those who are negligent, and also watch over the cleanliness of everything in the city, and prevent any private person from encroaching on State property either by buildings or diggings.  These officers must also keep a watch over the proper flowing of the rain-water, and over all other matters, whether within or without the city, that it is right for them to manage.  All such details—and all else that the lawgiver is unable to deal with and omits—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="779d"/> the Law-wardens shall regulate by supplementary decrees, taking account of the practical requirements.  And now that these buildings and those of the market-place, and the gymnasia, and all the schools have been erected and await their inmates, and the theaters their spectators, let us proceed to the subject which comes next after marriage, taking our legislation in order.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Whoever proposes to publish laws for States,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="780"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="780a"/> regulating the conduct of the citizens in State affairs and public matters, and deems that there is no need to make laws for their private conduct, even in necessary matters, but that everyone should be allowed to spend his day just as he pleases, instead of its being compulsory for everything, public and private, to be done by a regular rule, and supposes that, if he leaves private conduct unregulated by law, the citizens will still consent to regulate their public and civil life by law—this man is wrong in his proposal.  For what reason have I said this?  For this reason,—because we shall assert that the married people must take their meals at the public messes neither more nor less than they did
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="780b"/> during the time preceding marriage.  When the customs of the public mess first arose in your countries—probably dictated by a war or by some event of equal potency, when you were short of men and in dire straits,—it seemed an astonishing institution;  but after you had had experience of these public messes and had been obliged to adopt them, the custom seemed to contribute admirably towards security;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="780c"/> and in some such way as that the public mess came to be one of your established institutions.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1272a">Aristot. Pol. 1272a 2 ff</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is likely enough.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So, though this was once, as I said, an astonishing and alarming institution to impose on people, a man who tried to impose it as a law nowadays would not find it an equally difficult task.  But the practice which follows on this institution, and which, if carried out, would be really successful,—although at present it nowhere is carried out, and so causes the lawgiver (if he tries) to be practically carding his wool (as the proverb has it) into the fire, and laboring in vain at an endless tale of toils,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="780d"/> this practice it is neither easy to state nor, when stated, to carry into effect.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Why do you show so much hesitation, Stranger, in mentioning this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Listen now, so that we may not spend much time on the matter to no purpose.  Everything that takes place in the State, if it participates in order and law, confers all kinds of blessings;  but most things that are either without order or badly-ordered counteract the effects of the well-ordered.  And it is into this plight that the practice we are discussing has fallen.  In your case, Clinias <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="780e"/> and Megillus, public meals for men are, as I said, rightly and admirably established by a divine necessity, but for women this institution is left, quite wrongly, unprescribed by law, nor are public meals for them brought <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="781"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="781a"/> to the light of day; </said></p> </div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="781">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> instead of this, the female sex, that very section of humanity which, owing to its frailty, is in other respects most secretive and intriguing, is abandoned to its disorderly condition through the perverse compliance of the lawgiver.  Owing to your neglect of that sex, you have had an influx of many consequences which would have been much better than they now are if they had been under legal control.  For it is not merely, as one might suppose, a matter affecting one-half of our whole task—this matter of neglecting to regulate women,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="781b"/> but in as far as females are inferior in goodness to males, just in so far it affects more than the half.  It is better, then, for the welfare of the State to revise and reform this institution, and to regulate all the institutions for both men and women in common.  At present, however, the human race is so far from having reached this happy position, that a man of discretion must actually avoid all mention of the practice in districts and States
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="781c"/> where even the existence of public meals is absolutely without any formal recognition.  How then shall one attempt, without being laughed at, actually to compel women to take food and drink publicly and exposed to the view of all?  The female sex would more readily endure anything rather than this:  accustomed as they are to live a retired and private life, women will use every means to resist being led out into the light, and they will prove much too strong for the lawgiver.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="781d"/> So that elsewhere, as I said, women would not so much as listen to the mention of the right rule without shrieks of indignation;  but in our State perhaps they will.  So if we agree that our discourse about the polity as a whole must not—so far as theory goes—prove abortive, I am willing to explain how this institution is good and fitting, if you are equally desirous to listen, but otherwise to leave it alone.</said></p>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="782"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="782a"/> and will never have an end, but always was and always will be, or else it must have been in existence an incalculable length of time from the date when it first began.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Undoubtedly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, do we not suppose that all the world over and in all sorts of ways there have been risings and fallings of States, and institutions of every variety of order and disorder, and appetites for food—both meats and drinks—of every kind, and all sorts of variations in the seasons, during which it is probable that the animals underwent
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="782b"/> innumerable changes?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are we to believe, then, that vines, not previously existing, appeared at a certain stage;  and olives, likewise, and the gifts of Demeter and Kore?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or Persephone, daughter of the Earth-mother, Demeter.  Triptolemus was a mythical hero of EIeusis, worshipped as the inventor and patron of agriculture.</note> And that some Triptolemus was the minister of such fruits?  And during the period that these fruits were as yet non-existent, must we not suppose that the animals turned, as they do now, to feeding on one another.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="782c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The custom of men sacrificing one another is, in fact, one that survives even now among many peoples;  whereas amongst others we hear of how the opposite custom existed, when they were forbidden so much as to eat an ox, and their offerings to the gods consisted, not of animals, but of cakes of meal and grain steeped in honey, and other such bloodless sacrifices, and from flesh they abstained as though it were unholy to eat it or to stain with blood the altars of the gods;  instead of that, those of us men who then existed lived what is called an <q type="term">Orphic life,</q> keeping wholly to inanimate food and,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="782d"/> contrariwise, abstaining wholly from things animate.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly what you say is widely reported and easy to credit.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Someone might ask us— <q type="spoken">For what purpose have you now said all this?</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> A correct surmise, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So I will try, if I can, Clinias, to explain the subject which comes next in order.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Say on.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I observe that with men all things depend on a threefold need and desire, wherein if they proceed rightly, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="782e"/> the result is goodness, if badly, the opposite.  Of these desires they possess those for food and drink as soon as they are born;  and about the whole sphere of food every creature has an instinctive lust, and is full of craving, and quite deaf to any suggestion that they ought to do anything else than satisfy their tastes and desires for all such objects, and thus rid themselves entirely of all pain.</said></p></div>

These three morbid states<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The soul is in a <q type="emph">diseased</q> state when wholly dominated by any irrational desire or passion.</note> we must direct towards what is most good, instead of what is (nominally) most pleasant, trying to check them by means of the three greatest forces—fear, law, and true reasoning,—reinforced by the Muses and the Gods of Games, so as to quench thereby their increase and inflow.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="783b"/> So let us place the subject of the production of children next after that of marriage, and after their production, their nurture and education.  If our discourse proceeds on these lines, possibly each of our laws will attain completion, and when we come to the public meals, by approaching these at close quarters we shall probably discern more clearly whether such associations ought to be for men only, or for women as well;  and thus we shall not only prescribe the preliminaries that are still without legal regulation, and place them as fences
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="783c"/> before the common meals, but also, as I said just now, we shall discuss more exactly the character of the common meals, and thus be more likely to prescribe for them laws that are suitable and fitting.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are perfectly right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us, then, bear in mind the things we mentioned a moment ago;  for probably we shall need them all presently.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What are the things you bid us remember?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Those we distinguished by the three terms we used:  we spoke, you recollect, of eating, secondly of drinking, and
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="783d"/> thirdly of sexual excitement.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We shall certainly remember the things you now bid us, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very good.  Let us now come to the nuptials, so as to instruct them how and in what manner they ought to produce children, and, if we fail to persuade them, to threaten them by certain laws.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The bride and bridegroom must set their minds to produce for the State children of the greatest possible goodness and beauty.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="784b"/> The period of procreation and supervision shall be ten years and no longer, whenever there is an abundant issue of offspring;  but in case any are without issue to the end of this period, they shall take counsel in common to decide what terms are advantageous for both parties, in conjunction with their kindred and the women-officials, and be divorced.  If any dispute arises as to what is fitting and advantageous for each party, they shall choose ten of the Law-wardens,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="784c"/> and abide by the regulations they shall permit or impose.  The women-inspectors shall enter the houses of the young people, and, partly by threats, partly by admonition, stop them from their sin and folly:  if they cannot do so, they shall go and report the case to the Law-wardens, and they shall prevent them.  If they also prove unable, they shall inform the State Council, posting up a sworn statement that they are <q type="emph">verily unable to reform So-and-so.</q> The man that is thus posted up,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="784d"/> if he fails to defeat those who have thus posted him in the law-courts,—shall suffer the following disqualifications:  he shall not attend any marriage or children’s birthday feasts, and if he does so, anyone who wishes may with impunity punish him with blows.  The same law shall hold good for the women:  the offender shall have no part in women’s excursions, honors, or invitations to weddings or birthday feasts, if she has been similarly posted up as disorderly and has lost her suit.  <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="784e"/> And when they shall have finished producing children according to the laws, if the man have sexual intercourse with a strange woman, or the woman with a man, while the latter are still within the procreative age-limit, they shall be liable to the same penalty as was stated for those still producing children.  </said></p></div>

Sexual conduct shall lie unmentioned or unprescribed by law when the majority show due propriety therein;  but if they are disorderly, then what is thus prescribed shall be executed according to the laws then enacted. For everyone the first year is the beginning of the whole life: it ought to be inscribed as life’s beginning for both boy and girl in their ancestral shrines:  beside it, on a whited wall in every phratry, there should be written up the number of the archons who give its number to the year;  and the names of the living members of the phratry shall be written always close together,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="785b"/> and those of the deceased shall be erased.  The limit of the marriage-age shall be from sixteen to twenty years—the longest time allowed—for a girl, and for a boy from thirty to thirty-five.  The limit for official posts shall be forty for a woman and thirty for a man.  For military services the limit shall be from twenty years up to sixty for a man;  for women they shall ordain what is possible and fitting in each case, after they have finished bearing children, and up to the age of fifty, in whatever kind of military work it may be thought right to employ their services.</said></p></div></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="788"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="788a"/><label>Ath.</label> Now that our children, of both sexes, are born, our proper course will be to deal in the next place with their nurture and education.  This is a subject which it is wholly impossible to pass over;  but obviously it can be treated more suitably by way of precept and exhortation than by legislation.  For in the private life of the family many trivial things are apt to be done which escape general notice,—things which are the result of individual feelings of pain, pleasure, or desire,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="788b"/> and which contravene the instructions of the lawgiver;  and these will produce in the citizens a multiplicity of contradictory tendencies.  This is bad for a State.  For while, on the one hand, it is improper and undignified to impose penalties on these practices by law, because of their triviality and the frequency of their occurrence, on the other hand, it detracts from the authority of the law which stands written when men grow used to breaking the law in trivial matters repeatedly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="788c"/> Hence, while it is impossible to pass over these practices in silence, it is difficult to legislate concerning them.  The practices I refer to I will try to make clear by bringing some specimens, as it were, to the light;  for at present my words rather resemble a <q type="emph">dark speech.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is quite true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> When we said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 643d">Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly we did.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="788d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And I suppose that (to take the simplest point) the most beautiful bodies must grow up from earliest infancy as straight as possible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, do we not observe that in every living creature the first shoot makes by far the largest and longest growth;  so that many people stoutly maintain that in point of height men grow more in the first five years of life than in the next twenty?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is true.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="789">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But we know, don’t we, that when growth occurs rapidly,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="789"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="789a"/> without plenty of suitable exercise, it produces in the body countless evils?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And when bodies receive most food, then they require most exercise?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that, Stranger?  Are we to prescribe most exercise for new-born babes and tiny infants?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Nay, even earlier than that,—we shall prescribe it for those nourished inside the bodies of their mothers.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean, my dear sir?  Is it unborn babes you are talking of?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="789b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is.  Still it is by no means surprising that you know nothing of this pre-natal gymnastic;  but, strange though it is, I should like to explain it to you.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means do so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In our country it is easier to understand a practice of this kind, because there are people there who carry their sports to excess.  At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> we find not only boys but sometimes old men rearing birds and training such creatures to fight one another.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="789c"/> But they are far from thinking that the training they give them by exciting their pugnacity provides sufficient exercise;  in addition to this, each man takes up his bird and keeps it tucked away in his fist, if it is small, or under his arm, if it is large, and in this way they walk many a long mile in order to improve the condition, not of their own bodies, but of these creatures.  Thus clearly do they show to any observant person that all bodies benefit, as by a tonic, when they are moved by any kind of shaking or motion,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="789d"/> whether they are moved by their own action—as in a swing or in a rowing-boat—or are carried along on horseback or by any other rapidly moving bodies;  and that this is the reason why bodies can deal successfully with their supplies of meat and drink and provide us with health and beauty, and strength as well.  This being the state of the case, what does it behove us to do in the future?  Shall we risk ridicule,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="789e"/> and lay down a law that the pregnant woman shall walk, and that the child, while still soft, shall be molded like wax, and be kept in swaddling clothes till it is two years old?  And shall we also compel the nurses by legal penalties to keep carrying the children somehow, either to the fields or to the temples or to their relatives, all the time until they are able to stand upright;  and after that, still to persevere in carrying them until they are three years old, as a precaution against the danger of distorting their legs by over-pressure while they are still young?  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="790">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And that the nurses shall be
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="790"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="790a"/> as strong as possible?  And shall we impose a written penalty for every failure to carry out these injunctions?  Such a course is quite out of the question;  for it would lead to a superabundance of that consequence which we mentioned a moment ago.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What was that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The consequence of our incurring ridicule in abundance, in addition to meeting with a blank refusal to obey on the part of the nurses, with their womanish and servile minds.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What reason, then, had we for saying that these rules ought to be stated?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The reason was this:  the minds of the masters and of the freemen
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="790b"/> in the States may perhaps listen, and so come to the right conclusion that, unless private affairs in a State are rightly managed, it is vain to suppose that any stable code of laws can exist for public affairs;  and when he perceives this, the individual citizen may of himself adopt as laws the rules we have now stated, and, by so doing and thus ordering aright both his household and his State, may achieve happiness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Such a result seems quite probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Consequently we must not desist from this kind of legislation until we have described in detail the treatment suited for the souls
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="790c"/> of young children in the same manner as we commenced our advice regarding their bodies.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are quite right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us take this, then, as a fundamental assumption in both cases,—that for both body and soul of the very young a process of nursing and moving, that is as continuous as possible both by day and by night, is in all cases salutary, and especially in the case of the youngest:  it is like having them always rocked—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="790d"/> if that were possible—on the sea.  As it is, with new-born infants one should reproduce this condition as nearly as possible.  Further evidence of this may be seen in the fact that this course is adopted and its usefulness recognized both by those who nurse small children and by those who administer remedies in cases of Corybantism.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="mentioned">Corybantism</q> is a technical term for a state of morbid mental excitement (cp. <q type="emph">tarantism</q>) derived from <q type="soCalled">Corybantes,</q> the name given to the frenzied worshippers of Bacchus.</note>  Thus when mothers have children suffering from sleeplessness, and want to lull them to rest, the treatment they apply is to give them, not quiet, but motion, for they rock them constantly in their arms;  and instead of silence,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="790e"/> they use a kind of crooning noise;  and thus they literally cast a spell upon the children (like the victims of Bacchic frenzy) by employing the combined movements of dance and song as a remedy.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And what, Stranger, are we to suppose is the main cause of this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is easy enough to see.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?</said></p></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="791">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Both these affections are forms of fright;  and frights are due to a poor condition of soul.  So whenever one applies an external shaking
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="791"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="791a"/> to affections of this kind, the external motion thus applied overpowers the internal motion of fear and frenzy, and by thus overpowering it, it brings about a manifest calm in the soul and a cessation of the grievous palpitation of the heart which had existed in each case.  Thus it produces very satisfactory results.  The children it puts to sleep;  the Bacchants, who are awake, it brings into a sound state of mind instead of a frenzied condition, by means of dancing and playing, with the help of whatsoever gods
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="791b"/> they chance to be worshipping with sacrifice.  This is—to put it shortly—quite a plausible account of the matter.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most plausible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Seeing, then, that these causes produce the effects described, in the case of the people mentioned one should observe this point,—that every soul that is subjected to fright from youth will be specially liable to become timid:  and this, as all would aver, is not to practice courage, but cowardice.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course it is.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="791c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The opposite course, of practicing courage from youth up, consists, we shall say, in the conquering of the frights and fears that assail us.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us say, then, that this factor—namely, the exercise of quite young children by the various motions—contributes greatly towards developing one part of the soul’s virtue.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moreover, cheerfulness of soul and its opposite will constitute no small part of stoutheartedness and faintheartedness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="791d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What way can we find, then, for implanting at once in the new-born child whichever of these qualities we desire?  We must endeavor to indicate how and to what extent we have them at our command.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The doctrine held amongst us, I may explain, is this,—that whereas luxurious living renders the disposition of the young morose and irascible and too easily moved by trifles, its opposite (which is uttermost and cruel enslavement) makes them lowly and mean-spirited and misanthropic, and thus unfit to associate with others.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="791e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way, then, should the State at large rear up infants that are still incapable of understanding speech or receiving other kinds of education?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In this way:  it is usual for every creature that is born—and the human child as much as any— to utter at once a loud outcry;  and, what is more, the child is the most liable of them all to be afflicted with tears as well as outcries.</said></p>
        <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite true.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="792">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> When nurses are trying to discover what a baby wants, they judge by these very same signs in offering it things.

Thus infants indicate what they like by means of weepings and outcries—truly no happy signals!—and this period of infancy lasts not less than three years, which is no small fraction of one’s time to spend ill or well.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> There, my good sir, I must part company with Clinias.

And I maintain that whosoever of us would be godlike must pursue this state of soul, neither becoming himself prone at all to pleasures, even as he will not be devoid of pain, not allowing any other person—old or young, man or woman—to be in this condition and least of all,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="792e"/> so far as possible, the new-born babe.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are perfectly right, Clinias.  So then let the three of us together consider this next point.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That all the regulations which we are now expounding are what are commonly termed <q type="emph">unwritten laws.</q>  And these as a whole are just the same as
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="793b"/> what men call <q type="emph">ancestral customs.</q>  Moreover, the view which was recently<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 788b">Plat. Laws 788b</bibl>.</note> impressed upon us, that one should neither speak of these as <q type="emph">laws</q> nor yet leave them without mention, was a right view.  For it is these that act as bonds in every constitution, forming a link between all its laws (both those already enacted in writing and those still to be enacted), exactly like ancestral customs of great antiquity, which, if well established and practiced, serve to wrap up securely the laws already written, whereas if they perversely
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="793c"/> go aside from the right way, like builders’ props that collapse under the middle of a house, they bring everything else tumbling down along with them, one thing buried under another, first the props themselves and then the fair superstructure, once the ancient supports have fallen down.  Bearing this in mind, Clinias, we must clamp together this State of yours, which is a new one, by every possible means, omitting nothing great or small
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="793d"/> in the way of laws, customs and institutions;  for it is by all such means that a State is clamped together, and neither kind of law is permanent without the other.  Consequently, we need not be surprised if the influx of a number of apparently trivial customs or usages should make our laws rather long.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you say is quite true, and we will bear it in mind.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If one could carry out these regulations methodically, and not merely apply them casually,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="793e"/> in the case of girls and boys up to the age of three, they would conduce greatly to the benefit of our infant nurslings.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="794">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> To form the character of the child over three and up to six years old there will be need of games:  by then punishment must be used to prevent their getting pampered,—not, however, punishment of a degrading kind, but just as we said before,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 777a">Plat. Laws 777a</bibl>.</note> in the case of slaves, that one should avoid enraging the persons punished by using degrading punishments, or pampering them by leaving them unpunished,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="794"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="794a"/> so in the case of the free-born the same rule holds good.  Children of this age have games which come by natural instinct;  and they generally invent them of themselves whenever they meet together.  As soon as they have reached the age of three, all the children from three to six must meet together at the village temples, those belonging to each village assembling at the same place.  Moreover, the nurses of these children must watch over their behavior, whether it be orderly or disorderly;  and over the nurses themselves and the whole band of children
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="794b"/> one of the twelve women already elected must be appointed annually to take charge of each band, the appointment resting with the Law-wardens.  These women shall be elected by the women who have charge of the supervision of marriage,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 784a">Plat. Laws 784a</bibl>.</note> one out of each tribe and all of a like age.  The woman thus appointed shall pay an official visit to the temple every day, and she shall employ a State servant and deal summarily with male or female slaves and strangers,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="794c"/> but in the case of citizens, if the person protests against the punishment, she shall bring him for trial before the city stewards;  but if no protest is made, she shall inflict summary justice equally on citizens.  After the age of six, each sex shall be kept separate, boys spending their time with boys, and likewise girls with girls;  and when it is necessary for them to begin lessons, the boys must go to teachers of riding, archery, javelin-throwing and slinging, and the girls also, if they agree to it, must share in the lessons,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="794d"/> and especially such as relate to the use of arms.  For, as regards the view now prevalent regarding these matters, it is based on almost universal ignorance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What view?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The view that, in the case of hands, right and left are by nature different in respect of their utility for special acts;  but, as a matter of fact, in the case of the feet and the lower limbs there is plainly no difference in working capacity; <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="794e"/> and it is due to the folly of nurses and mothers that we have all become limping, so to say, in our hands.  For in natural ability the two limbs are almost equally balanced;  but we ourselves by habitually using them in a wrong way have made them different.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="795">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  In actions of trifling importance this does not matter—as for example, whether a man uses the left hand for the fiddle and the right hand for the bow, and things of that sort;  but to follow these precedents and to use the hands in this way on other occasions, when there is no necessity, is very like foolishness.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="795"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="795a"/> This is shown by the Scythian custom not only of using the left hand to draw the bow and the right to fit the arrow to it, but also of using both hands alike for both actions.  And there are countless other instances of a similar kind, in connection with driving horses and other occupations, which teach us that those who treat the left hand as weaker than the right are confuted by nature.  But this, as we have said, matters little in the case of fiddle-bows of horn
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="795b"/> and similar implements;  but when it is a case of using iron instruments of war—bows, darts and the like—it matters a great deal, and most of all when weapon is to be used against weapon at close quarters.  There is a vast difference here between the taught and the untaught, the trained and the untrained warrior.  For just as the athlete who is thoroughly practiced in the pancratium or in boxing or wrestling is capable of fighting on his left side, and does not move that side as if it were numb
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="795c"/> or lame, whenever he is compelled to bring it into action through his opponent shifting to the other side,—in precisely the same way, I take it, in regard to the use of weapons of war and everything else, it ought to be considered the correct thing that the man who possesses two sets of limbs, fit both for offensive and defensive action, should, so far as possible, suffer neither of these to go unpracticed or untaught.  Indeed, if a man were gifted by nature with the frame of a Geryon or a Briareus, with his hundred hands he ought to be able to throw a hundred darts.  So all these matters must be the care of
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="795d"/> the male and female officers, the women overseeing the games and the feeding of the children, and the men their lessons, to the intent that all the boys and girls may be sound of hand and foot, and may in no wise, if possible, get their natures warped by their habits. The lessons may, for practical convenience, be divided under two heads—the gymnastical, which concern the body, and the musical, which aim at goodness of soul.  Of gymnastic there are two kinds, dancing
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="795e"/> and wrestling.  Of dancing there is one branch in which the style of the Muse is imitated, preserving both freedom and nobility, and another which aims at physical soundness, agility and beauty by securing for the various parts and members of the body the proper degree of flexibility and extension and bestowing also the rhythmical motion which belongs to each, and which accompanies <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="796"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="796a"/> the whole of dancing and is diffused throughout it completely.</said></p></div>  
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="796">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  As to the devices introduced by Antaeus or Cercyon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Mythical giants and wrestlers, to whom were ascribed such devices as the use of the legs in wrestling.  Epeius is mentioned as a boxer in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.668">Hom.

But the exercises of stand-up wrestling, with the twisting free of neck, hands and sides, when practiced with ardor and with a firm and graceful pose, and directed towards strength and health,—these must not be omitted, since they are useful for all purposes;  but we must charge both the pupils and their teachers—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="796b"/> when we reach this point in our legislation—that the latter should impart these lessons gently, and the former receive them gratefully.  Nor should we omit such mimic dances as are fitting for use by our choirs,—for instance, the sword-dance of the Curetes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Priests of the Idaean Zeus.</note> here in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and that of the Dioscori<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Castor and Pollux.</note> in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>;  and at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, too, our Virgin-Lady<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Athene.</note> gladdened by the pastime of the dance deemed it not seemly to sport with empty hands,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="796c"/> but rather to tread the measure vested in full panoply.  These examples it would well become the boys and girls to copy, and so cultivate the favor of the goddess, alike for service in war and for use at festivals.  It shall be the rule for the children, from the age of six until they reach military age, whenever they approach any god and form processions, to be always equipped with arms and horses, and with dance and march, now quick, now slow, to make their supplications to the gods and the children of gods.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="796d"/> Contests, too, and preliminary trials must be carried out with a view to the objects stated, if at all;  for these objects are useful both in peace and war, alike for the State and for private families;  but all other kinds of work and play and bodily exercise are not worthy of a gentleman. And now, O Megillus and Clinias, I have pretty fully described that gymnastic training which—as I said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 672d">Plat. Laws 672d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 673a">Plat. Laws 673a ff</bibl>.;  cp. also <bibl n="Plat. Laws 813d">Plat. Laws 813d ff</bibl>.</note> early in our discourse—requires description:  here it is in its full completeness.  So if you know of a better gymnastic than this,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="796e"/> disclose it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is no easy thing, Stranger, to reject your account of gymnastic training and competition, and produce a better one.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The subject which comes next to this, and deals with the gifts of Apollo and the Muses, is one which we previously<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 673b">Plat. Laws 673b</bibl>.</note> thought we had done with, and that the only subject left was gymnastic;  but I plainly see now, not only what still remains to be said to everybody, but also that it ought to come first.  Let us, then, state these points in order.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means let us do so.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="797">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="797"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="797a"/><label>Ath.</label> Give ear to me now, albeit ye have already done so in the past.  None the less, one must take great heed, now as before, both in the telling and in the hearing of a thing that is supremely strange and novel.  To make the statement that I am going to make is an alarming task;  yet I will summon up my courage, and not shrink from it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is the statement you refer to, Stranger?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I assert that there exists in every State a complete ignorance about children’s games—how that they are of decisive importance for legislation, as determining whether the laws enacted are to be permanent or not.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="797b"/> For when the program of games is prescribed and secures that the same children always play the same games and delight in the same toys in the same way and under the same conditions, it allows the real and serious laws also to remain undisturbed;  but when these games vary and suffer innovations, amongst other constant alterations the children are always shifting their fancy from one game to another, so that neither in respect of their own bodily gestures nor in respect of their equipment have they any fixed and acknowledged standard of propriety and impropriety;  but the man they hold in special honor is he who is always innovating or introducing some novel device
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="797c"/> in the matter of form or color or something of the sort;  whereas it would be perfectly true to say that a State can have no worse pest than a man of that description, since he privily alters the characters of the young, and causes them to contemn what is old and esteem what is new.  And I repeat again that there is no greater mischief a State can suffer than such a dictum and doctrine:  just listen while I tell you how great an evil it is.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="797d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Do you mean the way people rail at antiquity in States?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Precisely.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is a theme on which you will find us no grudging listeners, but the most sympathetic possible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I should certainly expect it to be so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Only say on.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, let us listen to one another and address one another on this subject with greater care than ever.  Nothing, as we shall find, is more perilous than change in respect of everything, save only what is bad,—in respect of seasons, winds, bodily diet, mental disposition, everything in short with the solitary exception, as I said just now, of the bad. <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="797e"/> Accordingly, if one considers the human body, and sees how it grows used to all kinds of meats and drinks and exercises, even though at first upset by them, and how presently out of these very materials it grows flesh that is akin to them, and acquiring thus a familiar acquaintance with, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="798"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="798a"/> and fondness for, all this diet, lives a most healthy and pleasant life; </said></p> </div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="798">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> and further, should a man be forced again to change back to one of the highly-reputed diets, how he is upset and ill at first, and recovers with difficulty as he gets used again to the food,—it is precisely the same, we must suppose, with the intellects of men and the nature of their souls.  For if there exist laws under which men have been reared up and which (by the blessing of Heaven) have remained unaltered
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="798b"/> for many centuries, so that there exists no recollection or report of their ever having been different from what they now are,—then the whole soul is forbidden by reverence and fear to alter any of the things established of old.  By hook or by crook, then, the lawgiver must devise a means whereby this shall be true of his State.  Now here is where I discover the means desired:—Alterations in children’s games are regarded by all lawgivers (as we said above<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 797b">Plat. Laws 797b</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 797C">Plat. Laws 797C</bibl>.</note>) as being mere matters of play, and not as the causes of serious mischief;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="798c"/> hence, instead of forbidding them, they give in to them and adopt them.  They fail to reflect that those children who innovate in their games grow up into men different from their fathers;  and being thus different themselves, they seek a different mode of life, and having sought this, they come to desire other institutions and laws;  and none of them dreads the consequent approach of that result which we described just now as the greatest of all banes
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="798d"/> to a State.  The evil wrought by changes in outward forms would be of less importance;  but frequent changes in matters involving moral approval and disapproval are, as I maintain, of extreme importance, and require the utmost caution.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, then, do we still put our trust in those former statements of ours,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 654e">Plat. Laws 654e ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 668a">Plat. Laws 668a</bibl>.</note> in which we said that matters of rhythm and music generally are imitations of the manners of good
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="798e"/> or bad men?  Or how do we stand?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Our view at least remains unaltered.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We assert, then, that every means must be employed, not only to prevent our children from desiring to copy different models in dancing or singing, but also to prevent anyone from tempting them by the inducement of pleasures of all sorts.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Quite right.</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="799">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="799"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="799a"/><label>Ath.</label> To attain this end, can any one of us suggest a better device than that of the Egyptians?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 656d">Plat. Laws 656d</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What device is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The device of consecrating all dancing and all music.  First, they should ordain the sacred feasts, by drawing up an annual list of what feasts are to be held, and on what dates, and in honor of what special gods and children of gods and daemons;  and they should ordain next what hymn is to be sung at each of the religious sacrifices, and with what dances
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="799b"/> each such sacrifice is to be graced;  these ordinances should be first made by certain persons, and then the whole body of citizens, after making a public sacrifice to the Fates and all the other deities, should consecrate with a libation these ordinances—dedicating each of the hymns to their respective gods and divinities.  And if any man proposes other hymns or dances besides these for any god, the priests and priestesses will be acting in accordance with both religion and law when, with the help of the Law-wardens, they expel him from the feast;  and if the man resists expulsion, he shall be liable, so long as he lives, to be prosecuted for impiety by anyone who chooses.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is right.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="799c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Since we find ourselves now dealing with this theme, let us behave as befits ourselves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. with the caution proper to old men.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what respect?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Every young man—not to speak of old men—on hearing or seeing anything unusual and strange, is likely to avoid jumping to a hasty and impulsive solution of his doubts about it, and to stand still;  just as a man who has come to a crossroads and is not quite sure of his way, if he be travelling alone, will question himself, or if travelling with others,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="799d"/> will question them too about the matter in doubt, and refuse to proceed until he has made sure by investigation of the direction of his path.  We must now do likewise.  In our discourse about laws, the point which has now occurred to us being strange, we are bound to investigate it closely;  and in a matter so weighty we, at our age, must not lightly assume or assert that we can make any reliable statement about it on the spur of the moment.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is very true.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="799e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We shall, therefore, devote some time to this subject, and only when we have investigated it thoroughly shall we regard our conclusions as certain.  But lest we be uselessly hindered from completing the ordinance which accompanies the laws with which we are now concerned, let us proceed to their conclusion.  For very probably (if Heaven so will) this exposition, when completely brought to its conclusion, may also clear up the problem now before us.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well said, Stranger:  let us do just as you say.</said></p></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="800">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let the strange fact be granted, we say, that our hymns are now made into <q type="term">nomes</q> (laws),<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A play on the double sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>,—<gloss>law</gloss> and <gloss>chant</gloss> or <gloss>tune</gloss>:  cp. 700 B, 722 D, 734 E.</note> just as the men of old, it would seem, gave this name to harp-tunes,—
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="800"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="800a"/> so that they, too, perhaps, would not wholly disagree with our present suggestion, but one of them may have divined it vaguely, as in a dream by night or a waking vision:  anyhow, let this be the decree on the matter:—In violation of public tunes and sacred songs and the whole choristry of the young, just as in violation of any other <q type="term">nome</q> (law), no person shall utter a note or move a limb in the dance.  He that obeys shall be free of all penalty;  but he that disobeys shall (as we said just now) be punished by the Law-wardens, the priestesses and the priests.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="800b"/> Shall we now lay down these enactments in our statement?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, lay them down.</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> How shall we enact these rules by law in such a way as to escape ridicule?  Let us consider yet another point concerning them.  The safest plan is to begin by framing in our discourse some typical cases,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκμαγεῖον</foreign>(<gloss>mold</gloss> or <gloss>impression</gloss>)  is here used, much like <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, of a class or <gloss>type</gloss> of cases needing legal regulation.</note> so to call them;  one such case I may describe in this way.  Suppose that, when a sacrifice is being performed and the offerings duly burned, some private worshipper—a son or a brother —when standing beside the altar
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="800c"/> and the offering, should blaspheme most blasphemously, would not his voice bring upon his father and the rest of the family a feeling of despair and evil forebodings?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It would.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, in our part of the world this is what happens, one may almost say, in nearly every one of the States.  Whenever a magistrate holds a public sacrifice, the next thing is for a crowd of choirs— not merely one—to advance and take their stand, not at a distance from the altars,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="800d"/> but often quite close to them;  and then they let out a flood of blasphemy over the sacred offerings, racking the souls of their audience with words, rhythms and tunes most dolorous, and the man that succeeds at once in drawing most tears from the sacrificing city carries off the palm of victory.  Must we not reject<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Music should he used as an ennobling educational instrument, promoting self-control, not as a means of exciting vulgar sentiment and passion.</note> such a custom as this?  For if it is ever really necessary that the citizens should listen to such doleful strains, it would be more fitting that the choirs that attend should be hired from abroad, and that not on holy days but only on fast-days—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="800e"/> just as a corpse is escorted with Carian music by hired mourners.  Such music would also form the fitting accompaniment for hymns of this kind;  and the garb befitting these funeral hymns would not be any crowns nor gilded ornaments, but just the opposite, for I want to get done with this subject as soon as I can.  Only I would have us ask ourselves again<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 800b">Plat. Laws 800b</bibl>.</note> this single question,—are we satisfied to lay this down as our first typical rule for hymns?</said></p>
 <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What rule?</said></p></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="801">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That of auspicious speech;  and must we have a kind of hymn that is
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="801"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="801a"/> altogether in all respects auspicious?  Or shall I ordain that it shall be so, without further questioning?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means ordain it so;  for that is a law carried by a unanimous vote.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What then, next to auspicious speech, should be the second law of music?  Is it not that prayers should be made on each occasion to those gods to whom offering is made?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The third law, I suppose, will be this,—that the poets, knowing that prayers are requests addressed to gods, must take the utmost care lest unwittingly
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="801b"/> they request a bad thing as though it were a good thing;  for if such a prayer were made, it would prove, I fancy, a ludicrous blunder.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Did not our argument convince us, a little while ago,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 742d">Plat. Laws 742d</bibl>.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It did.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What then shall we say that this statement serves to illustrate?  Is it not this,—that the tribe of poets is not wholly capable of discerning
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="801c"/> very well what is good and what not?  For surely when a poet, suffering from this error, composes prayers either in speech or in song, he will be making our citizens contradict ourselves in their prayers for things of the greatest moment;  yet this, as we have said,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 801b">Plat. Laws 801b</bibl>.</note> is an error than which few are greater.  So shall we also lay down this as one of our laws and typical cases regarding music?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What law?  Explain it to us more clearly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The law that the poet shall compose nothing which goes beyond the limits of what the State holds to be legal and right, fair and good;  nor shall he show
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="801d"/> his compositions to any private person until they have first been shown to the judges appointed to deal with these matters, and to the Law-wardens, and have been approved by them.  And in fact we have judges appointed in those whom we selected to be the legislators of music and in the supervisor of education.  Well then, I repeat my question,—is this to be laid down as our third law, typical case, and example?  What think you?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Be it laid down by all means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Next to these, it will be most proper to sing hymns and praise to the gods, coupled with prayers;  and after the gods will come prayers combined with praise to daemons and heroes, as is befitting to each.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> To be sure.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="801e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This done, we may proceed at once without scruple to formulate this law:—all citizens who have attained the goal of life and have wrought with body or soul noble works and toilsome, and have been obedient to the laws, shall be regarded as fitting objects for praise.</said></p>

All such honors shall be equally shared by women as well as men who have been conspicuous for their excellence.  As to the songs and the dances, this is the fashion in which they should be arranged.  Among the compositions of the ancients there exist many fine old pieces of music, and likewise dances, from which we may select without scruple for the constitution we are founding such as are fitting and proper.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="802b"/> To examine these and make the selection, we shall choose out men not under fifty years of age;  and whichever of the ancient songs are approved we shall adopt, but whichever fail to reach our standard, or are altogether unsuitable, we shall either reject entirely or revise and remodel.  For this purpose we shall call in the advice of poets and musicians, and make use of their poetical ability, without, however, trusting to their tastes or their wishes,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="802c"/> except in rare instances;  and by thus expounding the intentions of the lawgiver, we shall organize to his satisfaction dancing, singing, and the whole of choristry.  In truth, every unregulated musical pursuit becomes, when brought under regulation, a thousand times better, even when no honeyed strains are served up:  all alike provide pleasure.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. a <q type="mentioned">regulated</q> style of music pleases the educated just as much as the other sort pleases the uneducated.  Cp.  <bibl n="Plat. Laws 658e">Plat. Laws 658e</bibl>.</note>  For if a man has been reared from childhood up to the age of steadiness and sense in the use of music that is sober and regulated, then he detests the opposite kind whenever he hears it, and
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="802d"/> calls it <q type="emph">vulgar</q>;  whereas if he has been reared in the common honeyed kind of music, he declares the opposite of this to be cold and unpleasing.  Hence, as we said just now, in respect of the pleasure or displeasure they cause neither kind excels the other;  where the superiority lies is in the fact that the one kind always makes those who are reared in it better, the other worse.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Finely spoken!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Further, it will be right for the lawgiver to set apart suitable songs for males and females by making a rough division of them;  and he must necessarily adapt them to harmonies and rhythms,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="802e"/> for it would be a horrible thing for discord to exist between theme and tune, meter and rhythm, as a result of providing the songs with unsuitable accompaniments.  So the lawgiver must of necessity ordain at least the outline of these.  And while it is necessary for him to assign both words and music for both types of song as defined by the natural difference of the two sexes, he must also clearly declare wherein the feminine type consists.  Now we may affirm that what is noble and of a manly tendency is masculine, while that which inclines rather to decorum and sedateness is to be regarded rather as feminine both in law and in discourse.</said></p></div>

We have next to discuss the question of the teaching and imparting of these subjects—how, by whom, and when each of them should be practiced.  Just as a shipwright at the commencement of his building outlines the shape of his vessel by laying down her keel, so I appear to myself to be doing just the same—trying to frame, that is, the shapes of lives according to the modes of their souls, and thus literally
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="803b"/> laying down their keels, by rightly considering by what means and by what modes of living we shall best navigate our barque of life through this voyage of existence.  And notwithstanding that human affairs are unworthy of earnest effort, necessity counsels us to be in earnest;  and that is our misfortune.  Yet, since we are where we are, it is no doubt becoming that we should show this earnestness in a suitable direction.  But no doubt

It is the life of peace that everyone should live as much and as well as he can.  What then is the right way?  We should live out our lives playing

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="804c"/> that the human race is not a mean thing, but worthy of serious attention. To pursue our subject,—we have described<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 764c">Plat. Laws 764c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 779d">Plat.

In all these establishments there should reside teachers
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="804d"/> attracted by pay from abroad for each several subject, to instruct the pupils in all matters relating to war and to music;  and no father shall either send his son as a pupil or keep him away from the training-school at his own sweet will, but every <q type="emph">man jack</q> of them all (as the saying goes) must, so far as possible, be compelled to be educated, inasmuch as they are children of the State even more than children of their parents.  For females, too, my law will lay down the same regulations as for men, and training of an identical kind.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="805"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="805a"/> as well as horses, and who practice it equally.  In addition to this I allege the following argument.  Since this state of things can exist, I affirm that the practice which at present prevails in our districts is a most irrational one—namely, that men and women should not all follow the same pursuits with one accord and with all their might.  For thus from the same taxation and trouble there arises and exists half a State only instead of a whole one, in nearly every instance;  yet surely this would be a surprising blunder
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="805b"/> for a lawgiver to commit.</said></p>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="805d"/> must share with the male, to the greatest extent possible, both in education and in all else.  For in truth we ought to conceive of the matter in this light.  Suppose that women do not share with men in the whole of their mode of life, must they not have a different system of their own?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They must.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then which of the systems now in vogue shall we prescribe in preference to that fellowship which we are now imposing upon them?  Shall it be that of the Thracians, and many other tribes,

Or that which obtains with us and all the people of our district?  The way women are treated with us at present is this—we huddle all our goods together, as the saying goes, within four walls, and then hand over the dispensing of them to the women, together with the control of the shuttles and all kinds of wool-work.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="806">
     <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Or again, shall we prescribe for them, Megillus, that midway system, the Laconian? <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="806"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="806a"/> Must the girls share in gymnastics and music, and the women abstain from wool-work, but weave themselves instead a life that is not trivial at all nor useless, but arduous, advancing as it were halfway in the path of domestic tendance and management and child-nurture, but taking no share in military service;  so that, even if it should chance to be necessary for them to fight in defence of their city and their children, they will be unable to handle with skill either a bow
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="806b"/>(like the Amazons) or any other missile, nor could they take spear and shield, after the fashion of the Goddess,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For Athene as a warrior, cp. <bibl n="Plat.

If they lived in this manner, they certainly would not dare to adopt the fashion of the Sauromatides, whose women would seem like men beside them.  So in regard to this matter, let who will commend your Laconian lawgivers:
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="806c"/> as to my view, it must stand as it is.  The lawgiver ought to be whole-hearted, not half-hearted,—letting the female sex indulge in luxury and expense and disorderly ways of life,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Aristot.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What manner of life would men live, supposing that they possessed a moderate supply of all the necessaries, and that they had entrusted all the crafts to other hands,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="806e"/> and that their farms were hired out to slaves, and yielded them produce enough for their modest needs?  Let us further suppose that they had public mess-rooms—separate rooms for men, and others close by for their households, including the girls and their mothers—</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="807">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> and that each of these rooms was in charge of a master or mistress, to dismiss the company and to watch over their behavior daily;  and, at the close of the meal, that the master and all the company poured a libation
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="807"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="807a"/> in honor of those gods to whom that night and day were dedicated, and so finally retired home.  Supposing them to be thus organized, is there no necessary work, of a really appropriate kind, left for them, but must every one of them continue fattening himself like a beast?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 7.1334a.13">Aristot. Pol. 1334a.13 ff</bibl>.</note>  That, we assert, is neither right nor good;  nor is it possible for one who lives thus to miss his due reward;  and the due reward of an idle beast, fattened in sloth, is, as a rule,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="807b"/> to fall a prey to another beast—one of those which are worn to skin and bone through toil hardily endured.  Now it is probable that if we look to find this state of leisure fully realized exactly as described, we shall be disappointed, so long as women and children and houses remain private, and all these things are established as the private property of individuals;  but if the second-best State,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the (Magnesian) State described in the <title>Laws</title>, in contrast to the Ideal (communistic) State of the <title>Republic</title>.</note> as now described,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="807c"/> could exist, we might be well content with it.  And, we assert, there does remain for men living this life a task that is by no means small or trivial, but rather one that a just law imposes upon them as the weightiest task of all.  For as compared with the life that aims at a Pythian or Olympian victory and is wholly lacking in leisure for other tasks, that life we speak of—which most truly deserves the name of <q type="emph">life</q>—is doubly (nay, far more than doubly) lacking in leisure, seeing that it is occupied with the care
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="807d"/> of bodily and spiritual excellence in general.  For there ought to be no other secondary task to hinder the work of supplying the body with its proper exercise and nourishment, or the soul with learning and moral training:  nay, every night and day is not sufficient for the man who is occupied therein to win from them their fruit in full and ample measure. So this being nature’s law, a program must be framed for all the freeborn men, prescribing how they shall pass their time continuously,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="807e"/> from dawn to dawn and sunrise on each successive day.  It would be undignified for a lawgiver to mention a host of petty matters connected with the domestic arrangements—such as, in particular, the rules about that wakefulness at night which is proper for men who propose to guard a whole State adequately and continuously. </said></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="808">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> That any citizen, indeed, should spend the whole of any night in sleep, instead of setting an example to his household by being himself
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="808"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="808a"/> always the first to awaken and rise—such a practice must be counted by all a shameful one, unworthy of a free man, whether it be called a custom or a law.  Moreover, that the mistress of a house should be awakened by maids, instead of being herself the first to wake up all the others—this is a shameful practice;  and that it is so all the servants must declare to one another—bondman and bondmaid and boy, yea, even (were it possible) every stone in the house.  And, when awake by night, they must certainly transact a large share of business,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="808b"/> both political and economical, the magistrates in the city, and the masters and mistresses in their own houses.  For much sleep is not naturally suitable either to our bodies or souls, nor yet to employment on any such matters.  For when asleep no man is worth anything, any more than if he were dead:  on the contrary, every one of us who cares most greatly for life and thought keeps awake as long as possible, only reserving so much time for sleep as his health requires—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="808c"/> and that is but little, once the habit is well formed.  And rulers that are watchful by night in cities are a terror to evil-doers, be they citizens or enemies, but objects of respect and admiration to the just and temperate;  and they confer benefit alike on themselves and on the whole State. The night, if spent in this way, will—in addition to all the other benefits described—lend greater fortitude to the souls of all who reside in these States.  With the return of daylight the children should go to their teachers;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="808d"/> for just as no sheep or other witless creature ought to exist without a herdsman, so children cannot live without a tutor, nor slaves without a master.  And, of all wild creatures, the child is the most intractable;  for in so far as it, above all others, possesses a fount of reason that is as yet uncurbed, it is a treacherous, sly and most insolent creature.  Wherefore the child must be strapped up, as it were, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="808e"/> with many bridles—first, when he leaves the care of nurse and mother, with tutors, to guide his childish ignorance, and after that with teachers of all sorts of subjects and lessons, treating him as becomes a freeborn child.  On the other hand, he must be treated as a slave;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The child is of two-fold nature,—semi-rational;  as such he needs a double <q type="emph">bridle,</q> that of instruction (proper to free men), and that of chastisement (proper to slaves).</note> and any free man that meets him shall punish both the child himself and his tutor or teacher, if any of them does wrong. </said></p> </div>

Moreover, this Law-warden shall exercise special supervision, with a keen eye, over the rearing of the children, to keep their growing natures in the straight way, by turning them always towards goodness, as the laws direct. But how is the law itself to give an adequate education to this Law-warden of ours?  For, up to the present, the law has not as yet made any clear or
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="809b"/> adequate statement:  it has mentioned some things, but omitted others.  But in dealing with this warden it must omit nothing, but fully expound every ordinance that he may be both expositor and nurturer to the rest.  Matters of choristry of tunes and dancing, and what types are to be selected, remodelled, and consecrated—all this has already been dealt with;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="809c"/> You know from our discourse<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 796a">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="809d"/> is obliged to take them into account.  What I allude to is this—the arranging of days into monthly periods, and of months into a year, in each instance, so that the seasons, with their respective sacrifices and feasts, may each be assigned its due position by being held as nature dictates, and that thus they may create fresh liveliness and alertness in the State, and may pay their due honors to the gods, and may render the citizens more intelligent about these matters.  These points, my friend, have not all as yet been explained to you sufficiently by the lawgiver.
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="809e"/> Now attend carefully to what is next to be said.  In the first place, you are, as we said, insufficiently instructed as yet concerning letters.  The point we complain of is this—that the law has not yet told you clearly whether the man who is to be a good citizen must pursue this study with precision, or neglect it altogether;  and so likewise with regard to the lyre.  That he must not neglect them we now affirm. </said></p> </div>

How will you deal with these, O my most excellent Law-wardens?  Or what method of dealing with them will the lawgiver rightly ordain?  He will be vastly perplexed, I verily believe.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What does this mean, Stranger?  Evidently you are addressing yourself, and are really perplexed.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are right in your supposition, Clinias.  As you are my partners in this investigation of laws, I am bound to explain to you both what seems easy and what hard.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="810d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, what is it about them that you are now alluding to, and what has come over you?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I will tell you:  it is no easy matter to gainsay tens of thousands of tongues.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Come now,—do you believe that the points in which our previous conclusions about laws contradicted ordinary opinion were few and trifling?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Your observation is most just.  I take it that you are bidding me, now that the path which is abhorrent to many is attractive to others possibly not less numerous
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="810e"/>(or if less numerous, certainly not less competent),—you are, I say, bidding me adventure myself with the latter company and proceed boldly along the path of legislation marked out in our present discourse, without flinching.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="811">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then I will not flinch.  I verily affirm that we have composers of verses innumerable—hexameters, trimeters, and every meter you could mention,—some of whom aim at the serious, others at the comic;  on whose writings, as we are told by our tens of thousands of people, we ought to rear and soak the young, if we are to give them a correct education, making them, by means of recitations, lengthy listeners <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="811"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="811a"/> and large learners, who learn off whole poets by heart.  Others there are who compile select summaries of all the poets, and piece together whole passages, telling us that a boy must commit these to memory and learn them off if we are to have him turn out good and wise as a result of a wide and varied range of instruction.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. Heraclitus’s saying (<title>Frag</title>. 16):<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυμαθίη νόον οὐ διδάσκει</foreign>;  and the contempt shown for the versatile smatterer in  <title>Phaedrus</title> 275 A (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυήκοοι . . . δοξόσοφοι γεγονότες ἀντὶ σοφῶν</foreign>).</note>  Would you have me now state frankly to these poets what is wrong about their declarations and what right?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What single statement can I make about all these people
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="811b"/> that will be adequate?  This, perhaps,—in which everyone will agree with me,—that every poet has uttered much that is well, and much also that is ill;  and this being so, I affirm that a wide range of learning involves danger to children.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What advice then would you give the Law-warden?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> About what?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> About the pattern by which he should be guided in respect of the particular subjects which he permits or forbids all the children to learn.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="811c"/> Tell us, and without scruple.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> My good Clinias, I have had, it would seem, a stroke of luck.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In the fact that I am not wholly at a loss for a pattern.  For in looking back now at the discussions which we have been pursuing from dawn up to this present hour—and that, as I fancy, not without some guidance from Heaven—it appeared to me that they were framed exactly like a poem.  And it was not surprising, perhaps,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="811d"/> that there came over me a feeling of intense delight when I gazed thus on our discourses all marshalled, as it were, in close array;  for of all the many discourses which I have listened to or learnt about, whether in poems or in a loose flood of speech like ours, they struck me as being not only the most adequate, but also the most suitable for the ears of the young.  Nowhere, I think, could I find a better pattern than this to put before the Law-warden who is educator, that he may charge the teachers to teach the children these discourses of ours, and such as resemble
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="811e"/> and accord with these;  and if it should be that in his search he should light on poems of composers, or prose-writings, or merely verbal and unwritten discourses, akin to these of ours, he must in no wise let them go, but get them written down.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="812">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> In the first place, he must compel the teachers themselves to learn these discourses, and to praise them, and if any of the teachers fail to approve of them, he must not employ them as colleagues;  only those who agree with his praise of the discourses should he employ, and entrust to them the teaching and training of the youth.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="812"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="812a"/> Here and herewith let me end my homily concerning writing-masters and writings.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Judged by our original intention, Stranger, I certainly do not think that we have diverged from the line of argument we intended;  but about the matter as a whole it is hard, no doubt, to be sure whether or not we are right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That, Clinias, (as we have often said) will probably become clearer of itself<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 799d">Plat. Laws 799d</bibl>.</note> when we arrive at the end of our whole exposition concerning laws.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="812b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> After the writing-master, must we not address the lyre-master next?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> When assigning to the lyre-masters their proper duties in regard to the teaching and general training in these subjects, we must, as I think, bear in mind our previous declarations.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 664e">Plat. Laws 664e</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Laws 679a">Plat. Laws 679a</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Declarations about what?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We said, I fancy, that the sixty-year-old singers of hymns to Dionysus ought to be exceptionally keen of perception
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="812c"/> regarding rhythms and harmonic compositions, in order that when dealing with musical representations of a good kind or a bad, by which the soul is emotionally affected, they may be able to pick out the reproductions of the good kind and of the bad, and having rejected the latter, may produce the other in public, and charm the souls of the children by singing them, and so challenge them all to accompany them in acquiring virtue by means of these representations.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="812d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So, to attain this object, both the lyre-master and his pupil must use the notes of the lyre, because of the distinctness of its strings, assigning to the notes of the song notes in tune with them;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the notes of the instrument must be in accord with those of the singer’s voice.  <quote>The <emph>tune</emph>, as composed by the poet, is supposed to have comparatively few notes, to be in slowish time, and low down in the register;  whereas the complicated <emph>variation</emph>, which he is condemning, has many notes, is in quick time, and high up in the register.</quote> (<bibl>England.</bibl>)</note>  but as to divergence of sound and variety in the notes of the harp, when the strings sound the one tune and the composer of the melody another, or when there results a combination of low and high notes, of slow and quick time, of sharp and grave, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="812e"/> and all sorts of rhythmical variations are adapted to the notes of the lyre,—no such complications should be employed in dealing with pupils who have to absorb quickly, within three years, the useful elements of music.  For the jarring of opposites with one another impedes easy learning;  and the young should above all things learn easily, since the necessary lessons imposed upon them are neither few nor small,—which lessons our discourse will indicate in time as it proceeds. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="813">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> So let our educator regulate these matters in the manner stated.  As regards the character of the actual tunes and words which the choir-masters ought to teach,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="813"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="813a"/> all this we have already<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 799a">Plat.

We stated that in each case they should be adapted to a suitable festival and dedicated, and thus prove a benefit to the States, by furnishing them with felicitous enjoyment.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> This, too, you have explained truly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, most truly.  These matters also let the man who is appointed our Director of Music take over and supervise, with the help of kindly fortune;  and let us supplement our former statements concerning dancing and bodily gymnastics in general.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="813b"/> Just as, in the case of music, we have supplied the regulations about tuition that were missing, so also let us now do in the case of gymnastics.  Shall we not say that both girls and boys must learn both dancing and gymnastics?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then for their practices it would be most proper that boys should have dancing-masters, and girls mistresses.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I grant it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us once more summon the man who will have most of these duties to perform,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="813c"/> the Director of the Children,—who, in supervising both music and gymnastic, will have but little time to spare.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How will he be able, at his age, to supervise so many affairs?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Quite easily.  For the law has granted him, and will continue to grant him, such men or women as he wishes to take to assist him in this task of supervision:  he will know himself the right persons to choose, and he will be anxious
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="813d"/> to make no blunder in these matters, recognizing the greatness of his office and wisely holding it in high respect, and holding also the rational conviction that, when the young have been, and are being, well brought up, all goes <q type="emph">swimmingly,</q> but otherwise—the consequences are such as it is wrong to speak of, nor will we mention them, in dealing with a new State, out of consideration for the over-superstitious.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. they would regard the mere mention of possible evil (esp. in connection with anything new-born) as of ill-omen.</note>  Concerning these matters also, which relate to dancing and gymnastic movements, we have already spoken at length.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="814">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  In all these subjects there should be public instructors, paid by the State;  and their pupils should be not only the boys and men in the State, but also the girls and women who understand all these matters—being practiced in all military drill and fighting while still girls and, when grown to womanhood, taking part in evolutions and rank-forming and the piling
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="814"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="814a"/> and shouldering of arms,— and that, if for no other reason, at least for this reason, that, if ever the guards of the children and of the rest of the city should be obliged to leave the city and march out in full force, these women should be able at least to take their place;  while if, on the other hand—and this is quite a possible contingency—an invading army of foreigners, fierce and strong, should force a battle round the city itself,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="814b"/> then it would be a sore disgrace to the State if its women were so ill brought up as not even to be willing to do as do the mother-birds, which fight the strongest beasts in defence of their broods, but, instead of facing all risks, even death itself, to run straight to the temples and crowd all the shrines and holy places, and drown mankind in the disgrace of being the most craven of living creatures.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By Heaven, Stranger, if ever this took place in a city, it would be a most unseemly thing,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="814c"/> apart from the mischief of it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we, then, lay down this law,—that up to the point stated women must not neglect military training, but all citizens, men and women alike, must pay attention to it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I, for one, agree.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As regards wrestling, some points have been explained;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 795d">Plat. Laws 795d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 795e">Plat. Laws 795e</bibl>.</note>  but we have not explained what is, in my opinion, the most important point, nor is it easy to express it in words without the help of a practical illustration.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="814d"/> This point, then, we shall decide about<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 832e">Plat. Laws 832e</bibl>.</note> when word accompanied by deed can clearly demonstrate this fact, among the others mentioned,—that wrestling of this kind is of all motions by far the most nearly allied to military fighting;  and also that it is not the latter that should be learned for the sake of the former, but, on the contrary, it is the former that should be practiced for the sake of the latter.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> There, at any rate, you are right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> For the present let this suffice as an account of the functions of the wrestling-school.  Motion
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="814e"/> of the whole body, other than wrestling, has for its main division what may be rightly termed dancing<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Here a wide term, embracing all kinds of bodily gestures and posturing.</note>;  and we ought to consider it as consisting of two kinds,—the one representing the solemn movement of beautiful bodies, the other the ignoble movement of ugly bodies;  and of these again there are two subdivisions. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="815">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  Of the noble kind there is, on the one hand, the motion of fighting, and that of fair bodies and brave souls engaged in violent effort;  and, on the other hand, there is the motion of a temperate soul living in a state of prosperity and moderate pleasures;  and this latter kind of dancing one will call, in accordance with its nature, <q type="emph">pacific.</q>  The warlike division,   
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="815"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="815a"/> being distinct from the pacific, one may rightly term <q type="foreign">pyrrhiche</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The technical name for a <gloss>war-dance</gloss> (<q type="emph">polka</q>) in quick time (possibly connected by P. with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῦρ, πυρετός</foreign>)</note>;  it represents modes of eluding all kinds of blows and shots by swervings and duckings and side-leaps upward or crouching;  and also the opposite kinds of motion, which lead to active postures of offence, when it strives to represent the movements involved in shooting with bows or darts, and blows of every description.  In all these cases the action and the tension of the sinews are correct when there is a representation of fair bodies and souls
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="815b"/> in which most of the limbs of the body are extended straight:  this kind of representation is right, but the opposite kind we pronounce to be wrong.  In pacific dancing, the point we must consider in every case is whether the performer in his dances keeps always rightly, or improperly, to the noble kind of dancing, in the way that befits law-abiding men. So, in the first place, we must draw a line between questionable dancing and dancing that is above question.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="815c"/> All the dancing that is of a Bacchic kind and cultivated by those who indulge in drunken imitations of Pans, Sileni and Satyrs (as they call them), when performing certain rites of expiation and initiation,—all this class of dancing cannot easily be defined either as pacific or as warlike, or as of any one distinct kind.  The most correct way of defining it seems to me to be this—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="815d"/> to separate it off both from pacific and from warlike dancing, and to pronounce that this kind of dancing is unfitted for our citizens:  and having thus disposed of it and dismissed it, we will now return to the warlike and pacific kinds which do beyond question belong to us. That of the unwarlike Muse, in which men pay honor to the gods and the children of the gods by dances, will consist, broadly speaking, of all dancing performed under a sense of prosperity:  of this we may make two subdivisions—
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="815e"/> the one being of a more joyful description, and proper to men who have escaped out of toils and perils into a state of bliss,—and the other connected rather with the preservation and increase of pre-existent blessings, and exhibiting, accordingly, joyousness of a less ardent kind.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="816">  
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Under these conditions every man moves his body more violently when his joys are greater, less violently when they are smaller;  also, he moves it less violently when he is more sedate and better trained in courage,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="816"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="816a"/> but when he is cowardly and untrained in temperance, he indulges in greater and more violent changes of motion;  and in general, no one who is using his voice, whether in song or in speech, is able to keep his body wholly at rest.  Hence, when the representation of things spoken by means of gestures arose, it produced the whole art of dancing.  In all these instances, one man of us moves in tune with his theme, another out of tune.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="816b"/> Many of the names bestowed in ancient times are deserving of notice and of praise for their excellence and descriptiveness:  one such is the name given to the dances of men who are in a prosperous state and indulge in pleasures of a moderate kind:  how true and how musical was the name so rationally bestowed on those dances by the man (whoever he was) who first called them all <q type="foreign">Emmeleiai,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A decorous, stately dance (<q type="emph">minuet</q>).</note> and established two species of fair dances—the warlike, termed <q type="foreign">pyrrhiche,</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="816c"/> and the pacific, termed <q type="foreign">emmeleia</q>—bestowing on each its appropriate and harmonious name.  These dances the lawgiver should describe in outline, and the Law-warden should search them out and, having investigated them, he should combine the dancing with the rest of the music, and assign what is proper of it to each of the sacrificial feasts, distributing it over all the feasts;  and when he has thus consecrated all these things in due order, he should thenceforth make no change in all that appertains to either dancing or singing, but this
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="816d"/> one and the same city and body of citizens should continue in one and the same way, enjoying the same pleasures and living alike in all ways possible, and so pass their lives happily and well. What concerns the actions of fair and noble souls in the matter of that kind of choristry which we have approved as right has now been fully discussed.  The actions of ugly bodies and ugly ideas and of the men engaged in ludicrous comic-acting, in regard to both speech and dance, and the representations given by all these comedians—all this subject we must necessarily consider and estimate.  For it is impossible to learn the serious without the comic,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="816e"/> or any one of a pair of contraries without the other, if one is to he a wise man;  but to put both into practice is equally impossible, if one is to share in even a small measure of virtue;  in fact, it is precisely for this reason that one should learn them,—in order to avoid ever doing or saying anything ludicrous, through ignorance, when one ought not;  we will impose such mimicry on slaves and foreign hirelings, and no serious attention shall ever be paid to it, nor shall any free man or free woman be seen learning it, and there must always be some novel feature in their mimic shows.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. lest the public taste should be debased by the repeated exhibition of any one piece of vulgarity.</note></said></p></div>

In truth, both we ourselves and the whole State
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="817d"/> would be absolutely mad, were it to allow you to do as I have said, before the magistrates had decided whether or not your compositions are deserving of utterance and suited for publication.

The first thing we must grasp correctly is this—which of these branches of study must be learnt, and how many, and at what periods, and which of them in conjunction with which, and which by themselves apart from all others, and the method of combining them;  this done, and with these studies as introductory, we may proceed to the learning of the rest.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="819b"/> First, as regards counting, lessons have been invented for the merest infants to learn, by way of play and fun,—modes of dividing up apples and chaplets, so that the same totals are adjusted to larger and smaller groups, and modes of sorting out boxers and wrestlers, in byes and pairs, taking them alternately or consecutively, in their natural order.  Moreover, by way of play, the teachers mix together bowls made of gold, bronze,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="819c"/> silver and the like, and others distribute them, as I said, by groups of a single kind, adapting the rules of elementary arithmetic to play;  and thus they are of service to the pupils for their future tasks of drilling, leading and marching armies, or of household management, and they render them both more helpful in every way to themselves and more alert.
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="819d"/> The next step of the teachers is to clear away, by lessons in weights and measures, a certain kind of ignorance, both absurd and disgraceful, which is naturally inherent in all men touching lines, surfaces and solids.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No doubt.  And, after all, draughts and these studies do not seem to be so very far apart.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> My statement sounds paradoxical, and it might be thought to be unbecoming in an old man;  but the fact is that, when a man believes that a science is fair and true and beneficial to the State and altogether well-pleasing to God,

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is precisely for this reason, Megillus and Clinias, that I now assert that our citizens and our children ought to learn so much concerning all these facts about the gods of Heaven

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are right, provided that, in the first place, it is possible to learn the subject you mention;  and provided also that learning will make us correct any mistakes we may be making about them now,—then I, too, agree that a subject of such importance should be learned.

    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, the matter I speak of is not an easy one to learn;  nor yet is it altogether difficult and demanding very prolonged study.  In proof of this—although I was told of it neither in the days of my youth nor long ago, I may be able to explain it to you in a comparatively short time.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="822">

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I must try.  The opinion, my friends, that the Sun and Moon and the rest of the stars <q type="emph">wander</q> is not correct;  the truth is precisely the opposite:  each of them always travels in a circle one and the same path,—not many paths, although it appears to move along many paths;  and the quickest of the stars is wrongly opined to be the slowest, and vice versa.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We may now say that our regulations concerning subjects of education have been completed.  The subject of hunting, and similar pursuits, must now be dealt with in a similar manner.  The duty laid upon the lawgiver probably goes further than the bare task of enacting laws:  in addition to laws, there is something else which falls naturally between advice and law—
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="822e"/> a thing which has often cropped up in the course of our discussion,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 788a">Plat. Laws 788a ff</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Laws 793a">Plat. Laws 793a ff</bibl>.</note> as, for example, in connection with the nurture of young children:  such matters, we say, should not be left unregulated, but it would be most foolish to regard those regulations as enacted laws.  When, then, the laws and the whole constitution have been thus written down, our praise of the citizen who is preeminent for virtue will not be complete when we say that the virtuous man is he who is the best servant of the laws and the most obedient; </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="823">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> a more complete statement will be this,—that the virtuous man is he who passes through life consistently obeying the written rules of the lawgiver, as given in his legislation, approbation and disapprobation.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. for perfect virtue there is required not only obedience to statute law, but also conformity with all the other rules of conduct laid down by the lawgiver in the less rigid form of advice (<q type="emph">approbation</q> and <q type="emph">disapprobation</q>).</note>
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="823"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="823a"/> This statement is the most correct way of praising the citizen;  and in this way, moreover, the lawgiver must not only write down the laws, but in addition to the laws, and combined with them, he must write down his decisions as to what things are good and what bad;  and the perfect citizen must abide by these decisions no less than by the rules enforced by legal penalties. The subject now before us we may adduce as a witness
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="823b"/> to show more clearly what we mean.  Hunting is a large and complex matter, all of which is now generally embraced under this single name.  Of the hunting of water-animals there are many varieties, and many of the hunting of fowls;  and very many varieties also of hunts of land-animals—not of beasts only, but also, mark you, of men, both in war and often, too, in friendship, a kind of hunt that is partly approved and partly disapproved;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Soph. 222d">Plat. Soph. 222d ff</bibl> where <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τῶν ἐρώντων θήρα</foreign> (<gloss>the lovers’ chase</gloss>) is mentioned as a sub-species of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρευτική</foreign>:  and in  <title>Symposium</title> 203 D the God of Love is described as <gloss>a mighty hunter</gloss> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρευτὴς δεινός</foreign>).</note>  and then there are robberies and hunts carried on by pirates and by bands.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="823c"/> When the lawgiver is making laws about hunting, he is necessarily bound to make this point clear, and to lay down minatory directions by imposing regulations and penalties for all these kinds.  What then ought to be done about these matters?  The lawgiver, for his part, will be right in praising or blaming hunting with an eye to the toils and pursuits of the young;  and the young man will be right in listening and obeying, and in allowing neither pleasure nor toil to hinder him, and in holding in greater respect the orders that are sanctioned by praise,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="823d"/> and carrying them out, rather than those which are enacted by law under threat of penalties. After these prefatory observations there will follow adequate praise and blame of hunting—praise of the kind which renders the souls of the young better, and blame of the kind which does the opposite.  Our next step will be to address the young people with prayer—<q type="spoken">O friends, would that you might never be seized with any desire or craving for hunting by sea, or for angling,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="823e"/> or for ever pursuing water-animals with creels that do your lazy hunting for you, whether you sleep or wake. </q></said></p></div> 
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="824">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> <q rend="merge">And may no longing for man-hunting by sea and piracy overtake you, and render you cruel and lawless hunters;  and may the thought of committing robbery in country or city not so much as cross your minds.  Neither may there seize upon any of the young the crafty craving for snaring birds—<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="824"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="824a"/> no very gentlemanly pursuit!  Thus there is left for our athletes only the hunting and capture of land-animals.  Of this branch of hunting, the kind called night-stalking, which is the job of lazy men who sleep in turn, is one that deserves no praise;  nor does that kind deserve praise in which there are intervals of rest from toil, when men master the wild force of beasts by nets and traps instead of doing so by the victorious might of a toil-loving soul.  Accordingly, the only kind left for all, and the best kind, is the hunting of quadrupeds with horses and dogs and the hunter’s own limbs, when men hunt in person, and subdue all the creatures by means of their own running, striking and shooting—all the men, that is to say, who cultivate the courage that is divine.</q> Concerning the whole of this subject, the exposition we have now given will serve as the praise and blame;  and the law will run thus,—<q type="spoken">None shall hinder these truly sacred hunters from hunting wheresoever and howsoever they wish;  but the night-trapper who trusts to nets and snares no one shall ever allow to hunt anywhere.  The fowler no man shall hinder on fallow land or mountain;  but he that finds him on tilled fields or on sacred glebes shall drive him off. The fisherman shall be allowed to hunt in all waters except havens and sacred rivers and pools and lakes, but only on condition that he makes no use of muddying juices.</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. vegetable juices which taint the water and paralyze the fish.</note>  So now, at last, we may say that all our laws about education are complete.</said></p>

Suppose we had been rearing boxers or pancratiasts or competitors in any similar branch of athletics, should we have gone straight into the contest without previously engaging in daily combat with someone?  If we were boxers, for a great many days before the contest we should have been learning how to fight,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="830b"/> and working hard, practicing in mimicry all those methods we meant to employ on the day we should be fighting for victory, and imitating the real thing as nearly as possible:  thus, we should don padded gloves instead of proper ring-gloves, so as to get the best possible practice in giving blows and dodging them;  and if we chanced to be very short of training-mates, do you suppose that we should be deterred by fear of the laughter of fools from hanging up a lifeless dummy and practicing on it?  Indeed, if ever we were in a desert, and without either live or lifeless
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="830c"/> training-mates, would we not have recourse to shadow-fighting of the most literal kind, against ourselves?  Or what else should one call the practice of pugilistic posturing?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What then?  Is the fighting force of our State to venture to come forward every time to fight for their lives, their children, their goods, and for the whole State, after a less thorough preparation than the competitors we have been describing?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="830d"/> And so is their lawgiver, through fear lest these training-bouts may appear ridiculous to some, to refrain from laying down laws whereby he will ordain field-operations, of which the minor kind, without heavy arms, will take place daily, if possible,—and to this end both the choristry and all the gymnastic shall be directed,—while the others, as a major kind of gymnastics in full armor, he shall order to be held at least once a month?

Moreover, if a man gets killed in these sham fights, inasmuch as the murder is involuntary, he shall pronounce the slayer to be pure of hands, when he has been legally purified;  for he will reflect that, when a few men die, others equally good will grow up in their place, whereas, once fear is, so to speak, dead, he will be unable to find a test to distinguish, in all such cases, the good from the bad,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="831b"/> and that is a far greater evil than the other for a State.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We, at least, Stranger, would certainly agree that every State should both ordain and practice these things.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are we all aware of the reason why such choristry and such contests do not at present exist anywhere in the States, except to a very small extent?  Shall we say that this is due to the ignorance of the populace and of those who legislate for them?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Possibly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Not so, by any means, my ingenious Clinias!  What we ought to say
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="831c"/> is that there are two causes, and both most weighty ones.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What are they?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The first springs from a lust for wealth which allows a man no leisure time for attention to anything else save his own private property;  and when the soul of every citizen hangs upon this, it is incapable of attending to matters other than daily gain.  Whatsoever science or pursuit leads to this, every man individually is most ready to learn and to practice;  but all else he laughs to scorn.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="831d"/> This we must assert to be one particular cause why a State is unwilling to be in earnest about this, or any other, fine and noble pursuit;  and why, on the other hand, every individual, because of his greed for silver and gold, is willing to toil at every art and device, noble or ignoble, if he is likely to get rich by it,—willing, too, to perform actions both holy and unholy—nay, utterly shameful—without a scruple,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="831e"/> provided only that he is able to sate himself to repletion, like a beast, with all manner of foods and drinks and wenchings.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.</said></p></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="832">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then let this which I describe be laid down as one cause which hinders the States from adequately practicing either military operations or any other noble pursuits and which turns men who are of a quiet nature <note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 691b">Plat. Laws 691b</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 410c">Plat.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="832"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="832a"/> and despots,—and that though, in some cases, they are not ill-natured, but merely ill-fortuned.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, how could I describe otherwise than as utterly unfortunate men who are compelled to go through life with hunger<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. for gold.  Cp. Virgil’s <q type="foreign">auri sacra fames.</q></note> always in their own souls?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> This, then, is one cause:  what is the second cause you speak of, Stranger?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You are right in reminding me.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> One cause, as you assert, is this lifelong insatiable pursuit, which wholly engrosses each man, and hinders each and all from rightly practicing military operations.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="832b"/> Be it so:  now tell us the second cause.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do you think that I am delaying to do so because I am at a loss?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> No;  but we think that, owing to a sort of hatred against the character you describe, you are castigating it more severely than is required by the argument now on hand.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Your rebuke is just, Strangers;  you want, it seems, to hear what comes next.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Only say on.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> There lies a cause, as I affirm, in those non-polities which I have often mentioned<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 712c">Plat. Laws 712c ff</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Laws 713e">Plat. Laws 713e ff</bibl>.</note> in our previous discourse,—namely, democracy,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="832c"/> oligarchy, and tyranny.  For none of these is a polity, but the truest name for them all would be <q type="emph">faction-State</q>;  for none of them is a form of voluntary rule over willing subjects, but a voluntary rule over unwilling subjects accompanied always by some kind of force;  and the ruler, through fear of the subject, will never voluntarily allow him to become noble or wealthy or strong or brave or in any way warlike.  These, then, are the two main causes of nearly everything, and certainly of the conditions we described.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="832d"/> The polity, however, for which we are now legislating has escaped both these causes;  for not only does it enjoy a great amount of leisure,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 806d">Plat. Laws 806d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 828d">Plat. Laws 828d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 828e">Plat. Laws 828e</bibl>, etc.</note> but the citizens also are free from one another’s domination, and as a consequence of these laws of ours they will be the least likely of men to be money-lovers.  Hence it is both natural and logical that of all existing polities this type alone should welcome the system above described, which combines military schooling with sport, when we have rightly completed that description.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very good.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The next step, then, is to remind ourselves,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="832e"/> with regard to all gymnastic contests, that all such as afford training for war should be instituted, and should have prizes assigned to them, but all that do not do so must be set aside.  What these contests consist in, it will be well to have described and ordained at the beginning.  First, then, should we not ordain contests in running and speed in general?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We should.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="833">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Most important of all things for war is, no doubt, general activity of the body, of hands as well as feet—activity of foot for flight and pursuit,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="833"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="833a"/> and of hand for the stand-up fighting at close quarters which calls for sturdiness and strength.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No doubt.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yet, surely, neither of these is of the greatest service when it lacks weapons.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So at our contests the herald (as is now the practice) shall summon first the short-distance runner:  he shall enter fully armed;  and for an unarmed competitor we shall offer no prize.  First, then, there shall enter the man who, with his arms, is to run the furlong,—second, the runner of the quarter-mile,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="833b"/> third, the half-miler,—fourth, the runner of the three-quarters,—and fifth, that runner whom we shall despatch first, fully armed, to run a distance of four miles to a temple of Ares and back;  he shall be in heavier armor, and be called a hoplite, and he shall run over a smooth course, while his antagonist<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In this 5th race the hoplite, running the shorter course competes (on time) against the archer, running the longer course.</note> shall be dressed in the full equipment of an archer, and shall run a course of twelve miles over hills and varied country to a temple of Apollo and Artemis.  And having thus set up the contests,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="833c"/> we shall await the return of these runners, and to the winner of each race we shall award the prize.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us plan these contests in three divisions—one for children, one for youths, and one for men.  We shall ordain that the course for the youths’ races shall be two-thirds of the full course, and that for children one-half, when they compete either as archers or as hoplites.  In the case of females, we shall ordain races of a furlong, a quarter-mile, a half-mile, and a three-quarters
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="833d"/> for girls under the age of puberty, who shall be stripped, and shall race on the course itself;  and girls over thirteen shall continue to take part until married,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 785b">Plat. Laws 785b</bibl>.</note> up to the age of twenty at most, or at least eighteen;  but these, when they come forward and compete in these races, must be clad in decent apparel. Let such, then, be the rules concerning races for men and women.  As to trials of strength, instead of wrestling and the other <q type="emph">strong-man</q> events now in vogue, we shall ordain fencing in armor, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="833e"/> both in solo-contests and in team-competitions of anything from two to ten a side.  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="834">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  As regards the hits which a winner is to make or avoid, and how many points he must score,—just as now in the case of wrestling, those who deal with this art have fixed by law the points of good wrestling and bad, so likewise we must summon the experts in fencing under arms, and bid them help us to draw up laws by which to decide the proper winner in such fights,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="834"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="834a"/> what he must do and what he must avoid,—and similarly the rules for determining the loser.  For females also, up to the age of marriage, the same laws shall be laid down. And in the place of the pancratium we must establish a general tourney for peltasts, who shall compete with bows, targes, javelins, and stones flung either by hand or by sling;  and for these, too, we shall prescribe laws for assigning the rewards and prizes to the man who best conforms to the rules governing such contests. After these, the next thing to ordain
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="834b"/> will be horse-racing.  Here, in a country like <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, there is not much need of horses—not in great numbers,—so that inevitably less attention is paid either to the rearing or the racing of horses.  As to chariots, we have no one who keeps them, nor is anyone here likely to cherish any great ambition respecting them, so that to establish contests for them would run counter to native custom, and would not only seem, but be, a foolish act.  If, however, we establish prizes for races of riding-horses—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="834c"/> both for young colts, and for three-year-olds, and for those of full age—we shall be adapting the sport of horse-racing to the character of the country.  Of these horsemen there shall be established by law a competitive contest, and the phylarchs and hipparchs shall act as public judges both of all the races and of the armed competitors.  For unarmed competitors we should be wrong in establishing prizes, either here or in the gymnastic sports.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="834d"/> And for a Cretan there is credit in being a mounted archer or javelin-man, so we shall have contests and matches of a sportive kind between these also.  As to women,—it is not worth while to make compulsory laws and rules about their taking part in such sports;  but if, as a result of earlier training which has grown into a habit, their nature allows, and does not forbid, girls or maidens to take part, let them do so without blame. So now at length we have reached the end both of competition and instruction in gymnastic, so far as concerns our education
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="834e"/> by means of contests and of daily teaching.  Most of our account of music has likewise been completed;  the regulations about rhapsodes, however, and their retinue, and the choral contests which must accompany festivals are matters to be arranged after the gods and demi-gods have had their months, days and years assigned to them;  then it will be seen whether they should be biennial fixtures or quadrennial,
            <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="835"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="835a"/> or what mode and manner of arranging them the gods may suggest. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="835"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Then also, one expects, the musical contests will be held in sections, as arranged by the Masters of the Games and the Educator of the youth and the Law-wardens, meeting for this special purpose and acting in person as legislators to determine what persons, and when and with whom, are to frame the contests for all the choruses and choristry.  Of what character each of these ought to be in respect of words, songs and tunes, blended with rhythm and dance,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="835b"/> has frequently been stated<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In Books VI and VII.</note> by the original lawgiver;  the secondary lawgivers should follow him in their enactments, and they should arrange the contests at convenient times to suit the several sacrifices, and thus appoint festivals for the State to observe. Now as to these and the like matters, it is by no means hard to perceive how they should be given legal regulation, nor indeed would a shifting of their positions cause much
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="835c"/> gain or loss to the State.  But the things which do make no small difference, and of which it is hard to persuade men—these form a task especially for God (were it possible that orders should come from him):  as it is, they are likely to require a bold man who, valuing candor above all else, will declare what he deems best for city and citizens, and in the midst of corrupted souls will enjoin what is fitting and in keeping with all the constitution, and gainsay the mightiest lusts, acting alone by himself with no man to help him save, as his solitary leader, Reason.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="835d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it we are reasoning about now, Stranger?  For we are still in the dark.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Naturally:  but I will try to explain myself more clearly.  When in my discourse I came to the subject of education,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 771e">Plat. Laws 771e</bibl>.</note> I saw young men and maidens consorting with one another affectionately;  and, naturally, a feeling of alarm came upon me, as I asked myself how one is to manage a State like this in which young men and maidens are well-nourished but exempt from those severe and menial labors which are the surest means of quenching wantonness,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="835e"/> and where the chief occupation of everyone all through life consists in sacrifices, feasts and dances.  In a State such as this, how will the young abstain from those desires which frequently plunge many into ruin,—all those desires from which reason, in its endeavor to be law,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A play on <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>; cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 836e">Plat. Laws 836e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 714a">Plat. Laws 714a</bibl>.</note> enjoins abstinence?  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="836">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> That the laws previously ordained serve to repress the majority of desires is not surprising; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="836"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="836a"/> thus, for example, the proscription of excessive wealth is of no small benefit for promoting temperance, and the whole of our education-system contains laws useful for the same purpose;  in addition to this, there is the watchful eye of the magistrates, trained to fix its gaze always on this point and to keep constant watch on the young people.  These means, then, are sufficient (so far as any human means suffice) to deal with the other desires.  But when we come to the amorous passions of children of both sexes and of men for women and women for men,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="836b"/> passions which have been the cause of countless woes both to individuals and to whole States,—how is one to guard against these, or what remedy can one apply so as to find a way of escape in all such cases from a danger such as this?  It is extremely difficult, Clinias.  For whereas, in regard to other matters not a few, <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> generally and <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> furnish us (and rightly) with no little assistance in the framing of laws which differ from those in common use,—in regard to the passions of sex (for we are alone by ourselves)
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="836c"/> they contradict us absolutely.  If we were to follow in nature’s steps and enact that law which held good before the days of Laius,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, father of Oedipus.</note> declaring that it is right to refrain from indulging in the same kind of intercourse with men and boys<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 636b">Plat. Laws 636b</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 181a">Plat. Sym.181-2</bibl>.</note> as with women, and adducing as evidence thereof the nature of wild beasts, and pointing out how male does not touch male for this purpose, since it is unnatural,—in all this we would probably be using an argument neither convincing nor in any way consonant with your States.  Moreover, that object which, as we affirm, the lawgiver ought always to have in view
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="836d"/> does not agree with these practices.  For the enquiry we always make is this —which of the proposed laws tends toward virtue and which not.  Come then, suppose we grant that this practice is now legalized, and that it is noble and in no way ignoble, how far would it promote virtue?  Will it engender in the soul of him who is seduced a courageous character, or in the soul of the seducer the quality of temperance?  Nobody would ever believe this;  on the contrary, as all men will blame the cowardice <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="836e"/> of the man who always yields to pleasures and is never able to hold out against them, will they not likewise reproach that man who plays the woman’s part with the resemblance he bears to his model?  Is there any man, then, who will ordain by law a practice like that?  Not one, I should say, if he has a notion of what true law is.  What then do we declare to be the truth about this matter?  </said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Friendship is the name we give to the affection of like for like, in point of goodness, and of equal for equal;  and also to that of the needy for the rich, which is of the opposite kind;  and when either of these feelings is intense we call it <q type="emph">love.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="837b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The friendship which occurs between opposites is terrible and fierce and seldom reciprocal amongst men, while that based on similarity is gentle and reciprocal throughout life.  The kind which arises from a blend of these presents difficulties,—first, to discover what the man affected by this third kind of love really desires to obtain, and, in the next place, because the man himself is at a loss, being dragged in opposite directions by the two tendencies,—of which the one bids him to enjoy the bloom of his beloved, while the other forbids him.  For he that is in love with the body
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="837c"/> and hungering after its bloom,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Sym. 183d">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="837d"/> the chaste object of his love.  But the love which is blended of these two kinds is that which we have described just now as third.  Since, then, love has so many varieties, ought the law to prohibit them all and prevent them from existing in our midst, or shall we not plainly wish that the kind of love which belongs to virtue and desires the young to be as good as possible should exist within our State, while we shall prohibit, if possible, the other two kinds?  Or what is our view, my dear Megillus?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The sentence that these acts are by no means holy,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="838c"/> but hated of God and most shamefully shameful.  And does not the reason lie in this, that nobody speaks of them otherwise, but every one of us, from the day of his birth, hears this opinion expressed always and everywhere, not only in comic speech, but often also in serious tragedy—as when there is brought on to the stage a Thyestes or an Oedipus, or a Macareus having secret intercourse with a sister, and all these are seen inflicting death upon themselves willingly as a punishment for their sins?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Thus much at least you are quite right in saying—that public opinion
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="838d"/> has a surprising influence, when there is no attempt by anybody ever to breathe a word that contradicts the law.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then is it not true, as I said just now, that when a lawgiver wishes to subdue one of those lusts which especially subdue men, it is easy for him at least to learn the method of mastering them,—that it is by consecrating this public opinion in the eyes of all alike—bond and free, women and children, and the whole State—that he will effect the firmest security
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="838e"/> for this law.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> Certainly;  but how it will ever be possible for him to bring it about that all are willing to say such a thing—</said></p></div>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="839">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> A very proper observation.  That was precisely the reason why I stated that in reference to this law I know of a device for making a natural use of reproductive intercourse,—on the one hand, by abstaining from the male and not slaying of set purpose the human stock,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="839"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="839a"/> nor sowing seed on rocks and stones where it can never take root and have fruitful increase;  and, on the other hand, by abstaining from every female field in which you would not desire the seed to spring up.  This law, when it has become permanent and prevails—if it has rightly become dominant in other cases, just as it prevails now regarding intercourse with parents,—is the cause of countless blessings.  For, in the first place, it follows the dictates of nature, and it serves to keep men from sexual rage and frenzy and all kinds of fornication, and from all excess in meats and drinks,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="839b"/> and it ensures in husbands fondness for their own wives:  other blessings also would ensue, in infinite number, if one could make sure of this law.  Possibly, however, some young bystander, rash and of superabundant virility, on hearing of the passing of this law, would denounce us for making foolish and impossible rules, and fill all the place with his outcries;  and it was in view of this that I made the statement<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 838b">Plat. Laws 838b</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="839c"/> that I knew of a device to secure the permanence of this law when passed which is at once the easiest of all devices and the hardest.  For while it is very easy to perceive that this is possible, and how it is possible—since we affirm that this rule, when duly consecrated, will dominate all souls, and cause them to dread the laws enacted and yield them entire obedience,—yet it has now come to this, that men think that, even so, it is unlikely to come about,—just in the same way as, in the case of the institution of public meals, people refuse to believe that it is possible
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="839d"/> for the whole State to be able to continue this practice constantly;  and that, too, in spite of the evidence of facts and the existence of the practice in your countries;  and even there, as applied to women, the practice is regarded as non-natural.  Thus it was that, because of the strength of this unbelief, I said that it is most difficult to get both these matters permanently legalized.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> And you were right in that.</said></p>

And the same story is told about Crison and Astylus and Diopompus and very many others.  And yet, Clinias, these men were not only much worse educated in soul then your citizens and mine,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="840b"/> but they also possessed much more sexual vigor of body.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Victory over pleasures,—which if they win, they will live a life of bliss, but if they lose, the very opposite.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now that we have reached this point in regard to our regulation,

    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="840e"/> they live in a way that is holy and just, remaining constant to their first contracts of love:  surely our citizens should at least be better than these animals.  If, however, they become corrupted by most of the other Hellenes or barbarians, through seeing and hearing that among them the <q type="emph">lawless Love</q> (as it is called) is of very great power, and thus become unable to overcome it, then the Law-wardens, acting as lawgivers, must devise for them a second law.</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Evidently that law which comes next to it as second.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One ought to put the force of pleasures as far as possible out of gear, by diverting its increase and nutriment to another part of the body by means of exercise.  This would come about if indulgence in sexual intercourse were devoid of shamelessness;  for if, owing to shame, people indulged in it but seldom,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="841b"/> in consequence of this rare indulgence they would find it a less tyrannical mistress.  Let them, therefore, regard privacy in such actions as honorable—sanctioned both by custom and by unwritten law;  and want of privacy—yet not the entire avoidance of such actions—as dishonorable.  Thus we shall have a second standard of what is honorable and shameful established by law and possessing a second degree of rectitude;  and those people of depraved character, whom we describe as <q type="emph">self-inferior,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kinds?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That of godly fear, and that of love of honor, and that which is desirous of fair forms of soul, not fair bodies.  The things I now mention are, perhaps, like the visionary ideals in a story;  yet in very truth, if only they were realized, they would prove a great blessing in every State.  Possibly, should God so grant,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="841d"/> we might forcibly effect one of two things in this matter of sex-relations,—either that no one should venture to touch any of the noble and freeborn save his own wedded wife, nor sow any unholy and bastard seed in fornication, nor any unnatural and barren seed in sodomy,—or else we should entirely abolish love for males, and in regard to that for women, if we enact a law that any man who has intercourse with any women save those who have been brought to his house
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="841e"/> under the sanction of Heaven and holy marriage, whether purchased or otherwise acquired, if detected in such intercourse by any man or woman, shall be disqualified from any civic commendation, as being really an alien,— probably such a law would be approved as right. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="842"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> So let this law—whether we ought to call it one law or two—be laid down concerning sexual commerce and love affairs in general, as regards right and wrong conduct

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well, now we have arrived at this point in our progress, that common meals have been established—a thing which elsewhere, as we say, would be difficult, but in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> no one would question its correctness.  As concerns the manner of them,—whether we should adopt the Cretan fashion, or the Lacedaemonian, or whether we can find a third fashion that is better than either,—this does not seem to me a difficult problem to decide, nor indeed would its decision prove of much benefit, since these meals are now
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="842c"/> actually established in a satisfactory way. Next to this comes the question of organizing the food-supply, and how to make this fit in with the meals.  In other States this supply would include all kinds of food and come from many sources, certainly from twice as many sources as it will in our State;  for most of the Greeks arrange for their food to be derived from both land and sea, but our people will derive it only from the land.  This makes the lawgiver’s task easier;  for in this case half the number of laws,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="842d"/> or less, will suffice, and the laws, too, will be better fitted for free men.  For the lawgiver of our State is rid, for the most part, of shipping and merchandise and peddling and inn-keeping and customs and mines and loans and usury, and countless matters of a like kind;  he can say good-bye to all such, and legislate for farmers and shepherds and bee-keepers, and concerning the preservation and supervision of the instruments employed in these occupations.  This he will do, now that he has already enacted the most important laws,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="842e"/> which deal with marriage, and with the birth and nurture and education of the children, and with the appointment of magistrates in the State.  For the present he must turn, in his legislating, to the subject of food and of those whose labors contribute to its supply. First, then, let there be a code of laws termed <q type="emph">agricultural.</q></said></p></div>

For of the one kind Zeus the Clansmen’s god is witness, of the other Zeus the Strangers’ god;  which gods, when aroused, bring wars most deadly.  He that obeys the law shall not suffer the evils which it inflicts;  but whoso despises it shall be liable to a double penalty, the first from the hand of Heaven, the second from the law.  No one shall
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="843b"/> voluntarily move the boundary-marks of the land of neighbors:  if any man shall move them, whosoever wishes shall report him to the land-holders, and they shall bring him to the law court.  And if a man be convicted,—since by such an act the convicted man is secretly and violently merging lands in one,—the court shall estimate what the loser must suffer or pay. Further, many small wrongs are done against neighbors which, owing to their frequent repetition, engender an immense amount of enmity, and make of neighborhood a grievous and bitter thing.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="843c"/> Wherefore every neighbor must guard most carefully against doing any unfriendly act to his neighbor, and must above all things take special care always not to encroach in the least degree on his land;  for whereas it is an easy thing and open to anyone to do an injury, to do a benefit is by no means open to everyone.  Whosoever encroaches on his neighbor’s ground, overstepping the boundaries, shall pay for the damage;  and, by way of cure for his shamelessness
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="843d"/> and incivility, he shall also pay out to the injured party twice the cost of the damage.  In all such matters the land-stewards shall act as inspectors, judges and valuers,—the whole staff of the district, as we have said above,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="844"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="844a"/> Thus, regarding water-supplies also, there are excellent old laws laid down for farmers, which we, in our exposition, need not draw upon.  Let this suffice:—he that desires to bring water to his own land may do so, commencing at the public cisterns, but he must not undercut the exposed wells of any private person:  he may lead it by whatever way he wishes, except through a house, temple or tomb, and he must do no damage beyond the actual work of channelling.  If, in any spot, the rain-water filters through owing to the natural dryness of the soil,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="844b"/> and there is a scarcity of necessary moisture, then the owner shall dig in his own ground down to the chalk subsoil, and if he fails to find water at this depth, he shall procure from his neighbors just so much as he requires for drinking purposes for all his household;  and if his neighbors also are stinted in their supplies, he shall apply for a ration of water from the land-stewards, and fetch it day by day, and so share the water with his neighbors.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="844c"/> And if, when rain comes, any dweller on lower ground damages the farmer above him, or the adjoining dweller, by preventing its outflow,—or if, conversely, the man on higher ground damages the man below by letting out the floods carelessly,—and if, in consequence, they refuse to accommodate one another in this matter, any person who wishes shall call in a city-steward, if it is in the city, or a land-steward, if in the country, and get an order as to what each party is to do;  and the man who does not abide by the order shall be liable to be charged with envy and frowardness,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="844d"/> and if convicted he shall pay to the injured party double the damage, for refusing to obey the magistrates. As concerns the fruit-harvest, the rule of sharing for all shall be this—this goddess has bestowed on us two gifts, one the plaything of Dionysus which goes unstored, the other produced by nature for putting in store.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. (1) choice (or <q type="emph">dessert</q>) fruit, for immediate use, and (2) coarse fruit, of poorer quality, for storing in bulk or making into wine.</note>  So let this law be enacted concerning the fruit-harvest:—whosoever shall taste of the coarse crop of grapes or figs before the season of vintage,

As to pears, apples, pomegranates, and all such fruits,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="845c"/> it shall be no disgrace to take them privily;  but the man that is caught at it, if he be under thirty years of age, shall be beaten and driven off without wounds;  and for such blows a free man shall have no right to sue.  A foreigner shall be allowed to share in these fruits in the same way as in the grape crop;  and if a man above thirty touch them, eating on the spot and not taking any away, he shall have a share in all such fruits, like the foreigner;  but if he disobeys the law, he shall be liable to be disqualified
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="845d"/> in seeking honors, in case anyone brings these facts to the notice of the judges at the time. Water above all else in a garden is nourishing;  but it is easy to spoil.  For while soil and sun and wind, which jointly with water nourish growing plants, are not easy to spoil by means of sorcery or diverting or theft, all these things may happen to water;  hence it requires the assistance of law.
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="845e"/> Let this, then, be the law concerning it:—if anyone wantonly spoil another man’s water, whether in spring or in pond, by means of sorcery, digging, or theft, the injured party shall sue him before the city-stewards, recording the amount of the damage sustained;  and whosoever is convicted of damaging by poisons shall, in addition to the fine, clean out the springs or the basin of the water, in whatever way the laws of the interpreters declare it right for the purification to be made on each occasion and for each plaintiff.</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is, in a sense, a shameful thing to make all those laws that we are proposing to make in a State like ours, which is, as we say, to be well managed and furnished with all that is right for the practice of virtue.  In such a State, the mere supposition that any citizen will grow up to share in the worst forms of depravity practiced in other States, so that one must forestall and denounce by law the appearance of any such character,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="853c"/> and, in order to warn them off or punish them, enact laws against them, as though they were certain to appear,—this, as I have said, is in a sense shameful.  But we are not now legislating, like the ancient lawgivers, for heroes and sons of gods,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 713b">Plat.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="854"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="854a"/> the general infirmity of human nature, I will state the law about temple-robbing, and all other crimes of a like kind which are hard, if not impossible, to cure.  And, in accordance with our rule as already approved,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 718b">Plat. Laws 718b</bibl>.</note> we must prefix to all such laws preludes as brief as possible.  By way of argument and admonition one might address in the following terms the man whom an evil desire urges by day and wakes up at night, driving him to rob some sacred object—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="854b"/><q type="spoken">My good man, the evil force that now moves you and prompts you to go temple-robbing is neither of human origin nor of divine, but it is some impulse bred of old in men from ancient wrongs unexpiated, which courses round wreaking ruin;  and it you must guard against with all your strength.  How you must thus guard, now learn.  When there comes upon you any such intention, betake yourself to the rites of guilt-averting, betake yourself as suppliant to the shrines of the curse-lifting deities, betake yourself to the company of the men who are reputed virtuous;  and thus learn, partly from others,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="854c"/> partly by self-instruction, that every man is bound to honor what is noble and just;  but the company of evil men shun wholly, and turn not back.  And if it be so that by thus acting your disease grows less, well;  but if not, then deem death the more noble way, and quit yourself of life.</q> As we chant this prelude to those who purpose all these unholy deeds, destructive of civic life, the law itself we must leave unvoiced<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 871a">Plat. Laws 871a</bibl>.</note> for him who obeys;  but for him who disobeys we must suffer the law, following on the prelude, to utter aloud this chant:

For no penalty that is legally imposed aims at evil, but it effects, as a rule, one or other of two results,—

That the goods of any such criminal should be confiscated would not be fitting in a State in which the allotments must remain always identical and equal in number.

What do I mean to imply by this remark?  It was no bad comparison we made<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 720a">Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> The choice we propose, Stranger, is an absurd one:  we should be acting like legislators
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="858b"/> who were driven by some overpowering necessity to pass laws on the spot, because it is impossible for them to do so on the morrow.  But for us (if Heaven will) it is quite possible to do as bricklayers do, or men starting on any other kind of construction,—that is, to collect material piecemeal, from which we may select what is suitable for the edifice we intend to build, and, what is more, select it at our leisure.  Let us assume, then, that we are not now building under compulsion, but that we are still at leisure, and engaged partly in collecting material and partly in putting it together;  so that we may rightly say that our laws are being in part

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We have in our States not only the writings and written speeches of many other people, but also the writings and speeches of the lawgiver.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are we, then, to pay attention to the compositions of the others—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="858d"/> poets, and all who, either with or without meter, have composed and put on record their counsels concerning life,—but to pay no attention to those of the lawgivers?  Or should we not attend to them above all others?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, far above all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But we surely do not mean that the lawgiver alone of all the writers is not to give counsel about what is noble, good and just, teaching what these are, and how those who intend to be happy must practice them.</said></p>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="858e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, is it more disgraceful on the part of Homer and Tyrtaeus and the rest of the poets to lay down in their writings bad rules about life and its pursuits, and less disgraceful on the part of Lycurgus and Solon and all the legislators who have written? </said></p> </div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="859">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>   Or rather, is it not right that, of all the writings which exist in States, those which concern laws should be seen, when unrolled, to be by far the fairest and best, and all other writings to be either modelled on them or,

Are we to conceive that the written laws in our States should resemble persons moved by love and wisdom, such as a father or a mother, or that they should order and threaten, like some tyrant and despot, who writes his decree on the wall, and there is an end of it?  So let us now consider whether we are going to try to discuss laws
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="859b"/> with this intention—showing zeal, at any rate, whether or not we may prove successful;  and if, in proceeding on this course, we must meet with mishap, so be it.  Yet we pray that it may be well with us, and if God wills, it shall be well.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are right:  let us do as you say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> First of all, since we have started on it, we must examine closely the law about temple-robbers and all forms of thieving and wrongdoing;  nor should we be vexed by the fact that, although we enacted some points while legislating,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="859c"/> there are some points still under consideration:  for we are in process of becoming lawgivers, and may perhaps become so, but we are not lawgivers as yet.  So if we agree to consider the matters I have mentioned in the way I have mentioned, let us so consider them.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In respect of goodness and justice as a whole, let us try to discern this,—how far we now agree with ourselves, and how far we differ (for we should certainly say that we desire, if nothing else,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="859d"/> to differ at least from the majority of men), and how far also the majority agree or differ among themselves.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What differences of ours have you in mind?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I will try to explain.  Concerning justice in general, and men, things, or actions that are just, we all agree that these are all beautiful, so that no one would be regarded as saying what was wrong even if he should maintain that just men, however ugly in body,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="859e"/> are quite beautiful in respect of their very just character.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Would not that be right?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Perhaps;  but let us observe this,—that if all things which belong to justice are beautiful, that <q type="emph">all</q> includes for us passions<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. <q type="emph">sufferings.</q></note> nearly as much as actions.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, what then?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Every just action, in so far as it shares in justice, practically in the same degree partakes of beauty.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p></div>
        
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="860">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is agreed also—if our argument is to be consistent—<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="860"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="860a"/> that a passion which shares in justice, becomes, so far, beautiful.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But if we agree that a passion though just is unseemly, then justice and beauty will be at discord, when just things are called most unseemly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean by that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is not hard to grasp.  The laws we enacted a short time ago might seem to enjoin what is absolutely contrary to our present statements.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What statements?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="860b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We laid it down<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 854b">Plat.

Thus the just and the beautiful will seem to us at one moment wholly identical, at another, utterly opposed, will they not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I am afraid so.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="860c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus it is that by the multitude the beautiful and the just are flung apart, and inconsistent language is used about them.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It certainly seems so, Stranger.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then let us look again at our own view, and see how far it is consistent in this respect.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kind of consistency, and in respect of what, do you mean?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That all bad men are in all respects unwillingly bad;  and, this being so, our next statement must agree therewith.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What statement do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This,—that the unjust man is, indeed, bad, but the bad man is unwillingly bad.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In what follows, the <title>Athenian</title>, adopting the Socratic dictum that <q type="emph">vice is involuntary</q> (cp. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 86e">Plat. Tim. 86e ff</bibl>.), applies it to the special vice of injustice;  but here his view is found to conflict with the popular view which distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary acts of injustice, and assigns to them different legal penalties.  If this popular distinction is wrong, the lawgiver must either (a) simply apply the Socratic rule, and enact that all unjust acts are involuntary and deserve therefore equal penalties, or (b) draw a new distinction, which <title>Ath</title>. proceeds to do in 861 E ff.  (see note ad loc.).</note>  But it is illogical to suppose that a willing deed is done unwillingly;  therefore he that commits an unjust act does so unwillingly in the opinion of him who assumes that injustice is involuntary—a conclusion which I also must now allow;  for I agree that all men do unjust acts unwillingly;  so, since I hold this view—and do not share the opinion of those who,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="860e"/> through contentiousness or arrogance, assert that, while there are some who are unjust against their will, yet there are also many who are unjust willingly,—how am I to prove consistent with my own statements?  Suppose you two, Megillus and Clinias, put this question to me—<q type="spoken">If this is the state of the case, Stranger, what counsel do you give us in regard to legislating for the Magnesian State?

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you say, Stranger, is quite right:  so what use are we to make of our present arguments?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> A very proper question!  The use we shall make of them, to begin with, is this—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us recall how, a moment ago, we rightly stated that in regard to justice we are suffering from the greatest confusion and inconsistency.  Grasping this fact,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="861b"/> let us again question ourselves,—<q type="spoken">As to our perplexity about these matters, since we have neither got it clear nor defined the point of difference between those two kinds of wrongdoing, voluntary and involuntary, which are treated as legally distinct in every State by every legislator who has ever yet appeared,—as to this, is the statement we recently made to stand, like a divine oracle, as a mere ex cathedra statement, unsupported by any proof, and to serve as a kind of master-enactment<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Literally, <gloss>to legislate down</gloss> (i.e.  over-rule the popular objection to our Socratic view).</note>?</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="861c"/> That is impossible;  and before we legislate we are bound first to make it clear somehow that these wrong-doings are two-fold, and wherein their difference consists, in order that when we impose the penalty on either kind, everyone may follow our rules, and be able to form some judgment regarding the suitability or otherwise of our enactments.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you say, Stranger, appears to us to be excellent:  we ought to do one of two things,—either not assert that all unjust acts are involuntary, or else make our distinctions first,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="861d"/> then prove the correctness of that assertion.</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Of these alternatives the first is to me quite intolerable—namely, not to assert what I hold to be the truth,—for that would be neither a lawful thing to do nor a pious.  But as to the question how such acts are two-fold,—if the difference does not lie in that between the voluntary and the involuntary, then we must try to explain it by means of some other distinction.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The proper distinction to be drawn (as <title>Ath</title>. proceeds to argue) is not that between voluntary and involuntary acts of injustice (since there are no such voluntary acts), but that between <q type="emph">injuries</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βλάβαι</foreign>, <gloss>acts causing loss</gloss>) and <q type="emph">acts of injustice.</q>  Injustice is really a quality of the agent rather than of the act, and (like all vice) is a form of un-reason:  as the slave of un-reason, the unjust man is never a free agent.  Hence the task of the lawgiver is two fold, (1) to make good the <q type="emph">injuries,</q> and (2) to cure the agent of his <q type="emph">injustice</q> by restoring the power of reason (<q type="emph">moral sense</q>) in his soul.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, certainly, Stranger, about this matter there is no other plan we can possibly adopt.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="861e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It shall be done.  Come now, in dealings and intercourse between citizens, injuries committed by one against another are of frequent occurrence, and they involve plenty of the voluntary as well as of the involuntary.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> To be sure!</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="862">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let no one put down all injuries as acts of injustice and then regard the unjust acts involved as two-fold in the way described, namely, that they are partly voluntary and partly involuntary (for, of the total, the involuntary injuries are not less than the voluntary either in number or in magnitude);
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="862"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="862a"/> but consider whether in saying what I am now going to say I am speaking sense or absolute nonsense.  For what I assert, Megillus and Clinias, is not that, if one man harms another involuntarily and without wishing it, he acts unjustly though involuntarily, nor shall I legislate in this way, pronouncing this to be an involuntary act of injustice, but I will pronounce that such an injury is not an injustice at all, whether it be a greater injury or a less.  And, if my view prevails, we shall often say that the author of a benefit wrongly done commits an injustice;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="862b"/> for as a rule, my friends, neither when a man gives some material object to another, nor when he takes it away, ought one to term such an act absolutely just or unjust, but only when a man of just character and disposition does any benefit or injury to another,—that is what the lawgiver must look at;  he must consider these two things, injustice and injury, and the injury inflicted he must make good so far as possible by legal means;  he must conserve what is lost, restore what has been broken down, make whole
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="862c"/> what is wounded or dead;  and when the several injuries have been atoned for by compensation, he must endeavor always by means of the laws to convert the parties who have inflicted them and those who have suffered them from a state of discord to a state of amity.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> He will be right in doing that.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As regards unjust injuries and gains, in case one man causes another to gain by acting unjustly towards him, all such cases as are curable we must cure, regarding them as diseases of the soul.  And we should affirm that our cure for injustice lies in this direction—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What direction?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="862d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In this,—that whenever any man commits any unjust act, great or small, the law shall instruct him and absolutely compel him for the future either never willingly to dare to do such a deed, or else to do it ever so much less often, in addition to paying for the injury.  To effect this, whether by action or speech, by means of pleasures and pains, honors and dishonors, money-fines and money-gifts, and in general by whatsoever means one can employ to make men hate injustice and love (or at any rate not hate) justice,—this is precisely the task of laws most noble.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="862e"/> But for all those whom he perceives to be incurable in respect of these matters, what penalty shall the lawgiver enact, and what law? </said></p></div> 
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="863">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> The lawgiver will realize that in all such cases not only is it better for the sinners themselves to live no longer, but also that they will prove of a double benefit to others by quitting life—since they will both serve as a warning to the rest not to act unjustly, and also rid <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="863"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="863a"/> the State of wicked men,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you have said seems very reasonable;  but we should be glad to hear a still clearer statement respecting the difference between injury and injustice, and how the distinction between the voluntary and the involuntary applies in these cases.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I must endeavor to do as you bid me, and explain the matter.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="863b"/> No doubt in conversing with one another you say and hear said at least thus much about the soul, that one element in its nature (be it affection or part) is <q type="emph">passion,</q> which is an inbred quality of a contentious and pugnacious kind, and one that overturns many things by its irrational force.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>

The domination of passion and fear and pleasure and pain and envies and desires in the soul, whether they do any injury or not, I term generally <q type="emph">injustice</q>;  but the belief in the highest good—
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="864"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="864a"/> in whatsoever way either States or individuals think they can attain to it,—if this prevails in their souls and regulates every man, even if some damage be done, we must assert that everything thus done is just, and that in each man the part subject to this governance is also just, and best for the whole life of mankind, although most men suppose that such damage is an involuntary injustice.  But we are not now

An act of this kind a man might commit when mad, or when suffering from some disease or from excessive senility, or in a state of childishness, whereby he is no better than a madman.  If any case of this kind is ever brought to the notice of the selected judges, either on the information of the doer of the act or on that of him who is pleading for the doer, and if it be judged that he was in this state of madness when he broke the law,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="864e"/> then he shall certainly pay for the damage he has done, but only the exact sum, and he shall be acquitted of the other charges, unless it be that he has killed a man and has not purged his hands from blood:  in this case he shall depart into another country and place, and dwell there as an exile for a year;  and should he return within the time fixed by the law or set foot at all within his own country, he shall be put in the public jail by the Law-wardens for the space of two years, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="865"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="865a"/> and not let out of jail until after that time. </said></p></div>

First we shall deal with the cases that are violent and involuntary.  If a man has killed a friend in a contest or in public games—whether his death has been immediate or as the after-effect of wounds,—or similarly if he has killed him in war or in some action of training for war, either when practicing
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="865b"/> javelin-work without armor or when engaged in some warlike maneuver in heavy armor,—then, when he has been purified as the Delphic rule on this matter directs, he shall be accounted pure.  So too with respect to all doctors, if the patient dies against the will of his doctor, the doctor shall be accounted legally pure. And if one man kills another of his own act, but involuntarily,—whether it be with his own unarmed body, or by a tool or a weapon, or by a dose of drink or of solid food, or by application of fire or of cold, or by deprivation of air, and whether he does it himself with his own body or by means of other bodies,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="865c"/> in all cases it shall be accounted to be his own personal act, and he shall pay the following penalties.  If he kill a slave, he shall secure the master against damage and loss, reckoning as if it were a slave of his own that had been destroyed, or else he shall be liable to a penalty of double the value of the dead man,—and the judges shall make an assessment of his value,—and he must also employ means of purification greater and more numerous than those employed by persons

And if anyone kill a free man involuntarily, he shall undergo the same purifications as the man that has killed a slave;  and there is an ancient tale, told of old, to which he must not fail to pay regard.  The tale is this,—that the man slain by violence, who has lived in a free and proud spirit, is wroth with his slayer when newly slain, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="865e"/> and being filled also with dread and horror on account of his own violent end, when he sees his murderer going about in the very haunts which he himself had frequented, he is horror-stricken;  and being disquieted himself, he takes conscience as his ally, and with all his might disquiets his slayer—both the man himself and his doings.  Wherefore it is right for the slayer to retire before his victim for a full year, in all its seasons, and to vacate all the spots he owned in all parts of his native land;  </said></p></div>

If a man willingly obeys this law, he that is nearest of kin to the dead man, having the supervision of the performance of all these rules, shall pardon him and live at peace with him, and in doing so he will be acting with perfect propriety;  but if a man disobeys, and dares, in the first place, to approach the altars and to do sacrifice while still unpurified, and if he refuses, further,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="866b"/> to fulfil the times appointed in exile, then the next of kin to the dead man shall prosecute the slayer for murder, and in case of conviction all the penalties shall be doubled.  And should the nearest relative fail to prosecute for the crime, it shall be as though the pollution had passed on to him, through the victim claiming atonement for his fate;  and whoso pleases shall bring a charge against him, and compel him by law to quit his country for five years. And if a Stranger involuntarily kills a Stranger who is resident in the State, whoso pleases shall prosecute him under the same laws;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="866c"/> and if he be a resident alien, he shall be exiled for a year, while if he be altogether a Stranger—whether the man slain be a Stranger or resident alien or citizen—in addition to the purifications imposed, he shall be barred for all his life from the country which ordains these laws;  and if he transgresses the law, and comes back to it, the Law-wardens shall punish him with death;  and if he has any property, they shall hand it over
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="866d"/> to the next of kin of the victim.  And should he come back unwillingly, in case he be shipwrecked off the coast of the country, he shall camp with his feet in the sea, and watch for a ship to take him off;  or in case he be brought in by people forcibly by land, the first magistrate of the State that meets with him shall loose him, and send him out over the border unharmed. If a person with his own hand kills a free man, and the deed be done in passion, in a case of this kind we must begin by making a distinction between two varieties of the crime.  For murder is committed in passion by those who, on a sudden and without intent to kill,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="866e"/> destroy a man by blows or some such means in an immediate attack, when the deed is at once followed by repentance;  and it is also a case of murder done in passion whenever men who are insulted by shameful words or actions seek for vengeance, and end by killing a man with deliberate intent to kill, and feel no repentance for the deed. </said></p> </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="867">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  We must lay it down, as it seems, that these murders are of two kinds,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="867"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="867a"/> both as a rule done in passion, and most properly described as lying midway between the voluntary and the involuntary.  None the less, each of these kinds tends to resemble one or other of these contraries;  for the man who retains his passion and takes vengeance, not suddenly on the spur of the moment, but after lapse of time, and with deliberate intent, resembles the voluntary murderer;  whereas the man who does not nurse his rage, but gives way to it at once on the spur of the moment and without deliberate intent, has a likeness to the involuntary murderer;  yet neither is he wholly involuntary, but bears a resemblance thereto.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="867b"/> Thus murders done in passion are difficult to define,—whether one should treat them in law as voluntary or involuntary.  The best and truest way is to class them both as resemblances, and to distinguish them by the mark of deliberate intent or lack of intent, and to impose more severe penalties on those who slay with intent and in anger, and milder penalties on those who do so without intent and on a sudden.  For that which resembles a greater evil must be more heavily punished, that which resembles a lesser evil
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="867c"/> more lightly.  So our laws also must do likewise.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They must, most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Returning, then, to our task, let us make this pronouncement:—If a man with his own hand slay a free man, and the deed be done in rage without deliberate intent, he shall suffer such other penalties as it is proper for the man to suffer who has slain without passion, and he shall be compelled to go into exile for two years, thereby chastising his own passion.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="867d"/> And he that slays in passion and with deliberate intent shall be treated in other respects like the former, but shall be exiled for three years—instead of two, like the other,—receiving a longer period of punishment because of the greatness of his passion.  As regards the return home, in such cases it shall be on this wise.  (It is a difficult matter to legislate for with exactness;  for sometimes the more dangerous of the two murderers in the eye of the law might prove the more gentle and the gentler the more dangerous, and the latter might have committed the murder more savagely, the former more gently;  though as a rule matters turn out in the way we have stated:
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="867e"/> so, regarding all these regulations the Law-wardens must act as supervisors).  When the period of exile in each case has elapsed, they must send twelve of their number to the borders of the country to act as judges—they having made during the interval a still closer investigation into the actions of the exiles;  </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="868">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> and these men shall serve also as judges in regard to the matter of giving them pardon and admitting them back;  and the exiles must abide by the verdicts of these magistrates.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="868"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="868a"/> And if either of them, after his return, again yields to rage and commits the same act, he shall be exiled, and never again return;  and if he returns, he shall suffer the same fate as the returned Stranger.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 855c">Plat. Laws 855c</bibl>.</note>  He that slays a slave of his own shall purify himself;  and if he kill another man’s slave in rage, he shall pay to the owner twice the damage.  And if anyone of all these types of slayers disobeys the law and, being unpurified, defiles the market and the games and other sacred assemblies, whoso pleases shall prosecute
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="868b"/> both that member of the dead man’s kindred who permits this and the slayer himself, and shall compel the one of them to exact, and the other to pay, double the amount of the money-fines and of the other exactions<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Such as the costs of the purification-rites.</note>;  and the sum so paid he shall keep for himself as the law directs.  If a slave kills his own master in rage, the kindred of the dead man shall treat the slayer how they please,—save that they must not
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="868c"/> in any wise let him live,—and shall be held guiltless.  And if a slave kill a free man (other than his master) in rage, his masters shall hand over the slave to the kindred of the dead man, and they shall be compelled to put the criminal to death, doing so in whatever manner they choose. If in a fit of rage a father or mother slays a son or daughter by means of blows or some kind of violence,—an occurrence which, though rare, does sometimes happen,—the slayer must make the same purifications as the other slayers, and be exiled for three years;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="868d"/> and when the slayers have returned, the wife must be separated from the husband and the husband from the wife, and they must never again have a child, nor shall they ever share a home with those whom the slayer has robbed of child or brother, nor shall they take part in their worship;  he that is disobedient and impious concerning this matter shall be liable to an action for impiety at the hands of whoso pleases.  And if a husband in a fit of rage kills his wedded wife, or if a wife in like manner kills her husband, they must undergo
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="868e"/> the same purifications, and remain exiled for three years.  And when one who has committed such a crime returns, he shall never take part in worship with his children, nor sit at table with them;  and if either the parent or the child disobeys, he shall be liable to a charge of impiety at the hands of whoso pleases. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="869"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> And if in rage a brother kill a brother or a sister, or a sister kill a brother or a sister, it shall be declared that they must undergo the same purifications and banishment as have been ordained for parents and children,—namely, that the homicide shall never share in the house or in the worship of those brothers or parents whom he has robbed of brothers or of children;
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="869"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="869a"/> and if anyone disobeys, he will rightly and justly be liable to the law laid down concerning such cases of impiety. If any man gets into such an uncontrollable rage with his parents as actually to dare to kill a parent in the madness of his rage, then, in case the dead person before dying voluntarily acquits the culprit of murder, he shall be held pure, after he has purified himself in the same manner as those who have committed an involuntary murder, and done as they
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="869b"/> in all other respects;  but in case the dead person does not so acquit him, then he that has done such a deed is liable to a number of laws:  for outrage he will be liable to most heavy penalties, and likewise for impiety and temple-robbing, since he has robbed his parent of life;  so that if <q type="emph">to die a hundred deaths</q> were possible for any one man, that a parricide or a matricide, who did the deed in rage, should undergo a hundred deaths would be a fate most just.  Since every law will forbid the man to kill
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="869c"/> father or mother, the very authors of his existence, even for the sake of saving his own life, and will ordain that he must suffer and endure everything rather than commit such an act,— in what other way than this can such a man be fittingly dealt with by law, and receive his due reward?  Be it enacted, therefore, that for the man who in rage slays father or mother the penalty is death. If a brother kill a brother in fight during a civil war, or in any such way, acting in self-defence
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="869d"/> against the other, who first started the brawl, he shall be counted as one who has slain an enemy, and be held guiltless;  so too, when a citizen has killed a citizen in like manner, or a Stranger a Stranger.  And if a citizen kill a Stranger in self-defence, or a Stranger a citizen, he shall be accounted pure in the same way.  So likewise, if a slave kill a slave;  but if a slave kill a free man in self-defence, he shall be liable to the same laws as he that kills a father.  And what has been said about remission of the charge in the case of the murder of a father shall hold equally good
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="869e"/> in all such cases—if any man voluntarily acquit any culprit of this charge, the purifications for the culprit shall be made as though the murder were involuntary, and one year of exile shall be imposed by law. Let us take this as an adequate statement respecting murder-cases that involve violence, and are involuntary and done in passion.  Next to these we must state the regulations regarding such acts when voluntary and involving iniquity of all kinds and premeditated,—acts caused by yielding to pleasure or lust or envy.</said></p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="870">

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="870"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="870a"/> how many these causes are likely to be.  The greatest is lust, which masters a soul that is made savage by desires;  and it occurs especially in connection with that object for which the most frequent and intense craving afflicts the bulk of men,—the power which wealth possesses over them, owing to the badness of their nature and lack of culture, to breed in them countless lustings after its insatiable and endless acquisition.  And of this lack of culture the cause is to be found in the ill-praising of wealth in the common talk of both Greeks and barbarians;  for by exalting it as the first of <q type="emph">goods,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="870b"/> when it should come but third, they ruin both posterity and themselves.  The noblest and best course of all in all States is that the truth should be stated about wealth,—namely, that it exists for the sake of the body, and the body for the sake of the soul;  so that, while the objects for which it really exists are <q type="emph">goods,</q> yet wealth itself will come third, after goodness of body and of soul.  So this law will serve as an instructor, to teach that the man who intends to be happy must seek not to be wealthy, but to be justly and temperately wealthy;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="870c"/> and if this were so, no murders that needed purging by murders would occur in States.  But, as things now stand, this love of riches is—as we said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 831c">Plat. Laws 831c</bibl>;  cp. <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1271a.17">Aristot. Pol. 1271a.17</bibl>.</note> when we began this subject—one cause, and a very great cause, which produces the most serious of trials for willful murder.  A second cause is the temper of the ambitious soul, which breeds envies that are dangerous associates for the man that feels the envy, in the first place, and dangerous also for the best citizens in the State.  Thirdly, fears bred of cowardice and iniquity
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="870d"/> have wrought many murders,—in cases where men do or have done things concerning which they desire that no one should share their secret;  consequently, if there are any who might expose their secret, they remove them by death, whenever they can do so by no other means. Concerning all these matters, the preludes mentioned shall be pronounced, and, in addition to them, that story which is believed by many when they hear it from the lips of those who seriously relate such things at their mystic rites,—that vengeance for such acts is exacted in Hades,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="871b"/> or fails to warn him of the fact that he is thus debarred, if he be of kin to the dead man on either the male or female side, and not further removed than a cousin,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

And he that wishes to punish him shall duly perform all that concerns the observance of the purifications proper therefore, and whatsoever else the god prescribes as lawful in these cases,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="871c"/> and he shall recite the pronouncement of warning;  and thus he shall go and compel the culprit to submit to the execution of the penalty according to law.  That it is necessary that these proceedings should be accompanied by certain invocations and sacrifices to those gods whose concern it is that murders should not occur in States, it is easy for the lawgiver to demonstrate:  who these gods are, and what method for bringing such prosecutions would be the most correct in point of ritual,—this the Law-wardens, in conjunction with the interpreters and seers and with the god, shall ordain;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="871d"/> and so they shall bring these prosecutions.  And the judges in these cases shall be the same persons who form—as we described<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 855c">Plat.

He that is convicted shall be punished by death, and he shall not be buried in the land of the victim, because of the shamelessness as well as impiety of his act.  If the culprit flees and refuses to come up for judgment, he shall be exiled with an unending exile;  and if any such person sets foot in the country of the murdered man, he of the dead man’s relatives or of the citizens that first meets with him
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="871e"/> shall slay him with impunity, or else bind him and hand him over to those magistrates who have judged the case, to be slain.  The prosecutor, in a murder-charge, must at once demand bail from the defendant;  and the latter shall provide three substantial securities—as approved by the court of the judges in such cases—, who guarantee to produce him at the trial;  and if a man be unwilling or unable to provide these sureties, the court must take, bind and keep him, and produce him at the trial of the case.</said></p></div>

And the person convicted shall be allowed to have burial at home;  but all else shall be carried out in his case in the same way as in the case last described.  And these same regulations shall govern all cases where Strangers are at law with Strangers, or citizens and Strangers at law with each other,

If a slave willfully slay a free man, either by his own hand or by plotting, and be convicted at the trial, the public executioner of the State shall drag him in the direction of the tomb of the dead man to a spot from which he can see the tomb, and there scourge him with as many stripes
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="872c"/> as the prosecutor shall prescribe;  and if the murderer be still alive after the beating, he shall put him to death.

Should cases occur of a kind for which it is a formidable and most unwelcome task to legislate, and yet impossible not to legislate,—such as murders of kinsfolk, either by a man’s own hand

The myth or story (or whatever
        <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="872e"/> one should call it) has been clearly stated, as derived from ancient priests, to the effect that Justice, the avenger of kindred blood, acting as overseer, employs the law just mentioned, and has ordained that the doer of such a deed must of necessity suffer the same as he has done:  if ever a man has slain his father, he must endure to suffer the same violent fate at his own children’s hands in days to come;  or if he has slain his mother, he must of necessity come to birth sharing in the female nature, and when thus born be removed from life by the hands of his offspring in afterdays;  </said></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="873">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  for of the pollution of common blood there is no other purification, nor does the stain of pollution admit of being washed off
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="873"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="873a"/> before the soul which committed the act pays back murder for murder, like for like, and thus by propitiation lays to rest the wrath of all the kindred.  Wherefore, in dread of such vengeances from Heaven a man should refrain himself;  if, however, any should be overtaken by a disaster so lamentable that they have the audacity deliberately and of free will to reave soul from body for father, mother, brethren or children, in such cases the ordinance of the law of the mortal lawgiver stands thus:—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="873b"/> The warnings of exclusion from customary places, and the sureties, are the same as those prescribed for former cases;  and if any man be convicted of such a murder, and of having slain any of the persons named, the officers of the judges and magistrates shall kill him and cast him out naked at an appointed cross-roads outside the city;  and all the magistrates, acting on behalf of the whole State, shall take each a stone and cast it on the head of the corpse, and thus make atonement for the whole State;  and after this they shall carry the corpse to the borders of the land and cast it out
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="873c"/> unburied, according to law. Now he that slays the person who is, as men say, nearest and dearest of all,—what penalty should he suffer?  I mean the man that slays himself,—violently robbing himself of his Fate-given share of life, when this is not legally ordered by the State, and when he is not compelled to it by the occurrence of some intolerable and inevitable misfortune, nor by falling into some disgrace that is beyond remedy or endurance,—but merely inflicting upon himself this iniquitous penalty owing to sloth and unmanly cowardice.  In this case, the rest of the matters—concerning the rules
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="873d"/> about rites of purification and of burial—come within the cognizance of the god, and regarding these the next of kin must seek information from the interpreters and the laws dealing with these matters, and act in accordance with their instructions:  but for those thus destroyed the tombs shall be, first, in an isolated position with not even one adjacent, and, secondly, they shall be buried in those borders of the twelve districts which are barren and nameless, without note, and with neither headstone nor name to indicate the tombs. If a mule or any other animal murder anyone,—
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="873e"/> except when they do it when taking part in a public competition,—the relatives shall prosecute the slayer for murder, and so many of the land-stewards as are appointed by the relatives shall decide the case, and the convicted beast they shall kill and cast out beyond the borders of the country. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="874">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> If a lifeless thing rob a man of life—except it be lightning or some bolt from heaven,—if it be anything else than these which kills someone, either through his falling against it or its falling upon him, then the relative shall set the nearest neighbor
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="874"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="874a"/> to pass judgment on it, thus making atonement on behalf of himself and all his kindred, and the thing convicted they shall cast beyond the borders, as was stated in respect of animals. If anyone be found evidently dead, and if his slayer be unknown and undiscoverable after careful search, then the warnings shall be the same as in the other cases, including the warning of death
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="874b"/> to the doer of the deed, and the prosecutor, when he has proved his claim, shall give public warning in the market-place to the slayer of So-and-so, convicted of murder, not to set foot in holy places nor anywhere in the country of the victim, since, if he appears and is known, he shall be put to death and be cast out from the country of the victim without burial.  So let this stand as one section of our code of law dealing with murder. Thus far we have dealt with crimes of the kind described;  in what follows we shall describe the cases and the circumstances under which the slayer will rightly be pronounced guiltless.  If a man catch and slay a thief who is entering his house by night to steal goods, he shall be guiltless;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="874c"/> and if a man in self-defence slay a footpad, he shall be guiltless.  The man who forcibly violates a free woman or boy shall be slain with impunity by the person thus violently outraged, or by his father or brother or sons.  And should a man discover his wedded wife being violated, if he kills the violator he shall be guiltless before the law.  And if a man slay anyone when warding off death from his father (when he is doing no wrong), or from his mother or children or brethren, or from the mother of his own children,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="874d"/> he shall be wholly guiltless. Thus let it be laid down by law respecting the nurture and training of living souls,—which when gained make life livable, but when missed, unlivable,—and respecting the punishments which ought to be imposed in cases of violent death.  The regulations regarding the nurture and training of the body have been stated<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 813d">Plat. Laws 813d</bibl>.</note>:  but what comes next, namely, violent actions, both voluntary and involuntary, done by one against another,—these we must define as clearly as we can, stating their character and number
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="874e"/> and what punishment each duly deserves:  such enactments, as it seems, will rightly follow on the foregoing. Next in order after cases of death even the least competent of those who essay legislation would place cases of wounds and maiming.  Wounds, just like murders, must be classed under several heads,—the involuntary, those done in passion, those done in fear, and all those that are voluntary and deliberate. </said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="875"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label>  Concerning all such cases we must make a prefatory pronouncement to this effect:—It is really necessary for men to make themselves laws and to live according to laws, or else to differ not at all from
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="875"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="875a"/> the most savage of beasts.  The reason thereof is this,—that no man’s nature is naturally able both to perceive what is of benefit to the civic life of men and, perceiving it, to be alike able and willing to practice what is best.  For, in the first place, it is difficult to perceive that a true civic art necessarily cares for the public, not the private, interest,—for the public interest bind States together, whereas the private interest rends them asunder,—and to perceive also that it benefits both public and private interests alike when the public interest, rather than the private, is well enacted.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="875b"/> And, secondly, even if a man fully grasps the truth of this as a principle of art, should he afterwards get control of the State and become an irresponsible autocrat, he would never prove able to abide by this view and to continue always fostering the public interest in the State as the object of first importance, to which the private interest is but secondary;  rather, his mortal nature will always urge him on to grasping and self-interested action, irrationally avoiding pain
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="875c"/> and pursuing pleasure;  both these objects it will prefer above justice and goodness, and by causing darkness within itself it will fill to the uttermost both itself and the whole State with all manner of evils.  Yet if ever there should arise a man competent by nature and by a birthright of divine grace to assume such an office, he would have no need of rulers over him;  for no law or ordinance is mightier than Knowledge,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 352b">Plat. Prot. 352b ff</bibl>.;  <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1145b.20">Aristot. Nic.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="875d"/> if it is really true to its name and free in its inner nature.  But at present such a nature exists nowhere at all, except in small degree;  wherefore we must choose what is second best, namely, ordinance and law, which see and discern the general principle, but are unable to see every instance in detail. This declaration has been made for the sake of what follows:  now we shall ordain what the man who has wounded, or in some way injured, another must suffer or pay.  And here, of course, it is open to anyone, in regard to any case, to interrupt us, and quite properly, with the question—<q type="spoken">What wounds has the man you speak of inflicted,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="875e"/> and on whom, and how and when?  For cases of wounding are countless in their variety, and they differ vastly from one another.</q>  So it is impossible for us either to commit all these cases to the law courts for trial, or to commit none of them. </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="876"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="876a"/> and it is practically impossible for the lawgiver to refuse in all cases to commit to the courts the question regarding the proper penalty or fine to be inflicted on the culprit, and himself to pass laws respecting all such cases, great and small.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What, then, is to be our next statement?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It will be best to make the following statement next,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="876b"/> that in a State where the courts are poor and dumb and decide their cases privily, secreting their own opinions, or (and this is a still more dangerous practice) when they make their decisions not silently but filled with tumult, like theaters, roaring out praise or blame of each speaker in turn,—then the whole State, as a rule, is faced with a difficult situation.  To be compelled by some necessity to legislate for law courts of this kind is no happy task;  but when one is so compelled, one must commit to them the right of fixing penalties
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="876c"/> only in a very few cases, dealing oneself with most cases by express legislation—if indeed one ever legislates at all for a State of that description.  On the other hand, in a State where the courts have the best possible constitution, and the prospective judges are well-trained and tested most strictly, there it is right, and most fitting and proper, that we should commit to such judges for decision most of the questions regarding what penalties convicted criminals should suffer or pay.  On the present occasion we may well be pardoned
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="876d"/> if we refrain from ordaining for them by law the points that are most important and most numerous, which even ill-educated judges could discern, and could assign to each offence the penalty merited by the wrong as suffered and committed;  and seeing that the people for whom we are legislating are themselves likely, as we suppose, to become not the least capable of judges of such matters, we must commit most of them to them.  None the less, that course which we frequently adopted<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 770b">Plat. Laws 770b</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 846b">Plat.

If he has done damage to the wounded man, he shall pay for it in full to him that is damaged;  and the damage shall be assessed by the court which decides the case, which court shall consist of those who would have tried the culprit for murder if the man had died of the wound he received. If in like manner, deliberately, a son wound his parents or a slave his master, death shall be the penalty;  and if a brother wound in like manner a brother or sister, or a sister wound a brother or sister,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="877c"/> and be convicted of wounding deliberately, death shall be the penalty.  A wife that has wounded her husband, or a husband his wife, with intent to kill, shall be exiled for life:  if they have sons or daughters who are still children, the guardians shall administer their property, and shall take charge of the children as orphans;  but if they be already grown men, the offspring shall be compelled to support their exiled parent, and they shall possess his property.  If any person overtaken by such a disaster be childless, the kinsfolk

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="878"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="878a"/> as we said just now, must meet together and in consultation with the Law-wardens consider what family there is in the State which is pre-eminent for goodness, and prosperous withal, and containing several children.  Then from the family selected they shall adopt one child on behalf of the dead man’s father and ancestors to be a son of theirs, and they shall name him after one of them, for the sake of the omen—with a prayer that in this wise he may prove to them a begetter of offspring, a hearth-master and a minister in holy and sacred things, and be blest with happier fortune than his (official) father;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="878b"/> him they shall thus establish legally as lot-holder, and the offender they shall suffer to be nameless and childless and portionless, whenever such calamities overtake him. It is not the fact, as it would seem, that in the case of all objects boundary is contiguous with boundary;  but where there is a neutral strip, which lies between the two boundaries, impinging on each, it will be midway between both.  And that is precisely the description we gave<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 867a">Plat. Laws 867a</bibl>.</note> of the passionate action as one which lies midway between involuntary and voluntary actions.  So let the law stand thus respecting wounding committed in anger:—If a person be convicted, in the first place he shall pay
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="878c"/> double the damage, in case the wound prove to be curable, but four times the damage in case of incurable wounds.  And if the wound be curable, but cause great shame and disgrace to the wounded party, the culprit shall pay three times the damage.  And if ever a person, in wounding anyone, do damage to the State as well as to the victim, by rendering him incapable of helping his country against its enemies, such a person, in addition to the rest of the damages, shall pay also for the damage done to the State:  in addition to his own military service, he shall do service also as a substitute for the incapacitated man,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="878d"/> and carry out his military duties in his place, or, if he fails to do so, he shall by law be liable to prosecution for shirking military service, at the hands of anyone who pleases.  The due proportion of the damage payable—whether two, three, or four times the actual amount—shall be fixed by the judges who have voted on the case.  If a kinsman wound a kinsman in the same way as the person just mentioned, the members of his tribe and kin, both males and females, as far as cousins’ children on both the male and female side, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="878e"/> shall meet together and, after coming to a decision, shall hand over the case to the natural parents for assessment of the damage;  and if the assessment be disputed, the kindred on the male side shall be authorized to make a binding assessment;  and if they prove unable to do so, they shall refer the matter finally to the Law-wardens.</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="879"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="879a"/> not even if he be of the full age stated in the law.  If a slave wound a free man in rage, his owner shall hand over the slave to the wounded man to be dealt with just as he pleases;  and if he do not hand over the slave, he shall himself make good the damage to the full.  And if any man alleges that the deed was a trick concocted by the slave in collusion with the wounded party, he shall dispute the case:  if he fail to win it, he shall pay three times the damage, but if he win, he shall hold liable for kidnapping the man who contrived the trick in collusion with the slave.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="879b"/> Whoever wounds another involuntarily shall pay a single equivalent for the damage (since no lawgiver is able to control fortune), and the judges shall be those designated to act in cases of the wounding of parents by children;  and they shall assess the due proportion of damage payable. All the cases we have now dealt with are of suffering due to violence, and the whole class of cases of <q type="emph">outrage</q> involve violence.  Regarding such cases, the view that should be held by everyone,—man, woman and child,—is this, that the older is greatly more revered than the younger, both among the gods and among those men who propose to keep safe and happy.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="879c"/> An outrage perpetrated by a younger against an older person is a shameful thing to see happening in a State, and a thing hateful to God:  when a young man is beaten by an old man, it is meet that, in every case, he should quietly endure his anger, and thus store up honor for the time of his own old age.  Therefore let the law stand thus:—Everyone shall reverence his elder both by deed and word;  whosoever, man or woman, exceeds himself in age by twenty years he shall regard as a father or a mother, and he shall keep his hands off that person, and he shall ever refrain himself, for the sake of the gods of birth, from all the generation
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="879d"/> of those who are potentially his own bearers and begetters.  So likewise he shall keep his hands off a Stranger, be he long resident or newly arrived;  neither as aggressor nor in self-defence shall he venture at all to chastise such an one with blows.  If he deems that a Stranger has shown outrageous audacity in beating him and needs correction, he shall seize the man and take him before the bench of the city-stewards (but refrain from beating him), so that he may flee the thought of
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="879e"/> ever daring to strike a native.  And the city-stewards shall take over the Stranger and examine him—with due respect for the God of Strangers;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For the respect due to Strangers as a religious duty, cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Any man who lends a ready ear to such exhortations will prove easy to manage;  but he that is intractable and pays no regard to the prelude will hearken readily

Further, he that dares to strike the older man in the way described shall be liable also to an action for outrage, and if he be convicted,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="880c"/> he shall be imprisoned for not less than a year;  and if the judges assess the penalty at a longer period, the period so assessed shall be binding on him.  And if a Stranger or a resident alien beat a man older than himself by twenty or more years, the same law regarding help from bystanders shall be equally binding;  and he that is cast in a suit of this kind, if he be a non-resident Stranger, shall be imprisoned for two years and fulfil this sentence;  and he that is a resident alien and disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three years, unless the court assess his penalty at a longer period.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> First, there is the evidence of the earth, the sun, the stars, and all the universe, and the beautiful ordering of the seasons, marked out by years and months;  and then there is the further fact that all Greeks and barbarians believe in the existence of gods.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> My dear sir, these bad men cause me alarm—for I will never call it <q type="emph">awe</q>—lest haply they scoff at us.  For the cause of the corruption in their case is one you are not aware of;  since you imagine that it is solely by their incontinence in regard to pleasures and desires
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="886b"/> that their souls are impelled to that impious life of theirs.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What other cause can there be, Stranger, besides this?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One which you, who live elsewhere, could hardly have any knowledge of or notice at all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is this cause you are now speaking of?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> A very grievous unwisdom which is reputed to be the height of wisdom.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> have accounts<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">By Hesiod, Pherecydes, etc.</note> preserved in writing (though, I am told, such do not exist in your country, owing to the excellence of your polity),
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="886c"/> some of them being in a kind of meter, others without meter, telling about the gods:  the oldest of these accounts relate how the first substance of Heaven and all else came into being, and shortly after the beginning they go on to give a detailed theogony, and to tell how, after they were born, the gods associated with one another.  These accounts, whether good or bad for the hearers in other respects, it is hard for us to censure because of their antiquity;  but as regards the tendance and respect due to parents, I certainly would never praise them or say that they are either helpful or wholly true accounts.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="886d"/> Such ancient accounts, however, we may pass over and dismiss:  let them be told in the way best pleasing to the gods.  It is rather the novel views of our modern scientists<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Materialists such as Democritus.</note> that we must hold responsible as the cause of mischief.  For the result of the arguments of such people is this,—that when you and I try to prove the existence of the gods by pointing to these very objects—sun, moon, stars, and earth—as instances of deity and divinity, people who have been converted by these scientists will assert that these things are simply earth and stone,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="886e"/> incapable of paying any heed to human affairs, and that these beliefs of ours are speciously tricked out with arguments to make them plausible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> The assertion you mention, Stranger, is indeed a dangerous one, even if it stood alone;  but now that such assertions are legion, the danger is still greater.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="887">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What then?  What shall we say?  What must we do?  Are we to make our defence as it were before a court of impious men, where someone had accused us
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="887"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="887a"/> of doing something dreadful by assuming in our legislation the existence of gods?  Or shall we rather dismiss the whole subject and revert again to our laws, lest our prelude prove actually more lengthy than the laws?  For indeed our discourse would be extended in no small degree if we were to furnish those men who desire to be impious with an adequate demonstration by means of argument concerning those subjects which ought, as they claimed, to be discussed, and so to convert them to fear of the gods, and then finally, when we had caused them to shrink from irreligion, to proceed to enact the appropriate laws.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="887b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Still, Stranger, we have frequently (considering the shortness of the time) made<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 701c">Plat. Laws 701c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 701d">Plat. Laws 701d</bibl>;  <bibl n="Plat. Laws 858a">Plat. Laws 858a ff</bibl>.:  all this discussion is supposed to have taken place on one and the same day,—hence the ref. to <q type="mentioned">shortness of time.</q></note> the very statement,—that we have no need on the present occasion to prefer brevity of speech to lengthiness (for, as the saying goes, <q type="emph">no one is chasing on our heels</q>);  and to show ourselves choosing the briefest in preference to the best would be mean and ridiculous.  And it is of the highest importance that our arguments, showing that the gods exist and that they are good and honor justice more than do men, should by all means possess some degree of persuasiveness;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="887c"/> for such a prelude is the best we could have in defence, as one may say, of all our laws.  So without any repugnance or undue haste, and with all the capacity we have for endowing such arguments with persuasiveness, let us expound them as fully as we can, and without any reservation.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This speech of yours seems to me to call for a prefatory prayer, seeing that you are so eager and ready;  nor is it possible any longer to defer our statement.  Come, then;  how is one to argue on behalf of the existence of the gods without passion?  For we needs must be vexed and indignant with the men who have been, and now are,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="887d"/> responsible for laying on us this burden of argument, through their disbelief in those stories which they used to hear, while infants and sucklings, from the lips of their nurses and mothers—stories chanted to them, as it were, in lullabies, whether in jest or in earnest;  and the same stories they heard repeated also in prayers at sacrifices, and they saw spectacles which illustrated them, of the kind which the young delight to see and hear when performed at sacrifices;  and their own parents they saw showing the utmost zeal on behalf of themselves and their children in addressing the gods in prayers and supplications, as though they most certainly existed;  and at the rising and setting of the sun and moon
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="887e"/> they heard and saw the prostrations and devotions of all the Greeks and barbarians, under all conditions of adversity and prosperity, directed to these luminaries, not as though they were not gods, but as though they most certainly were gods beyond the shadow of a doubt—</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="888">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> all this evidence is contemned by these people, and that for no sufficient reason, as everyone endowed with a grain of sense would affirm;  and so they are now forcing us to enter on our present argument.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="888"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="888a"/> How, I ask, can one possibly use mild terms in admonishing such men, and at the same time teach them, to begin with, that the gods do exist?  Yet one must bravely attempt the task;  for it would never do for both parties to be enraged at once,—the one owing to greed for pleasure, the other with indignation at men like them. So let our prefatory address to the men thus corrupted in mind be dispassionate in tone, and, quenching our passion, let us speak mildly, as though we were conversing with one particular person of the kind described, in the following terms:  <q type="spoken">My child, you are still young, and time as it advances
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="888b"/> will cause you to reverse many of the opinions you now hold:  so wait till then before pronouncing judgment on matters of most grave importance;  and of these the gravest of all—though at present you regard it as naught—is the question of holding a right view about the gods and so living well, or the opposite.  Now in the first place, I should be saying what is irrefutably true if I pointed out to you this signal fact, that neither you by yourself nor yet your friends are the first and foremost to adopt this opinion about the gods;  rather is it true that people who suffer from this disease are always springing up, in greater or less numbers.  But I, who have met with many of these people, would declare this to you, that not a single man
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="888c"/> who from his youth has adopted this opinion, that the gods have no existence, has ever yet continued till old age constant in the same view;  but the other two false notions about the gods do remain—not, indeed, with many, but still with some,—the notion, namely, that the gods exist, but pay no heed to human affairs, and the other notion that they do pay heed, but are easily won over by prayers and offerings.  For a doctrine about them that is to prove the truest you can possibly form you will, if you take my advice, wait, considering the while whether the truth stands thus or otherwise,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="888d"/> and making enquiries not only from all other men, but especially from the lawgiver;  and in the meantime do not dare to be guilty of any impiety in respect of the gods.  For it must be the endeavor of him who is legislating for you both now and hereafter to instruct you in the truth of these matters.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Our statement thus far, Stranger, is most excellent.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very true, O Megillus and Clinias;  but we have plunged unawares into a wondrous argument.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it you mean?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="888e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That which most people account to be the most scientific of all arguments.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Explain more clearly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is stated by some that all things which are coming into existence, or have or will come into existence, do so partly by nature, partly by art, and partly owing to chance.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Is it not a right statement?</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="889">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is likely, to be sure, that what men of science say is true.  Anyhow, let us follow them up, and consider
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="889"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="889a"/> what it is that the people in their camp really intend.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By all means let us do so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is evident, they assert, that the greatest and most beautiful things are the work of nature and of chance, and the lesser things that of art,—for art receives from nature the great and primary products as existing, and itself molds and shapes all the smaller ones, which we commonly call <q type="emph">artificial.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="889b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> I will explain it more clearly.  Fire and water and earth and air, they say, all exist by nature and chance, and none of them by art;  and by means of these, which are wholly inanimate, the bodies which come next—those, namely, of the earth, sun, moon and stars—have been brought into existence.  It is by chance all these elements move, by the interplay of their respective forces, and according as they meet together and combine fittingly,—hot with cold, dry with moist,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="889c"/> soft with hard, and all such necessary mixtures as result from the chance combination of these opposites,—in this way and by those means they have brought into being the whole Heaven and all that is in the Heaven, and all animals, too, and plants—after that all the seasons had arisen from these elements;  and all this, as they assert, not owing to reason, nor to any god or art, but owing, as we have said, to nature and chance.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This is a summary of the doctrines of the Atomists (Leucippus and Democritus) who denied the creative agency of Reason.  Similar views were taught, later, by Epicurus and Lucretius.</note>  As a later product of these, art comes later;  and it, being mortal itself and of mortal birth, begets later playthings
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="889d"/> which share but little in truth, being images of a sort akin to the arts themselves—images such as painting begets, and music, and the arts which accompany these.  Those arts which really produce something serious are such as share their effect with nature,—like medicine, agriculture, and gymnastic.  Politics too, as they say, shares to a small extent in nature, but mostly in art;  and in like manner all legislation which is
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="889e"/> based on untrue assumptions is due, not to nature, but to art.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean?</said></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="890">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The first statement, my dear sir, which these people make about the gods is that they exist by art and not by nature,—by certain legal conventions<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A view ascribed to Critias.</note> which differ from place to place, according as each tribe agreed when forming their laws.  They assert, moreover, that there is one class of things beautiful by nature, and another class beautiful by convention<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1094b">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1094 b 14 ff</bibl>.</note>;  while as to things just, they do not exist at all by nature, but men are constantly in dispute about them and continually altering them, and whatever alteration they make at any time <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="890"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="890a"/> is at that time authoritative, though it owes its existence to art and the laws, and not in any way to nature.  All these, my friends, are views which young people imbibe from men of science, both prose-writers and poets, who maintain that the height of justice is to succeed by force;  whence it comes that the young people are afflicted with a plague of impiety, as though the gods were not such as the law commands us to conceive them;  and, because of this, factions also arise, when these teachers attract them towards the life that is right <q type="emph">according to nature,</q> which consists in being master over the rest in reality, instead of being a slave to others according to legal convention.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This antithesis between <gloss>Nature</gloss> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσις</foreign>) and <gloss>Convention</gloss> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) was a familiar one in ethical and political discussion from the time of the Sophists.  The supremacy of <q type="emph">Nature,</q> as an ethical principle, was maintained (it is said) by Hippias and Prodicus;  that of <q type="emph">Convention,</q> by Protagoras and Gorgias:  Plato goes behind both to the higher principle of Reason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>), cp.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What a horrible statement you have described, Stranger!  And what widespread corruption of the young in private families as well as publicly in the States!</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That is indeed true, Clinias.  What, then, do you think the lawgiver ought to do, seeing that these people have been armed in this way for a long time past?  Should he merely stand up in the city and threaten all the people that unless they affirm that the gods exist and conceive them in their minds to be such as the law maintains<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 634d">Plat. Laws 634d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 634e">Plat. Laws 634e</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Laws 859b">Plat. Laws 859b</bibl>, al.</note> and so likewise with regard to the beautiful and the just and all the greatest things,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="890c"/> as many as relate to virtue and vice, that they must regard and perform these in the way prescribed by the lawgiver in his writings;  and that whosoever fails to show himself obedient to the laws must either be put to death or else be punished, in one case by stripes and imprisonment, in another by degradation, in others by poverty and exile?  But as to persuasion, should the lawgiver, while enacting the people’s laws, refuse to blend any persuasion with his statements, and thus tame them so far as possible?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="890d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly not, Stranger;  on the contrary, if persuasion can be applied in such matters in even the smallest degree, no lawgiver who is of the slightest account must ever grow weary, but must (as they say) <q type="spoken">leave no stone unturned</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Literally, <gloss>utter every voice</gloss> (leave nothing unsaid).</note> to reinforce the ancient saying that gods exist, and all else that you recounted just now;  and law itself he must also defend and art, as things which exist by nature or by a cause not inferior to nature, since according to right reason they are the offspring of mind, even as you are now, as I think, asserting;  and I agree with you.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What now, my most ardent Clinias?  Are not statements thus made to the masses
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="890e"/> difficult for us to keep up with in argument, and do they not also involve us in arguments portentously long?</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="891">
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well now, Stranger, if we had patience with ourselves when we discoursed at such length on the subjects of drinking and music,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In Books I and II.</note> shall we not exercise patience in dealing with the gods and similar subjects?  Moreover, such a discourse is of the greatest help for intelligent legislation,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="891"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="891a"/> since legal ordinances when put in writing remain wholly unchanged, as though ready to submit to examination for all time, so that one need have no fear even if they are hard to listen to at first, seeing that even the veriest dullard can come back frequently to examine them, nor yet if they are lengthy, provided that they are beneficial.  Consequently, in my opinion, it could not possibly be either reasonable or pious for any man to refrain from lending his aid to such arguments to the best of his power.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> What Clinias says, Stranger, is, I think, most excellent.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="891b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Most certainly it is, Megillus;  and we must do as he says.  For if the assertions mentioned had not been sown broadcast well-nigh over the whole world of men, there would have been no need of counter-arguments to defend the existence of the gods;  but as it is, they are necessary.  For when the greatest laws are being destroyed by wicked men, who is more bound to come to their rescue than the lawgiver?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Megillus"><label>Meg.</label> No one.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Come now, Clinias, do you also answer me again,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="891c"/> for you too must take a hand in the argument:  it appears that the person who makes these statements holds fire, water, earth and air to be the first of all things, and that it is precisely to these things that he gives the name of <q type="emph">nature,</q> while soul he asserts to be a later product therefrom.  Probably, indeed, he does not merely <q type="emph">appear</q> to do this, but actually makes it clear to us in his account.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Can it be then, in Heaven’s name, that now we have discovered, as it were, a very fountain-head of irrational opinion in all the men who have ever yet handled physical investigations?  Consider, and examine each statement.  For it is a matter
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="891d"/> of no small importance if it can be shown that those who handle impious arguments, and lead others after them, employ their arguments not only ill, but erroneously.  And this seems to me to be the state of affairs.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well said;  but try to explain wherein the error lies.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We shall probably have to handle rather an unusual argument.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We must not shrink, Stranger.  You think, I perceive, that we shall be traversing alien ground, outside legislation, if we handle such arguments.  But if there is no other way in which it is possible for us to speak in concert with the truth, as now legally declared,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="891e"/> except this way, then in this way, my good sir, we must speak.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It appears, then, that I may at once proceed with an argument that is somewhat unusual;  it is this.  That which is the first cause of becoming and perishing in all things, this is declared by the arguments which have produced the soul of the impious to be not first, but generated later, and that which is the later to be the earlier;  and because of this they have fallen into error regarding the real nature of divine existence.</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As regards the soul, my comrade, nearly all men appear to be ignorant of its real nature and its potency, and ignorant not only of other facts about it, but of its origin especially,—how that it is one of the first existences, and prior to all bodies, and that it more than anything else is what governs all the changes and modifications of bodies.  And if this is really the state of the case, must not things which are akin to soul be necessarily prior in origin to things which belong to body, seeing that soul

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Necessarily.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then opinion and reflection and thought and art and law will be prior to things hard and soft and heavy and light;  and further, the works and actions that are great and primary will be those of art, while those that are natural, and nature itself which they wrongly call by this name—will be secondary, and will derive their origin from art and reason.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="892c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How are they wrong?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> By <q type="emph">nature</q> they intend to indicate production of things primary;  but if soul shall be shown to have been produced first (not fire or air), but soul first and foremost,—it would most truly be described as a superlatively <q type="emph">natural</q> existence.  Such is the state of the case, provided that one can prove that soul is older than body, but not otherwise.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we then, in the next place, address ourselves to the task of proving this?

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us guard against a wholly deceitful argument, lest haply it seduce us who are old with its specious youthfulness, and then elude us and make us a laughing-stock, and so we get the reputation of missing even little things while aiming at big things.  Consider then.  Suppose that we three had to cross a river that was in violent flood, and that I, being the youngest of the party and having often had experience of currents, were to suggest that the proper course
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="892e"/> is for me to make an attempt first by myself—leaving you two in safety—to see whether it is possible for you older men also to cross, or how the matter stands, and then, if the river proved to be clearly fordable, I were to call you, and, by my experience, help you across, while if it proved impassable for such as you, in that case the risk should be wholly mine,—such a suggestion on my part would have sounded reasonable.  So too in the present instance;  the argument now in front of us is too violent, and probably impassable, for such strength as you possess; </said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Explain more clearly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It was undertaken, was it not, for the sake of soul?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> As one of the two let us count that motion which is always able to move other things, but unable to move itself;  and that motion which always is able to move both itself and other things,—by way of combination and separation, of increase and decrease, of generation and corruption,—let us count as another separate unit
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="894c"/> in the total number of motions.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Be it so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus we shall reckon as ninth on the list that motion which always moves another object and is moved by another;  while that motion which moves both itself and another, and which is harmoniously adapted to all forms of action and passion, and is termed the real change and motion of all that really exists,—it, I presume, we shall call the tenth.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="894d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Of our total of ten motions, which shall we most correctly adjudge to be the most powerful of all and excelling in effectiveness?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We are bound to affirm that the motion which is able to move itself excels infinitely, and that all the rest come after it.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well said.  Must we, then, alter one or two of the wrong statements we have now made?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Which do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Our statement about the tenth seems wrong.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Logically it is first in point of origin and power;  and the next one is second to it,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="894e"/> although we absurdly called it ninth a moment ago.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> This:  when we find one thing changing another, and this in turn another, and so on,—of these things shall we ever find one that is the prime cause of change?  How will a thing that is moved by another ever be itself the first of the things that cause change?  It is impossible.</said></p></div>  
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="895">
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> But when a thing that has moved itself changes another thing, and that other a third, and the motion thus spreads progressively through thousands upon thousands of things,
    
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="895"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="895a"/> will the primary source of all their motions be anything else than the movement of that which has moved itself?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Excellently put, and we must assent to your argument.</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Further, let us question and answer ourselves thus:—Supposing that the Whole of things were to unite and stand still,—as most of these thinkers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">E.g.  Anaxagoras, who taught, originally, <q type="emph">all things were together (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοῦ</foreign>);</q>  and the Eleatic School (Parmenides, etc.) asserted that the Real World (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὄν</foreign>) is One and motionless;  cp. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 180e">Plat. Theaet. 180e</bibl>.</note> venture to maintain,—which of the motions mentioned would necessarily arise in it first?  That motion, of course, which is self-moving;  for it will never be shifted beforehand by another thing,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="895b"/> since no shifting force exists in things beforehand.  Therefore we shall assert that inasmuch as the self-moving motion is the starting-point of all motions and the first to arise in things at rest and to exist in things in motion, it is of necessity the most ancient and potent change of all, while the motion which is altered by another thing and itself moves others comes second.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now that we have come to this point in our discourse,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="895c"/> here is a question we may answer.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If we should see that this motion had arisen in a thing of earth or water or fire, whether separate or in combination, what condition should we say exists in such a thing?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What you ask me is, whether we are to speak of a thing as <q type="emph">alive</q> when it moves itself?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is alive, to be sure.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, when we see soul in things, must we not equally agree that they are alive?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We must.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="895d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now stop a moment, in Heaven’s name!  Would you not desire to observe three points about every object?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One point is the substance, one the definition of the substance, and one the name;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <title>Epistles</title> 7, 342 A, B.</note>  and, moreover, about everything that exists there are two questions to be asked.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How two?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> At one time each of us, propounding the name by itself, demands the definition;  at another, propounding the definition by itself, he demands the name.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Is it something of this kind we mean now to convey?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Of what kind?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="895e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We have instances of a thing divisible into two halves, both in arithmetic and elsewhere;  in arithmetic the name of this is <q type="emph">the even,</q> and the definition is <q type="emph">a number divisible into two equal parts.</q></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes, that is what I mean.  So in either case it is the same object, is it not, which we describe, whether, when asked for the definition, we reply by giving the name, or, when asked for the name, we give the definition,—describing one and the same object by the name <q type="emph">even,</q> and by the definition <q type="emph">a number divisible into two halves</q>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="896">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What is the definition of that object which has for its name <q type="emph">soul</q>?
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="896"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="896a"/> Can we give it any other definition than that stated just now—<q type="emph">the motion able to move itself</q>?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Do you assert that <q type="emph">self-movement</q> is the definition of that very same substance which has <q type="emph">soul</q> as the name we universally apply to it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That is what I assert.  And if this be really so, do we still complain that it has not been sufficiently proved that soul is identical with the prime origin and motion of what is, has been, and shall be, and of all
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="896b"/> that is opposite to these, seeing that it has been plainly shown to be the cause of all change and motion in all things?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We make no such complaint;  on the contrary, it has been proved most sufficiently that soul is of all things the oldest, since it is the first principle of motion.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then is not that motion which, when it arises in one object, is caused by another, and which never supplies self-motion to anything, second in order—or indeed as far down the list as one cares to put it,—it being the change of a really soulless body?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> True.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Truly and finally, then, it would be a most veracious and complete statement
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="896c"/> to say that we find soul to be prior to body, and body secondary and posterior, soul governing and body being governed according to the ordinance of nature.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes, most veracious.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We recollect, of course, that we previously agreed<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 892a">Plat. Laws 892a</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 892b">Plat. Laws 892b</bibl>.</note> that if soul could be shown to be older than body, then the things of soul also will be older than those of body.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly we do.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="896d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Moods and dispositions and wishes and calculations and true opinions and considerations and memories will be prior to bodily length, breadth, depth and strength, if soul is prior to body.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Necessarily.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Must we then necessarily agree, in the next place, that soul is the cause of things good and bad, fair and foul, just and unjust, and all the opposites, if we are to assume it to be the cause of all things?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course we must.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And as soul thus controls and indwells in all things
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="896e"/> everywhere that are moved, must we not necessarily affirm that it controls Heaven also?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One soul, is it, or several?  I will answer for you—<q type="emph">several.</q>  Anyhow, let us assume not less than two—the beneficent soul and that which is capable of effecting results of the opposite kind.</said></p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="897">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very well, then.  Soul drives all things in Heaven and earth and sea by its own motions,

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="897b"/> hardness and softness, whiteness and blackness, bitterness and sweetness, and all those qualities which soul employs, both when it governs all things rightly and happily as a true goddess, in conjunction with reason, and when, in converse with unreason, it produces results which are in all respects the opposite.  Shall we postulate that this is so, or do we still suspect that it may possibly be otherwise?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Which kind of soul, then, shall we say is in control of Heaven and earth and the whole circle?  That which is wise and full of goodness, or that which

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If, my good sir, we are to assert that the whole course and motion of Heaven and of all it contains have a motion like to the motion and revolution and reckonings of reason,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the uniform revolution of a sphere in the same spot and on its own axis:  cp. <bibl n="Plat.

Tim. 34b ff</bibl>;  <bibl>Plat. 90c, d</bibl>.</note> and proceed in a kindred manner, then clearly we must assert that the best soul regulates the whole cosmos and drives it on its course, which is of the kind described.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You are right.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="897d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But the bad soul, if it proceeds in a mad and disorderly way.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That also is right.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then what is the nature of the motion of reason?  Here, my friends, we come to a question that is difficult to answer wisely;  consequently, it is fitting that you should now call me in to assist you with the answer.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very good.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us take as an image that one of the ten motions which reason resembles;  reminding ourselves of which<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> You will probably speak admirably.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do we still recollect thus much about the things then described, that we assumed that, of the total, some were in motion, others at rest?</said></p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="898">

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And that, of these two motions, the motion which moves in one place must necessarily move always round some center, being a copy of the turned wheels;  and that this has the nearest possible kinship and similarity to the revolution of reason?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If we described them both as moving regularly and uniformly in the same spot, round the same things and in relation to the same things, according to one rule and system—reason, namely, and the motion that spins in one place
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="898b"/>(likened to the spinning of a turned globe),—we should never be in danger of being deemed unskillful in the construction of fair images by speech.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> On the other hand, will not the motion that is never uniform or regular or in the same place or around or in relation to the same things, not moving in one spot nor in any order
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="898c"/> or system or rule—will not this motion be akin to absolute unreason?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It will, in very truth.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So now there is no longer any difficulty in stating expressly that, inasmuch as soul is what we find driving everything round, we must affirm that this circumference of Heaven is of necessity driven round under the care and ordering of either the best soul or its opposite.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> But, Stranger, judging by what has now been said, it is actually impious to make any other assertion than that these things are driven round by one or more souls endowed with all goodness.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You have attended to our argument admirably, Clinias.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="898d"/> Now attend to this further point.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is that?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If soul drives round the sum total of sun, moon and all other stars, does it not also drive each single one of them?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then let us construct an argument about one of these stars which will evidently apply equally to them all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> About which one?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The sun’s body is seen by everyone, its soul by no one.  And the same is true of the soul of any other body, whether alive or dead, of living beings.  There is, however, a strong suspicion that this class of object, which is wholly imperceptible to sense,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="898e"/> has grown round all the senses of the body,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. envelopes the body and its sense-organs (like circum-ambient air).</note> and is an object of reason alone.  Therefore by reason and rational thought let us grasp this fact about it,—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What fact?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> If soul drives round the sun, we shall be tolerably sure to be right in saying that it does one of three things.</said></p>
        <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What things?</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="900b"/> to repudiate the gods, you have come to your present morbid state of mind, in which you opine that the gods exist, but scorn and neglect human affairs.  In order, therefore, that your present opinion may not grow to a greater height of morbid impiety, but that we may succeed in repelling the onset of its pollution (if haply we are able) by argument, let us endeavor to attach our next argument to that which we set forth in full to him who utterly disbelieves gods, and thereby to employ the latter as well.</q>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> When a person whose duty it is especially to act and care for
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="901b"/> some object has a mind that cares for great things, but neglects small things, on what principle could we praise such a person without the utmost impropriety?  Let us consider the matter in this way:  the action of him who acts thus, be he god or man, takes one of two forms, does it not?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What forms?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Either because he thinks that neglect of the small things makes no difference to the whole,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="901c"/> or else, owing to laziness and indolence, he neglects them, though he thinks they do make a difference.  Or is there any other way in which neglect occurs?  For when it is impossible to care for all things, it will not in that case be neglect of great things or small when a person—be he god or common man—fails to care for things which he lacks the power and capacity to care for.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now to us three let these two men make answer, of whom both agree that gods exist, but the one asserts that they can be bribed, and the other that they neglect the small.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="901d"/> First, you both assert that the gods know and hear and see all things,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 641e">Plat.

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is what we assert.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Here, and in what follows, Clinias is answering on behalf of the two misbelievers.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And further, that they can do all that can be done by mortal or immortal?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They will, of course, admit that this also is the case.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="901e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And it is undeniable that all five of us agreed that the gods are good, yea, exceeding good.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Being, then, such as we agree, is it not impossible to allow that they do anything at all in a lazy and indolent way?  For certainly amongst us mortals idleness is the child of cowardice, and laziness of idleness and indolence.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> None, then, of the gods is neglectful owing to idleness and laziness, seeing that none has any part in cowardice.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> There is none.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Shall we then assume, my worthy and excellent sir, that you assert that the gods are ignorant, and that it is through ignorance that they are neglectful when they ought to be showing care,—or that they know indeed what is needful, yet act as the worst of men are said to do, who, though they know that other things are better to do than what they are doing, yet do them not,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="902b"/> owing to their being somehow defeated by pleasures or pains?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Impossible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do not human affairs share in animate nature, and is not man himself, too, the most god-fearing of all living creatures?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is certainly probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> We affirm that all mortal creatures are possessions of the gods, to whom belongs also the whole heaven.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> That being so, it matters not whether a man says that these things are small or great
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="902c"/> in the eyes of the gods;  for in neither case would it behove those who are our owners to be neglectful, seeing that they are most careful and most good.  For let us notice this further fact—</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In regard to perception and power,—are not these two naturally opposed in respect of ease and difficulty?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is more difficult to see and hear small things than great;  but everyone finds it more easy to move, control and care for things small and few than their opposites.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="902d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Much more.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> When a physician is charged with the curing of a whole body, if, while he is willing and able to care for the large parts, he neglects the small parts and members, will he ever find the whole in good condition?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> No more will pilots or generals or house-managers, nor yet statesmen or any other such persons, find that the many and great thrive apart from the few
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="902e"/> and small;  for even masons say that big stones are not well laid without little stones.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> They cannot be.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="903">
        <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us never suppose that God is inferior to mortal craftsmen who, the better they are, the more accurately and perfectly do they execute their proper tasks, small and great, by one single art,—or that God, who is most wise, and both willing and able to care, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="903"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="903a"/> cares not at all for the small things which are the easier to care for—like one who shirks the labor because he is idle and cowardly,—but only for the great.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> By no means let us accept such an opinion of the gods, Stranger:  that would be to adopt a view that is neither pious nor true at all.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And now, as I think, we have argued quite sufficiently with him who loves to censure the gods for neglect.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And it was by forcing him by our arguments to acknowledge
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="903b"/> that what he says is wrong.  But still he needs also, as it seems to me, some words of counsel to act as a charm upon him.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What kind of words, my good sir?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Let us persuade the young man by our discourse that all things are ordered systematically by Him who cares for the World—all with a view to the preservation and excellence of the Whole, whereof also each part, so far as it can, does and suffers what is proper to it.  To each of these parts, down to the smallest fraction, rulers of their action and passion are appointed to bring about fulfillment even to the uttermost
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="903c"/> fraction;  whereof thy portion also, O perverse man, is one, and tends therefore always in its striving towards the All, tiny though it be.  But thou failest to perceive that all partial generation is for the sake of the Whole, in order that for the life of the World-all blissful existence may be secured,—it not being generated for thy sake, but thou for its sake.  For every physician and every trained craftsman works always for the sake of a Whole, and strives after what is best in general, and he produces a part for the sake of a whole, and not a whole for the sake of a part;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="903d"/> but thou art vexed, because thou knowest not how what is best in thy case for the All turns out best for thyself also, in accordance with the power of your common origin.  And inasmuch as soul, being conjoined now with one body, now with another, is always undergoing all kinds of changes either of itself or owing to another soul, there is left for the draughts-player no further task,—save only to shift the character that grows better to a superior place, and the worse to a worse, according to what best suits each of them, so that to each may be allotted its appropriate destiny.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="903e"/></said></p>
        <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way do you mean?</said></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="904">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The way I am describing is, I believe, that in which supervision of all things is most easy for the gods.  For if one were to shape all things, without a constant view to the Whole, by transforming them (as, for instance, fire into water), instead of merely converting one into many or many into one,
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="904"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="904a"/> then when things had shared in a first, or second, or even third generation,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This seems to refer to three stages of the soul’s incarnation;  see p. 367, n. 2.</note> they would be countless in number in such a system of transformations;  but as things are, the task before the Supervisor of the All is wondrous easy.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Thus:—Since our King saw that all actions involve soul, and contain much good and much evil, and that body and soul are, when generated, indestructible but not eternal,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="904b"/> there would never have been generation of living creatures), and since He perceived that all soul that is good naturally tends always to benefit, but the bad to injure,—observing all this, He designed a location for each of the parts, wherein it might secure the victory of goodness in the Whole and the defeat of evil most completely, easily, and well.  For this purpose He has designed the rule which prescribes what kind of character should be set to dwell in what kind of position and in what regions;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 42b">Plat. Tim 42b ff</bibl>. where it is said that the soul of the good man returns at death to its native star, while that of the bad takes the form of a woman in its second, and that of a beast in its third incarnation.</note>  but the causes of the generation of any special kind he left to the wills

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is certainly probable.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> All things that share in soul change, since they possess within themselves the cause of change, and in changing they move according to the law and order of destiny;  the smaller the change of character, the less is the movement over surface in space, but when the change is great and towards great iniquity,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="904d"/> then they move towards the deep and the so-called lower regions, regarding which—under the names of Hades and the like—men are haunted by most fearful imaginings, both when alive and when disparted from their bodies.  And whenever the soul gets a specially large share of either virtue or vice, owing to the force of its own will and the influence of its intercourse growing strong, then, if it is in union with divine virtue, it becomes thereby eminently virtuous, and moves to an eminent region, being transported by a holy road to another and a better region;
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="904e"/> whereas, if the opposite is the case, it changes to the opposite the location of its life’s abode.</said></p></div>

And the same rule, let me tell thee, will apply also to those whom thou sawest growing to great estate from small after doing acts of impiety or other such evil,—concerning whom thou didst deem that they had risen from misery to happiness, and didst imagine, therefore, that in their actions, as in mirrors, thou didst behold the entire neglect of the gods, not knowing of their joint contribution and

For while those who, though they utterly disbelieve in the existence of the gods, possess by nature a just character, both hate the evil and, because of their dislike of injustice, are incapable of being induced to commit unjust actions, and flee from unjust men
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="908c"/> and love the just, on the other hand, those who, besides holding that the world is empty of gods, are afflicted by incontinence in respect of pleasures and pains, and possess also powerful memories and sharp wits—though both these classes share alike in the disease of atheism, yet in respect of the amount of ruin they bring on other people, the latter class would work more and the former less of evil.  For whereas the one class will be quite frank in its language about the gods and about sacrifices and oaths,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="908d"/> and by ridiculing other people will probably convert others to its views, unless it meets with punishment, the other class, while holding the same opinions as the former, yet being specially <q type="emph">gifted by nature</q> and being full of craft and guile, is the class out of which are manufactured many diviners and experts in all manner of jugglery;  and from it, too, there spring sometimes tyrants and demagogues and generals, and those who plot by means of peculiar mystic rites of their own, and the devices of those who are called <q type="soCalled">sophists.</q>  Of these there may be many kinds;

For all these reasons their action should be governed by the law now stated;  and a further reason is this—to prevent impious men
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="910b"/> from acting fraudulently in regard to these matters also, by setting up shrines and altars in private houses, thinking to propitiate the gods privily by sacrifices and vows, and thus increasing infinitely their own iniquity, whereby they make both themselves and those better men who allow them guilty in the eyes of the gods, so that the whole State reaps the consequences of their impiety in some degree—and deserves to reap them.  The lawgiver himself, however, will not be blamed by the god;  for this shall be the law laid down:—Shrines of the gods no one must possess
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="910c"/> in a private house;  and if anyone is proved to possess and worship at any shrine other than the public shrines—be the possessor man or woman,—and if he is guilty of no serious act of impiety, he that notices the fact shall inform the Law-wardens, and they shall give orders for the private shrines to be removed to the public temples, and if the owner disobeys the order, they shall punish him until he removes them.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="910d"/> And if anyone be proved to have committed an impious act, such as is not the venial offence of children, but the serious irreligion of grown men, whether by setting up a shrine on private ground, or on public ground, by doing sacrifice to any gods whatsoever, for sacrificing in a state of impurity he shall be punished with death.  And the Law-wardens shall judge what is a childish or venial offence and what not, and then shall bring the offenders before the court, and shall impose upon them the due penalty for their impiety.</said></p></div></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="918b"/> and then impose on it a law.  The natural purpose for which all retail trading comes into existence in a State is not loss, but precisely the opposite;  for how can any man be anything but a benefactor if he renders even and symmetrical the distribution of any kind of goods which before was unsymmetrical and uneven?  And this is, we must say, the effect produced by the power of money, and we must declare that the merchant is ordained for this purpose.  And the hireling and the innkeeper and the rest—some more and some

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> My dear Clinias, small is the class of men—rare by nature and trained, too, with a superlative training—who, when they fall into diverse needs and lusts,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="918d"/> are able to stand out firmly for moderation, and who, when they have the power of taking much wealth, are sober, and choose what is of due measure rather than what is large.  The disposition of the mass of mankind is exactly the opposite of this;  when they desire, they desire without limit, and when they can make moderate gains, they prefer to gain insatiably; and it is because of this that all the classes concerned with retail trade, commerce, and inn-keeping are disparaged and subjected to violent abuse.  Now if anyone were to do what never will be done (Heaven forbid !)—but I shall make the supposition, ridiculous though it is—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="918e"/> namely, compel the best men everywhere for a certain period to keep inns or to peddle or to carry on any such trade, or even to compel women by some necessity of fate to take part in such a mode of life,—then we should learn how that each of these callings is friendly and desirable;  and if all these callings were carried on according to a rule free from corruption, they would be honored

    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="919b"/> it is criminal practices such as this, in the case of all these trades, that afford grounds of complaint against this way of succoring distress.  For these evils, then, the lawgiver must in each case provide a medicine.  It is an old and true saying that it is hard to fight against the attack of two foes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 89c">Plat.

What remedy, then, is to be found for this disease in a State gifted with understanding?  The first is to employ the trading class as little as possible;  the second, to assign to that class those men whose corruption would prove no great loss to the State;  the third, to find a means whereby the dispositions of those engaged in these callings may not quite so easily become infected
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="919d"/> by shamelessness and meanness of soul.  After the declarations now made, let our law on these matters (Heaven prosper it!) run in this wise:—Amongst the Magnesians,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp.  <bibl n="Plat. Laws 702b">Plat.

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="920"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="920a"/> if he repeats the offence, he shall get two years’ imprisonment, and for each subsequent conviction the period of imprisonment shall go on being doubled.  Now comes a second law:—Whosoever intends to engage in retail trade must be a resident alien or a foreigner.  And thirdly, this third law:—In order that such an one may be as good as possible, or as little as possible bad, he being a resident in our State, the Law-wardens must bear in mind that they are guardians not only of those who, being well-trained both by birth and nurture, are easy to guard from lawless and evil ways, but also of those who are otherwise,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="920b"/> and who follow pursuits which greatly to urge them on the road to vice;  and these must regard the more.  Accordingly, with respect to retail trading, which is a multifarious occupation, embracing many callings of a similar nature,—with respect (I mean) to so many branches as are allowed to exist, as being deemed absolutely necessary to the State, concerning these the procedure shall be the same as that previously described
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="920c"/> in the case of the kindred matter of adulteration:<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 917e">Plat.

So possibly, by this means, retail trade would be of benefit to all classes, and would do but little damage to those in the States who practise it.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="920d"/> Touching agreements, whenever a man undertakes and fails to fulfil his agreement—unless it be such as is forbidden by the laws or by a decree, or one made under forcible and unjust compulsion, or when the man is involuntarily prevented from fulfilling it owing to some unforeseen accident,—in all other cases of unfulfilled agreements, actions may be brought before the tribal courts, if the parties are unable to come to a previous settlement before arbitrators or neighbors.  Sacred to Hephaestus and Athena is the class of craftsmen who have furnished our life with the arts,

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="921"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="921a"/> If any craftsman fail to execute his work within the time named, owing to baseness—he not revering the god who gives him his livelihood, but deeming him (in his blindness of mind) to be merciful because of his kinship,—he shall, in the first place, pay a penalty to the god, and, secondly, there shall be a law enacted to suit his case:—He shall owe the price of the works regarding which he has lied to the person who gave him the order, and within the stated time he shall execute them all over again gratis.  And as it counselled the seller,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="921b"/> so the law counsels the contractor who undertakes a work not to give in too high an estimate for it, but to estimate it simply at its real worth;  this same charge the law gives, I say, to the contractor, for he as a craftsman certainly knows what its worth is.  In States composed of gentlemen it is wrong for a craftsman to try by his art (which is essentially truthful and sincere) to impose artfully upon lay persons;  and in such cases the wronged shall be entitled to prosecute the wrongdoer.  If, on the other hand, a man who has given an order to a craftsman
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="921c"/> fails to pay him his wage duly according to the legal agreement, and sets at naught Zeus, the Patron of the State, and Athena, who are partners in the constitution,—thereby dissolving great partnerships through love of a little gain,—then, with the help of the gods, this law shall lend aid to the bonds that unite the State:—Whosoever has previously received the work ordered and fails to pay the price within the period agreed shall be bound to pay double the price;  and if a year have elapsed, although all other

And now that we have made mention of craftsmen in general, it is right to allude in passing to those whose craft is military security, that is to say, military commanders and all experts in such matters.  As to the former craftsmen, so to these men, as craftsmen of another sort,—whenever any of them, either voluntarily or under orders,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="921e"/> undertakes any public work and executes it well,—whosoever shall duly pay to these men those honors which are the soldier’s wages, him the law will never weary of lauding; </said></p></div>

Prot. 343b">Plat. Prot. 343b ff</bibl></note> your own selves, to boot.  So I, as lawgiver, make this ruling—that both yourself and this your property are not your own, but belong to the whole of your race, both past and future, and that still more truly does all your race and its property belong to the State;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="923b"/> and this being so, I will not willingly consent if anyone persuades you to make a will contrary to what is best, by fawning on you and helping you when afflicted by disease or age;  rather will I legislate with a general view to what is best for your whole race and State, justly accounting of minor importance the interest of the individual.  May it be that you will feel kindly disposed and at peace with us as you journey towards that bourne whither, by the natural law of our human life, you now are traveling:  the rest of your affairs
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="923c"/> shall be our care, and we will watch over them all, without exception, to the best of our power.  This shall serve, Clinias, alike for consolation and for prelude for both the living and the dying, and the law shall run as follows:— Whosoever writes a will disposing of his property, if he be the father of children, he shall first write down the name of whichever of his sons he deems worthy to be his heir, and if he offers any one of his other children to another man to be adopted by him, this also he shall write down;  and if he has any son besides that is not adopted for any lot,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. one of the 5040 allotments, cp. <bibl n="Plat.

And if a son already possesses a house, he shall not assign him goods, and so likewise in the case of a daughter, if she is betrothed to a husband,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="923e"/> he shall not assign goods, but if not so betrothed, he shall assign.  And if, after the will is made, it is discovered that one of the sons or daughters owns a lot in the district, then that person shall resign his legacy in favor of the heir of him that made the will.  If the testator leave no male children, but females, he shall bequeath to whichever daughter he chooses a husband, and to himself a son, and write him down as his heir;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. he shall select a citizen to become his heir by marrying one of his daughters.</note> </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="924"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="924a"/> when making his will, he shall state in writing who is to be his son’s successor, and with happier luck.  If any testator be wholly childless, he shall take out a tenth part of his surplus property and shall give it to any person, if he so chooses;  but all the rest he shall hand over to his adopted heir, and him he shall make his son with mutual good-will and the blessing of the law. When a man’s children need guardians, if he die after making a will and naming what persons and how many he desires to act as guardians to his children,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="924b"/> and if they are willing and consent act, then the choice of guardians in this document shall be final;  but if a man dies either wholly intestate or having omitted from his will the choice of guardians, then the nearest of kin on both the father’s and the mother’s side, two from each side, together with one of the friends of the deceased, shall act as official guardians, and these the Law-wardens shall appoint in the case of each orphan that requires them.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="924c"/> All that appertains to guardianship and the orphans shall be supervised by fifteen of the Law-wardens, who shall be the eldest of the whole body, and shall divide themselves into threes according to seniority, three acting one year and another three a second year, until five yearly periods have passed in rotation;  and this process shall go on, so far as possible, without a break. And if any man die wholly intestate, leaving children that require guardianship, his unfriended children shall share in these same laws.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="924d"/> And if a man meets with some unforeseen mischance and leaves daughters, he shall pardon the lawgiver if he regulates the betrothal of the daughters with an eye to two points out of three—namely, nearness of kinship and the security of the lot—and omits the third point, which a father would take into consideration,—namely, the selecting out of all the citizens of a person suited by character and conduct to be a son to himself and a spouse for daughter,—if, I say, the lawgiver passes this over owing to the impossibility of taking it into consideration.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="924e"/> Accordingly, the law that we shall enact, as the best in our power touching such matters, will be this:—If a man dies intestate and leaves daughters, that brother who is born of the same father or of the same mother and who is without a lot shall take the daughter<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. in marriage:  the <q type="emph">lot</q> is to pass on always to the next of kin, cf. <bibl n="Plat.

    <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="925"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="925a"/><label>Ath.</label> In like manner, if a man leaves female children, the right of kinship shall proceed always by degrees of consanguinity, going up through brothers and brother’s children, first the males, and secondly the females in one line. The suitability or otherwise of the time of marriage the judge shall decide by inspection, viewing the males naked and the females naked down to the navel.  And if there be in the family a lack of kinsmen as far as brother’s grandchildren, and likewise as far as grandfather’s children, whomsoever of the other citizens the girl, aided by her guardians, shall choose, that man (if both he and the girl are willing)
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="925b"/> shall become the heir of the deceased and the spouse of his daughter.  But obstacles often occur, and there might be times when there was an unusual dearth of such men in the city itself:  so if any girl, being at a loss to find a spouse on the spot, sees one that has emigrated to a colony and desires that he should become heir to her father’s property, if so be that he is related, he shall proceed to the lot, according to the ordinance of the law;  but if he be outside the kin, and there be no one of near kin in the State,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="925c"/> then by the choice of the guardians and of the daughter of the deceased he shall be entitled to marry and to take the lot of the intestate man on his return home. Whosoever dies intestate, being without any issue, male or female, in his case all other matters shall be governed by the previous law;  and a man and woman from the family shall in each such instance go into the deserted house as joint assignees, and their claim to the lot shall be made valid;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="925d"/> and the female claims to inheritance shall come in this order—first, a sister;  second, a brother’s daughter;  third, a sister’s daughter;  fourth, a father’s sister;  fifth, a father’s brother’s daughter;  sixth, a father’s sister’s daughter;  and these shall share the home with the male kinsmen according to the degree of relationship and right, as we previously enacted.  Now we must not fail to notice how burdensome such a law may prove, in that sometimes it harshly orders the next of kin to the deceased to marry his kinswoman, and that it appears to overlook the thousands of impediments which in human life
        <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="925e"/> prevent men from being willing to obey such orders and cause them to prefer any other alternative, however painful, in cases where either of the parties ordered to marry is suffering from diseases or defects of mind or body.  Some might suppose that the lawgiver is paying no heed to these considerations, but they would be wrong.</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="926d"/> all who dispute about any such matters shall go for judgment, and their verdict shall be carried out as final. If, however, anyone maintains that this is to confer too much power on the Law-wardens, he shall summon his opponents before the court of select judges<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 775d">Plat. Laws 775d</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Laws 855c">Plat. Laws 855c</bibl>.</note> and secure a decision regarding the points in dispute. On him that is defeated there shall be imposed by the lawgiver censure and disgrace,—a penalty heavier than a large fine in the eyes of a man of right mind. Accordingly, orphan children will undergo a kind of second birth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. be <q type="emph">born again</q> as children of the State, with the Law-wardens as their new official parents, as explained below.</note>  How in each case they should be reared and trained
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="926e"/> after their first birth we have already described;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> In Books II. and VII.</note>  and now we must contrive some means whereby, after their second birth in which they are destitute of parents, their orphan condition may be as free as possible from piteous misery for those who have become orphans.  In the first place, to act in the room of their begetters, as parents of no inferior kind, we must legally appoint the Law-wardens; and we charge three of these, year by year<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 924c">Plat.

        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> Opportune, indeed, as I think, was the account we previously gave<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> <bibl n="Plat. Laws 865e">Plat. Laws 865e</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="927"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="927a"/> of how the souls of the dead have a certain power of caring for human affairs after death.  The tales which contain this doctrine are true, though long; and while it is right to believe the other traditions about such matters, which are so numerous and exceeding old, we must so believe those who lay it down by law that these are facts, unless it is plain that they are utter fools.  So if this is really the state of the case, the guardians shall fear, first, the gods above who
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="927b"/> pay regard to the solitude of orphans; and, secondly, the souls of the dead, whose natural instinct it is to care especially for their own offspring, and to be kindly disposed those who respect them and hostile to those who disrespect them; and, thirdly, they shall fear the souls of the living who are old and who are held in most high esteem;  since where the State flourishes under good laws, their children’s children revere the aged with affection and live in happiness.  These old people
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="927c"/> are keen of eye and keen of ear to mark such matters, and while they are gracious towards those who deal justly therein, they are very wroth with those who despitefully entreat orphans and waifs, regarding these as a trust most solemn and sacred.  To all these authorities the guardian and official—if he has a spark of sense—must pay attention;  he must show as much care regarding the nurture and training of the orphans as if he were contributing to his own support and that of his own children, and he must do them good in every way to the utmost of his power.  He, then, that obeys the tale prefixed to the law
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="927d"/> and in no wise misuses the orphan will have no direct experience of the anger of the lawgiver against such offences;  but the disobedient and he that wrongs any who has lost father or mother shall in every case pay a penalty double of that due from the man who offends against a child with both parents living. As regards further legal directions either to guardians concerning orphans or to magistrates concerning the supervision of the guardians,—if they did not already possess a pattern of the way to nurture free children in the way they themselves nurture their own children and supervise their household goods,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="927e"/> and if they did not also possess laws regulating these same affairs in detail, then it would have been reasonable enough to lay down laws concerning guardianship, as a peculiar and distinct branch of law, marking out with special regulations of its own the life of the orphan as contrasted with the non-orphan;  but, as the matter stands, the condition of orphanhood in all these respects does not differ greatly with us from the condition of parental control, although as a rule in respect of public estimation and of the care bestowed on the children they are on quite a different level.</said></p></div>

    <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="928"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="928a"/><label>Ath.</label>  Consequently, in its regulations concerning orphans the law has emphasized this very point both by admonition and by threat.  A threat, moreover, of the following kind will be extremely opportune:—Whosoever is guardian of a male or female child, and whosoever of the Law-wardens is appointed supervisor of a guardian, shall show as much affection for the child whom Fate has made an orphan as for his own children, and he shall zealously care for the goods of his nursling as much as for his own goods—or rather, more.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="928b"/> Every guardian shall observe this one law in the discharge of his office;  and if any act in such matters contrary to this law, the magistrate shall punish him if he be a guardian, and, if he be a magistrate, the guardian shall summon him before the court of the select judges, and fine him double the penalty adjudged by the court.  And if a guardian be held by the child’s relatives, or by any other citizen, to be guilty of neglecting or maltreating his ward, they shall bring him before the same court,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="928c"/> and he shall pay four times the damages assessed, and of this amount one half shall go to the child, the other half to the successful prosecutor.  When an orphan has reached full age, if he thinks that he has been badly cared for, he shall be allowed to bring an action concerning the guardianship within a period of five years after the date of its expiration;  and if the guardian lose his case, the court shall assess the amount of his penalty or fine;  and if it be a magistrate that is held to have injured the orphan by neglect, the court shall assess
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="928d"/> what sum he shall pay to the child, but if the injury be due to unjust dealing, in addition to the fine he shall be removed from his office of Law-warden, and the public authority of the State shall appoint another in his place to act as Law-warden for the country and the State. Between fathers and their children, and children and their fathers, there arise differences greater than is right, in the course of which fathers, on the one hand, are liable to suppose that the lawgiver should give them legal permission to proclaim publicly by herald, if they so wish, that their sons have legally
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="928e"/> ceased to be their sons;  while the sons, on the other hand, claim permission to indict their fathers for insanity when they are in a shameful condition owing to illness or old age.  These results are wont to occur among men who are wholly evil of character, since where only half of them are evil—the son being evil and the father not, or vice versa—such enmity does not issue in calamitous consequences.</said></p></div>

Such cases should be dealt with according to a law such as this:—If any man is urged by a most unhappy impulse of anger to desire, rightly or wrongly, to expel from his own kindred one whom he has begotten and reared, he shall not be permitted
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="929b"/> to do this informally and immediately, but he shall, first of all, assemble his own kinsfolk as far as cousins and likewise his son’s kinsfolk on the mother’s side, and in the presence of these he shall accuse his son, showing how he deserves at the hands of all to be expelled from the family, and he shall grant to the son an equal length of time for arguing that he does not deserve to suffer any such treatment;  and if the father convinces them and gains the votes of more than half the family (votes being given by all the other adults of both sexes,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="929c"/> save only the father, the mother, and the son who is defendant), in this way and on these conditions, but not otherwise, the father shall be permitted to disinherit his son.  And as regards the man disinherited, if any citizen desires to adopt him as his son, no law shall prevent him from doing so, (for the characters of the young naturally undergo many changes during their life);  but if within ten years no one offers to adopt the disinherited man,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="929d"/> then the controllers of the surplus children designed for emigration shall take control of these persons also, in order that they may be duly included in the same scheme of emigration.  And if a man becomes unusually demented owing to illness or old age or crabbedness, or a combination of these complaints, but his condition remains unnoticed by all except those who are living with him, and if he regards himself as master of his own property and wastes his goods, while his son feels at a loss and scruples to indict him for insanity,—in such a case a law shall be enacted
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="929e"/> on behalf of the son whereby he shall, in the first instance, go to the eldest of the Law-wardens and report to them his father’s condition, and they, after full enquiry, shall advise whether or not he ought to bring an indictment;  and if they advise him to bring an indictment, they shall act for him, when he brings it, both as witnesses and advocates;  and the father that is convicted shall thenceforward have no power to administer even the smallest tittle of his property, and shall be counted as a child in the house for the rest of his life. </said></p></div>

Distinct from this is the type which, by means of sorceries and incantations and spells (as they are called), not only convinces those who attempt to cause injury that they really can do so, but convinces also their victims that they certainly are being injured by those who possess the power of bewitchment.  In respect of all such matters it is neither easy to perceive what is the real truth, nor, if one does perceive it, is it easy to convince others.  And it is futile to approach the souls of men
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="933b"/> who view one another with dark suspicion if they happen to see images of molded wax at doorways, or at points where three ways meet, or it may be at the tomb of some ancestor, to bid them make light of all such portents, when we ourselves hold no clear opinion concerning them.  Consequently, we shall divide the law about poisoning under two heads, according to the modes in which the attempt is made,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> i.e. attacking the mind or body.</note> and, as a preliminary, we shall entreat, exhort, and advise that no one must attempt
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="933c"/> to commit such an act, or to frighten the mass of men, like children, with bogeys, and so compel the legislator and the judge to cure men of such fears, inasmuch as, first, the man who attempts poisoning knows not what he is doing either in regard to bodies (unless he be a medical expert) or in respect of sorceries (unless he be a prophet or diviner).  So this statement shall stand

And if it be held that a man is acting like an injurer by the use of spells, incantations,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="933e"/> or any such mode of poisoning, if he be a prophet or diviner, he shall be put to death;  but if he be ignorant of the prophetic art, he shall be dealt with in the same way as a layman convicted of poisoning,—that is to say, the court shall assess in his case also what shall seem to them right for him to suffer or pay.</said></p></div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="934c"/> while the lawgiver, like a draughtsman, must give a sketch in outline of cases which illustrate the rules of the written code.  And that, O Megillus and Clinias, is the task which we must now execute as fairly and well as we can:  we must state what penalties should be ordained for all cases of robbery and violence, in so far as the gods and sons of gods may suffer us to ordain them by law. If any be a madman, he shall not appear openly in the city;  the relatives of such persons shall keep them indoors, employing whatever means they know of,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="934d"/> or else they shall pay a penalty;  a person belonging to the highest property-class shall pay a hundred drachmae, whether the man he is neglecting be a free man or a slave,—one belonging to the second class shall pay four-fifths of a mina—one of the third class, three-fifths,—and one of the fourth class, two-fifths.  There are many and various forms of madness:  in the cases now mentioned it is caused by disease, but cases also occur where it is due to the natural growth and fostering of an evil temper, by which men in the course of a trifling quarrel abuse one another slanderously with loud cries—

No man, therefore, shall ever in any wise utter such words in any holy place or at any public sacrifice or public games, or in the market or the court or any public assembly;  in every such case the magistrate concerned shall punish the offender;  or, if he fail to do so, he shall be disqualified for any public distinction

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="944"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="944a"/> but none the less the law ought to try by some means to distinguish case from case.  In illustration we may cite the story of Patroclus:<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.125">Hom. Il. 16., 17. 125 ff., 18. 84 ff</bibl>.  Patroclus (son of Menoetios) was wearing the arms of Achilles (son of Peleus) when slain by Hector.</note>  suppose that he had been brought to his tent without his arms and had recovered—as has happened in the case of thousands,—while the arms he had had (which, as the poet relates, had been given to Peleus by the gods, as a dowry with Thetis) were in the hands of Hector,—then all the base men of those days would have been free to abuse Menoetios’ son for loss of arms.  Moreover, there are instances
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="944b"/> of men losing their arms through being flung down from cliffs, or on the sea, or in ravines, when overwhelmed by a sudden great rush of water, or from other mishaps, countless in number, which one could mention by way of consolation, and thereby justify an evil which lends itself to calumny.  It is right, therefore, to separate, as best one can, the greater and more serious evil from its opposite.  As a rule, indeed, the employment of the names in question by way of abuse admits of a distinction;  for the term <q type="term">shield-flinger</q> would not properly be applied in all cases, but rather the term <q type="term">arms-dropper.</q>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="944c"/> For the man who by a fair amount of violence is stripped of his arms will not be as much of a <q type="term">shield-flinger</q> as the man who has voluntarily thrown them away—rather there is a vast difference between the two cases.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="944d"/> For the bad man one must always punish, in order to better him, but not the luckless man;  for that profits not.

Rhadamanthys deserves admiration for the way in which, as we are told, he judged cases of law, in that he perceived that the men of his time had a clear belief in the existence of gods,—and naturally so, seeing that most men at that time were the offspring of gods, he himself among others, as the story declares.  Probably he thought that he ought not to entrust lawsuits to any man, but only to gods, from whom he obtained verdicts that were both simple and speedy;  for he administered an oath
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="948c"/> to the disputants regarding each matter in dispute, and thus secured a speedy and safe settlement.  But nowadays, when, as we say,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 886d">Plat. Laws 886d ff</bibl>., <bibl n="Plat. Laws 891b">Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="948d"/> Since, therefore, the opinions of men about the gods have changed, so also must their laws change.  In legal actions laws that are framed intelligently ought to debar both litigants from taking oaths;  he that is bringing an action against anyone ought to write down his charges, but swear no oath, and the defendant in like manner ought to write down his denial and hand it to the magistrates without an oath.  For truly it is a horrible thing to know full well that, inasmuch as lawsuits are frequent in a State, well-nigh half the citizens are perjurers,

And in general, during a trial, the presidents of the court shall not permit a man to speak under oath for the sake of gaining credence, or to imprecate curses upon himself and his family, or to make use of unseemly supplications and womanish sobbings, but only and always to state and hear what is just in proper language;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

To this synod he that has inspected the legal institutions of other peoples shall repair immediately after his return home;  and if he has discovered any persons able to declare any oracle regarding legislation or education or nurture, or if he has brought back any personal observations of his own, he shall communicate them to the whole synod;  and if it appear

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="953"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> this stranger must be received, when he comes to the city, at the markets, harbors, and public buildings outside the city, by the officials in charge thereof;  and they shall have a care lest any such strangers
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="953"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="953a"/> introduce any innovation, and they shall duly dispense justice to them, and shall hold such intercourse as is necessary with them, but to the least extent possible.  The second type of stranger is he who is an inspector, in the literal sense, with his eyes, and with his ears also of all that appertains to musical exhibitions:  for all such there must be lodgings provided at the temples, to afford them friendly accommodation, and the priests and temple-keepers must show them care and attention, until they have sojourned for a reasonable length of time and have seen and heard all that they intended;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="953b"/> after which, if no harm has been done or suffered by them, they shall be dismissed.  And for these the priests shall act as judges, in case anyone injures one of them or one of them injures anyone else, if the claim does not exceed fifty drachmae;  but if any greater claim is made, the trial for such strangers must take place before the market-stewards.  The third type which requires a public reception is he who comes from another country on some public business:  he must be received by none but the generals, hipparchs and taxiarchs, and the care of a stranger of this kind
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="953c"/> must be entirely in the hands of the official with whom he lodges, in conjunction with the prytaneis.  The fourth type of stranger comes rarely, if ever:  should there, however, come at any time from another country an inspector similar to those we send abroad, he shall come on these conditions:—First, he shall be not less than fifty years old;  and secondly, his purpose in coming must be to view some noble object which is superior in beauty to anything to be found in other States, or else to display to another State something of that description.  Every visitor of this kind
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="953d"/> shall go as an unbidden guest to the doors of the rich and wise, he being both rich and wise himself;  and he shall go also to the abode of the General Superintendent of Education, believing himself to be a proper guest for such a host, or to the house of one of those who have won a prize for virtue;  and when he has communed with some of these, by the giving and receiving of information, he shall take his departure, with suitable gifts and distinctions bestowed on him as a friend by friends.  Such are the laws in conformity with which they must receive all strangers, of either sex, from another country,
            <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="953e"/> and send out their own citizens;  thus doing honor to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, instead of expelling strangers by means of meats and ceremonies<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. by forbidding their presence at ceremonial feasts;  or, because (as Grote says) <quote>the Egyptian habits as to eating and sacrifice were intolerably repulsive to a foreigner.</quote></note> (as is now done by the nurslings of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>), or else by savage proclamations.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

And if the means are not forthcoming, and there be a deficiency of not less than a drachma, the loser in question shall be precluded from suing anyone else until he has paid to the full his whole debt

As in other matters it is right to trust the lawgiver, so too we must believe him when he asserts that the soul is wholly superior to the body, and that in actual life what makes each of us to be what he is
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="959b"/> is nothing else than the soul, while the body is a semblance which attends on each of us, it being well said that the bodily corpses are images of the dead, but that which is the real self of each of us, and which we term the immortal soul, departs to the presence of other gods,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<bibl n="Plat.

This being so, one ought never to spend extravagantly on the dead, through supposing that the carcass of flesh that is being buried is in the truest sense one’s own relative;  but one ought rather to suppose that the real son or brother—or whoever else it may be that a man fancies himself to be mournfully burying—has departed in furtherance and fulfillment of his own destiny, and that it is our duty to make a wise use of what we have

The Law-wardens must of necessity perform many other duties and supervise many other matters,

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Resuming, then, the subject of this synod, I will say this:—If one were to lay this down as an anchor for the whole State, possessing all the requisite conditions,—then, I affirm, it would secure the salvation of all that we desire.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now will be the time for us to display no lack of zeal in declaring truly what follows.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Excellently spoken!  Proceed as you propose.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="961d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One ought to observe, Clinias, in regard to every object, in each of its operations, what constitutes its appropriate savior—as, for example, in an animal, the soul and the head are eminently such by nature.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Surely it is the goodness of those parts that provides salvation to every animal.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> By the existence of reason in the soul, in addition to all its other qualities, and by the existence of sight and hearing, in addition to all else, in the head;  thus, to summarize the matter, it is the combination of reason with the finest senses, and their union in one, that would most justly be termed the salvation of each animal.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> That is certainly probable.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="961e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is probable.  But what kind of reason is it which, when combined with senses, will afford salvation to ships in stormy weather and calm?  On shipboard is it not the pilot and the sailors who, by combining the senses with the pilot reason, secure salvation both for themselves and for all that belongs to the ship?</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course.</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="962">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> There is no need of many examples to illustrate this.  Consider, for instance, what would be the right mark for a general to set up to shoot at in the case of an army, or the medical profession in the case of a human body, if they were aiming
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="962"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="962a"/> at salvation.  Would not the former make victory his mark, and mastery over the enemy, while that of the doctors and their assistants would be the providing of health to the body?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> But if a doctor were ignorant of that bodily condition which we have now called <q type="emph">health,</q> or a general ignorant of victory, or any of the other matters we have mentioned, could he possibly be thought to possess reason about any of these things?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How could he?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> What, now, shall we say about a State?  If a man were to be plainly ignorant as regards the political mark to be aimed at, would he, first of all, deserve the title of magistrate, and,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="962b"/> secondly, would he be able to secure the salvation of that object concerning the aim of which he knows nothing at all?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How could he?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So now, in our present case, if our settlement of the country is to be finally completed, there must, it would seem, exist in it some element which knows, in the first place, what that political aim, of which we are speaking, really is, and, secondly, in what manner it may attain this aim, and which of the laws, in the first instance, and secondly of men, gives it good counsel or bad.  But if any State is destitute of such an element, it will not be surprising
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="962c"/> if, being thus void of reason and void of sense, it acts at haphazard always in all its actions.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In which, then, of the parts or institutions of our State have we now got anything so framed as to prove an adequate safeguard of this kind?  Can we answer that question?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> No, Stranger;  at least, not clearly.  But if I must make a guess, it seems to me that this discourse of yours is leading up to that synod which has to meet at night, as you said just now.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="962d"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> An excellent reply, Clinias!  And, as our present discourse shows, this synod must possess every virtue;  and the prime virtue is not to keep shifting its aim among a number of objects,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 705e">Plat. Laws 705e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 934b">Plat. Laws 934b</bibl>.</note> but to concentrate its gaze always on one particular mark, and at that one mark to shoot, as it were, all its arrows continually.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Most certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> So now we shall understand that it is by no means surprising if the legal customs in States keep shifting, seeing that different parts of the codes in each State look in different directions.  And, in general, it is not surprising that, with some statesmen,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="962e"/> the aim of justice is to enable a certain class of people to rule in the State (whether they be really superior, or inferior), while with others the aim is how to acquire wealth (whether or not they be somebody’s slaves);  and others again direct their efforts to winning a life of freedom.  Still others make two objects at once the joint aim of their legislation,—namely, the gaining of freedom for themselves, and mastery over other States;  while those who are the wisest of all, in their own conceit, aim not at one only, but at the sum total of these and the like objects, since they are unable to specify any one object of preeminent value towards which they would desire all else to be directed.</said></p></div>

We said<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 630e">Plat.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Yes.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And we stated that virtue consists of four things.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> And that the chief of all the four is reason,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 631c">Plat.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> You follow us admirably, Clinias;  and now follow us in what comes next.  In the case of the pilot, the doctor, and the general, reason is directed,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="963b"/> as we said, towards the one object of aim which is proper in each case;  and now we are at the point of examining reason in the case of a statesman, and, addressing it as a man, we shall question it thus:—<q type="spoken">O admirable sir, what is your aim?  Medical reason is able to state clearly the one single object at which it aims;  so will you be unable to state your one object—you who are superior, as perhaps you will say, to all the wise?</q>  Can you two, Megillus and Clinias, define that object on his behalf, and tell me what you say it is,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="963c"/> just as I, on behalf of many others, defined their objects for you?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> We are totally unable to do so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, can you declare that we need zeal in discerning both the object itself as a whole and the forms it assumes?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Illustrate what you mean by <q type="emph">the forms</q> you speak of.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> For example, when we said that there are four forms of virtue, obviously, since there are four, we must assert that each is a separate one.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And yet we call them all by one name:  we assert that courage is virtue, and wisdom virtue,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="963d"/> and the other two likewise, as though they were really not a plurality, but solely this one thing—virtue.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Very true.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Now it is not hard to explain wherein these two (and the rest) differ from one another, and how they have got two names;  but to explain why we have given the one name <q type="emph">virtue</q> to both of them (and to the rest) is no longer an easy matter.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How do you mean?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is not hard to make clear my meaning.  Let one of us adopt the role of questioner, the other of answerer.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 893a">Plat. Laws 893a</bibl>.</note></said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> In what way?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="963e"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Do you ask me this question—why, when calling both the two by the single name of <q type="emph">virtue,</q> did we again speak of them as two—courage and wisdom?  Then I shall tell you the reason,—which is, that the one of them has to do with fear, namely courage,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Lach. 196d">Plat.

So do you, in turn, inform me how it is that they are one and identical.  Imagine you are also going to tell me how it is that, though four, they are yet one;  and then, after you have shown me how they are one, do you again ask me how they are four.  And after that, let us enquire regarding the person who has full knowledge of any objects which possess both a name and a definition, whether he ought to know the name only, and not know the definition, or whether it is not a shameful thing for a man worth anything to be ignorant of all these points in regard to matters of surpassing beauty
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="964b"/> and importance.</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Impossible.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> In regard to these matters, is it not right that the interpreters, the teachers, the lawgivers, as the wardens of the rest, in dealing with him that requires knowledge and information, or with him that requires punishment and reproof for his sin,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="964c"/> should excel all others in the art of instructing him in the quality of vice and virtue and exhibiting it fully?  Or is some poet who comes into the State, or one who calls himself a trainer of youth, to be accounted evidently superior to him that has won prizes for all the virtues?  In a State like that, where there are no wardens who are competent both in word and deed, and possessed of a competent knowledge of virtue,—is it surprising, I ask, if such a State, all unwarded as it is, suffers the same fate as do many of the
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="964d"/> States which exist today?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Not at all, I should say.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, must we do what we now propose, or what?  Must we contrive how our wardens shall have a more accurate grasp of virtue, both in word and deed, than the majority of men?  For otherwise, how shall our State resemble a wise man’s head and senses, on the ground that it possesses within itself a similar kind of wardenship?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What is this resemblance we speak of and wherein does it consist?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="964e"/></said></p>
    <p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Evidently we are comparing the State itself to the skull;  and, of the wardens, the younger ones, who are selected as the most intelligent and nimble in every part of their souls, are set, as it were, like the eyes, in the top of the head, and survey the State all round; </said></p></div>

<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="965"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="965a"/> while the old men, who are likened to the reason because of their eminent wisdom in many matters of importance, act as counsellors, and make use of the young men as ministers and colleagues also in their counsels, so that both these classes by their co-operation really effect the salvation of the whole State.  Is this the way, or ought we to contrive some other?  Should the State, do you think, have all its members equal instead of having some more highly trained and educated?</said></p>

<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Probably not.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is certain, my friend, rather than probable, that no man can possibly have a clearer method than this.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> I believe you, Stranger, and I assent;  so let us employ this method in our subsequent discourse.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Naturally we must compel the wardens also of our divine polity to observe accurately, in the first place, what that identical element is which pervades all the four virtues,
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="965d"/> and which,—since it exists as a unity in courage, temperance, justice and wisdom,— may justly be called, as we assert, by the single name of <q type="emph">virtue.</q>  This element, my friends, we must now (if we please) hold very tight, and not let go until we have adequately explained the essential nature of the object to be aimed at—whether, that is, it exists by nature as a unity, or as a whole, or as both, or in some other way.  Else, if this eludes us, can we possibly suppose that we shall adequately grasp the nature of virtue, when we are unable to state whether it is many or four or one?
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="965e"/> Accordingly, if we follow our own counsel, we shall contrive somehow, by hook or by crook, that this knowledge shall exist in our State.  Should we decide, however, to pass it over entirely—pass it over we must.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Nay, Stranger, in the name of the Stranger’s God, we must by no means pass over a matter such as this, since what you say seems to us most true.  But how is this to be contrived?</said></p></div>

<p><said who="#Athenian"><milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="966"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="966a"/><label>Ath.</label> It is too early to explain how we are to contrive it:  let us first make sure that we agree among ourselves as to whether or not we ought to do so.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, surely we ought, if we can.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Very well then;  do we hold the same view about the fair and the good?  Ought our wardens to know only that each of these is a plurality, or ought they also to know how and wherein they are each a unity?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is fairly obvious that they must necessarily also discern how these are a unity.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="966b"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, ought they to discern it, but be unable to give a verbal demonstration of it?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Impossible!  The state of mind you describe is that of a slave.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Well then, do we hold the same view about all forms of goodness, that those who are to be real wardens of the laws must really know the true nature of them, and be capable both of expounding it in word and conforming to it in deed, passing judgment on fair actions and foul according to their real character?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Certainly.
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="966c"/></said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> And is not one of the fairest things the doctrine about the gods, which we expounded earnestly,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In Book X.</note>—to know both that they exist, and what power they manifestly possess, so far as a man is capable of learning these matters;  so that while one should pardon the mass of the citizens if they merely follow the letter of the law, one must exclude from office those who are eligible for wardenship, unless they labor to grasp all the proofs there are about the existence of gods?  Such exclusion from office
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="966d"/> consists in refusing ever to choose as a Law-warden, or to number among those approved for excellence, a man who is not divine himself, nor has spent any labor over things divine.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> It is certainly just, as you say, that the man who is idle or incapable in respect of this subject should be strictly debarred from the ranks of the noble.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Are we assured, then, that there are two causes, amongst those we previously discussed,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Laws 893b">Plat. Laws 893b</bibl>.</note> which lead to faith in the gods?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What two?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> One is our dogma about the soul,—that it is the most ancient

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="967"> 
        <p><said who="#Athenian" rend="merge"><label>Ath.</label> For no man that views these objects in no careless or amateurish way has ever proved so godless as not to be affected by them in a way just the opposite of that which most people expect.
<milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="967"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="967a"/> For they imagine that those who study these objects in astronomy and the other necessary allied arts become atheists through observing, as they suppose, that all things come into being by necessary forces and not by the mental energy of the will aiming at the fulfillment of good.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What in fact is the real state of the case?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> The position at present is, as I said, exactly the opposite of what it was when those who considered these objects considered them to be soulless.  Yet even then they were objects of admiration, and the conviction
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="967b"/> which is now actually held was suspected by all who studied them accurately—namely, that if they were soulless, and consequently devoid of reason, they could never have employed with such precision calculations so marvellous;  and even in those days there were some who dared to hazard the statement<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An allusion to the saying of Anaxagoras, <q type="written">All things were together;  then Reason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>) came and set them in order.</q>  But A. ascribed to Reason only the initiation of a world-order;  in all other respects his doctrine was materialistic, and he used purely physical causes and processes in explaining the world, regarding the stars as fiery masses of matter (<q type="emph">full of earth, stones,</q> etc.).  Cp.<title>Phaedo</title> 91 B ff.</note> that reason is the orderer of all that is in the heavens.  But the same thinkers, through mistaking the nature of the soul and conceiving her to be posterior, instead of prior, to body,
    <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="967c"/> upset again (so to say) the whole universe, and most of all themselves;  for as regards the visible objects of sight, all that moves in the heavens appeared to them to be full of stones, earth and many other soulless bodies which dispense the causes of the whole cosmos.  These were the views which, at that time, caused these thinkers to incur many charges of atheism and much odium, and which also incited the poets to abuse them<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is impossible for any mortal man to become permanently god-fearing if he does not grasp the two truths now stated,—namely, how that the soul is oldest of all things that partake of generation, and is immortal, and rules over all bodies,—and in addition to this, he must also grasp that reason which, as we have often affirmed, controls what exists among the stars, together with the

And now, O Megillus and Clinias, it is time at last to consider whether, in addition to all the previous laws which we have stated, we shall add this also—that the nocturnal synod of magistrates shall be legally established, and shall participate in all the education we have described, to keep ward over the State, and to secure its salvation;
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="968b"/> or what are we to do?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Of course we shall add this law, my excellent sir, if we can possibly do so, even to a small extent.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Then, verily, let us all strive to do so.  And herein you will find me a most willing helper, owing to my very long experience and study of this subject;  and perhaps I shall discover other helpers also besides myself.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> Well, Stranger, we most certainly must proceed on that path along which God too, it would seem, is conducting us.  But what is the right method for us to employ,—
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="968c"/> that is what we have now got to discover and state.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> It is not possible at this stage, Megillus and Clinias, to enact laws for such a body, before it has been duly framed;  when it is, its members must themselves ordain what authority they should possess;  but it is already plain that what is required in order to form such a body, if it is to be rightly formed, is teaching by means of prolonged conferences.</said></p>
<p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> How so?  What now are we to understand by this observation?</said></p>
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Surely we must first draw up a list
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="968d"/> of all those who are fitted by age, intellectual capacity, and moral character and habit for the office of warden;  but as regards the next point, the subjects they should learn,—these it is neither easy to discover for oneself<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 528b">Plat. Rep. 528b ff</bibl>.</note> nor is it easy to find another who has made the discovery and learn from him.  Moreover, with respect to the limits of time, when and for how long they ought to receive instruction in each subject, it were idle to lay down written regulations;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cp.<title>Epp</title>. 7. 341 C.</note>
<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="968e"/> for even the learners themselves could not be sure that they were learning at the opportune time until each of them had acquired within his soul some knowledge of the subject in question.  Accordingly, although it would be wrong to term all these matters <q type="emph">indescribable,</q> they should be termed <q type="emph">imprescribable,</q> seeing that the prescribing of them beforehand does nothing to elucidate the question under discussion.</said></p>
    <p><said who="#Clinias"><label>Clin.</label> What then must we do, Stranger, under these circumstances?</said></p></div>
    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="969">
<p><said who="#Athenian"><label>Ath.</label> Apparently, my friends, we must <q type="emph">take our chance with the crowd</q> (as the saying is), and if we are willing to put the whole polity to the hazard and throw (as men say) three sixes or three aces, so it must be done; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="969"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="969a"/> and I will go shares with you in the hazard by declaring and explaining my views concerning education and nurture, the subject now started anew in our discourse;  but truly the hazard will be no small one, nor comparable to any others.  And you, Clinias, I specially exhort to take good heed to this matter.  For as concerns the State of the Magnesians—or whoever else, by the god’s direction, gives your State its name,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. if the god should direct the State to be named, not after the Magnetes, but after some other person or place:  cp. <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="969b"/> of all your successors.  If so be that this divine synod actually comes into existence, my dear colleagues, we must hand over to it the State;  and practically all our present lawgivers agree to this without dispute.
