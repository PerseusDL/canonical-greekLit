                  <milestone unit="para"/>Then what did he say before his death? and how did he die? I should like to hear,
                    for nowadays none of the Phliasians go to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at all, and no stranger has come from there for a long
                    time, <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="57b"/> who could tell us anything definite
                    about this matter, except that he drank poison and died, so we could learn no

            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> Did you not even hear about the trial and how it was conducted?</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Yes, some one told us about that, and we wondered that although it took place a
                    long time ago, he was put to death much later. Now why was that, Phaedo?
                    </said></p>

            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> It was a matter of chance, Echecrates. It happened that the stern of the ship
                    which the Athenians send to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> was
                    crowned on the day before the trial.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> What ship is this?</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> This is the ship, as the Athenians say, in which Theseus once went to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> with the fourteen <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="58b"/> youths and maidens, and saved them and himself. Now the Athenians made a vow to Apollo, as the story goes, that if they were saved they
                    would send a mission every year to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. And from that time even to the present day they send it
                    annually in honor of the god. Now it is their law that after the mission begins
                    the city must be pure and no one may be publicly executed until the ship has
                    gone to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and back; and
                    sometimes, when contrary winds <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="58c"/> detain it,
                    this takes a long time. The beginning of the mission is when the priest of
                    Apollo crowns the stern of the ship; and this took place, as I say, on the day
                    before the trial. For that reason Socrates passed a long time in prison between
                    his trial and his death.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> What took place at his death, Phaedo? What was said and done? And which of his
                    friends were with him? Or did the authorities forbid them to be present, so that
                    he died without his friends? </said></p>
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="58d"/>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> Not at all. Some were there, in fact, a good many.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Be so good as to tell us as exactly as you can about all these things, if you are
                    not too busy.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> I am not busy and I will try to tell you. It is always my greatest pleasure to be
                    reminded of Socrates whether by speaking of him myself or by listening to
                    someone else.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Well, Phaedo, you will have hearers who feel as you do; so try to tell us
                    everything as accurately as you can. </said></p>     
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="58e"/>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> For my part, I had strange emotions when I was there. For I was not filled with
                    pity as I might naturally be when present at the death of a friend; since he
                    seemed to me to be happy, both in his bearing and his words, he was meeting
                    death so fearlessly and nobly. And so I thought that even in going to the abode
                    of the dead he was not going without the protection of the gods, and that when
                    he arrived there <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="59"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="59a"/> it would be well with him, if it ever was well with anyone.</said></p>
                    
 </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="59">   
    <p><said who="#Phaedo" rend="merge"><label>Phaedo.</label> And for this reason I was not at all filled with pity, as might seem natural
                    when I was present at a scene of mourning; nor on the other hand did I feel
                    pleasure because we were occupied with philosophy, as was our custom—and
                    our talk was of philosophy;—but a very strange feeling came over me, an
                    unaccustomed mixture of pleasure and of pain together, when I thought that
                    Socrates was presently to die. And all of us who were there were in much the
                    same condition, sometimes laughing and sometimes weeping; especially one of us,
                    Apollodorus; you know him <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="59b"/> and his
                    character.</said></p>

            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> He was quite unrestrained, and I was much agitated myself, as were the
                    others.</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Who were these, Phaedo?</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> Of native Athenians there was this Apollodorus, and Critobulus and his father,
                    and Hermogenes and Epiganes and Aeschines and Antisthenes; and Ctesippus the
                    Paeanian was there too, and Menexenus and some other Athenians. But Plato, I
                    think, was ill. </said></p>
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="59c"/>
            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Were any foreigners there?</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> Yes, Simmias of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and Cebes and

            <p><said who="#Echecrates"><label>Echecrates.</label> Well then, what was the conversation?</said></p>
            <p><said who="#Phaedo"><label>Phaedo.</label> I will try to tell you everything from the beginning. On the previous days <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="59d"/> I and the others had always been in the
                    habit of visiting Socrates. We used to meet at daybreak in the court where the
                    trial took place, for it was near the prison; and every day we used to wait
                    about, talking with each other, until the prison was opened, for it was not
                    opened early; and when it was opened, we went in to Socrates and passed most of
                    the day with him. On that day we came together earlier; for the day before,
              <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="59e"/> when we left the prison in the evening we
                    heard that the ship had arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. So we agreed to come to the usual place as early in the
                    morning as possible. And we came, and the jailer who usually answered the door
                    came out and told us to wait and not go in until he told us. <q type="spoken">For,</q>
                    he said, <q type="spoken">the eleven are releasing Socrates from his fetters and giving
                    directions how he is to die today.</q></said></p>  </div>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="60">  
     <p><said who="#Phaedo" rend="merge"><label>Phaedo.</label> So after a little delay he came and
               <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="60"/><milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="60a"/> told us to
                    go in. We went in then and found Socrates just released from his fetters and
                    Xanthippe—you know her—with his little son in her arms, sitting
                    beside him. Now when Xanthippe saw us, she cried out and said the kind of thing
                    that women always do say: <q type="spoken">Oh Socrates, this is the last time now that
                    your friends will speak to you or you to them.</q> And Socrates glanced at
                    Crito and said, <q type="spoken">Crito, let somebody take her home.</q>
         <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And some of Crito’s people took her away wailing <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="60b"/> and beating her breast. But Socrates sat
                    up on his couch and bent his leg and rubbed it with his hand, and while he was
                    rubbing it, he said, <q type="spoken">What a strange thing, my friends, that seems to be
                    which men call pleasure! How wonderfully it is related to that which seems to be
                    its opposite, pain, in that they will not both come to a man at the same time,
                    and yet if he pursues the one and captures it he is generally obliged to take
                    the other also, as if the two were joined together in one head. And I
                    think,</q> <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="60c"/>
          he said, <q type="spoken">if Aesop had thought of them, he would have made a fable telling how they were at war and god
                    wished to reconcile them, and when he could not do that, he fastened their heads
                    together, and for that reason, when one of them comes to anyone, the other
                    follows after. Just so it seems that in my case, after pain was in my leg on
                    account of the fetter, pleasure appears to have come following
                        after.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Here Cebes interrupted and said,
                    <q type="spoken">By Zeus, Socrates, I am glad you reminded me.
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="60d"/>
          Several others have asked about the poems you have composed,
                    the metrical versions of Aesop’s fables and the hymn to Apollo, and Evenus asked
                    me the day before yesterday why you never wrote any poetry before, composed
                    these verses after you came to prison. Now, if you care that I should be able to
                    answer Evenus when he asks me again—and I know he will ask me—tell
                    me what to say.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Then tell him,
                    Cebes,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">the truth, that I composed these verses not
                    because I wished to rival him or his poems, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="60e"/>
           for I knew that would not be easy, but because I wished to test the meaning of
                    certain dreams, and to make sure that I was neglecting no duty in case their
                    repeated commands meant that I must cultivate the Muses in this way. They were
                    something like this. The same dream came to me often in my past life, sometimes
                    in one form and sometimes in another, but always saying the same thing:
                    <q type="spoken">Socrates,</q> it said, <q type="spoken">make music and work at it.</q></q></said></p></div>
                    
              
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="61">  
    <p><said who="#Phaedo" rend="merge"><label>Phaedo.</label> <q type="spoken" rend="merge">And I formerly thought it was
                    urging and encouraging me <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="61"/>
         
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="61a"/>
          to do what I was doing already and that just as people
                    encourage runners by cheering, so the dream was encouraging me to do what I was
                    doing, that is, to make music, because philosophy was the greatest kind of music
                    and I was working at that. But now, after the trial and while the festival of
                    the god delayed my execution, I thought, in case the repeated dream really meant

        before making sure that I had done what I ought, by obeying
                    the dream and composing verses. So first I composed a hymn to the god whose
                    festival it was; and after the god, considering that a poet, if he is really to
                    be a poet, must compose myths and not speeches, since I was not a maker of
                    myths, I took the myths of Aesop, which I had at hand and knew, and turned into
                    verse the first I came upon. So tell Evenus that, Cebes, and bid him farewell,
                    and tell him, if he is wise, to come after me as quickly as he can.

           <q type="spoken">but perhaps
                    there is some reason in it. Now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this

                    run away, seems to me to be weighty and not easy to understand. But this at
                    least, Cebes, I do believe is sound, that the gods are our guardians and that we
                    men are one of the chattels of the gods. Do you not believe
                        this?</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">Yes,</q> said Cebes,

                    unreasonable to say that a man must not kill himself until god sends some

                    you said just now, Socrates, that philosophers ought to be ready and willing to
                    die, that seems 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="62d"/>
         strange if we were right just
                    now in saying that god is our guardian and we are his possessions. For it is not
                    reasonable that the wisest men should not be troubled when they leave that
                    service in which the gods, who are the best overseers in the world, are watching
                    over them. A wise man certainly does not think that when he is free he can take
                    better care of himself than they do. A foolish man might perhaps think so, that
                    he ought to run away from his master, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="62e"/>
          and he
                    would not consider that he must not run away from a good master, but ought to
                    stay with him as long as possible; and so he might thoughtlessly run away; but a
                    man of sense would wish to be always with one who is better than himself. And
                    yet, Socrates, if we look at it in this way, the contrary of what we just said
                    seems natural; for the wise ought to be troubled at dying and the foolish to
                        rejoice.</q></said></p>

                    the soul is contaminated by such an evil, we shall never attain completely what
                    we desire, that is, the truth. For the body keeps us constantly busy by reason

         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="66c"/>
            and moreover, if
                    diseases come upon it they hinder our pursuit of the truth. And the body fills
                    us with passions and desires and fears, and all sorts of fancies and
                    foolishness, so that, as they say, it really and truly makes it impossible for
                    us to think at all. The body and its desires are the only cause of wars and
                    factions and battles; for all wars arise for the sake of gaining money, and we
                    are compelled to gain money

            for the sake of
                    the body. We are slaves to its service. And so, because of all these things, we
                    have no leisure for philosophy. But the worst of all is that if we do get a bit
                    of leisure and turn to philosophy, the body is constantly breaking in upon our
                    studies and disturbing us with noise and confusion, so that it prevents our
                    beholding the truth, and in fact we perceive that, if we are ever to know
                    anything absolutely, we must be free from the body and must behold 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="66e"/>
            the actual realities with the eye of the soul alone.
                    And then, as our argument shows, when we are dead we are likely to possess the

                    in reality had a hidden meaning when they said long ago that whoever goes

            the other things you say, but in regard
                    to the soul men are very prone to disbelief. They fear that when the soul leaves
                    the body it no longer exists anywhere, and that on the day when the man dies it
                    is destroyed and perishes, and when it leaves the body and departs from it,

                    by asking whether the souls of men who have died are in the nether world or not.
                    There is an ancient tradition, which we remember, that they go there from here
                    and come back here again and are born from the dead. Now if this is true, if the
                    living are born again from the dead, our souls would exist there, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="70d"/>
            would they not? For they could not be born again if
                    they did not exist, and this would be a sufficient proof that they exist, if it
                    should really be made evident that the living are born only from the dead. But
                    if this is not so then some other argument would be needed.</q>

                    to me to be a sufficient proof that the souls of the dead exist somewhere,

            For if generation did not proceed
                    from opposite to opposite and back again, going round, as it were in a circle,
                    but always went forward in a straight line without turning back or curving,
                    then, you know, in the end all things would have the same form and be acted upon
                    in the same way and stop being generated at all.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">What do you mean?</q> said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><q type="spoken">It is not at all hard,</q> said Socrates, <q type="spoken">to
                    understand what I mean. For example, if the process of falling asleep existed,
                    but not the opposite process of waking from sleep, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="72c"/>
            in the end, you know, that would make the sleeping Endymion
                    mere nonsense; he would be nowhere, for everything else would be in the same
                    state as he, sound asleep. Or if all thing were mixed together and never
                    separated, the saying of Anaxagoras, all things are chaos, would soon come true.
                    And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all things that have life should die, and,
                    when they had died, the dead should remain in that condition, is it not
                    inevitable that at last all things would be dead 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="72d"/>
            and nothing alive? For if the living were generated from any
                    other things than from the dead, and the living were to die, is there any escape
                    from the final result that all things would be swallowed up in

            our soul did not

                    which is mortal. Now if someone shatters the lyre or cuts and breaks the
                    strings, what if he should maintain by the same argument you employed, that the
                    harmony could not have perished and must still exist? For there would be no
                    possibility that the lyre and its strings, which are of mortal nature, still
                    exist after the strings are broken, and the harmony, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="86b"/>
            which is related and akin to the divine and the immortal,
                    perish before that which is mortal. He would say that the harmony must still
                    exist somewhere, and that the wood and the strings must rot away before anything
                    could happen to it. And I fancy, Socrates, that it must have occurred to your
                    own mind that we believe the soul to be something after this fashion; that our
                    body is strung and held together by heat, cold, moisture, dryness, and the like,
                        
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="86c"/>
            and the soul is a mixture and a harmony
                    of these same elements, when they are well and properly mixed. Now if the soul
                    is a harmony, it is clear that when the body is too much relaxed or is too
                    tightly strung by diseases or other ills, the soul must of necessity perish, no
                    matter how divine it is, like other harmonies in sounds and in all the works of
                    artists, and the remains of each body will endure 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="86d"/>
            a long time until they are burnt or decayed. Now what shall
                    we say to this argument, if anyone claims that the soul, being a mixture of the
                    elements of the body, is the first to perish in what is called
                        death?</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then Socrates, looking keenly at

            For I do not deny that it has
                    been very cleverly, and, if I may say so, conclusively shown that the soul
                    existed before it entered into this bodily form, but it does not seem to me
                    proved that it will still exist when we are dead. I do not agree with Simmias’
                    objection, that the soul is not stronger and more lasting than the body, for I
                    think it is far superior in all such respects. <q type="spoken">Why then,</q> the argument might
                    say, <q type="spoken">do you still disbelieve, when you see that after a man dies 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="87b"/>
            the weaker part still exists? Do you not think the
                    stronger part must necessarily be preserved during the same length of time?</q> Now
                    see if my reply to this has any sense. I think I may, like Simmias, best express
                    myself in a figure. It seems to me that it is much as if one should say about an
                    old weaver who had died, that the man had not perished but was safe and sound
                    somewhere, and should offer as a proof of this the fact that the cloak which the
                    man had woven and used to wear was still whole and had not perished. Then if
                    anyone did not believe him, he would ask 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="87c"/>
            which lasts longer, a man or a cloak that is in use and wear, and when the
                    answer was given that a man lasts much longer, he would think it had been proved
                    beyond a doubt that the man was safe, because that which was less lasting had
                    not perished.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But I do not think he is
                    right, Simmias, and I ask you especially to notice what I say. Anyone can
                    understand that a man who says this is talking nonsense. For the weaver in
                    question wove and wore out many such cloaks and 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="87d"/>
            lasted longer than they, though they were many, but
                    perished, I suppose, before the last one. Yet a man is not feebler or weaker
                    than a cloak on that account at all. And I think the same figure would apply to
                    the soul and the body and it would be quite appropriate to say in like manner
                    about them, that the soul lasts a long time, but the body lasts a shorter time
                    and is weaker. And, one might go on to say that each soul wears out many bodies,
                    especially if the man lives many years. For if the body is constantly changing
                    and being destroyed while the man still lives, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="87e"/>
            and the soul is always weaving anew that which wears out, then when the soul
                    perishes it must necessarily have on its last garment, and this only will
                    survive it, and when the soul has perished, then the body will at once show its
                    natural weakness and will quickly disappear in decay.</q></said></p></div>

                    before we were born, but also that there is nothing to prevent some of them from
                    continuing to exist and from being born and dying again many times after we are
                    dead, because the soul is naturally so strong that it can endure repeated
                    births,—even allowing this, one might not grant that it does not suffer by
                    its many births and does not finally perish altogether in one of its deaths.

            But he might say that no one knows
                    beforehand the particular death and the particular dissolution of the body which
                    brings destruction to the soul, for none of us can perceive that. Now if this is
                    the case, anyone who feels confident about death has a foolish confidence,
                    unless he can show that the soul is altogether immortal and imperishable.
                    Otherwise a man who is about to die must always fear that his soul will perish

                    and that this was death—the destruction of the soul, since the body is

            For surely you will not accept your own

                    composed of things that do not yet exist? For harmony is not what your
                    comparison assumes it to be. The lyre and the strings and the sounds 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="92c"/>
            come into being in a tuneless condition, and the
                    harmony is the last of all to be composed and the first to perish. So how can

         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="92d"/>
            and attractive, which is the
                    reason why many men hold it. I am conscious that those arguments which base
                    their demonstrations on mere probability are deceptive, and if we are not on our
                    guard against them they deceive us greatly, in geometry and in all other things.
                    But the theory of recollection and knowledge has been established by a sound
                    course of argument. For we agreed that our soul before it entered into the body
                    existed just as the very essence which is called the absolute exists.

            and immortal, if the philosopher, who is
                    confident in the face of death and who thinks that after death he will fare
                    better in the other world than if he had lived his life differently, is not to
                    find his confidence senseless and foolish. And although we show that the soul is
                    strong and godlike and existed before we men were born as men, all this, you
                    say, may bear witness not to immortality, but only to the fact that the soul
                    lasts a long while, and existed somewhere an immeasurably long time before our
                    birth, and knew and did various things; yet it was none the more immortal for

                    or fire by which we think? Or is it none of these, and does the brain furnish
                    the sensations of hearing and sight and smell, and do memory and opinion arise
                    from these, and does knowledge come from memory and opinion in a state of rest?

            how these

                    finally I made up my mind that I was by nature totally unfitted for this kind of
                    investigation. And I will give you a sufficient proof of this. I was so
                    completely blinded by these studies that I lost the knowledge that I, and others

                    the appropriate thing is added to each of his other parts, then the small bulk
                    becomes greater and the small man large. That is what I used to think. Doesn’t

                    then two, and when they were brought near each other this juxtaposition was the
                    cause of their becoming two. And I cannot yet believe that if one is divided,

                    day I heard a man reading from a book, as he said, by Anaxagoras, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="97c"/>
            that it is the mind that arranges and causes all
                    things. I was pleased with this theory of cause, and it seemed to me to be
                    somehow right that the mind should be the cause of all things, and I thought,
                    <q type="thought">If this is so, the mind in arranging things arranges everything and establishes
                    each thing as it is best for it to be. So if anyone wishes to find the cause of
                    the generation or destruction or existence of a particular thing, he must find
                    out what sort of existence, or passive state of any kind, or activity is best
                    for it. And therefore in respect to 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="97d"/>
            that
                    particular thing, and other things too, a man need examine nothing but what is
                    best and most excellent; for then he will necessarily know also what is
                    inferior, since the science of both is the same.</q> As I considered these things I
                    was delighted to think that I had found in Anaxagoras a teacher of the cause of
                    things quite to my mind, and I thought he would tell me whether the earth is
                    flat or round, and when 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="97e"/>
            he had told me that,
                    would go on to explain the cause and the necessity of it, and would tell me the
                    nature of the best and why it is best for the earth to be as it is; and if he
                    said the earth was in the center, he would proceed to show that it is best for
                    it to be in the center; and I had made up my mind that <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="98"/>
            
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="98a"/>
            if he made those things clear to
            me, I would no longer yearn for any other kind of cause.</q></said></p></div>

                    the active or passive condition of each of them is for the best. For I never

                    what is best for each and what is good for all in common. I prized my hopes very
                    highly, and I seized the books very eagerly and read them as fast as I could,
                    that I might know as fast as I could about the best and the worst.

                    causes for the ordering of things, but mentioned as causes air and ether and
                    water and many other absurdities. And it seemed to me it was very much as if one
                    should say that Socrates does with intelligence whatever he does, and then, in
                    trying to give the causes of the particular thing I do, should say first that I
                    am now sitting here because my body is composed of bones and sinews, and the
                    bones are hard and have joints which divide them and the sinews

            can be contracted and relaxed and, with the flesh
                    and the skin which contains them all, are laid about the bones; and so, as the
                    bones are hung loose in their ligaments, the sinews, by relaxing and
                    contracting, make me able to bend my limbs now, and that is the cause of my
                    sitting here with my legs bent. Or as if in the same way he should give voice
                    and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our

            and that I act with intelligence
                    but not from the choice of what is best, would be an extremely careless way of
                    talking. Whoever talks in that way is unable to make a distinction and to see
                    that in reality a cause is one thing, and the thing without which the cause
                    could never be a cause is quite another thing. And so it seems to me that most
                    people, when they give the name of cause to the latter, are groping in the dark,
                    as it were, and are giving it a name that does not belong to it. And so one man
                    makes the earth stay below the heavens by putting a vortex about it, and another
                    regards the earth as a flat trough supported on a foundation of air; but they do

            that, if the soul is immortal, we
                    must care for it, not only in respect to this time, which we call life, but in
                    respect to all time, and if we neglect it, the danger now appears to be
                    terrible. For if death were an escape from everything, it would be a boon to the
                    wicked, for when they die they would be freed from the body and from their
                    wickedness together with their souls. But now, since the soul is seen to be
                    immortal, it cannot escape

                    soul takes with it to the other world nothing but its education and nurture, and
                    these are said to benefit or injure the departed greatly from the very beginning
                    of his journey thither. And so it is said that after death, the tutelary genius
                    of each person, to whom he had been allotted in life, leads him to a place where
                    the dead are gathered together; then they are judged and depart to the other

            for he says a simple path leads to the lower world,
                    but I think the path is neither simple nor single, for if it were, there would
                    be no need of guides, since no one could miss the way to any place if there were
                    only one road. But really there seem to be many forks of the road and many

                    Now the orderly and wise soul follows its guide and understands its

                    at the place where the other souls are, the soul which is impure and has done
                    wrong, by committing wicked murders or other deeds akin to those and the works
                    of kindred souls, is avoided and shunned by all, and no one is willing to be its

                    through life in purity and righteousness, finds gods for companions and guides,
                    and goes to dwell in its proper dwelling. Now there are many wonderful regions

                    For I believe there are in all directions on the earth many hollows of very
                    various forms and sizes, into which the water and mist and air have run
                    together; but the earth itself is pure and is situated in the pure heaven in

                    perceive that we live in the hollows, but think we live on the upper surface of
                    the earth, just as if someone who lives in the depth of the ocean should think
                    he lived on the surface of the sea, and, seeing the sun and the stars through
                    the water, should think the sea was the sky, and should, by reason of

                    heard from anyone who had seen, how much purer and fairer it is than the world
                    he lived in. I believe this is just the case with us; for we dwell in a hollow

            is that this liquid matter has no bottom
                    or foundation. So it oscillates and waves up and down, and the air and wind
                    about it do the same; for they follow the liquid both when it moves toward the
                    other side of the earth and when it moves toward this side, and just as the
                    breath of those who breathe blows in and out, so the wind there oscillates with
                    the liquid and causes terrible and irresistible blasts as it rushes in and out.

            And when the water retires to the region
                    which we call the lower, it flows into the rivers there and fills them up, as if
                    it were pumped into them; and when it leaves that region and comes back to this
                    side, it fills the rivers here; and when the streams are filled they flow
                    through the passages and through the earth and come to the various places to
                    which their different paths lead, where they make seas and marshes, and rivers
                    and springs. Thence they go down again under the earth,

            some passing around many great regions and others around
                    fewer and smaller places, and flow again into Tartarus, some much below the
                    point where they were sucked out, and some only a little; but all flow in below
                    their exit. Some flow in on the side from which they flowed out, others on the
                    opposite side; and some pass completely around in a circle, coiling about the
                    earth once or several times, like serpents, then descend to the lowest possible
                    depth and fall again into the chasm.

                    many times underground, it flows into Tartarus at a lower level. This is the
                    river which is called Pyriphlegethon, and the streams of lava which spout up at
                    various places on earth are offshoots from it. Opposite this the fourth river

                    Acherusian lake. And the water of this river also mingles with no other water,
                    but this also passes round in a circle and falls into Tartarus opposite
                    Pyriphlegethon. And the name of this river, as the Poets say, is Cocytus.

                    genius, first they are judged and sentenced, as they have lived well and

                    them, and in the meantime have eaten and drunk and some of them enjoyed the
                    society of those whom they loved. Do not hurry; for there is still
                    time.</q></said></p></div>

                            <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Socrates said: <q type="spoken">Crito,
                    those whom you mention are right in doing as they do, for they think they gain
                    by it; and I shall be right in not doing as they do; <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="117"/>
            
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="117a"/>
            for I think I should gain
                    nothing by taking the poison a little later. I should only make myself
                    ridiculous in my own eyes if I clung to life and spared it, when there is no
                    more profit in it. Come,</q> he said, <q type="spoken">do as I ask and do not
                        refuse.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thereupon Crito nodded to the
                    boy who was standing near. The boy went out and stayed a long time, then came
                    back with the man who was to administer the poison, which he brought with him in
                    a cup ready for use. And when Socrates saw him, he said: <q type="spoken">Well, my good
                    man, you know about these things; what must I do?</q> <q type="spoken">Nothing,</q>
                    he replied, <q type="spoken">except drink the poison and walk about 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="117b"/>
            till your legs feel heavy; then lie down, and the poison
                    will take effect of itself.</q><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At the same
                    time he held out the cup to Socrates. He took it, and very gently, Echecrates,
                    without trembling or changing color or expression, but looking up at the man
                    with wide open eyes, as was his custom, said: <q type="spoken">What do you say about
                    pouring a libation to some deity from this cup? May I, or not?</q>
                    <q type="spoken">Socrates,</q> said he, <q type="spoken">we prepare only as much as we think is
                    enough.</q> <q type="spoken">I understand,</q> said Socrates; 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="117c"/>
            <q type="spoken">but I may and must pray to the gods that my departure
                    hence be a fortunate one; so I offer this prayer, and may it be granted.</q>
                    With these words he raised the cup to his lips and very cheerfully and quietly
                    drained it. Up to that time most of us had been able to restrain our tears
                    fairly well, but when we watched him drinking and saw that he had drunk the
                    poison, we could do so no longer, but in spite of myself my tears rolled down in
                    floods, so that I wrapped my face in my cloak and wept for myself; for it was
                    not for him that I wept, 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="117d"/>
            but for my own
                    misfortune in being deprived of such a friend. Crito had got up and gone away
                    even before I did, because he could not restrain his tears. But Apollodorus, who
                    had been weeping all the time before, then wailed aloud in his grief and made us
                    all break down, except Socrates himself. But he said, <q type="spoken">What conduct is
                    this, you strange men! I sent the women away chiefly for this very reason, that
                    they might not behave in this absurd way; for I have heard that 
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="117e"/>
            it is best to die in silence. Keep quiet and be
                    brave.</q> Then we were ashamed and controlled our tears. He walked about
                    and, when he said his legs were heavy, lay down on his back, for such was the
                    advice of the attendant. The man who had administered the poison laid his hands
                    on him and after a while examined his feet and legs, then pinched his foot hard
                    and asked if he felt it.  He said <q type="spoken">No</q>;</said></p></div>
                    
                    
                    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" resp="perseus" n="118">  
                      <p><said who="#Phaedo" rend="merge"><label>Phaedo.</label> 
                            then after that, <milestone unit="page" resp="Stephanus" n="118"/>
            
         
         <milestone unit="section" resp="Stephanus" n="118a"/>
            his thighs; and
                    passing upwards in this way he showed us that he was growing cold and rigid. And
                    again he touched him and said that when it reached his heart, he would be gone.
                    The chill had now reached the region about the groin, and uncovering his face,
                    which had been covered, he said—and these were his last
                    words—<q type="spoken">Crito, we owe a cock to Aesculapius. Pay it and do not
                    neglect it.</q> <q type="spoken">That,</q> said Crito, <q type="spoken">shall be done; but see
                    if you have anything else to say.</q> To this question he made no reply, but
                    after a little while he moved; the attendant uncovered him; his eyes were fixed.
                    And Crito when he saw it, closed his mouth and eyes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, who was, as we may
                    say, of all those of his time whom we have known, the best and wisest and most
                    righteous man.</said></p></div>
