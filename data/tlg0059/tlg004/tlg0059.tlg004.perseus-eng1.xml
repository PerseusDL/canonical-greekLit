            <said who="#Echecrates">Yes, some one told us about that, and we wondered that although it took place a
                    long time ago, he was put to death much later. Now why was that, Phaedo?

            <said who="#Phaedo">It was a matter of chance, Echecrates. It happened that the stern of the ship
                    which the Athenians send to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> was
                    crowned on the day before the trial.</said>
            <said who="#Echecrates">What ship is this?</said>
            <said who="#Phaedo">This is the ship, as the Athenians say, in which Theseus once went to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> with the fourteen </said>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="58b">
            <said who="#Phaedo">youths and maidens, and saved them and himself. Now the
                    Athenians made a vow to Apollo, as the story goes, that if they were saved they
                    would send a mission every year to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. And from that time even to the present day they send it
                    annually in honor of the god. Now it is their law that after the mission begins
                    the city must be pure and no one may be publicly executed until the ship has
                    gone to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and back; and

                    this takes a long time. The beginning of the mission is when the priest of
                    Apollo crowns the stern of the ship; and this took place, as I say, on the day
                    before the trial. For that reason Socrates passed a long time in prison between
                    his trial and his death.</said>
            <said who="#Echecrates">What took place at his death, Phaedo? What was said and done? And which of his
                    friends were with him? Or did the authorities forbid them to be present, so that
                    he died without his friends? </said>

                    not too busy.</said>
            <said who="#Phaedo">I am not busy and I will try to tell you. It is always my greatest pleasure to be
                    reminded of Socrates whether by speaking of him myself or by listening to
                    someone else.</said>
            <said who="#Echecrates">Well, Phaedo, you will have hearers who feel as you do; so try to tell us

                    pity as I might naturally be when present at the death of a friend; since he
                    seemed to me to be happy, both in his bearing and his words, he was meeting
                    death so fearlessly and nobly. And so I thought that even in going to the abode
                    of the dead he was not going without the protection of the gods, and that when
                    he arrived there <milestone unit="page" n="59"/>

                    And for this reason I was not at all filled with pity, as might seem natural
                    when I was present at a scene of mourning; nor on the other hand did I feel
                    pleasure because we were occupied with philosophy, as was our custom—and
                    our talk was of philosophy;—but a very strange feeling came over me, an
                    unaccustomed mixture of pleasure and of pain together, when I thought that
                    Socrates was presently to die. And all of us who were there were in much the
                    same condition, sometimes laughing and sometimes weeping; especially one of us,
                    Apollodorus; you know him </said>

            <said who="#Echecrates">Who were these, Phaedo?</said>
            <said who="#Phaedo">Of native Athenians there was this Apollodorus, and Critobulus and his father,
                    and Hermogenes and Epiganes and Aeschines and Antisthenes; and Ctesippus the
                    Paeanian was there too, and Menexenus and some other Athenians. But Plato, I
                    think, was ill. </said>

            <said who="#Phaedo">I and the others had always been in the
                    habit of visiting Socrates. We used to meet at daybreak in the court where the
                    trial took place, for it was near the prison; and every day we used to wait
                    about, talking with each other, until the prison was opened, for it was not
                    opened early; and when it was opened, we went in to Socrates and passed most of
                    the day with him. On that day we came together earlier; for the day before,

                    heard that the ship had arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. So we agreed to come to the usual place as early in the
                    morning as possible. And we came, and the jailer who usually answered the door
                    came out and told us to wait and not go in until he told us. “For,”
                    he said, “the eleven are releasing Socrates from his fetters and giving
                    directions how he is to die today.” So after a little delay he came and

                    Xanthippe—you know her—with his little son in her arms, sitting
                    beside him. Now when Xanthippe saw us, she cried out and said the kind of thing
                    that women always do say: “Oh Socrates, this is the last time now that
                    your friends will speak to you or you to them.” And Socrates glanced at
                    Crito and said, “Crito, let somebody take her home.”<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And some of Crito's people took her away wailing

                    up on his couch and bent his leg and rubbed it with his hand, and while he was
                    rubbing it, he said, “What a strange thing, my friends, that seems to be
                    which men call pleasure! How wonderfully it is related to that which seems to be
                    its opposite, pain, in that they will not both come to a man at the same time,
                    and yet if he pursues the one and captures it he is generally obliged to take
                    the other also, as if the two were joined together in one head. And I
                    think,” </said>

         <div type="section" n="60c">
            <said who="#Phaedo">he said, “if Aesop had
                    thought of them, he would have made a fable telling how they were at war and god
                    wished to reconcile them, and when he could not do that, he fastened their heads
                    together, and for that reason, when one of them comes to anyone, the other
                    follows after. Just so it seems that in my case, after pain was in my leg on
                    account of the fetter, pleasure appears to have come following
                        after.”<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Here Cebes interrupted and said,

                    me the day before yesterday why you never wrote any poetry before, composed
                    these verses after you came to prison. Now, if you care that I should be able to
                    answer Evenus when he asks me again—and I know he will ask me—tell
                    me what to say.”<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>“Then tell him,

                    repeated commands meant that I must cultivate the Muses in this way. They were
                    something like this. The same dream came to me often in my past life, sometimes
                    in one form and sometimes in another, but always saying the same thing:
                    'Socrates,' it said, 'make music and work at it.' And I formerly thought it was

                    service in which the gods, who are the best overseers in the world, are watching
                    over them. A wise man certainly does not think that when he is free he can take
                    better care of himself than they do. A foolish man might perhaps think so, that

                    yet, Socrates, if we look at it in this way, the contrary of what we just said

                    harmony could not have perished and must still exist? For there would be no
                    possibility that the lyre and its strings, which are of mortal nature, still

                    exist somewhere, and that the wood and the strings must rot away before anything
                    could happen to it. And I fancy, Socrates, that it must have occurred to your
                    own mind that we believe the soul to be something after this fashion; that our
                    body is strung and held together by heat, cold, moisture, dryness, and the like,

                    defence of our reasoning. Come, Cebes,” said he, “tell us what it

                    proved that it will still exist when we are dead. I do not agree with Simmias'
                    objection, that the soul is not stronger and more lasting than the body, for I
                    think it is far superior in all such respects. 'Why then,' the argument might

                    see if my reply to this has any sense. I think I may, like Simmias, best express
                    myself in a figure. It seems to me that it is much as if one should say about an
                    old weaver who had died, that the man had not perished but was safe and sound
                    somewhere, and should offer as a proof of this the fact that the cloak which the
                    man had woven and used to wear was still whole and had not perished. Then if
                    anyone did not believe him, he would ask </said>

         <div type="section" n="87c">
            <said who="#Phaedo">which lasts longer, a man or a cloak that is in use and wear, and when the
                    answer was given that a man lasts much longer, he would think it had been proved
                    beyond a doubt that the man was safe, because that which was less lasting had
                    not perished.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>“But I do not think he is
                    right, Simmias, and I ask you especially to notice what I say. Anyone can
                    understand that a man who says this is talking nonsense. For the weaver in
                    question wove and wore out many such cloaks and </said>

                    than a cloak on that account at all. And I think the same figure would apply to
                    the soul and the body and it would be quite appropriate to say in like manner
                    about them, that the soul lasts a long time, but the body lasts a shorter time
                    and is weaker. And, one might go on to say that each soul wears out many bodies,
                    especially if the man lives many years. For if the body is constantly changing

                    natural weakness and will quickly disappear in decay. And so we are not yet

                    continuing to exist and from being born and dying again many times after we are
                    dead, because the soul is naturally so strong that it can endure repeated

                    this, you strange men! I sent the women away chiefly for this very reason, that
                    they might not behave in this absurd way; for I have heard that </said>

                    and, when he said his legs were heavy, lay down on his back, for such was the
                    advice of the attendant. The man who had administered the poison laid his hands
                    on him and after a while examined his feet and legs, then pinched his foot hard
                    and asked if he felt it. He said “No”; then after that, <milestone unit="page" n="118"/>

                    neglect it.” “That,” said Crito, “shall be done; but see
                    if you have anything else to say.” To this question he made no reply, but
                    after a little while he moved; the attendant uncovered him; his eyes were fixed.
                    And Crito when he saw it, closed his mouth and eyes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, who was, as we may
