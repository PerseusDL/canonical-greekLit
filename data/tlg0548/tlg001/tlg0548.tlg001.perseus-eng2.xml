								world.<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">According
								to Hesiod (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 126">Hes. Th. 126ff.</bibl>), Sky
								(Uranus) was a son of Earth (Gaia), but afterwards lay with his own
								mother and had by her Cronus, the giants, the Cyclopes, and so
								forth. As to the marriage of Sky and Earth, see the fragment of
									<bibl>Eur. Chrys., quoted by Sextus Empiricus, Bekker p. 751
									(Nauck TGF(2), p. 633, Leipsig, 1889)</bibl>; <bibl n="Lucr. 1.150">Lucretius i.250ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Lucr. 1.991">ii.991ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.325">Verg. G.
									2.325ff.</bibl> The myth of such a marriage is widespread among
								the lower races. See <bibl>E. B. Tylor, <title>Primitive
										Culture</title> (London, 1873), i.321ff., ii.370ff.</bibl>
								For example, the Ewe people of Togo-land, in West Africa, think that
								the Earth is the wife of the Sky, and that their marriage takes
								place in the rainy season, when the rain causes the seeds to sprout
								and bear fruit. These fruits they regard as the children of Mother
								Earth, who in their opinion is the mother also of men and of gods,
								see <bibl>J. Spieth, <title>Die Ewe-Stämme</title> (Berlin, 1906),
									pp. 464, 548</bibl>. In the regions of the <name type="place" key="tgn,1000189">Senegal</name> and the <name type="place" key="tgn,1000181">Niger</name> it is believed that the Sky-god
								and the Earth-goddess are the parents of the principal spirits who
								dispense life and death, weal and woe, among mankind. See
									<bibl>Maurice Delafosse, <title>Haut-Sénégal-Niger</title>
									(Paris, 1912), iii.173ff.</bibl> Similarly the Manggerai, a
								people of West Flores, in the Indian Archipelago, personify Sky and
								Earth as husband and wife; the consummation of their marriage is
								manifested in the rain, which fertilizes Mother Earth, so that she
								gives birth to her children, the produce of the fields and the
								fruits of the trees. The sky is called <hi rend="ital">langīt</hi>;
								it is the male power: the earth is called <hi rend="ital">alang</hi>; it is the female power. Together they form a divine
								couple, called <hi rend="ital">Moerī Kraèng</hi>. See <bibl>H. B.
									Stapel, “Het Manggeraische Volk (West Flores),”
										<title>Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-Landen
										Volkenkunde</title>, lvi. (Batavia and the Hague, 1914), p.
									163</bibl>.</note> And having wedded Earth, he begat first the

							fifty heads.<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Compare
									<bibl n="Hes. Th. 147">Hes. Th. 147ff.</bibl> Instead of Gyes,
								some MSS. of Hesiod read Gyges, and this form of the name is
								supported by the <bibl>Scholiast on Plat. Laws 7, 795c</bibl>.

								distinguishes Ortygia from <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>, and says that, while Apollo was born in <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>, Artemis was born
								in Ortygia. Thus distinguished from <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>, the island of Ortygia is
								probably to be identified, as Strabo thought, with Rhenia, an
								uninhabited island a little way from <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>, where were the graves of the
								Delians; for no dead body might be buried or burnt in <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name> (<bibl n="Strab. 10.5.5">Strab. 10.5.5</bibl>). Not only so, but it was
								not even lawful either to be born or to die in <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>; expectant mothers and dying
								folk were ferried across to Rhenia, there to give birth or to die.
								However, Rhenia is so near the sacred isle that when Polycrates,
								tyrant of <name type="place" key="tgn,7002673">Samos</name>,
								dedicated it to the Delian Apollo, he connected the two islands by a
								chain. See <bibl n="Thuc. 3.104">Thuc. 3.104</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod. 12.58.1">Diod. 12.58.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 2.27.1">Paus. 2.27.1</bibl>. The notion that either a birth or a death

								Nit), who offered him fruits, bread, and water, and that, if he
								accepted them, he could return to earth no more. See <bibl>G.
									Maspero, <title>Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de l'Orient

								say that when a man dies, messengers come from the other world to
								guide his soul through the air and over the sea to the spirit land.
								Arrived there, he is welcomed by the other souls and bidden to a
								banquet, where he is offered food, especially bananas. If he tastes
								them, his doom is fixed for ever: he cannot return to earth. See the
								missionary <bibl>Gagniere, in <title>Annales de la Propagation de la
										Foi</title>, xxxii. (Lyons, 1860), pp. 439ff.</bibl> The
								Eastern Melanesians believe that living people can go down to the
								land of the dead and return alive to the upper world. Persons who
								have done so relate how in the nether world they were warned by
								friendly ghosts to eat nothing there. See <bibl>R. H. Codrington,
										<title>The Melanesians</title> (Oxford, 1891), pp. 277,
									286</bibl>. Similar beliefs prevail and similar tales are told
								among the Maoris of <name type="place" key="tgn,1000226">New
									Zealand</name>. For example, a woman who believed that she had
								died and passed to the spirit land, related on her return how there
								she met with her dead father, who said to her, “You must go back to
								the earth, for there is no one now left to take care of my
								grandchild. But remember, if you once eat food in this place, you
								can never more return to life; so beware not to taste anything
								offered to you.” See <bibl>E. Shortland, <title>Traditions and
										Superstitions of the New Zealanders</title> (London, 1856),
									pp. 150-152</bibl>. Again, they tell of a great chief named
								Hutu, who performed the same perilous journey. On reaching the place
								of departed spirits he encountered a certain being called Hine nui
								te po, that is, Great Mother Night, of whom he inquired the way down
								to the nether world. She pointed it out to him and gave him a basket
								of cooked food, saying, “When you reach the lower regions, eat
								sparingly of your provisions that they may last, and you may not be
								compelled to partake of their food, for if you do, you cannot return
								upwards again.” See <bibl>R. Taylor, <title>Te Ika A Maui, or New
										Zealand and its Inhabitants</title>, 2nd ed. (London, 1870),
									p. 271</bibl>. And the same rule holds good of fairyland, into
								which living people sometimes stray or are enticed to their sorrow.
								“Wise people recommend that, in the circumstances, a man should not
								utter a word till he comes out again, nor, on any account, taste
								fairy food or drink. If he abstains he is very likely before long
								dismissed, but if he indulges he straightway loses the will and the

								Frazer's Appendix to Apollodorus, “Myths of the Origin of Fire.” The
								plant (<foreign xml:lang="grc">na/rqhc</foreign>) in which Prometheus
								is said to have carried the stolen fire is commonly identified with
								the giant fennel (Ferula communis). See <bibl>L. Whibley,
										<title>Companion to Greek Studies</title> (Cambridge, 1916),
									p. 67</bibl>. Tournefort found the plant growing abundantly in
								Skinosa, the ancient Schinussa, a small deserted island south of
									<name type="place" key="perseus,Naxos,Sicily">Naxos</name>
									(<bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. iv.68</bibl>). He describes the stalk
								as about five feet high and three inches thick, with knots and
								branches at intervals of about ten inches, the whole being covered
								with a tolerably hard rind. “This stalk is filled with a white pith,
								which, being very dry, catches fire just like a wick; the fire keeps
								alight perfectly in the stalk and consumes the pith only gradually,
								without damaging the rind; hence people use this plant to carry fire
								from one place to another; our sailors laid in a supply of it. This
								custom is of great antiquity, and may serve to explain a passage in
								Hesiod, who, speaking of the fire which Prometheus stole from
								heaven, says that he carried it away in a stalk of fennel.” He tells
								us, further, that the Greeks still call the plant nartheca. See
									<bibl>P. de Tournefort, <title>Relation d'un Voyage du
										Levant</title> (Amsterdam, 1718), i.93</bibl>. The plant is

									231</bibl>. In <name type="place" key="perseus,Naxos,Sicily">Naxos</name> Mr. J. T. Bent saw orange gardens divided by
								hedges of tall reeds, and he adds: “In Lesbos this reed is still
								called <foreign xml:lang="grc">na/rqhka (na/rqhc)</foreign>, a
								survival of the old word for the reed by which Prometheus brought
								down fire from heaven. One can understand the idea well: a peasant
								today who wishes to carry a light from one house to another will put
								it into one of these reeds to prevent its being blown out.” See
									<bibl>J. T. Bent, <title>The Cyclades</title> (London, 1885), p.
									365</bibl>. Perhaps Bent mistook fennel for a reed. The
								rationalistic Diodorus Siculus explained the myth of the theft of
								fire by saying that Prometheus was the inventor of the fire-sticks,
								by the friction of which against each other fire is kindled. See
									<bibl>Diod. 5.67.2</bibl>. But Greek tradition attributed the

								madness by which the <name type="place" key="tgn,5001993">Argive</name> women, or some portion of them, were temporarily

								insanity to which the women of the wild Jakun tribe in the <name type="place" key="tgn,7018618">Malay Peninsula</name> are said
								to be liable. “A curious complaint was made to the Penghulu of

								by a kind of madness—presumably some form of hysteria— and that they
								ran off singing into the jungle, each woman by herself, and stopped
								there for several days and nights, finally returning almost naked,
								or with their clothes all torn to shreds. He said that the first
								outbreak of this kind occurred a few years ago, and that they were
								still frequent, one usually taking place every two or three months.
								They were started by one of the women, whereupon all the others

								and <bibl>Tzetzes, Chiliades ii.353ff.</bibl>, both of whom,
								however, may have had the present passage of Apollodorus before
								them. It is possible that the period refers to the eight years'
								cycle, which figured prominently in the religious calendar of the
								ancient Greeks; for example, the Pythian games were originally held
								at intervals of eight years. See <bibl>Geminus, Element. Astron.
									viii.25ff., ed. C. Manitius</bibl>; <bibl>Censorinus, De die
									natali 18</bibl>. It is to be remembered that the period of
								service performed by Herakles for Eurystheus was an expiation for
								the murder of his children (see <bibl n="Apollod. 2.4.12">Apollod.
									2.4.12</bibl>). Now Cadmus is said to have served Ares for eight
								years as an expiation for the slaughter of the dragon, the offspring
								of Ares (see <bibl n="Apollod. 3.4.2">Apollod. 3.4.2</bibl>). But in
								those days, we are told, the “eternal year” comprised eight common
								years (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.4.2">Apollod. 3.4.2</bibl>). Now Apollo
								served Admetus for a year as an expiation for the slaughter of the
								Cyclopes (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.4">Apollod. 3.10.4</bibl>); but
								according to <bibl n="Serv. A. 7.761">Serv. Verg. A. 7.761</bibl>,
								the period of Apollo's service was not one but nine years. In making
								this statement Servius, or his authority, probably had before him a
								Greek author, who mentioned an <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)nneathri/s</foreign> as the period of Apollo's service. But
								though <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)nneathri/s</foreign> means literally
								“nine years,” the period, in consequence of the Greek mode of
								reckoning, was actually equivalent to eight years (compare
									<bibl>Celsus, De die natali 18.4</bibl>, “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Octaeteris facta, quae tunc enneateris vocitata, quia primus
									eius annus nono quoque anno redibat</foreign>.”) These legends
								about the servitude of Cadmus, Apollo, and Herakles for eight years,
								render it probable that in ancient times Greek homicides were
								banished for eight years, and had during that time to do penance by
								serving a foreigner. Now this period of eight years was called a
								“great year” (<bibl>Censorinus, De die natali 18.5</bibl>), and the
								period of banishment for a homicide was regularly a year. See <bibl n="Apollod. 2.8.3">Apollod. 2.8.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 34">Eur. Hipp.34-37</bibl>, <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1643">Eur. Or. 1643-1645</bibl>; <bibl>Nicolaus

                           </bibl>. Hence it seems probable that, though in later times the
								period of a homicide's banishment was a single ordinary year, it may
								formerly have been a “great year,” or period of eight ordinary
								years. It deserves to be noted that any god who had forsworn himself
								by the Styx had to expiate his fault by silence and fasting for a
								full year, after which he was banished the company of the gods for
								nine years (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 793">Hes. Th. 793-804ff.</bibl>); and
								further that any man who partook of human flesh in the rites of
								Lycaean Zeus was supposed to be turned into a wolf for nine years.
								See <bibl n="Paus. 8.2">Paus. 8.2</bibl>; <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist.
									viii.81</bibl>; <bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei
								xviii.17</bibl>. These notions point to a nine years' period of
								expiation, which may have been observed in some places instead of
								the eight years' period. In the present passage of Apollodorus, the
								addition of a month to the eight years' period creates a difficulty
								which I am unable to explain. Ancient mathematicians defined a
								“great year” as the period at the end of which the sun, moon, and
								planets again occupy the same positions relatively to each other
								which they occupied at the beginning; but on the length of the
								period opinions were much divided. See <bibl>Cicero, De natura
									deorum ii.20.51ff.</bibl> Different, apparently, from the “great
								year” was the “revolving” (<foreign xml:lang="lat">vertens</foreign>) or
								“mundane” (<foreign xml:lang="lat">mundanus</foreign>) year, which was
								the period at the end of which, not only the sun, moon, and planets,
								but also the so-called fixed stars again occupy the positions
								relatively to each other which they occupied at the beginning; for
								the ancients recognized that the so-called fixed stars do move,
								though their motion is imperceptible to our senses. The length of a
								“revolving” or “mundane” year was calculated by ancient physicists
								at fifteen thousand years. See <bibl>Cicero, Somnium Scipionis 7,

								that of Apollodorus seems to show that here, as in many other
								places, our author followed Pherecydes. The account given by
								Pherecydes of the origin of the golden apples is as follows. When
								Zeus married Hera, the gods brought presents to the bride. Among the
								rest, Earth brought golden apples, which Hera so much admired that
								she ordered them to be planted in the garden of the gods beside
								Mount Atlas. But, as the daughters of Atlas used to pilfer the
								golden fruit, she set a huge serpent to guard the tree. Such is the
								story told, on the authority of Pherecydes, by Eratosthenes,
									<bibl>Hyginus, Astr. ii.3</bibl>, and the Scholiast on the
								Aratea of Germanicus.</note> for he did not acknowledge the labour

								authority cited by the <bibl>Scholiast on Ap. Rhod., Argon.
									iv.1396</bibl>. <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 56</bibl> adds that the seer
								Phrasius, who advised the sacrifice, was a brother of Pygmalion.
								Herodotus, without mentioning Busiris, scouts the story on the
								ground that human sacrifices were utterly alien to the spirit of
								Egyptian religion (<bibl n="Hdt. 2.45">Hdt. 2.45</bibl>). Isocrates
								also discredited the tradition, in so far as it relates to Herakles,
								because Herakles was four generations younger, and Busiris more than
								two hundred years older, than Perseus. See <bibl n="Isoc. 11.15">Isoc. 11.15</bibl>. Yet there are grounds for thinking that the
								Greek tradition was substantially correct. For Manetho, our highest
								ancient authority, definitely affirmed that in the city of Ilithyia
								it was customary to burn alive “Typhonian men” and to scatter their
								ashes by means of winnowing fans (<bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris
									73</bibl>). These “Typhonian men” were red-haired, because
								Typhon, the Egyptian embodiment of evil, was also redhaired
									(<bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris 30, 33</bibl>). But redhaired men
								would commonly be foreigners, in contrast to the black-haired
								natives of <name type="place" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</name>; and it
								was just foreigners who, according to Greek tradition, were chosen
								as victims. Diodorus Siculus points this out (<bibl>Diod.
									1.88.5</bibl>) in confirmation of the Greek tradition, and he
								tells us that the redhaired men were sacrificed at the grave of
								Osiris, though this statement may be an inference from his etymology
								of the name Busiris, which he explains to mean “grave of Osiris.”
								The etymology is correct, Busiris being a Greek rendering of the
								Egyptian Asir “place of Osiris.” See <bibl>A. Wiedemann,
										<title>Herodots Zweites Buch</title> (Leipsic, 1890), p.
									213</bibl>. Porphyry informs us, on the authority of Manetho,
								that the Egyptian custom of sacrificing human beings at the City of
								the Sun was suppressed by Amosis (Amasis), who ordered waxen
								effigies to be substituted for the victims. He adds that the human
								victims used to be examined just like calves for the sacrifice, and
								that they were sealed in token of their fitness for the altar. See
									<bibl>Porphyry, De abstinentia iii.35</bibl>. Sextus Empiricus
								even speaks of human sacrifices in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</name> as if they were practised down to
								his own time, which was about 200 A.D. See <bibl>Sextus Empiricus,

								human sacrifices in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</name> (<bibl>Athenaeus iv.72, p. 172 D</bibl>). In view
								of these facts, the Greek tradition that the sacrifices were offered
								in order to restore the fertility of the land or to procure rain
								after a long drought, and that on one occasion the king himself was
								the victim, may be not without significance. For kings or chiefs
								have been often sacrificed under similar circumstances (see <bibl n="Apollod. 3.5.1">Apollod. 3.5.1</bibl>; <bibl>

								In order that the will of Zeus, who had sworn never to release

								prisoner from his chains, Prometheus on obtaining his freedom was
								ordered to wear on his finger a ring made out of his iron fetters
								and of the rock to which he had been chained; hence, in memory of
								their saviour's sufferings, men have worn rings ever since. The
								practice of wearing crowns or garlands was explained by some people
								in the same way. See <bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.15</bibl>; <bibl n="Serv. Ecl. 6.42">Serv. Verg. Ecl. 6.42</bibl>; <bibl>Pliny,
									Nat. Hist. xxxvii.2</bibl>; <bibl>Isidore, Orig.

								which the sufferer on regaining his liberty was doomed to wear was a
								crown of willow; and the Carians, who used to crown their brows with
								branches of willow, explained that they did so in imitation of
								Prometheus. See <bibl>Athenaeus xv.11-13, pp. 671-673 EB</bibl>. In
								the present passage of Apollodorus, if the text is correct,
								Herakles, as the deliverer of Prometheus, is obliged to bind himself
								vicariously for the prisoner whom he has released; and he chooses to
								do so with his favourite olive. Similarly he has to find a
								substitute to die instead of Prometheus, and he discovers the
								substitute in Chiron. As to the substitution of Chiron for
								Prometheus, see <bibl n="Apollod. 2.5.4">Apollod. 2.5.4</bibl>. It

								current among ancient writers and illustrated by ancient artists.
								See <bibl>Frazer, note on Paus. 1.4.6 (vol. ii. pp. 75ff.)</bibl>.
								One of these versions, which I omitted to notice in that place, ran
								as follows. On a visit to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>, king Aleus of <name type="place" key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</name> was warned by the oracle that
								his daughter would bear a son who would kill his maternal uncles,
								the sons of Aleus. To guard against this catastrophe, Aleus hurried
								home and appointed his daughter priestess of Athena, declaring that,
								should she prove unchaste, he would put her to death. As chance
								would have it, Herakles arrived at <name type="place" key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</name> on his way to <name type="place" key="perseus,Elis">Elis</name>, where he purposed
								to make war on Augeas. The king entertained him hospitably in the
								sanctuary of Athena, and there the hero, flushed with wine, violated
								the maiden priestess. Learning that she was with child, her father
								Aleus sent for the experienced ferryman Nauplius, father of
								Palamedes, and entrusted his daughter to him to take and drown her.
								On their way to the sea the girl (Auge) gave birth to Telephus on
								Mount Parthenius, and instead of drowning her and the infant the
								ferryman sold them both to king Teuthras in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</name>, who, being childless, married
								Auge and adopted Telephus. See <bibl>Alcidamas, Od. 14-16, pp.
									179ff., ed. Blass</bibl> (appended to his edition of Antiphon).
								This version, which represents mother and child as sold together to
								Teuthras, differs from the version adopted by Apollodorus, according
								to whom Auge alone was sold to Teuthras in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</name>, while her infant son Telephus
								was left behind in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</name> and reared by herdsmen (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.9.1">Apollod. 3.9.1</bibl>). The sons of Aleus and maternal uncles
								of Telephus were Cepheus and Lycurgus (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.9.1">Apollod. 3.9.1</bibl>). Ancient writers do not tell us how
								Telephus fulfilled the oracle by killing them, though the murder is
								mentioned by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 244</bibl> and a Greek
								proverb-writer (<bibl>Paroemiographi Graeci, ed. Leutsch and
									Schneidewin, i. p. 212</bibl>). Sophocles appears to have told
								the story in his lost play, <title>The Mysians</title>; for in it he
								described how Telephus came, silent and speechless, from <name type="place" key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</name> to <name type="place" key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</name> (<bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1460a">Aristot. Poet. 1460a
									32"&gt;P"&gt;Aristot. Poet. 1460a 32</bibl>), and this silence
								of Telephus seems to have been proverbial. For the comic poet
								Alexis, speaking of a greedy parasite who used to gobble up his
								dinner without exchanging a word with anybody, says that, “he dines
								like speechless Telephus, answering all questions put to him only
								with nods” (<bibl>Athenaeus x.18, p. 421 D</bibl>). And another
								comic poet, Amphis, describing the high and mighty airs with which
								fish-mongers treated their customers in the market, says that it was
								a thousand times easier to get speech of a general than of a
								fish-monger; for if you addressed one of these gentry and, pointing
								to a fish, asked “How much?” he would not at first deign to look at
								you, much less speak to you, but would stoop down, silent as
								Telephus, over his wares; though in time, his desire of lucre
								overcoming his contempt of you, he would slap a bloated octopus and
								mutter meditatively, as if soliloquizing, “ Sixpence for him, and a
								bob for the hammerfish.” This latter poet explains incidentally why
								Telephus was silent; he says it was very natural that fish-mongers
								should hold their tongue, “for all homicides are in the same case,”
								thus at once informing us of a curious point in Greek law or custom
								and gratifying his spite at the “cursed fish-mongers,” whom he
								compares to the worst class of criminals. See <bibl>Athenaeus vi.5,
									p. 224 DE</bibl>. As Greek homicides were supposed to be haunted
								by the ghosts of their victims until a ceremony of purification was
								performed which rid them of their invisible, but dangerous,
								pursuers, we may conjecture that the rule of silence had to be
								observed by them until the accomplishment of the purificatory rite
								released them from the restrictions under which they laboured during
								their uncleanness, and permitted them once more to associate freely
								with their fellows. As to the restrictions imposed on homicides in
								ancient <name type="place" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</name>, see <bibl>
                              <title>Psyche's Task</title>, 2nd ed. pp. 113ff.</bibl>; <bibl>
                              <title>Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</title>, i.80,
									83ff.</bibl> The motive of the homicide's silence may have been
								a fear lest by speaking he should attract the attention, and draw
								down on himself the vengeance, of his victim's ghost. Similarly,
								among certain peoples, a widow is bound to observe silence for some
								time after her husband's death, and the rule appears to be based on
								a like dread of exciting the angry or amorous passions of her
								departed spouse by the sound of the familiar voice. See <bibl>

								was told by Archilochus, who represented the river Achelous in the

								manner by supposing that it referred to a canal which the eminent
								philanthropist Herakles dug for the benefit of the people of
								Calydon.</note> So Hercules married Deianira, but Achelous recovered
							the horn by giving the horn of Amalthea in its stead. Now Amalthea was a
							daughter of Haemonius, and she had a bull's horn, which, according to
							Pherecydes, had the power of supplying meat or drink in abundance,
							whatever one might wish.<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">According to some, Amalthea was the goat on
								whose milk the infant Zeus was fed. From one of its horns flowed
								ambrosia, and from the other flowed nectar. See <bibl>Callimachus,

								the god. See <bibl>Eratosthenes, Cat. 13</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Ast.
									ii.13</bibl>; <bibl>Ovid, Fasti v.115ff.</bibl> Some said that,
								in gratitude for having been nurtured on the animal's milk, Zeus
								made a constellation of the goat and bestowed one of its horns on
								the nymphs who had reared him, at the same time ordaining that the
								horn should produce whatever they asked for. See <bibl>Zenobius,

								to destroy the mortal and earthly part of them by the fire, and
								afterwards to attract to himself the immortal part of them, and to
								raise their souls to heaven.’” So Lucian speaks of Herakles becoming
								a god in the burning pile on Mount Oeta, the human element in him,
								which he had inherited from his mortal mother, being purged away in
								the flames, while the divine element ascended pure and spotless to
								the gods. See <bibl>Lucian, Hermotimus 7</bibl>. The notion that

								important, and hence was naturally the scene of various battles,
								legendary or historical. Gargettus, where, according to Strabo,
								confirmed by Hesychius and Stephanus Byzantius (s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">*garghtto/s</foreign>), the headless trunk of

								Euripides and Strabo about the place where the body of Eurystheus
								was buried may be reconciled if we suppose that it was interred at
								Gargettus facing over against <name type="place" key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</name>, which lay on the opposite
								or southern side of the gap between Pentelicus and <name type="place" key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</name>. For the battles
								said to have been fought at various times in this important pass,
								see <bibl n="Hdt. 1.62">Hdt. 1.62ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 15">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 15</bibl>, with Sir
								J. E. Sandys's note; <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 13">Plut. Thes. 13</bibl>;
									<bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Hipp. 35</bibl>. The statement of
								Apollodorus that Hyllus killed Eurystheus and brought his head to
								Alcmena, who gouged out his eyes with weaving-pins, is repeated by
									<bibl>Zenobius, Cent. ii.61</bibl>, who probably here, as so
								often, simply copied our author without acknowledgment. According to
									<bibl n="Pind. P. 9">Pind. P. 9.79(137)ff., (with the
									Scholia)</bibl>, the slayer of Eurystheus was not Hyllus but
								Iolaus; and this seems to have been the common tradition. Can we
								explain the curious tradition that the severed head and body of the
								foeman Eurystheus were buried separately many miles apart, and both
								of them in passes strategically important? According to <bibl n="Eur. Heraclid. 1026">Eur. Heraclid. 1026ff.</bibl>,
								Eurystheus, before being killed by the order of Alcmena, announced
								to the Athenians that, in gratitude for their merciful, though
								fruitless, intercession with Alcmena, he would still, after his
								death, lying beneath the sod, be a friend and saviour to <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name>, but a stern foe
								to the descendants of the Heraclids—that is, to the Argives and
								Spartans, both of whom traced the blood of their kings to Herakles.
								Further, he bade the Athenians not to pour libations or shed blood
								on his grave, for even without such offerings he would in death
								benefit them and injure their enemies, whom he would drive home,
								defeated, from the borders of <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name>. From this it would seem that the ghost of
								Eurystheus was supposed to guard <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name> against invasion; hence we can
								understand why his body should be divided in two and the severed
								parts buried in different passes by which enemies might march into
								the country, because in this way the ghost might reasonably be
								expected to do double duty as a sentinel or spiritual outpost in two
								important places at the same time. Similarly the dead Oedipus in his
								grave at <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name> was
								believed to protect the country and ensure its welfare. See <bibl n="Soph. OC 576">Soph. OC 576ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Soph. OC 1518">Soph. OC 1518-1534</bibl>; <bibl n="Soph. OC 1760">Soph. OC
									1760-1765</bibl>; <bibl>Aristides, Or. xlvi. vol. ii. p. 230,
									ed. G. Dindorf</bibl>. So Orestes, in gratitude for his
								acquittal at <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name>,
								is represented by Aeschylus as promising that even when he is in his
								grave he will prevent any <name type="place" key="tgn,5001993">Argive</name> leader from marching against <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name>. See <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 732">Aesch. Eum. 732(762)ff.</bibl> And Euripides makes Hector
								declare that the foreigners who had fought in defence of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> were “no small
								security to the city” even when “they had fallen and were lying in
								their heaped-up graves.” See <bibl n="Eur. Rh. 413">Eur. Rh.
									413-415</bibl>. These examples show that in the opinion of the
								Greeks the ghosts even of foreigners could serve as guardian spirits
								of a country to which they were attached by ties of gratitude or
								affection; for in each of the cases I have cited the dead man who
								was thought to protect either <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name> or <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> was a stranger from a strange land. Some of the
								Scythians in antiquity used to cut off the heads of their enemies
								and stick them on poles over the chimneys of their houses, where the
								skulls were supposed to act as watchmen or guardians, perhaps by
								repelling any foul fiends that might attempt to enter the dwelling
								by coming down the chimney. See <bibl n="Hdt. 4.103">Hdt.
									4.103</bibl>. So tribes in <name type="place" key="tgn,1000107">Borneo</name>, who make a practice of cutting off the heads of
								their enemies and garnishing their houses with these trophies,
								imagine that they can propitiate the spirits of their dead foes and
								convert them into friends and protectors by addressing the skulls in
								endearing language and offering them food. See <bibl>
                              <title>Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild</title>,
									i.294ff.</bibl> The references in Greek legend to men who
								habitually relieved strangers of their heads, which they added to
								their collection of skulls, may point to the former existence among
								the Greeks of a practice of collecting human skulls for the purpose
								of securing the ghostly protection of their late owners. See notes

								According to Euripides, Agenor had three sons, Cilix, Phoenix, and

								with regard to Thasus, saying that the natives of <name type="place" key="perseus,Thasos City">Thasos</name> were Phoenicians by
								descent and traced their origin to this Thasus, son of Agenor (<bibl n="Paus. 5.25.12">Paus. 5.25.12</bibl>). In saying this,

								historian had visited (<bibl n="Hdt. 6.46">Hdt. 6.46ff.</bibl>), and

								colony in the island of <name type="place" key="perseus,Thera City">Thera</name>. Diodorus Siculus reports (<bibl>Diod.

								Phoenician colony in <name type="place" key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</name>, and that the descendants of the colonists
								continued to hold the hereditary priesthood of Poseidon, whose

								Lindian Athena in <name type="place" key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</name>. For in this record, engraved on a marble slab, there
								occurs the following entry: “Cadmus (dedicated) a bronze tripod

								book of the histories.” See <bibl>Chr. Blinkenberg, <title>La
										Chronique du temple Lindien</title> (Copenhagen, 1912), p.

								some of the Greek islands and parts of the mainland. If Europa was,
								as seems possible, a personification of the moon in the shape of a
								cow (see <bibl>
                              <title>The Dying God</title>, p. 88</bibl>), we might perhaps

								the vines, lopped off one of his own feet or even both his legs. It
								appears to be a common belief that a woodman who cuts a sacred tree

								when the missionary Jerome of <name type="place" key="tgn,7006464">Prague</name> was preaching to the heathen Lithuanians and

								resembles the one which is said to have befallen the Edonian king in
								a similar attempt on the sacred vine.</note> Dionysus took refuge in

								heels of the criminal with a sword or to hamstring him as he swung
								on the gallows. See <bibl>S. Mateer, <title>The Land of

								implements which figured prominently in the processions of Dionysus.

								However, Hyginus gives Hypolipnus as the name of the guide to hell.
								Every year the descent of the god through the deep water was
								celebrated with nocturnal rites on the reedy margin of the pool
									(<bibl n="Paus. 2.37.6">Paus. 2.37.6</bibl>). The pious
								Pausanias shrank from divulging the nature of the rites; but from
								Plutarch we learn that a lamb was thrown into the lake as an
								offering to the warder of hell, while on trumpets hidden in the
								god's leafy emblems the buglers blew blasts which, startling the
								stillness and darkness of night, were believed to summon up the lost
								Dionysus from the watery depths. See <bibl>Plut. Isis et Osiris
									35</bibl>. Perhaps in answer to this bugle call an actor,
								dressed in the vine-god's garb, may have emerged dripping from the
								pool to receive the congratulations of the worshippers on his rising
								from the dead. However, according to others, the resurrection of
								Dionysus and his mother took place, not in the gloomy swamp at <name type="place" key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</name>, but on the
								beautiful, almost landlocked, bay of <name type="place" key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</name>, where nowadays groves of

								cypresses, fringe the margin of the calm blue water at the foot of
								the rugged mountains. See <bibl n="Paus. 2.31.2">Paus.
								2.31.2</bibl>. Plutarch has drawn a visionary picture of the scene
								of the ascension. It was, he says, a mighty chasm like the caves
								sacred to Bacchus, mantled with woods and green grass and blooming
								flowers of every sort, and exhaling a delicious, an intoxicating,
								perfume, while all about it the souls of the departed circled and
								stooped upon the wing like flights of birds, but did not dare to
								cross its tremendous depth. It was called the Place of
								Forgetfulness. See <bibl>Plut. De sera numinis vindicta 22, pp.
									565ff.</bibl> A pretty story was told of the device by which
								Dionysus induced the grim warden of the dead to release the soul of
								his mother from the infernal gaol. It is said that Hades consented
								to set her free provided that her son would send of his best beloved
								to replace her shade in the world of shadows. Now of all the things
								in the world the dearest to Dionysus were the ivy, the vine, and the
								myrtle; so of these he sent the myrtle, and that is why the
								initiated in his rites wreathed their brows with myrtle leaves. See

								opinion prevailed among the ancients with regard to the number of
								Niobe's children. Diodorus, Ovid, Hyginus, Lactantius Placidus, and
								the First Vatican Mythographer agree with Apollodorus as to the
								seven sons and seven daughters of Niobe, and from the
									<bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Ph. 159</bibl>, we learn that Aeschylus,
								Euripides, and Aristophanes in lost plays adopted the same numbers,
								but that Pherecydes agreed with Homer in reckoning six sons and six
								daughters, while Hellanicus allowed the lady no more than four sons
								and three daughters. On the other hand, Xanthus the Lydian,
								according to the same Scholiast, credited her with a score of
								children, equally divided between the two sexes. Herein he probably
								followed the authority of Hesiod (see Apollodorus, below), and the
								same liberal computation is said to have been accepted by
								Bacchylides, Pindar, and Mimnermus, while Sappho reduced the figure
								to twice nine, and Alcman to ten all told (<bibl>Aulus Gellius
									xx.70</bibl>; <bibl>Ael., Var. Hist. xii.36</bibl>). Aeschylus

									Nat. Hist. xxxvi.28</bibl>), and modern opinion is still divided
								on the question. See <bibl>Frazer on Paus. ii.29.9 (vol. iii. p.
									201)</bibl>. The pathetic character of the group may perhaps be
								held to speak in favour of Scopas, who seems to have excelled in the
								portrayal of the sterner, sadder emotions, while Praxiteles dwelt by
								preference on the brighter, softer creations of the Greek religious
								imagination. This view of the sombre cast of the genius of Scopas is
								suggested by the subjects which he chose for the decoration of the

								Professor M. Collignon, denied that the original of this famous
								group, which he regarded as a copy, was either by Scopas or
								Praxiteles. He held that it belongs to an Asiatic school of
								sculpture characterized by picturesque grouping, and that it could
								not have been executed before the third century B.C. To the same
								school he would assign another famous group of sculpture, that of
								Dirce and the bull (above, Frazer on Apollod. 3.5.5). See <bibl>M.

								grown, and with the aid of a stick in his old age.”</note> whose
							mother was Echidna and her father Typhon; and she had the face of a
							woman, the breast and feet and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird.
							And having learned a riddle from the Muses, she sat on Mount Phicium,
							and propounded it to the Thebans. And the riddle was this:— What is that
							which has one voice and yet becomes four-footed <pb n="349"/>and
							two-footed and three-footed? Now the Thebans were in possession of an
							oracle which declared that they should be rid of the Sphinx whenever
							they had read her riddle; so they often met and discussed the answer,
							and when they could not find it the Sphinx used to snatch away one of
							them and gobble him up. When many had perished, and last of all Creon's
							son Haemon, Creon made proclamation that to him who should read the
							riddle he would give both the kingdom and the wife of Laius. On hearing
							that, Oedipus found the solution, declaring that the riddle of the
							Sphinx referred to man; for as a babe he is four-footed, going on four
							limbs, as an adult he is two-footed, and as an old man he gets besides a
							third support in a staff. So the Sphinx threw herself from the citadel,

							Pherecydes says that he was blinded by Athena<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The blinding of Tiresias by Athena is
								described by Callimachus in his hymn, <title>The Baths of
									Pallas</title>. He tells how the nymph Chariclo, mother of
								Tiresias, was the favourite attendant of Athena, who carried her
								with her wherever she went, often mounting the nymph in her own car.
								One summer day, when the heat and stillness of noon reigned in the
								mountains, the goddess and the nymph had stripped and were enjoying
								a cool plunge in the fair-flowing spring of Hippocrene on Mount
								Helicon. But the youthful Tiresias, roaming the hills with his dogs,
								came to slake his thirst at the bubbling spring and saw what it was
								not lawful to see. The goddess cried out in anger, and at once the
								eyes of the intruder were quenched in darkness. His mother, the
								nymph, reproached the goddess with blinding her son, but Athena
								explained that she had not done so, but that the laws of the gods
								inflicted the penalty of blindness on anyone who beheld an immortal
								without his or her consent. To console the youth for the loss of his
								sight the goddess promised to bestow on him the gifts of prophecy
								and divination, long life, and after death the retention of his
								mental powers undimmed in the world below. See <bibl>Callimachus,
									Baths of Pallas 57-133</bibl>. In this account Callimachus
								probably followed Pherecydes, who, as we learn from the present
								passage of Apollodorus, assigned the same cause for the blindness of
								Tiresias. It is said that Erymanthus, son of Apollo, was blinded
								because he saw Aphrodite bathing. See <bibl>Ptolemy Hephaest., Nov.
									Hist. i. in Westermann's Mythographi Graeci, p.
									183</bibl>.</note>; for Chariclo was dear to Athena <gap reason="lost"/> and
							Tiresias saw the goddess stark naked, and she covered his eyes with her
							hands, and so rendered him sightless. And when Chariclo asked her to
							restore his sight, she could not do so, but by cleansing his ears she
							caused him to understand every note of birds; and she gave him a staff

								Dicaearchus, Clitarchus, and Callimachus. He agrees with
								Apollodorus, Hyginus, Lactantius Placidus, and the Second Vatican
								Mythographer in laying the scene of the incident on Mount Cyllene in
									<name type="place" key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</name>; whereas
								Eustathius and Tzetzes lay it on Mount Cithaeron in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</name>, which is more
								appropriate for a Theban seer. According to Eustathius and Tzetzes,
								it was by killing the female snake that Tiresias became a woman, and
								it was by afterwards killing the male snake that he was changed back
								into a man. According to Ovid, the seer remained a woman for seven
								years, and recovered his male sex in the eighth; the First Vatican
								Mythographer says that he recovered it after eight years; the Third
								Vatican Mythographer affirms that he recovered it in the seventh
								year. All the writers I have cited, except Antoninus Liberalis,
								record the verdict of Tiresias on the question submitted to him by
								Zeus and Hera, though they are not all agreed as to the precise
								mathematical proportion expressed in it. Further, they all, except
								Antoninus Liberalis, agree that the blindness of Tiresias was a
								punishment inflicted on him by Hera (Juno) because his answer to the
								question was displeasing to her. According to Phlegon, Hyginus,
								Lactantius Placidus, and the Second Vatican Mythographer the life of
								Tiresias was prolonged by Zeus (Jupiter) so as to last seven
								ordinary lives. The notion that it is unlucky to see snakes coupling
								appears to be widespread. In Southern India “the sight of two snakes
								coiled round each other in sexual congress is considered to portend
								some great evil” (<bibl>E. Thurston, <title>Ethnographic Notes in
										Southern India</title>, Madras, 1906, p. 293</bibl>). The
								Chins of Northeastern India think that “one of the worst omens that
								it is possible to see is two snakes copulating, and a man who sees
								this is not supposed to return to his house or to speak to anyone
								until the next sun has risen” (<bibl>B. S. Carey and H. N. Tuck,
										<title>The Chin Hills</title>, vol. i. Rangoon, 1896, p.
									199</bibl>). “It is considered extremely unlucky for a Chin to
								come upon two snakes copulating, and to avoid ill-fortune he must
								remain outside the village that night, without eating cooked food;
								the next morning he may proceed to his house, but, on arrival there,
								must kill a fowl and, if within his means, hold a feast. If a man
								omits these precautions and is found out, he is liable to pay
								compensation of a big <foreign xml:lang="chin">mythun</foreign>, a pig,
								one blanket, and one bead, whatever his means, to the first man he
								brings ill-luck to by talking to him. Before the British occupation,
								if the man, for any reason, could not pay the compensation, the
								other might make a slave of him, by claiming a pig whenever one of
								his daughters married” (<bibl>W. R. Head, <title>Haka Chin
										Customs</title>, Rangoon, 1917, p. 44</bibl>). In the <name type="place" key="tgn,7016919">Himalayas</name> certain
								religious ceremonies are prescribed when a person has seen snakes
								coupling (<bibl>
                              <title>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</title>, 1884,
									pt. i. p. 101</bibl>; the nature of the ceremonies is not
								described). In Timorlaut, one of the East Indian Islands, it is
								deemed an omen of great misfortune if a man dreams that he sees
								snakes coupling (<bibl>J. G. F. Riedel, <title>De sluik- en
										kroesharige rassen tusschen Selebes en Papua</title>, The
									Hague, 1886, p. 285</bibl>). Similarly in Southern India there
								prevails “a superstitious belief that, if a person sees two crows
								engaged in sexual congress, he will die unless one of his relations
								sheds tears. To avert this catastrophe, false news as to the death
								are sent by the post or telegraph, and subsequently corrected by a
								letter or telegram announcing that the individual is alive”
									(<bibl>E. Thurston, op. cit. p. 278</bibl>). A similar belief as

								these writers say that it was Amphiaraus, not Tydeus, who killed as

								slew and beheaded Melanippus and brought the gory head to Tydeus.

								which the poet has distilled the whole range of ancient mythology

								Scythians, who regularly decapitated their enemies in battle and
								drank of the blood of the first man they slew (<bibl n="Hdt. 4.64">Hdt. 4.64</bibl>). It has indeed been a common practice with
								savages to swallow some part of a slain foe in order with the blood,
								or flesh, or brains to acquire the dead man's valour. See for
								example <bibl>L. A. Millet-Mureau, <title>Voyage de la Perouse
										autour du Monde</title> (Paris, 1797), ii.272</bibl> (as to
								the Californian Indians); <bibl>Fay-Cooper Cole, <title>The Wild

                              <title>Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild</title>,
									ii.148ff.</bibl> The story of the brutality of Tydeus to
								Melanippus may contain a reminiscence of a similar custom. From the
									<bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. v.126</bibl> we learn that the story
								was told by Pherecydes, whom Apollodorus may be following in the
								present passage. The grave of Melanippus was on the road from <name type="place" key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</name> to <name type="place" key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</name> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.18.1">Paus. 9.18.1</bibl>), but Clisthenes, tyrant of

								Melanippus” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">e)phga/geto to\n
									Mela/nippon</foreign> ) to <name type="place" key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</name> and dedicated a precinct to him in the Prytaneum
								or town-hall; moreover, he transferred to Melanippus the sacrifices
								and festal honours which till then had been offered to Adrastus, the
								foe of Melanippus. See <bibl n="Hdt. 5.67">Hdt. 5.67</bibl>. It is
								probable that Clisthenes, in “fetching Melanippus,” transferred the
								hero's bones to the new shrine at <name type="place" key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</name>, following a common practice of
								the ancient Greeks, who were as anxious to secure the miraculous
								relics of heroes as modern Catholics are to secure the equally

								This was the version adopted by Euripides, Statius, and Apollodorus.

								Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a
								ladder at the siege of <name type="place" key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</name>. See <bibl n="Apollod. 3.6.7">Apollod.
									3.6.7</bibl>. Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have
								been buried, not burned, and the grave fenced off; whereas the other
								bodies were all consumed on a single pyre. See <bibl n="Eur. Supp. 934">Eur. Supp. 934-938</bibl>, where <foreign xml:lang="grc">sumph/cas ta/fon</foreign> refers to the fencing in
								of the grave. So the tomb of Semele, who was also killed by
								lightning, seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure. See <bibl n="Eur. Ba. 6">Eur. Ba. 6-11</bibl>. Yet, inconsistently with
								the foregoing passage, Euripides appears afterwards to assume that
								the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre (<bibl n="Eur. Supp. 1000">Eur. Supp. 1000ff.</bibl>). The rule that a person killed by a
								thunderbolt should be buried, not burnt, is stated by <bibl>Pliny,
									Nat. Hist. ii.145</bibl> and alluded to by <bibl>Tertullian,
									Apologeticus 48</bibl>. An ancient Roman law, attributed to
								Numa, forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who
								had been killed by lightning. See <bibl>Festus, s.v. “Occisum,” p.
									178, ed. C. O. Müller</bibl>. It is true that these passages
								refer to the Roman usage, but the words of <bibl n="Eur. Supp. 934">Eur. Supp. 934-938</bibl> seem to imply that the Greek practice
								was similar, and this is confirmed by Artemidorus, who says that the
								bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on
								the spot (<bibl>Artemidorus, Onirocrit. ii.9</bibl>). The same
								writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be
								disgraced, nay, he was honoured as a god; even slaves killed by
								lightning were approached with respect, as honoured by Zeus, and
								their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments. Such customs are to
								some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in
								the flash of lightning; hence whatever the lightning struck was
								naturally regarded as holy. Places struck by lightning were sacred
								to Zeus the Descender (<foreign xml:lang="grc">*zeu\s
									kataiba/ths</foreign> ) and were enclosed by a fence.
								Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of
									<name type="place" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</name>. See
									<bibl>Pollux ix.41</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 5.14.10">Paus.

									“Keraunos,” <title>Kleine Schriften</title>, iv.477ff.</bibl>,
								(who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the
								worship of persons killed by lightning); <bibl>Chr. Blinkenberg,
										<title>The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore</title>
									(Cambridge, 1911), pp. 110ff.</bibl> Among the Ossetes of the
									<name type="place" key="tgn,1108814">Caucasus</name> a man who
								has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky, for they believe
								that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself. So the survivors
								raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him. His relations think
								it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings, for any
								appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias
								and therefore punishable. The festival lasts eight days. The
								deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact
								attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died.
								At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and
								feasting, a high cairn is erected on his grave, and beside it they
								set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it,
								and another pole, on which hang the best clothes of the deceased.
								The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage. See <bibl>Julius von
									Klaproth, <title>Reise in den Kaukasus und nach Georgien</title>
									(Halle and Berlin, 1814), ii.606</bibl>; <bibl>A. von
									Haxthausen, <title>Transkaukasia</title> (Leipsig, 1856),
									ii.21ff.</bibl> Similarly the Kafirs of <name type="place" key="tgn,1000193">South Africa</name> “have strange notions
								respecting the lightning. They consider that it is governed by the
									<foreign xml:lang="kafir">umshologu</foreign>, or ghost, of the
								greatest and most renowned of their departed chiefs, and who is
								emphatically styled the <foreign xml:lang="kafir">inkosi</foreign>; but
								they are not at all clear as to which of their ancestors is intended
								by this designation. Hence they allow of no lamentation being made
								for a person killed by lightning, as they say that it would be a
								sign of disloyalty to lament for one whom the <foreign xml:lang="kafir">inkosi</foreign> had sent for, and whose services he
								consequently needed; and it would cause him to punish them, by
								making the lightning again to descend and do them another injury.”
								Further, rites of purification have to be performed by a priest at
								the kraal where the accident took place; and till these have been
								performed, none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal or have
								intercourse with other people. Meantime their heads are shaved and
								they must abstain from drinking milk. The rites include a sacrifice
								and the inoculation of the people with powdered charcoal. See
									<bibl>“Mr. Warner's Notes,” in Col. Maclean's <title>Compendium
										of Kafir Laws and Customs</title> (Cape Town, 1866), pp.
									82-84</bibl>. Sometimes, however, the ghosts of persons who have
								been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous. Hence the
								Omahas used to slit the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent
								their ghosts from walking about. See <bibl>J. Owen Dorsey, “A Study
									of Siouan Cults,” <title>Eleventh Annual Report of the Bureau of
										Ethnology</title> (Washington, 1894), p. 420</bibl>. For
								more evidence of special treatment accorded to the bodies of persons

								not killed, by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess of
								the god Kiranga, whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom
								he or she is deemed a bodily representative. And any place that has
								been struck by lightning is enclosed, and the trunk of a banana-tree
								or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as the temporary abode
								of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning. See <bibl>H.

								institutions in righteousness. And wishing like his father to wean
								his subjects from unrighteousness he said that Zeus constantly
								visited him in the likeness of a stranger to view the righteous and
								the unrighteous. And once, as he himself said, being about to
								receive the god, he offered a sacrifice. But of his fifty sons, whom
								he had, as they say, by many women, there were some present at the
								sacrifice, and wishing to know if they were about to give
								hospitality to a real god, they sacrificed a child and mixed his
								flesh with that of the victim, in the belief that their deed would
								be discovered if the visitor was a god indeed. But they say that the
								deity caused great storms to burst and lightnings to flash, and that
								all the murderers of the child perished.” A similar version of the
								story is reported by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 176</bibl>, who adds that
								Zeus in his wrath upset the table, killed the sons of Lycaon with a
								thunderbolt, and turned Lycaon himself into a wolf. According to
								this version of the legend, which Apollodorus apparently accepted,
								Lycaon was a righteous king, who ruled wisely like his father
								Pelasgus before him (see <bibl n="Paus. 8.1.4">Paus.
								8.1.4-6</bibl>), but his virtuous efforts to benefit his subjects
								were frustrated by the wickedness and impiety of his sons, who by
								exciting the divine anger drew down destruction on themselves and on
								their virtuous parent, and even imperilled the existence of mankind
								in the great flood. But according to another, and perhaps more
								generally received, tradition, it was King Lycaon himself who
								tempted his divine guest by killing and dishing up to him at table a
								human being; and, according to some, the victim was no other than
								the king's own son Nyctimus. See <bibl>Clement of <name type="place" key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, Protrept. ii.36,
									p. 31, ed. Potter</bibl>; <bibl>Nonnus, Dionys.
									xviii.20ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Arnobius, Adversus Nationes
									iv.24</bibl>. Some, however, said that the victim was not the
								king's son, but his grandson Arcas, the son of his daughter Callisto
								by Zeus. See <bibl>Eratosthenes, Cat. 8</bibl>; <bibl>Hyginus, Ast.
									ii.4</bibl>; <bibl>Scholia in Caesaris Germanici Aratea, p. 387
									(in Martianus Capella, ed. Fr. Eyssenhardt)</bibl>. According to
									<bibl n="Ov. Met. 1.218">Ov. Met. 1.218ff.</bibl>, the victim
								was a Molossian hostage. Others said simply that Lycaon set human
								flesh before the deity. See <bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius,
									Theb. xi.128</bibl>; <bibl>Scriptores rerum mythicarum Latini,
									ed. Bode, i.5 (First Vatican Mythographer 17)</bibl>. For this
								crime Zeus changed the wicked king into a wolf, according to
								Hyginus, Ovid, the Scholiast on Caesar Germanicus, and the First
								Vatican Mythographer; but, on the other hand, Clement of Alexandria,
								Nonnus, Eratosthenes, and Arnobius say nothing of such a
								transformation. The upsetting of the table by the indignant deity is
								recorded by <bibl>Eratosthenes, Cat. 8</bibl> as well as by
									<bibl>Hyginus, Ast. ii.4</bibl> and Apollodorus. A somewhat
								different account of the tragical occurrence is given by Pausanias,
								who says (<bibl n="Paus. 8.2.3">Paus. 8.2.3</bibl>) that Lycaon
								brought a human babe to the altar of Lycaean Zeus, after which he
								was immediately turned into a wolf. These traditions were told to
								explain the savage and cruel rites which appear to have been
								performed in honour of Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus down to the
								second century of our era or later. It seems that a human victim was
								sacrificed, and that his inward parts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">spla/gxnon</foreign>), mixed with that of animal victims, was
								partaken of at a sort of cannibal banquet by the worshippers, of
								whom he who chanced to taste of the human flesh was believed to be
								changed into a wolf and to continue in that shape for eight years,
								but to recover his human form in the ninth year, if in the meantime
								he had abstained from eating human flesh. See <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 8.565d">Plat. Rep. 8.565d-e</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 8.2.6">Paus. 8.2.6</bibl>. According to another
								account, reported by Varro on the authority of a Greek writer
								Euanthes, the werewolf was chosen by lot, hung his clothes on an oak
								tree, swam across a pool, and was then transformed into a wolf and
								herded with wolves for nine years, afterwards recovering his human
								shape if in the interval he had not tasted the flesh of man. In this
								account there is no mention of cannibalism. See <bibl>Pliny, Nat.
									Hist. viii.81</bibl>; <bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei
									xviii.17</bibl>. A certain Arcadian boxer, named Damarchus, son
								of Dinnytas, who won a victory at <name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name>, is said to have been thus
								transformed into a wolf at the sacrifice of Lycaean Zeus and to have
								been changed back into a man in the tenth year afterwards. Of the
								historical reality of the boxer there can be no reasonable doubt,
								for his statue existed in the sacred precinct at <name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name>, where it was seen by
								Pausanias; but in the inscription on it, which Pausanias copied,
								there was no mention made of the man's transformation into a wolf.
								See <bibl n="Paus. 6.8.2">Paus. 6.8.2</bibl>. However, the
								transformation was recorded by a Greek writer, Scopas, in his
								history of Olympic victors, who called the boxer Demaenatus, and
								said that his change of shape was caused by his partaking of the
								inward parts of a boy slain in the Arcadian sacrifice to Lycaean
								Zeus. Scopas also spoke of the restoration of the boxer to the human
								form in the tenth year, and mentioned that his victory in boxing at
									<name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name> was
								subsequent to his experiences as a wolf. See <bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist.
									viii.82</bibl>; <bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei
								xviii.17</bibl>. The continuance of human sacrifice in the rites of
								Lycaean Zeus on Mount Lycaeus is hinted at by <bibl n="Paus. 8.38.7">Paus. 8.38.7</bibl> in the second century of our era, and
								asserted by <bibl>Porphyry, (De abstinentia ii.27: Eusebius,
									Praeparatio Evangelii, iv.16.6)</bibl> in the third century.
								From these fragmentary notices it is hardly possible to piece
								together a connected account of the rite; but the mention of the
								transformation of the cannibal into a wolf for eight or nine years
								suggests that the awful sacrifice was offered at intervals either of
								eight or of nine years. If the interval was eight years, it would
								point to the use of that eight years' cycle which played so
								important a part in the ancient calendar of the Greeks, and by which
								there is reason to think that the tenure of the kingship was in some
								places regulated. Perhaps the man who was supposed to be turned into
								a wolf acted as the priest, or even as the incarnation, of the Wolf
								God for eight or nine years till he was relieved of his office at
								the next celebration of the rites. The subject has been learnedly
								discussed by <bibl>A. B. Cook (<title>Zeus</title>,
								i.63-99);</bibl>. He regards Lycaean Zeus as a god of light rather
								than of wolves, and for this view there is much to be said. See
								Frazer on Paus. 8.38.7 (vol. iv. pp. 385ff.). The view would be
								confirmed if we were sure that the solemn sacrifice was octennial,
								for the octennial period was introduced in order to reconcile solar
								and lunar time, and hence the religious rites connected with it
								would naturally have reference to the great celestial luminaries. As
								to the octennial period, see the note on <bibl n="Apollod. 2.5.11">Apollod. 2.5.11</bibl>. But with this view of the festival it
								is difficult to reconcile the part played by wolves in the myth and
								ritual. We can hardly suppose with some late Greek writers, that the
								ancient Greek word for a year, <foreign xml:lang="grc">luka/bas</foreign>, was derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">lu/kos</foreign>, “a wolf,” and <foreign xml:lang="grc">bai/nw</foreign>, “to walk.” See <bibl>Ael., Nat. Anim.

								and the First and Second Vatican Mythographers (<bibl>Scriptores

									<bibl>Diod. 4.65.4</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 8.35.10">Paus.

								Hesiod also called him Schoeneus (see Apollodorus, below), and the
								later writers just mentioned probably accepted the name on his
								authority. According to Euripides, as we learn from Apollodorus (see
								below), the name of the heroine's father was Maenalus. The suckling
								of Atalanta by the bear, and the unsuccessful assault on her by the
								two centaurs, Hylaeus and Rhoecus, are described, with a wealth of
								picturesque detail, by Aelian (<bibl>Ael., Var. Hist.
								xiii.1</bibl>), who does not, however, mention her wedding race. The
								suitor who won the coy maiden's hand by throwing down the golden
								apples is called Hippomenes by most writers (Theocritus, Hyginus,
								Ovid, Servius, First and Second Vatican Mythographers). Herein later
								writers may have followed Euripides, who, as we learn from
								Apollodorus (see below), also called the successful suitor
								Hippomanes. But by <bibl n="Prop. 1.1">Prop. i.1.9</bibl> and <bibl n="Ov. Ars 2">Ovid, Ars Am. ii.188</bibl> the lover is called
								Milanion, which nearly agrees with the form Melanion adopted by
								Apollodorus. Pausanias seems also to have agreed with Apollodorus on
								this point, for he tells us (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.12.9">Apollod.
									3.12.9</bibl>) that Parthenopaeus, who was a son of Atalanta
								(see below), had Melanion for his father.</note> by Clymene,
							daughter of Minyas. This Atalanta was exposed by her father, because he
							desired male children; and a she bear came often and gave her suck, till
							hunters found her and brought her up among themselves. Grown to
							womanhood, Atalanta kept herself a virgin, and hunting in the wilderness
							she remained always under arms. The centaurs Rhoecus and Hylaeus tried
							to force her, but were shot down and killed by her. She went moreover
							with the chiefs to hunt the Calydonian boar, and at the games held in
							honor of Pelias she wrestled with <pb n="401"/> Peleus and won.
							Afterwards she discovered her parents, but when her father would have
							persuaded her to wed, she went away to a place that might serve as a
							racecourse, and, having planted a stake three cubits high in the middle
							of it, she caused her wooers to race before her from there, and ran
							herself in arms; and if the wooer was caught up, his due was death on
							the spot, and if he was not caught up, his due was marriage. When many
							had already perished, Melanion came to run for love of her, bringing
							golden apples from Aphrodite,<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">According to <bibl n="Ov. Met. 10.644">Ov. Met.

								mythographers to be that lions do not mate with each other, but with
								leopards, so that after their transformation the lovers could never
								repeat the sin of which they had been guilty. For this curious piece
								of natural history they refer to Pliny's <title>Natural
									History</title>; but all that Pliny, in the form in which he has
								come down to us, appears to affirm on this subject is, that when a
								lioness forgot her dignity with a leopard, her mate easily detected
								and vigorously punished the offence (<bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist.
									viii.43</bibl>). What would have happened if the lion had

									Mythographer 234)</bibl>. There was a general agreement among
								the ancients as to the names of the seven Pleiades. Aratus, for
								example, gives the same names as Apollodorus and in the same order.
								However, with the exception of Maia, a different list of names is
								given by the <bibl>Scholiast on Theocritus xiii.25</bibl>, who tells
								us further, on the authority of Callimachus, that they were the
								daughters of the queen of the Amazons. As their father was commonly
								said to be Atlas, they were sometimes called Atlantides
								(Apollodorus, below; <bibl>Diod. 3.60.4</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Hes. WD 382">Hes. WD 382</bibl>). But there was much
								diversity of opinion as to the origin of the name Pleiades. Some
								derived it from the name of their mother Pleione; but the most
								probable view appears to be that the name comes from <foreign xml:lang="grc">plei=n</foreign>, “to sail,” because in the
								Mediterranean area these stars were visible at night during the
								summer, from the middle of May till the beginning of November, which
								coincided with the sailing season in antiquity. This derivation of
								the name was recognized by some of the ancients (<bibl n="Serv. G. 1.138">Serv. Verg. G. 1.138</bibl>). With regard to
								the number of the Pleiades, it was generally agreed that there were
								seven of them, but that one was invisible, or nearly so, to the
								human eye. Of this invisibility two explanations were given. Some
								thought that Electra, as the mother of Dardanus, was so grieved at
								the fall of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> that
								she hid her face in her hands; the other was that Merope, who had
								married a mere man, Sisyphus, was so ashamed of her humble, though
								honest, lot by comparison with the guilty splendour of her sisters,
								who were all of them paramours of gods, that she dared not show
								herself. These alternative and equally probable theories are stated,
								for example, by Ovid and Hyginus. The cause of the promotion of the
								maidens to the sky is said to have been that for seven or even
								twelve years the hunter Orion pursued them with his unwelcome
								attentions, till Zeus in pity removed pursuer and pursued alike to
								heaven, there to shine as stars for ever and to continue the endless
								pursuit. The bashful or mournful Pleiad, who hid her light, is
								identified by modern astronomers with Celaeno, a star of almost the
								seventh magnitude, which can be seen now, as in antiquity, in clear
								moonless nights by persons endowed with unusually keen sight. See

								had secretly begotten Hermes on Maia in the cave, how she herself
								was acting temporarily as nurse to the child, how the infant grew at
								an astonishing and even alarming rate, and how, being detained in
								the cave by his father's orders, he devoted his leisure hours to
								constructing out of a dead beast a curious toy which emitted musical
								notes. Being pressed for a fuller explanation she describes how
								Hermes made the lyre out of a tortoise shell, how the instrument was
								“his only balm of grief, his comforter,” and how the child was
								transported with delight at the ravishing sweetness of the tones
								which spoke to him from the dead beast. Unmoved by this touching
								description, the Satyrs at once charge the precocious infant with
								having stolen the cattle. His nurse indignantly repels the charge,
								stoutly declaring that the poor child had inherited no propensity to
								thieving either from its father or from its mother, and recommending
								his accusers to go and look for the thief elsewhere, since at their
								age, with their long beards and bald heads, they ought to know
								better than to trump up such ridiculous accusations, for which they
								may yet have to smart. The nurse's passionate defence of her little
								charge makes no more impression on the Satyrs than her previous
								encomium on his musical talent: indeed their suspicions are
								quickened by her reference to the hides which the infant prodigy had
								used in the construction of the lyre, and they unhesitatingly
								identify the skins in question with those of the missing cattle.
								Strong in this conviction, they refuse to budge till the culprit has
								been made over to them. At this point the Greek text begins to fail;
								we can just catch a few disjointed fragments of a heated dialogue
								between the nurse and the satyrs; the words “cows,” “thief,”
								“rascal,” and so forth, occur with painful iteration, then all is
								silence. See <bibl>

								the claim of Arsinoe, quotes in favour of Coronis a Delphic oracle,
								which he regards as decisive: for who should know the true mother of
								Aesculapius better than his own father Apollo? The testimony of the
								deity for once was quite unambiguous. It ran thus:— “O born to be
								the world's great joy, Aesculapius, Offspring of love, whom
								Phlegyas' daughter, fair Coronis, bore to me in rugged <name type="place" key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</name>.” See
									<bibl n="Paus. 2.26.7">Paus. 2.26.7</bibl>. In modern times the
								stones of <name type="place" key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</name>, if we may say so, have risen up to testify to
								the truth of this oracle. For in the course of the modern
								excavations at the great Epidaurian sanctuary of Aesculapius there
								was discovered a limestone tablet inscribed with a hymn in honour of
								Apollo and Aesculapius, in which the family tree of the junior god
								is set out with the utmost precision, and it entirely confirms the
								Delphic oracle. The author of the hymn was a certain native of <name type="place" key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</name>, by name
								Isyllus, a man of such scrupulous accuracy that before publishing
								his hymn he took the precaution of submitting it to the fount of
								knowledge at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>
								with an inquiry whether the god would sanction its publication. The
								deity granted his permission in very cordial terms; hence we may
								look on the hymn as an authentic document bearing the imprimatur of
								the Delphic Apollo himself. In it the pedigree of Aesculapius is
								traced as follows: Father Zeus bestowed the hand of the Muse Erato
								on Malus in holy matrimony (<foreign xml:lang="grc">o(si/oisi
									ga/mois.</foreign>) The pair had a daughter Cleophema, who
								married Phlegyas, a native of <name type="place" key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</name>; and Phlegyas had by

								According to <bibl>Diod. 4.71.1-3</bibl> Aesculapius as a physician
								was so successful in his practice that the death-rate was
								perceptibly lowered, and Hades accused the doctor to Zeus of
								poaching on his preserves. The accusation angered Zeus, and he
								killed Aesculapius with a thunderbolt. According to Pherecydes, with
								whom Apollodorus agrees, the period of Apollo's servitude with
								Admetus was one year; according to Servius and the First Vatican
								Mythographer it was nine years. This suggests that the period may

									Scholiast on Lycophron 284, 511</bibl>. Pausanias consistently
								represents Perieres as the son of Aeolus, and this tradition had the
								support of Hesiod (quoted by <bibl>Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron
									284</bibl>). On the other hand Tzetzes represents Perieres as
								the son of Cynortes (<bibl>Scholiast on Lycophron 511</bibl>).
								Apollodorus here and elsewhere (<bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod.
									1.9.5</bibl>) mentions both traditions without deciding between
								them. In two passages (<bibl n="Apollod. 1.7.3">Apollod.
									1.7.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod. 1.9.5</bibl>) he
								asserts or implies that the father of Perieres was Aeolus; in
								another passage (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.3">Apollod. 3.10.3</bibl>)
								he asserts that the father of Perieres was Cynortes. In the present
								passage he seems to say that according to one tradition there were
								two men of the name of Perieres: one of them was the son of Aeolus
								and father of Aphareus and Leucippus; the other was the son of
								Cynortes and father of Oebalus, who married the nymph Batia and
								became by her the father of Tyndareus, Hippocoon, and Icarius.
								Pausanias says that Gorgophone, daughter of Perseus, first married
								Perieres and had by him two sons, Aphareus and Leucippus, and that
								after his death she married Oebalus, son of Cynortas (Cynortes), and
								had by him a son Tyndareus. See <bibl n="Paus. 2.21.7">Paus.
									2.21.7</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 3.1.4">Paus. 3.1.4</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 4.2.4">Paus. 4.2.4</bibl>. Apollodorus, on the other
								hand, represents Perieres as the father not only of Aphareus and
								Leucippus, but also of Tyndareus and Icarius by Gorgophone, daughter
								of Perseus. See above, <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.5">Apollod.
									1.9.5</bibl>; <bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.3">Apollod. 3.10.3</bibl>.
								Tzetzes (<bibl>Scholiast on Lycophron 511</bibl>) agrees with him as
								to the sons, but makes Perieres the son of Cynortas instead the son
								of Aeolus. Thus there were two traditions as to the father of
								Tyndareus; according to one, his father was Perieres, according to
								the other, he was Oebalus. But the two traditions were agreed as to
								the mother of Tyndareus, whom they represented as Gorgophone,
								daughter of Perseus. According to another account, which may have
								been intended to reconcile the discrepant traditions as to the
								father of Tyndareus, Oebalus was the son of Perieres and the father
								of Tyndareus, Icarius, Arene, and the bastard Hippocoon, whom he had
								by Nicostrate. See <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 457</bibl>;
									<bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. ii.581</bibl>. This account is
								mentioned, but apparently not accepted, by Apollodorus in the
								present passage, though he says nothing about the daughter Arene and
								the bastardy of Hippocoon. If we accept this last version of the
								genealogy, Tyndareus was descended both from Oebalus and Perieres,
								being the son of Oebalus and the grandson of Perieres. In a recently
								discovered fragment of the <title>Catalogues</title> of Hesiod, that
								poet calls Tyndareus an Oebalid, implying that his father was
								Oebalus. See <bibl>Griechische Dichterfragmente, i., Epische und

									<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.3">Apollod. 3.10.3</bibl>). They invited
								to their wedding Castor and Pollux, who were cousins both to the

								Castor and Pollux (see above, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.7">Apollod.
									3.10.7</bibl>), was a brother of Aphareus and Leucippus (see

								wedding Castor and Pollux carried off the brides, and being pursued
								by the bridegrooms, Idas and Lynceus, they turned on their pursuers.
								In the fight which ensued, Castor and Lynceus were slain, and Idas
								was killed by Zeus with a thunderbolt. See <bibl>Theocritus
									xxii.137ff.</bibl>; <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. iii.243</bibl>;

								According to Apollodorus, however, the fight between the cousins was
								occasioned by a quarrel arising over the division of some cattle
								which they had lifted from <name type="place" key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</name> in a joint raid. This seems to have been the
								version of the story which Pindar followed; for in his description
								of the fatal affray between the cousins (<bibl n="Pind. N. 10">Pind.
									N. 10.60(112)ff.</bibl>) he speaks only of anger about cattle as
								the motive that led Idas to attack Castor. The rape of the daughters
								of Leucippus by Castor and Pollux was a favourite subject in art.
								See <bibl n="Paus. 1.18.1">Paus. 1.18.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 3.17.3">Paus. 3.17.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 3.18.11">Paus. 3.18.11</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 4.31.9">Paus.

                           </bibl>, we may perhaps infer that these maiden priestesses, like
								the goddesses, were two in number, and that they were called “the
								colts of the Leucippides.” Further, since the name of Leucippus, the
								legendary father of the goddesses, means simply “White Horse,” it is
								tempting to suppose that the Leucippides, like their priestesses,
								were spoken of and perhaps conceived as white horses. More than
								that, Castor and Pollux, who carried off these white-horse maidens,
								if we may call them so, were not only constantly associated with
								horses, but were themselves called White Horses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">leuko/pwloi)</foreign>) by <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. P. 1.66(126)</bibl> and “White Colts of Zeus” by

								point to the worship of a pair of brother deities conceived as white

								mares, who were served by a pair of maiden priestesses called White
								Colts, assisted apparently by a boy priest or priests; for a

								all comparatively late, and they differ from each other on various
								points; but the most commonly received account seems to have been
								that the image was a small wooden one, that it had fallen from
								heaven, and that so long as it remained in <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> the city could not be taken. The
								Greek tradition was that the Palladium was stolen and carried off to
								the Greek camp by Ulysses and Diomedes (see <bibl n="Apollod. Epit. E.5.10">Apollod. E.5.10</bibl> and <bibl n="Apollod. Epit. E.5.13">Apollod. E.5.13</bibl>), and that its
								capture by the Greeks ensured the fall of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>. The Roman tradition was that the
								image remained in <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>
								till the city was taken by the Greeks, when Aeneas succeeded in

								in the temple of Vesta at <name type="place" key="perseus,Rome">Rome</name>. These two traditions are clearly inconsistent with
								each other, and the Roman tradition further conflicts with the
								belief that the city which possessed the sacred image could not be
								captured by an enemy. Hence in order to maintain the genuineness of
								the image in the temple of Vesta, patriotic Roman antiquaries were
								driven to various expedients. They said, for example, that an exact
								copy of the Palladium had been publicly exposed at <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, while the true one
								was carefully concealed in a sanctuary, and that the unsuspicious
								Greeks had pounced on the spurious image, while the knowing Aeneas
								smuggled away the genuine one packed up with the rest of his sacred
								luggage (<bibl>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Ant. Rom.
								i.68ff.</bibl>). Or they affirmed that the thief Diomedes had been
								constrained to restore the stolen image to its proper owners
									(<bibl>First Vatican Mythographer 40, 142</bibl>); or that,
								warned by Athena in a dream, he afterwards made it over to Aeneas in
									<name type="place" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</name> (<bibl>Silius
									Italicus, Punic. xiii.30ff.</bibl>). But the Romans were not the

								maintained that it was with them (<bibl n="Paus. 2.23.5">Paus.

								According to <bibl>Dictys Cretensis v.5</bibl>, the image fell from
								heaven at the time when Ilus was building the temple of Athena; the
								structure was nearly completed, but the roof was not yet on, so the
								Palladium dropped straight into its proper place in the sacred
								edifice. <bibl>Clement of Alexandria, Protrept. iv.47, p. 42, ed.
									Potter</bibl>, mentions a strange opinion that the Palladium
								“was made out of the bones of Pelops, just as the Olympian (image of
								Zeus was made) out of other bones of an Indian beast,” that is, out
								of ivory. Pherecydes discussed the subject of <hi rend="ital">palladia</hi> in general; he described them as “shapes not made
								with hands,” and derived the name from <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/llein</foreign>, which he considered to be equivalent to
									<foreign xml:lang="grc">ba/llein</foreign>, “to throw, cast,”
								because these objects were cast down from heaven. See <bibl>Tzetzes,

									s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">*palla/dion</foreign>, p.

								white-headed and could not stir hand or foot, he prayed for death as
								a release from his sufferings; but die he could not, for he was
								immortal. Hence the goddess in pity either shut him up in his

								most musical of insects, that she might have the joy of hearing her
								lover's voice sounding for ever in her ears. The former and sadder

								“the grasshoppers, like the snakes, when they are old, slough their
								old age” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ gh=ras</foreign>, literally “old

								that when the festival in honour of the birth of the twins was being

								Thus was exuberant fertility procured for the fruits of the earth by
								the prayers of Aeacus” (<bibl>Clement of Alexandria, Strom. vi.3.28,

									Theb. ii.113, vii.344, xi.281</bibl>. Tradition differed on
								several points as to the murder. According to Apollodorus and
								Plutarch the murderer was Telamon; but according to what seems to
								have been the more generally accepted view he was Peleus. (So
								Diodorus, Pausanias, the Scholiast on Homer, one of the
									<bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Andr. 687</bibl>, Ovid, and in one
								passage Lactantius Placidus). If Pherecydes was right in denying any
								relationship between Telamon and Peleus, and in representing Telamon
								as a Salaminian rather than an Aeginetan (see above), it becomes
								probable that in the original tradition Peleus, not Telamon, was
								described as the murderer of Phocus. Another version of the story
								was that both brothers had a hand in the murder, Telamon having
								banged him on the head with a quoit, while Peleus finished him off
								with the stroke of an axe in the middle of his back. This was the
								account given by the anonymous author of the old epic
									<title>Alcmaeonis</title>; and the same division of labour
								between the brothers was recognized by the Scholiast on Pindar and
								Tzetzes, though according to them the quoit was handled by Peleus
								and the cold steel by Telamon. Other writers (Antoninus Liberalis
								and Hyginus) lay the murder at the door of both brothers without
								parcelling the guilt out exactly between them. There seems to be a
								general agreement that the crime was committed, or the accident
								happened, in the course of a match at quoits; but Dorotheus (quoted
								by <bibl>Plut. Parallela 25</bibl>) alleged that the murder was
								perpetrated by Telamon at a boar hunt, and this view seems to have
								been accepted by Lactantius Placidus in one place (<bibl>Lactantius
									Placidus on Statius, Theb. ii.113</bibl>), though in other
								places (<bibl>Lactantius Placidus on Statius, Theb. vii.344 and
									xi.281</bibl>) he speaks as if the brothers were equally guilty.
								But perhaps this version of the story originated in a confusion of
								the murder of Phocus with the subsequent homicide of Eurytion, which
								is said to have taken place at a boar-hunt, whether the hunting of
								the Calydonian boar or another. See below, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.13.2">Apollod. 3.13.2</bibl> with the note. According to Pausanias
								the exiled Telamon afterwards returned and stood his trial, pleading
								his cause from the deck of a ship, because his father would not
								suffer him to set foot in the island. But being judged guilty by his
								stern sire he sailed away, to return to his native land no more. It
								may have been this verdict, delivered against his own son, which
								raised the reputation of Aeacus for rigid justice to the highest
								pitch, and won for him a place on the bench beside Minos and
								Rhadamanthys in the world of shades.</note>

								Antigone, daughter of Eurytion (<bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il.

								marrows of lions, wild boars, and bears were no doubt supposed to
								impart to the youthful hero who partook of them the strength and
								courage of these animals, while the marrows of fawns or deer may
								have been thought to ensure the fleetness of foot for which he was
								afterwards so conspicuous. It is thus that on the principle of
								sympathetic magic many races seek to acquire the qualities of
								certain animals by eating their flesh or drinking their blood;
								whereas they abstain from eating the flesh of other animals lest
								they should, by partaking of it, be infected with the undesirable
								qualities which these creatures are believed to possess. For
								example, in various African tribes men eat the hearts of lions in
								order to become lionhearted, while others will not eat the flesh of
								tortoises lest they should become slow-footed like these animals.

								To the instances there cited may be added another. When the Algerine

								sacrifice a sheep, cut off its head, extract its entrails, and then
								throw them, together with the head, overboard; afterwards “with all
								the speed they can (without skinning) they cut the body in two parts
								by the middle, and then throw one part over the right side of the

								propitiation.” See <bibl>Joseph Pitts, <title>A true and faithful

								the fable was propounded by the eminent Roman antiquary Varro.
								According to him, the olive-tree suddenly appeared in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name>, and at the same
								time there was an eruption of water in another part of the country.
								So king Cecrops sent to inquire of Apollo at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> what these portents might
								signify. The oracle answered that the olive and the water were the

								choose which of these deities they would worship. Accordingly the
								question was submitted to a general assembly of the citizens and
								citizenesses; for in these days women had the vote as well as men.
								All the men voted for the god, and all the women voted for the
								goddess; and as there was one more woman than there were men, the
								goddess appeared at the head of the poll. Chagrined at the loss of
								the election, the male candidate flooded the country with the water
								of the sea, and to appease his wrath it was decided to deprive women
								of the vote and to forbid children to bear their mother's names for
								the future. See <bibl>Augustine, De civitate Dei xviii.9</bibl>. The
								print of Poseidon's trident on the rock of the acropolis at <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name> was shown down

									<bibl n="Paus. 1.26.5">Paus. 1.26.5</bibl>. The “sea,” which the
								god was supposed to have produced as evidence of his right to the
								country was also to be seen within the Erechtheum on the acropolis;
								Pausanias calls it a well of sea water, and says that, when the
								south wind blew, the well gave forth a sound of waves. See <bibl n="Hdt. 8.55">Hdt. 8.55</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 1.26.5">Paus.

								According to the late Latin mythographers (see the references
								above), Poseidon produced a horse from the rock in support of his
								claim, and this version of the story seems to have been accepted by
									<bibl>Virgil (Geo. i.12ff.)</bibl>, but it is not countenanced
								by Greek writers. The Athenians said that the contest between
								Poseidon and Athena took place on the second of the month
								Boedromion, and hence they omitted that day from the calendar. See

								will willingly consent to divest them of the legendary charm which

								hoopoe still pursued his cruel wife crying, Poo! poo! (<foreign xml:lang="grc">pou=, pou=</foreign>, “Where? Where?”). The later
								Roman mythographers somewhat absurdly inverted the transformation of
								the two sisters, making Procne the swallow and the tongueless
								Philomela the songstress nightingale.</note> Tereus had by her a son
							Itys, <pb n="101"/>and having fallen in love with Philomela, he seduced
							her also saying that Procne was dead, for he concealed her in the

							to Procne her own sorrows. And having sought out her sister, Procne
							killed her son Itys, boiled him, served him up for supper to the
							unwitting Tereus, and fled with her sister in haste. When Tereus was

							being overtaken at Daulia in <name type="place" key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</name>, they prayed the gods to be turned into birds, and

								Aglaurus, Herse, and Pandrosus, the three daughters of Cecrops (see
								above, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.14.2">Apollod. 3.14.2</bibl>), were the

							inhabiting the Isthmus of <name type="place" key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</name> he used to force the passersby to keep bending pine
							trees; but they were too weak to do so, and being tossed up by the trees
							they perished miserably. In that way also Theseus killed Sinis.<note anchored="true" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Compare <bibl n="Bacchyl. Dith. 18.19">Bacch. 17(18).19ff., ed. Jebb</bibl>;

									<bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 38</bibl>. Bacchylides, the Scholiast on
								Pindar, and Hyginus call Sinis a son of Poseidon (Neptune). The
								ancients are not agreed as to the exact mode in which the ruffian
								Sinis despatched his victims. According to Diodorus, Pausanias, and
								the Scholiast on Pindar he bent two pine-trees to the ground, tied
								the extremities of his victim to both trees, and then let the trees
								go, which, springing up and separating, tore the wretch's body in
								two. This atrocious form of murder was at a later time actually
								employed by the emperor Aurelian in a military execution. See
									<bibl>Vopiscus, Aurelian, 7.4</bibl>. A Ruthenian pirate, named
								Botho, is said to have put men to death in similar fashion. See
									<bibl>Saxo Grammaticus, Historia Danica, bk. vii. vol. i. pp.
									353ff., ed. P. E. Müller</bibl>. According to Hyginus, Sinis,
								with the help of his victim, dragged down a pine-tree to the earth;
								then, when the man was struggling to keep the tree down, Sinis
								released it, and in the rebound the man was tossed up into the air
								and killed by falling heavily to the ground. Apollodorus seems to
								have contemplated a similar mode of death, except that he does not
								mention the cooperation of Sinis in bending the tree to the earth.
								According to the <title>Parian Chronicle</title> (<bibl>Marmor
									Parium 35ff.</bibl>) it was not on his journey from <name type="place" key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</name> to <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name> that Theseus
								killed Sinis, but at a later time, after he had come to the throne
								and united the whole of <name type="place" key="tgn,7002681">Attica</name> under a single government; he then returned to
								the Isthmus of <name type="place" key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</name>, killed Sinis, and celebrated the Isthmian
								games. This tradition seems to imply that Theseus held the games as
								a funeral honour paid to the dead man, or more probably as an
								expiation to appease the angry ghost of his victim. This implication
								is confirmed by the Scholiast on Pindar, who says that according to
								some people Theseus held the Isthmian games in honour of Sinis, whom
								he had killed. Plutarch tells us <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 8.2">Plut.
									Thes. 8.2</bibl> that when Theseus had killed Sinis, the
								daughter of the dead man, by name Perigune, fled and hid herself in
								a bed of asparagus; that she bore a son Melanippus to Theseus, and
								that Melanippus had a son Ioxus, whose descendants, the Ioxids, both
								men and women, revered and honoured asparagus and would not burn it,
								because asparagus had once sheltered their ancestress. This
								hereditary respect shown by all the members of a family or clan for
								a particular species of plant is reminiscent of totemism, though it
								is not necessarily a proof of it.</note>
