                                (First Vatican Mythographer 167; Second Vatican Mythographer
                                127)</bibl>. Curiously enough, the Second Vatican Mythographer
                            attributes the despatching of Sciron, not to Theseus, but to the artist
                            Daedalus. The Megarians, as we learn from Plutarch, indignantly denied
                            the defamatory reports current as to the character and pursuits of their
                            neighbour Sciron, whom they represented as a most respectable man, the
                            foe of robbers, the friend of the virtuous, and connected by marriage
                            with families of the highest quality; but their efforts to whitewash the
                            blackguard appear to have been attended with little success. The
                            Scironian Rocks, to which Sciron was supposed to have given his name,
                            are a line of lofty cliffs rising sheer from the sea; a narrow,
                            crumbling ledge about half way up their face afforded a perilous
                            foothold, from which the adventurous traveller looked down with horror
                            on the foam of the breakers far below. The dangers of the path were
                            obviated about the middle of the nineteenth century by the construction
                            of a road and railway along the coast. See Frazer's note on Paus. 1.44.6
                            (vol. ii. pp. 546ff. ).</note>

                            Apollodorus and Plutarch call him Damastes; but Apollodorus says that
                            some people called him Polypemon, and this latter name is supported by
                            Pausanias, who adds that he was surnamed Procrustes. Ovid in two
                            passages (<bibl n="Ov. Met. 7.438">Ov. Met. 7.438, Her. ii. 69</bibl>)
                            calls him simply Procrustes, but in a third passage (<bibl>Ovid, Ibis
                                407</bibl>) he seems to speak of him as the son of Polypemon. The
                                <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Hipp. 977</bibl> wrongly names him Sinis.
                            The reference of Bacchylides to him is difficult of interpretation. Jebb
                            translates the passage: “The mighty hammer of Polypemon has dropt from
                            the hand of the Maimer [Prokoptes], who has met with a stronger than
                            himself.” Here Jebb understands Prokoptes to be another name for
                            Procrustes, who received the hammer and learned the use of it from
                            Polypemon, his predecessor, perhaps his father. But other translations
                            and explanations have been proposed. See the note in <bibl>Jebb's
                                Appendix, pp. 490ff.</bibl>; <bibl>W. H. Roscher, <title>Lexikon der

                            The hammer in question was the instrument with which Procrustes operated
                            on the short men, beating them out till they fitted the long bed, as we
                            learn from the Scholiast on Euripides as well as from Apollodorus; a
                            handsaw was probably the instrument with which he curtailed the length
                            of the tall men. According to Apollodorus, with whom Hyginus agrees,
                            Procrustes had two beds for the accommodation of his guests, a long one
                            for the short men, and a short one for the long men. But according to
                            Diodorus Siculus, with whom the Scholiast on Euripides agrees, he had
                            only one bed for all comers, and adjusted his visitors to it with the
                            hammer or the handsaw according to circumstances.</note>

                            her lover. He was to fasten one end of the thread to the lintel of the
                            door on entering into the labyrinth, and holding the ball in his hand to
                            unwind the skein while he penetrated deeper and deeper into the maze,
                            till he found the Minotaur asleep in the inmost recess; then he was to
                            catch the monster by the hair and sacrifice him to Poseidon; after which
                            he was to retrace his steps, gathering up the thread behind him as he
                            went. According to the <bibl>Scholiast on the <title>Odyssey</title>

                            subject, both under the title of <title>Hippolytus</title>: it is the
                            second which has come down to us. In the first <title>Hippolytus</title>
                            the poet, incensed at the misconduct of his wife, painted the character
                            and behaviour of Phaedra in much darker colours than in the second,
                            where he has softened the portrait, representing the unhappy woman as
                            instigated by the revengeful Aphrodite, but resisting the impulse of her
                            fatal passion to the last, refusing to tell her love to Hippolytus, and
                            dying by her own hand rather than endure the shame of its betrayal by a
                            blabbing nurse. This version of the story is evidently not the one here
                            followed by Apollodorus, according to whom Phaedra made criminal
                            advances to her stepson. On the other hand the version of Apollodorus
                            agrees in this respect with that of the <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Od.
                                xi.321</bibl>: both writers may have followed the first
                                <title>Hippolytus</title> of Euripides. As to that lost play, of
                            which some fragments have come down to us, see the <bibl>Life of
                                Euripides in Westermann's <title>Vitarum Scriptores Graeci

                            Apollodorus says nothing as to the scene of the tragedy. Euripides in
                            his extant play lays it at <name type="place" key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</name>, whither Theseus had gone with Phaedra to be
                            purified for the slaughter of the sons of Pallas (<bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 34">Eur. Hipp. 34ff.</bibl>). Pausanias agrees with
                            this account, and tells us that the graves of the unhappy pair were to
                            be seen beside each other at <name type="place" key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</name>, near a myrtle-tree, of which the pierced leaves
                            still bore the print of Phaedra's brooch. The natural beauty of the spot
                            is in keeping with the charm which the genius of Euripides has thrown
                            over the romantic story of unhappy love and death. Of Troezen itself
                            only a few insignificant ruins remain, overgrown with weeds and
                            dispersed amid a wilderness of bushes. But hard by are luxuriant groves
                            of lemon and orange with here and there tall cypresses towering like
                            dark spires above them, while behind this belt of verdure rise wooded
                            hills, and across the blue waters of the nearly landlocked bay lies
                            Calauria, the sacred island of Poseidon, its peaks veiled in the sombre
                            green of the pines. A different place and time were assigned by Seneca
                            to the tragedy. According to him, the events took place at <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name>, and Phaedra
                            conceived her passion for Hippolytus and made advances to him during the
                            absence of her husband, who had gone down to the nether world with
                            Pirithous and was there detained for four years (<bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 835">Eur. Hipp.835ff.</bibl>). Diodorus Siculus agrees
                            with Euripides in laying the scene of the tragedy at <name type="place" key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</name>, and he agrees with Apollodorus in
                            saying that at the time when Phaedra fell in love with Hippolytus she
                            was the mother of two sons, Acamas and Demophon, by Theseus. In his
                            usual rationalistic vein Diodorus omits all mention of Poseidon and the
                            sea-bull, and ascribes the accident which befell Hippolytus to the
                            mental agitation he felt at his stepmother's calumny.</note>

                            to Servius and the Vatican Mythographers, after his death Caeneus was
                            changed back into a woman, thus conforming to an observation of Plato or
                            Aristotle that the sex of a person generally changes at each
                            transmigration of his soul into a new body. Curiously enough, the
                            Urabunna and Waramunga tribes of <name type="place" key="tgn,7001829">Central Australia</name> agree with Plato or Aristotle on this
                            point. They believe that the souls of the dead transmigrate sooner or
                            later into new bodies, and that at each successive transmigration they
                            change their sex. See <bibl>Sir. Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen,
                                    <title>The Northern Tribes of Central Australia</title> (London,
                                1904), p. 148</bibl>. According to <bibl n="Ov. Met. 12.524">Ov.
                                Met. 12.524ff.,</bibl> a bird with yellow wings was seen to rise
                            from the heap of logs under which Caeneus was overwhelmed; and the seer
                            Mopsus explained the bird to be Caeneus transformed into that creature.
                            Another tradition about Caeneus was that he set up his spear in the
                            middle of the marketplace and ordered people to regard it as a god and
                            to swear by it. He himself prayed and sacrificed to none of the gods,
                            but only to his spear. It was this impiety that drew down on him the
                            wrath of Zeus, who instigated the centaurs to overwhelm him. See the
                                <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. i.264</bibl>; <bibl>Scholiast on Ap.

                            Caeneus, his impiety, his invulnerability, and the manner of his death,
                            is told by the old prose-writer Acusilaus in a passage quoted by a Greek
                            grammarian, of whose work some fragments, written on papyrus, were
                            discovered some years ago at <name type="place" key="tgn,7001267">Oxyrhynchus</name> in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</name>. See <bibl>

                                pp. 133ff.</bibl> Apollodorus probably derived his account of
                            Caeneus from Acusilaus, whom he often refers to (see Index). The
                            fortunate discovery of this fragment of the ancient writer confirms our
                            confidence in the excellence of the sources used by Apollodorus and in
                            the fidelity with which he followed them. In his complete work he may
                            have narrated the impiety of Caeneus in setting up his spear for
                            worship, though the episode has been omitted in the Epitome.</note>

                            except Apollodorus in the present passage, expressly mentions the Chair
                            of Forgetfulness, though Horace seems to allude to it (<bibl n="Hor. Carm. 4.7.27">Hor. Carm. 4.7.27ff.</bibl>), where he speaks

                            faithful friend was powerless to break. But when Apollodorus speaks of
                            the heroes growing to their seats, he may be following the old poet
                            Panyasis, who said that Theseus and Pirithous were not pinioned to their
                            chairs, but that the rock growing to their flesh held them as in a vice
                                (<bibl n="Paus. 10.29.9">Paus. 10.29.9</bibl>). Indeed, Theseus
                            stuck so fast that, on being wrenched away by Hercules, he left a piece
                            of his person adhering to the rock, which, according to some people, was
                            the reason why the Athenians ever afterwards were so remarkably spare in

                            Lucian only the torment of thirst. According to another account,
                            Tantalus lay buried under Mount Sipylus in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</name>, which had been his home in life, and
                            on which his grave was shown down to late times (<bibl n="Paus. 2.22.3">Paus. 2.22.3</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 5.13.7">5.13.7</bibl>). The
                            story ran that Zeus owned a valuable watchdog, which guarded his
                            sanctuary in <name type="place" key="tgn,7012056">Crete</name>; but
                            Pandareus, the Milesian, stole the animal and entrusted it for
                            safekeeping to Tantalus. So Zeus sent Hermes to the resetter to reclaim
                            his property, but Tantalus impudently denied on oath that the creature
                            was in his house or that he knew anything about it. Accordingly, to
                            punish the perjured knave, the indignant Zeus piled Mount Sipylus on the
                            top of him. See the <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. O. 1.60(97)</bibl>;

                                <title>Tantalus</title> Sophocles seems to have introduced the theft
                            of the dog, the errand of Hermes to recover the animal, and perhaps the
                            burial of the thief under the mountain. See <bibl>

                                <bibl>Frazer, note on v.13.7 (vol. iii. pp. 553ff.)</bibl>. Ovid
                            mentions a certain Broteas, who from a desire of death burned himself on
                            a pyre (<bibl> Ovid, Ibis 517ff.</bibl>), and who is probably to be
                            identified with the Broteas of Apollodorus, though the Scholiasts on
                            Ovid describe him either as a son of Jupiter (Zeus), or as a son of
                            Vulcan (Hephaestus) and Pallas (Athena), identical with Erichthonius.
                            According to one of the Scholiasts, Broteas, son of Zeus, was a very
                            wicked man, who was blinded by Zeus, and loathing his life threw himself
                            on a burning pyre. According to another of the Scholiasts, Broteas, son
                            of Hephaestus and Athena, was despised for his ugliness, and this so
                            preyed on his mind that he preferred death by fire. See <bibl>Ovid,
                                Ibis, ed. R. Ellis, p. 89</bibl>. It seems not improbable that this
                            legend contains a reminiscence of a human sacrifice or suicide by fire,

                            the <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 990</bibl> agree closely with each other
                            and with that of Apollodorus, which they may have copied. They agree
                            with him and with the Scholiast on Pindar in alleging an incestuous
                            passion of Oenomaus for his daughter as the reason why he was reluctant
                            to give her in marriage; indeed they affirm that this was the motive
                            assigned for his conduct by the more accurate historians, though they
                            also mention the oracle which warned him that he would perish at the
                            hands of his in-law. The fear of this prediction being fulfilled is the
                            motive generally alleged by the extant writers of antiquity. Diodorus
                            Siculus mentions some particulars which are not noticed by other
                            authors. According to him, the goal of the race was the altar of
                            Poseidon at <name type="place" key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</name>, and
                            the suitor was allowed a start; for before mounting his chariot Oenomaus
                            sacrificed a ram to Zeus, and while he was sacrificing the suitor drove
                            off and made the best of his way along the road, until Oenomaus, having
                            completed the sacrifice, was free to pursue and overtake him. The
                            sacrifice was offered at a particular altar at <name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name>, which some people called the
                            altar of Hephaestus, and others the altar of Warlike Zeus (<bibl n="Paus. 5.14.6">Paus. 5.14.6</bibl>). In the eastern gable of the
                            temple of Zeus at <name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name> the competitors with their chariots and charioteers
                            were represented preparing for the race in the presence of an image of
                            Zeus; among them were Hippodamia and her mother Sterope. These
                            sculptures were found, more or less mutilated, by the Germans in their
                            excavation of <name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name>
                            and are now exhibited in the local museum. See <bibl n="Paus. 5.10.6">Paus. 5.10.6ff.</bibl> with (<bibl>Frazer, commentary vol. iii. pp.
                                504ff.</bibl>) Curiously enough, the scene of the story is
                            transposed by the <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 990</bibl>, who affirms
                            that Oenomaus reigned in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</name>, though at the same time he says, in accordance with
                            the usual tradition, that the goal of the race was the Isthmus of <name type="place" key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</name>. The connexion of
                            Oenomaus with <name type="place" key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</name> is to a
                            certain extent countenanced by a story for which the authority cited is
                            Theopompus. He related that when Pelops was on his way to <name type="place" key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</name> (<name type="place" key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</name>) to woo Hippodamia, his
                            charioteer Cillus died in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</name>, and that his ghost appeared to Pelops in a dream,

                            which had been born in his flocks; but meanwhile the lamb had been given
                            by his treacherous wife Aerope to her paramour Thyestes, who produced it
                            in evidence of his claim and was accordingly awarded the crown. However,
                            with the assistance of Zeus, the rightful claimant Atreus was able to
                            exhibit a still greater portent, which was the sun and the Pleiades

                            the west. This mighty marvel, attesting the divine approbation of
                            Atreus, clinched the dispute in his favour; he became king, and banished
                            his rival Thyestes. According to a different account, which found favour
                            with the Latin poets, the sun reversed his course in the sky, not in
                            order to demonstrate the right of Atreus to the crown, but on the
                            contrary to mark his disgust and horror at the king for murdering his
                            nephews and dishing up their mangled limbs to their father Thyestes at

                                i.93</bibl>. In later times rationalists explained the old fable by
                            saying that Atreus was an astronomer who first calculated an eclipse,
                            and so threw his less scientific brother into the shade (<bibl>Hyginus,
                                Fab. 158</bibl>; <bibl n="Serv. A. 1.568">Serv. A. 1.568</bibl>), or
                            who first pointed out that the sun appears to revolve in a direction
                            contrary to the motion of the stars. See <bibl n="Strab. 1.2.15">Strab.
                                1.2.15</bibl>; <bibl>Lucian, De astrologia 12</bibl>. A fragment of
                            Euripides appears to show that he put in the mouth of Atreus this claim
                            to astronomical discovery. See <bibl>TGF (Nauck 2nd ed.), p. 639, frag.
                                861</bibl>. A still more grandiose explanation of the myth was given
                            by Plato l.c., who adduced it, with grave irony, as evidence that in
                            alternate cycles of vast duration the universe revolves in opposite
                            directions, the reversal of its motion at the end of each cycle being
                            accompanied by a great destruction of animal life. This magnificent
                            theory was perhaps suggested to the philosopher by the speculations of
                            Empedocles, and it bears a resemblance not only to the ancient Indian
                            doctrine of successive epochs of creation and destruction, but also to
                            Herbert Spencer's view of the great cosmic process as moving eternally
                            in alternate and measureless cycles of evolution and dissolution. See

                                    in his text (see above p. 164). The restoration of the passage
                                    to its present place in the text of Apollodorus is due to the

                            The story ran that all the gods and goddesses, except Strife, were
                            invited to attend the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, and that Strife,
                            out of spite at being overlooked, threw among the wedding guests a
                            golden apple inscribed with the words, “Let the fair one take it,” or
                            “The apple for the fair.” Three goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite,
                            contended for this prize of beauty, and Zeus referred the disputants to
                            the judgment of Paris. The intervention of Strife was mentioned in the
                            Cypria according to Proclus, but without mention of the golden apple,
                            which first appears in late writers, such as Lucian and Hyginus. The
                            offers made by the three divine competitors to Paris are recorded with
                            substantial agreement by <bibl n="Eur. Tro. 924">Eur. Tro.

                            magic art a phantom Helen, which he gave to Paris to carry away with him

                            fought and died, was a mere wraith, while her true self was far away,

                            or with Proteus in <name type="place" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</name>;
                            for there is nothing to show whether Stesichorus shared the opinion that
                            Paris had spirited her away to the East before he returned, with or
                            without her, to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>. This
                            view the poet propounded by way of an apology to Helen for the evil he
                            had spoken of her in a former poem; for having lost the sight of his
                            eyes he ascribed the loss to the vengeance of the heroine, and sought to
                            propitiate her by formally retracting all the scandals he had bruited
                            about concerning her. See <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 243a">Plat. Phaedrus

                            whereupon the father at once checked the plough and betrayed his sanity.
                            However, Lucian agrees with Apollodorus in saying that Palamedes
                            threatened the child with his sword, though at the same time, by
                            mentioning the unlike animals yoked together, he shows that he had the
                            scene of the ploughing in his mind. His description purports to be based
                            on a picture, probably a famous picture of the scene which was still

                        him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to
                        Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, he dropped
                        the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and
                        delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The Machiavellian device by

                            Scholiast, a servant of Palamedes was bribed to secrete the forged
                            letter and the gold under his master's bed, where they were discovered
                            and treated as damning evidence of treason. According to Hyginus,
                            Ulysses had recourse to a still more elaborate stratagem in order to
                            bury the gold in the earth under the tent of Palamedes. Compare <bibl n="Serv. A. 2.81">Serv. Verg. A. 2.81</bibl>; <bibl>Lactantius

                        Dionysus granted them the power of producing oil, corn, and wine from the

                                3.80</bibl>; <bibl>Dictys Cretensis i.23</bibl>. Each of the
                            Winegrowers received from Dionysus the power of producing the thing from
                            which she derived her name; thus Elais, who took her name from <foreign lang="greek">e)lai/a</foreign>, “an olive,” could produce olive oil;
                            Spermo, who took her name from <foreign lang="greek">spe/rma</foreign>,
                            “seed,” could produce corn; and Oeno, who took her name from <foreign lang="greek">oi)=nos</foreign>, “wine,” could produce wine.
                            According to Apollodorus, the women elicited these products from the
                            ground; but according to Ovid and Servius, whatever they touched was
                            turned into olive-oil, corn, or wine, as the case might be. Possessing
                            these valuable powers, the daughters of Anius were naturally much sought
                            after. Their father, a son of Apollo, was king of <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name> and at the same time priest of his
                            father Apollo (<bibl n="Verg. A. 3.80">Verg. A. 3.80</bibl>), and when
                            Aeneas visited the island on his way from <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, the king, with pardonable pride,
                            dwelt on his daughters' accomplishments and on the income they had
                            brought him in (<bibl n="Ov. Met. 13.650">Ov. Met. 13.650ff.</bibl>) It
                            is said by Tzetzes that when the Greeks sailed for <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> and landed in <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>, the king, who had received the
                            gift of prophecy from his divine sire (<bibl>Diod. 5.62.2</bibl>),
                            foretold that <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> would
                            not be taken for ten years, and invited them to stay with him for nine
                            years, promising that his daughters would find them in food all the
                            time. This hospitable offer was apparently not accepted at the moment;
                            but afterwards, when the Greeks were encamped before <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, Agamemnon sent for the young women
                            and ordered them peremptorily to feed his army. This they did
                            successfully, if we may believe Tzetzes; but, to judge by Ovid's
                            account, they found the work of the commissariat too exacting, for he
                            says that they took to flight. Being overtaken by their pursuers, they
                            prayed to Dionysus, who turned them into white doves. And that, says
                            Servius, is why down to this day it is deemed a sin to harm a dove in
                                <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name>. From Tzetzes we
                            learn that the story of these prolific damsels was told by Pherecydes
                            and by the author of the epic <title>Cypria</title>, from whom
                            Pherecydes may have borrowed it. Stesichorus related how Menelaus and
                            Ulysses went to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name> to
                            fetch the daughters of Anius (<bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Od.
                            vi.164</bibl>). If we may judge from the place which the brief mention
                            of these women occupies in the <title>Epitome</title> of Apollodorus, we
                            may conjecture that in his full text he described how their services
                            were requisitioned to victual the fleet and army assembling at <name type="place" key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</name>. The conjecture is
                            confirmed by the statement of Dictys Cretensis, that before the Greek
                            army set sail from <name type="place" key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</name>,
                            it had received a supply of corn, wine, and other provisions from Anius
                            and his daughters. It may have been in order to ensure these supplies
                            that Menelaus and Ulysses repaired to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delos">Delos</name> for the purpose of securing the

                            The numbers of the ships and leaders recorded by Apollodorus do not
                            always tally with those of Homer. For example, he gives the Boeotians
                            forty ships, while Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.509">Hom. Il.
                            5.509</bibl>) gives them fifty; and he says that the Phocians had four

                            mentions only two. The question of the catalogue of the Greek forces,
                            and its relation to Homer and history, are fully discussed by Dr. Walter

                                <title>Homer and History</title> (London, 1915)</bibl>. He concludes
                            that the catalogue forms no part of the original but was added to it at
                            a later time by a patriotic Boeotian for the purpose of glorifying his
                            people by claiming that they played a very important part in the Trojan
                            war, although this claim is inconsistent with the statement of <bibl n="Thuc. 1.12">Thuc. 1.12</bibl> that the Boeotians did not migrate

                            and at least generally in the manner, described in Homer,” and that the

                            the rags and tatters in which Telephus appeared on the stage in
                            Euripides's play (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 430">Aristoph. Acharn.
                                430ff.</bibl>). Apollodorus may have had the passage of Euripides or
                            the parody of Aristophanes in mind when he describes Telephus as clad in
                            rags. The cure of a wound by an application to it of rust from the
                            weapon which inflicted the hurt is not to be explained, as Pliny
                            supposed, by any medicinal property inherent in rust as such, else the
                            rust from any weapon would serve the purpose. It is clearly a folklore
                            remedy based on the principle of sympathetic magic. Similarly Iphiclus
                            was cured of impotence by the rust of the same knife which had caused
                            the infirmity. See <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.12">Apollod. 1.9.12</bibl>. The
                            proverbial remedy for the bite of a dog “the hair of the dog that bit
                            you,” is strictly analogous in principle; for it is not the hair of any
                            dog that will work the cure, but only the hair of the particular dog
                            that inflicted the bite. Thus we read of a beggar who was bitten by a
                            dog, at the vicarage of Heversham, in Westmoreland, and went back to the
                            house to ask for some of the animal's hair to put on the wound. See
                                <bibl>W. Henderson, <title>Notes on the Folk-lore of the Northern
                                    Counties of England</title> (London, 1879), p. 160, note
                                1</bibl>. A precisely similar remedy for similar hurts appears to be
                            popular in <name type="place" key="tgn,1000111">China</name>; for we
                            hear of a missionary who travelled about the province of Canton
                            accompanied by a powerful dog, which bit children in the villages
                            through which his master passed; and when a child was bitten, its mother
                            used to run after the missionary and beg for a hair from the dog's tail
                            to lay on the child's wound as a remedy. See <bibl>N. B. Dennys,

                            worshipped after his death as a god by the people of Tenedos, who made a
                            precinct for him and offered sacrifices to him down to late times. No
                            flute-player was allowed to enter the precinct, because a flute-player
                            had borne false witness against Tenes; and the name of Achilles might

                            Philoctetes happened, not in <name type="place" key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</name>, but in the small island of <name type="place" key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</name>, where a goddess of that name was
                            worshipped, and the serpent which bit Philoctetes was the guardian of

                            with Athena, and said that Philoctetes was stung while he was cleansing

                            supported by Sophocles nor by the evidence of a vase painting, which

                            to the first century B.C. were to be seen “an altar of Philoctetes, a

                            memorial of his sufferings” (<bibl>Appian, Mithridat. 77</bibl>). The
                            island had sunk in the sea before the time of Pausanias in the second

                            According to a different account, the unfortunate encounter of
                            Philoctetes with the snake took place in <name type="place" key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</name> itself, the island where he was

                            bow and arrows of Hercules from that hero as a reward for his service in
                            kindling the pyre on Mount Oeta. See <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 801">Soph.

                            account, which Servius has preserved, it was from these arrows,
                            envenomed with the poison of the hydra, and not from a serpent, that
                            Philoctetes received his grievous hurt. It is said that Hercules on the
                            pyre solemnly charged his friend never to reveal the spot where his
                            ashes should repose. Philoctetes promised with an oath to observe the
                            wish of his dying friend, but afterwards he betrayed the secret by
                            stamping with his foot on the grave. Hence on his way to the war one of
                            the poisoned arrows fell upon and wounded the traitor foot. See <bibl n="Serv. A. 3.402">Serv. Verg. A. 3.402</bibl>; <bibl>Scriptores

                            devotion by dedicating to him many vessels of gold and silver and

                            restored to her for only three hours; her prayer was granted, but she
                            could not bear the grief of parting with him, and died in his arms
                                (<bibl>Servius, l.c.</bibl>). A rationalistic version of the story
                            ran that Laodamia had made a waxen image of her dead husband and
                            secretly embraced it, till her father ordered it to be burned, when she
                            threw herself into the fire and perished with the image (<bibl>Hyginus,
                                Fab. 104</bibl>). According to Ovid, Laodamia made the waxen image
                            of her absent lord and fondled it even in his lifetime. Her sad story
                            was the theme of a tragedy of Euripides (<bibl>TGF (Nauck 2nd ed.), pp.

                            represented as a youth, but the stories concerning his death are
                            various. According to Eustathius, the lad was exercising his horses in
                            the Thymbraeum or sanctuary of the Thymbraean Apollo, when Achilles
                            killed him with his spear. Tzetzes says that he was a son of Hecuba by
                            Apollo, though nominally by Priam, that he fled from his assailant to
                            the temple of Apollo, and was cut down by Achilles at the altar. There
                            was a prophecy that <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>
                            could not be taken if Troilus should live to the age of twenty (so the
                            First Vatican Mythographer). This may have been the motive of Achilles
                            for slaying the lad. According to <bibl>Dictys Cretensis iv.9</bibl>,
                            Troilus was taken prisoner and publicly slaughtered in cold blood by
                            order of Achilles. The indefatigable Sophocles, as usual, wrote a

                            of the slain woman, she came to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> to be purified from her guilt. The same story is told

                            beautiful Amazon. In the <title>Aethiopis</title> it was related how,

                            made Achilles invulnerable by dipping him in the water of Styx; but his
                            heel, by which she held him, was not wetted by the water and so remained

                            agent of Achilles's death. Some writers, like Arctinus and Apollodorus,
                            say that the hero was killed by Apollo and Paris jointly. Thus in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.359">Hom. Il. 22.359ff.</bibl>) the dying Hector
                            prophesies that Achilles will be slain by Paris and Apollo at the Scaean
                            gate; and the same prophecy is put by Homer more darkly into the mouth
                            of the talking horse Xanthus, who, like Balaam's ass, warns his master
                            of the danger that besets his path (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 19.404">Hom. Il.
                                19.404ff.</bibl>). According to Virgil and Ovid, it was the hand of
                            Paris that discharged the fatal arrow, but the hand of Apollo that
                            directed it to the mark. See <bibl n="Verg. A. 6.56">Verg. A.

                                (<bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 107</bibl>). But in one passage (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 21.277">Hom. Il. 21.277ff.</bibl>) homer speaks of the
                            death of Achilles as wrought by the shafts of Apollo alone; and this
                            version was followed by <bibl>Quintus Smyrnaeus, Posthomerica

                            said that Priam offered her hand in marriage to Achilles on condition

                            raised. In the negotiations which were carried on for this purpose
                            Achilles went alone and unarmed to the temple of Thymbraean Apollo and
                            was there treacherously assassinated, Deiphobus clasping him to his
                            breast in a pretended embrace of friendship while Paris stabbed him with

                            Vatican Mythographer tells us that Achilles first saw Polyxena, Hector's
                            sister, when she stood on a tower in the act of throwing down bracelets
                            and earrings with which to ransom Hector's body, and that when Achilles
                            came to the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo to ratify the treaty of
                            marriage and peace, Paris lurked behind the image of the god and shot
                            the confiding hero with an arrow. This seems to be the account of the

                            of Achilles, after his body had been burnt on the pyre, were laid with
                            the bones of his friend Patroclus in a golden urn, made by Hephaestus,
                            which Thetis had received from Dionysus. The urn was buried at the
                            headland of Sigeum, according to Tzetzes and Dictys Cretensis. In
                                <bibl>Quintus Smyrnaeus, iii.766-780</bibl> we read how Poseidon
                            comforted Thetis by assuring her that Achilles, her sorrow, was not
                            dead, for he himself would bestow on the departed hero an island in the
                            Euxine Sea where he should be a god for evermore, worshipped with
                            sacrifices by the neighbouring tribes. The promised land was the White
                            Isle mentioned by Apollodorus. It is described as a wooded island off
                            the mouth of the Danube. In it there was a temple of Achilles with an
                            image of him; and there the hero was said to dwell immortal with Helen
                            for his wife and his friends Patroclus and Antilochus for his
                            companions. There he chanted the verses of Homer, and mariners who
                            sailed near the island could hear the song wafted clearly across the
                            water; while such as put in to the shore or anchored off the coast,
                            heard the trampling of horses, the shouts of warriors, and the clash of
                            arms. See <bibl n="Paus. 3.19.11">Paus. 3.19.11-13</bibl>;

                            White Isle, the statement of Apollodorus that the Greeks interred him in
                            the White Isle must be regarded as erroneous, whether the error is due
                            to Apollodorus himself, or, as is more probable, either to his
                            abbreviator or to a copyist. Perhaps in the original form of his work
                            Apollodorus followed Arctinus in describing how Thetis snatched the body
                            of Achilles from the pyre and transported it to the White Isle.</note>

                            was afterwards repeated by Simonides. The story is unknown to Homer, who
                            describes the shade of Achilles repining at his lot and striding alone

                            that the Trojans and Pallas Athena acted as judges and awarded the arms
                            to Ulysses. A <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Od. 11.547</bibl> informs us that
                            Agamemnon, unwilling to undertake the invidious duty of deciding between
                            the two competitors, referred the dispute to the decision of the Trojan
                            prisoners, inquiring of them which of the two heroes had done most harm
                            to the Trojans. The prisoners decided that Ulysses was the man, and the
                            arms were therefore awarded to him. According to another account, which
                            was adopted by the author of the <title>Little Iliad</title>, the Greeks
                            on the advice of Nestor sent spies to the walls of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> to overhear the Trojans discussing
                            the respective merits of the two champions. They heard two girls
                            debating the question, and thinking that she who gave the preference to
                            Ulysses reasoned the better, they decided accordingly. See
                                <bibl>Scholiast on Aristoph. Kn. 1056</bibl>. According to <bibl n="Pind. N. 8">Pind. N. 8.26(45)ff.</bibl>, it was the Greeks who by
                            secret votes decided in favour of Ulysses. The subject was treated by
                            Aeschylus in a lost play called <title>The Decision of the Arms</title>.

                            in representing the Trojan captives as the judges in the dispute, while
                            Ovid speaks of the Greek chiefs sitting in judgment and deciding in
                            favour of Ulysses. According to <bibl>Zenobius, Cent. i.43</bibl>, Ajax
                            in his frenzy scourged two rams, believing that he was scourging
                            Agamemnon and Menelaus. This account is based on the description of the
                            frenzy of Ajax in <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 97">Soph. Aj. 97-110</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 237">Soph. Aj. 237-244</bibl>).</note> And Agamemnon

                            coffin.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Similarly the
                            author of the <title>Little Iliad</title> said that the body of Ajax was
                            not burned, but placed in a coffin “on account of the wrath of the
                            king.” See <bibl>Eustathius on Hom. Il. ii.557, p. 285</bibl>.
                            Philostratus tells us that the body was laid in the earth by direction
                            of the seer Calchas, “because suicides may not lawfully receive the
                            burial by fire” (<bibl>Philostratus, Her. xiii.7</bibl>). This was
                            probably the true reason for the tradition that the corpse was not
                            cremated in the usual way. For the ghosts of suicides appear to be
                            commonly dreaded; hence unusual modes of disposing of their bodies are
                            adopted in order to render their spirits powerless for mischief. For
                            example, the Baganda of Central Africa, who commonly bury their dead in
                            the earth, burn the bodies of suicides on waste land or at crossroads in
                            order to destroy the ghosts; for they believe that if the ghost of a
                            suicide is not thus destroyed, it will tempt other people to imitate its
                            example. As an additional precaution everyone who passed the place where
                            the body of a suicide had been burnt threw some grass or a few sticks on
                            the spot, “so as to prevent the ghost from catching him, in case it had
                            not been destroyed.” For the same reason, if a man took his life by
                            hanging himself on a tree, the tree was torn up by the roots and burned
                            with the body; if he had killed himself in a house, the house was pulled
                            down and the materials consumed with fire; for “people feared to live in
                            a house in which a suicide had taken place, lest they too should be
                            tempted to commit the same crime.” See <bibl>J. Roscoe, <title>The
                                    Baganda</title> (London, 1911), pp. 20ff., 289</bibl>. Similar
                            customs prevailed among the Banyoro, a neighbouring nation of Central
                            Africa. “It was said to be necessary to destroy a tree upon which a
                            person had hanged himself and to burn down a house in which a person had
                            committed suicide, otherwise they would be a danger to people in general
                            and would influence them to commit suicide.” See <bibl>J. Roscoe,
                                    <title>The Northern Bantu</title> (Cambridge, 1915), pp.
                                24ff.</bibl> (where, however, the burning of the body is not
                            expressly mentioned). In like manner the Hos of <name type="place" key="tgn,7016577">Togoland</name>, in West Africa, are much afraid
                            of the ghost of a suicide. They believe that the ghost of a man who has
                            hanged himself will torment the first person who sees the body. Hence
                            when the relations of such a man approach the corpse they protect
                            themselves against the ghost by wearing magical cords and smearing their
                            faces with a magical powder. The tree on which a man hanged himself is
                            cut down, and the branch on which he tied the fatal noose is lopped off.
                            To this branch the corpse is then tied and dragged ruthlessly through
                            the woods, over stones and through thorny bushes, to the place where
                            “men of blood,” that is, all who die a violent death, are buried. There
                            they dig a shallow grave in great haste and throw the body in. Having
                            done so they run home; for they say that the ghosts of “men of blood”
                            fling stones at such as do not retreat fast enough, and that he who is
                            struck by one of these stones must die. The houses of such men are
                            broken down and burnt. A suicide is believed to defile the land and to
                            prevent rain from falling. Hence the district where a man has killed
                            himself must be purified by a sacrifice offered to the Earth-god. See
                                <bibl>J. Spieth, <title>Die Ewe-Stämme</title> (Berlin, 1906), pp.

                            bodies of suicides, see <bibl>R. Lasch, “Die Behandlung der Leiche des

                                63-66)</bibl>. In the <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles the rites of
                            burial are at first refused, but afterwards conceded, to the dead body
                            of Ajax; and though these ceremonies are not described, we may assume
                            that they included the burning of the corpse on a pyre. This variation
                            from what appears to be the usual tradition may have been introduced by
                            Sophocles out of deference to the religious feelings of the Athenians,
                            who worshipped Ajax as a hero, and who would have been shocked to think
                            of his remains being denied the ordinary funeral honours. See

                            Philoctetes). The story was told somewhat differently by Lesches in the
                                <title>Little Iliad</title>. According to him, the prophecy that
                                <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> could not be taken
                            without the help of Philoctetes was uttered, not by Calchas, but by the
                            Trojan seer Helenus, whom Ulysses had captured; Philoctetes was brought
                            from <name type="place" key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</name> by Diomedes
                            alone, and he was healed, not by Podalirius, but by Machaon. The account
                            of <bibl>Tzetzes, Posthomerica 571-595</bibl> agrees with that of
                            Lesches in respect of the prophecy of Helenus and the cure by Machaon.
                            Sophocles also followed the <title>Little Iliad</title> in putting the
                            prophecy in the mouth of the captured Trojan seer Helenus (<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 604">Soph. Phil. 604-613</bibl>). Compare

                            agree, the envoys were Ulysses and Diomedes; according to Sophocles,
                            they were Ulysses and Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. See <bibl>Dio

                            Greek envoys who fetched Neoptolemus from Scyros were Ulysses and
                            Phoenix. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, they were Ulysses and Diomedes.
                            Ulysses is the only envoy mentioned by Homer, Lesches, and Tzetzes; and
                            Phoenix is the only envoy mentioned by Philostratus. Pindar speaks
                            vaguely of “messengers.” In this passage I have adopted Wagner's
                            conjecture <foreign lang="greek">pei/qousi &lt; au)&gt; to\n
                                Neopto/lemon proe/sqai</foreign>, “persuaded him to let Neoptolemus
                            go.” If this conjecture is not accepted, we seem forced to translate the
                            passage “persuaded Neoptolemus to venture.” But I cannot cite any exact
                            parallel to such a use of the middle of <foreign lang="greek">proi/+hmi.</foreign> When employed absolutely, the verb seems often
                            to convey a bad meaning. Thus Demosthenes uses it in the sense of
                            “throwing away a chance,” “neglecting an opportunity” (<bibl n="Dem. 19.150">Dem.19.150, 152</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                                pro/esqai, ou) proh/sesqai</foreign>). Iphicrates employed it with
                            the same significance (quoted by <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 2.23.3">Aristot.
                                Rh. 2.1397b</bibl>
                            <foreign lang="greek">dio/ti proei=to</foreign>). Aristotle applied the
                            verb to a man who had “thrown away” his health (<bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1114a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 3.1114a 15</bibl>,

                                dunato\n a)nalabei=n</foreign>). However, elsewhere Aristotle uses
                            the word to describe the lavish liberality of generous men (<bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 1.9.5">Aristot. Rh. 1.1366b</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ei)=ta h( e)leuqerio/ths: proi/+entai ga\r kai\ ou)k

                                a)/lloi</foreign>). In the present passage of Apollodorus, if
                            Wagner's emendation is not accepted, we might perhaps read <foreign lang="greek">&lt;mh\&gt;pro/esqai</foreign> and translate,
                            “persuaded Neoptolemus not to throw away the chance.” But it is better
                            to acquiesce in Wagner's simple and probable correction.</note> On

                            himself, comes as a spy to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, and being recognized by Helen he makes a compact with
                            her concerning the capture of the city; and having slain some of the
                            Trojans he arrives at the ships. And after these things he with Diomedes
                            conveys the Palladium out of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</name>.” From this it appears that Ulysses made two different
                            expeditions to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>: in one
                            of them he went by himself as a spy in mean attire, and being recognized
                            by Helen concerted with her measures for betraying <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> to the Greeks; in the other he went
                            with Diomedes, and together the two stole the Palladium. The former of
                            these expeditions is described by Homer in the <title>Odyssey</title>
                                (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 4.242">Hom. Od. 4.242ff.</bibl>), where Helen
                            tells how Ulysses disfigured himself with wounds, and disguising himself
                            in mean attire came as a beggar to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>; how she alone detected him, wormed the secrets of the
                            Greeks out of him, and having sworn not to betray him till he had
                            returned in safety to the ships, let him go free, whereupon on his way
                            back he killed many Trojans. Euripides also relates this visit of
                            Ulysses to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, adding
                            that Helen revealed his presence to Hecuba, who spared his life and sent
                            him out of the country (<bibl n="Eur. Hec. 239">Eur. Hec.
                            239-250</bibl>). These two quite distinct expeditions of Ulysses have
                            been confused and blended into one by Apollodorus. As to the joint
                            expedition of Ulysses and Diomedes to <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, and the stealing of the Palladium,

                                Cretensis v.5, 8ff.</bibl> The narrative of Apollodorus suggests
                            that Ulysses had the principal share in the exploit. But according to
                            another and seemingly more prevalent tradition it was Diomedes who
                            really bore off the image. This emerges particularly from Conon's
                            account. Diomedes, he tells us, mounted on the shoulders of Ulysses, and
                            having thus scaled the wall, he refused to draw his comrade up after
                            him, and went in search of the Palladium. Having secured it, he returned
                            with it to Ulysses, and together they retraced their steps to the Greek
                            camp. But by the way the crafty Ulysses conceived the idea of murdering
                            his companion and making himself master of the fateful image. So he
                            dropped behind Diomedes and drew his sword. But the moon shone full; and
                            as he raised his arm to strike, the flash of the blade in the moonlight
                            caught the eye of the wary Diomedes. He faced round, drew his sword,
                            and, upbraiding the other with his cowardice, drove him before him,
                            while he beat the back of the recreant with the flat of his sword. This
                            incident gave rise to the proverb, “Diomedes's compulsion,” applied to
                            such as did what they were forced to do by dire necessity. The proverb
                            is similarly explained by the other Greek proverb-writers and
                            lexicographers cited above, except that, instead of the flash of the
                            sword in the moonlight, they say it was the shadow of the sword raised
                            to strike him which attracted the attention of Diomedes. The picturesque
                            story appears to have been told in the <title>Little Iliad</title>
                                (<bibl>Hesychius, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*diomh/deios
                                    a)na/gkh</foreign>
                            </bibl>). According to one account, Diomedes and Ulysses made their way
                            into the Trojan citadel through a sewer (<bibl n="Serv. A. 2.166">Serv.
                                Verg. A. 2.166</bibl>), indeed a narrow and muddy sewer, as
                            Sophocles called it in the play which he composed on the subject. See
                                <bibl>Julius Pollux, ix.49</bibl>; <bibl>
                                <title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, ii.36,
                                frag. 367</bibl>. Some affirmed that the Palladium was treacherously
                            surrendered to the Greek heroes by Theano, the priestess of the goddess
                                (<bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Il. vi.311</bibl>; <bibl>Suidas, s.v.
                                    <foreign lang="greek">*palla/dion</foreign>
                            </bibl>); to this step she was said to have been instigated by her
                            husband Antenor (<bibl>Malalas, Chr. v. p. 109, ed. L. Dindorf</bibl>;
                                <bibl>Dictys Cretensis v.5, 8</bibl>). As to Theano in her capacity
                            of priestess, see <bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.297">Hom. Il. 6.297ff.</bibl> The
                            theft of the Palladium furnished a not infrequent subject to Greek
                            artists; but the artistic, like the literary, tradition was not agreed
                            on the question whether the actual thief was Diomedes or Ulysses. See
                                <bibl>Frazer on Paus. 1.22.6 (vol. ii. pp. 264 sq.)</bibl>.</note>

                                11ff.</bibl> The story is only alluded to by Homer, but was no doubt
                            fully told by Lesches and Arctinus, though of their narratives we
                            possess only the brief abstracts of Proclus. The accounts of later
                            writers, such as Virgil, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus, Tzetzes, and
                            Apollodorus himself, are probably based on the works of these early
                            cyclic poets. The poem of Arctinus, if we may judge by Proclus's
                            abstract, opened with the deliberations of the Trojans about the Wooden
                            Horse, and from the similarity of the abstract to the text of
                            Apollodorus we may infer that our author followed Arctinus generally,
                            though not in all details; for instance, he differed from Arctinus in
                            regard to the affair of Laocoon and his sons. See below. With the
                            stratagem of the Wooden Horse we may compare the stratagem by which, in
                            the war of Independence waged by the <name type="place" key="tgn,7016845">United Provinces</name> against <name type="place" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</name>, Prince Maurice contrived to make
                            himself master of <name type="place" key="tgn,7006827">Breda</name>. The
                            city was then held by a Spanish garrison, which received its supply of
                            fuel by boats. The master of one of these boats, Adrian Vandenberg by
                            name, noticed that in the absence of the governor there was great
                            negligence in conducting the examination to which all boats were
                            subjected before they were allowed to enter the town. This suggested to
                            Vandenberg a plan for taking the citadel by surprise. He communicated
                            his plan to Prince Maurice, who readily embraced it. Accordingly the
                            boat was loaded in appearance with turf as usual; but the turf was
                            supported by a floor of planks fixed at the distance of several feet
                            from the bottom; and beneath this floor seventy picked soldiers were
                            placed under the command of an able officer named Harauguer. The boat
                            had but a few miles to sail, yet through unexpected accidents several
                            days passed before they could reach <name type="place" key="tgn,7006827">Breda</name>. The wind veered against them, the melting ice (for it
                            was the month of February) retarded their course, and the boat, having
                            struck upon a bank, was so much damaged that the soldiers were for some
                            time up to their knees in water. Their provisions were almost spent, and
                            to add to their anxieties one of their number was seized with a violent
                            cough, which, if it had continued, would inevitably have betrayed them
                            to the enemy. The man generously entreated his comrades to kill him,
                            offering them his own sword for the purpose; but they as generously
                            refused, and happily the soldier's cough left him before they approached
                            the walls. Even the leak in the boat was stopped by some accident. On
                            reaching the fortifications the boat was searched, but only in the most
                            superficial manner. Still the danger was great, for the turf was
                            immediately purchased and the soldiers of the garrison set to work to
                            unload it. They would soon have uncovered the planks and detected the
                            ambush, if the ready-witted master of the boat had not first amused them
                            with his discourse and then invited them to drink wine with him. The
                            offer was readily accepted. The day wore on, darkness fell, and the
                            Spanish soldiers were all drunk or asleep. At dead of night Harauguer
                            and his men issued from the boat, and dividing into two bodies they
                            attacked the guards and soon made themselves masters of two gates.
                            Seized with a panic, the garrison fled the town. Prince Maurice marched
                            in and took possession of the citadel. These events happened in the year

                                i. pp. 144ff. (Second Vatican Mythographer 207)</bibl>. According to
                            Arctinus, our oldest authority for the tragedy of Laocoon, the two
                            serpents killed Laocoon himself and one of his sons. According to
                            Virgil, Hyginus, and Servius, they killed Laocoon and both his sons.
                            According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, the serpents killed the two sons but
                            spared the father, who lived to lament their fate. This last seems to
                            have been the version followed by Apollodorus. The reason of the
                            calamity which befell Laocoon is explained by Servius on the authority
                            of Euphorion. He tells us that when the Greek army landed in the <name type="place" key="tgn,7002331">Troad</name>, the Trojans stoned the
                            priest of Poseidon to death, because he had not, by offering sacrifices
                            to the sea god, prevented the invasion. Accordingly, when the Greeks
                            seemed to be departing, it was deemed advisable to sacrifice to
                            Poseidon, no doubt in order to induce him to give the Greeks a stormy
                            passage. But the priesthood was vacant, and it was necessary to choose a
                            priest by lot. The lot fell on Laocoon, priest of the Thymbraean Apollo,
                            but he had incurred the wrath of Apollo by sleeping with his wife in
                            front of the divine image, and for this sacrilege he perished with his
                            two sons. This narrative helps us to understand the statement of
                            Apollodorus that the two serpents were sent by Apollo for a sign.
                            According to Tzetzes, the death of Laocoon's son took place in the
                            temple of the Thymbraean Apollo, the scene of the crime thus becoming
                            the scene of the punishment. Sophocles wrote a tragedy on the subject of
                            Laocoon, but though a few fragments of the play have survived, its
                            contents are unknown. See <bibl>TGF (Nauck 2nd ed.), pp. 211ff.</bibl>; <bibl>

                                ii. pp. 38ff.</bibl> In modern times the story of Laocoon is
                            probably even better known from the wonderful group of statuary in the
                                <name type="place" key="tgn,7001168">Vatican</name> than from the
                            verses of Virgil. That group, the work of three Rhodian sculptors,
                            graced the palace of the emperor Titus in the time of Pliny, who
                            declared that it was to be preferred to any other work either of
                            sculpture or painting (<bibl>Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxxvi.37</bibl>). Lessing
                            took the group for the text of his famous essay on the comparative
                            limitations of poetry and art.</note>

                            from the grave of Achilles is Tryphiodorus, who adds that all night long
                            there blazed a light like the full moon above Helen's chamber, for she
                            too was awake and signalling to the enemy, while all the town was
                            plunged in darkness and silence; the sounds of revelry and music had
                            died away, and not even the barking of a dog broke the stillness of the
                            summer night. See <bibl>Tryphiodorus, Excidium Ilii 487-521</bibl>. That
                            the poet conceived the fall of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> to have happened in the summer time is shown by his
                            describing how the Trojans wreathed the mane of the Wooden Horse with
                            flowers culled on river banks, and how the women spread carpets of roses
                            under its feet (<bibl>Tryphiodorus, Excidium Ilii 316ff.,
                            340-344</bibl>). For these flowers of fancy Tryphiodorus is severely
                            taken to task by the pedantic Tzetzes on the ground that <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> fell at midwinter; and
                            he clinches the lesson administered to his predecessor by observing that
                            he had learned from Orpheus, “who had it from another man,” never to
                            tell a lie. Such was the state of the Higher Criticism at <name type="place" key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</name> in the twelfth

                            generally agree that Astyanax was killed by being thrown from a tower at
                            or after the sack of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>,
                            they differ as to the agent of his death. Arctinus, as reported by
                            Proclus, says merely that he was killed by Ulysses. Tryphiodorus reports
                            that he was hurled by Ulysses from a high tower. On the other hand,
                            Lesches in the <title>Little Iliad</title> said that it was Neoptolemus
                            who snatched Astyanax from his mother's lap and cast him down from the
                            battlements (Tzetzes and <bibl n="Paus. 10.26.9">Paus. 10.26.9</bibl>).
                            According to Euripides and Seneca, the murder of the child was not
                            perpetrated in hot blood during the sack of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> but was deliberately executed after
                            the capture of the city in pursuance of a decree passed by the Greeks in
                            a regular assembly. This seems to have been the version followed by
                            Apollodorus, who apparently regarded the death of Astyanax as a
                            sacrifice, like the slaughter of Polyxena on the grave of Achilles. But
                            the killing of Astyanax was not thus viewed by our other ancient
                            authorities, unless we except Seneca, who describes how Astyanax leaped
                            voluntarily from the wall while Ulysses was reciting the words of the
                            soothsayer Calchas and invoking the cruel gods to attend the
                            rite.</note> and slaughtered Polyxena on the <pb n="241"/>grave of

                            Euripides and Seneca, the ghost of Achilles appeared above his grave and
                            demanded the sacrifice of the maiden. Others said that the spirit of the
                            dead showed himself in a dream to Neoptolemus (so Quintus Smyrnaeus) or
                            to Agamemnon (so Ovid). In Quintus Smyrnaeus the ghost threatens to keep
                            the Greeks wind-bound at <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name> until they have complied with his demand, and
                            accordingly the offering of the sacrifice is followed by a great calm.
                            Euripides seems to have contemplated the sacrifice, in primitive
                            fashion, as a means of furnishing the ghost with the blood needed to
                            quench his thirst (<bibl n="Eur. Hec. 391">Eur. Hec. 391-393</bibl>;
                                <bibl n="Eur. Hec. 536">Eur. Hec. 536ff.</bibl>); but Seneca
                            represents the ghost as desiring to have Polyxena as his wife in the
                            Elysian Fields (<bibl>Seneca, Troades 938-944</bibl>). A more romantic
                            turn is given to the tradition by Philostratus, who says that after the
                            death of Achilles, and before the fall of <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, the amorous Polyxena stole out from
                            the city and stabbed herself to death on the grave of Achilles, that she
                            might be his bride in the other world. See <bibl>Philostratus, Her.
                                xx.18</bibl>; <bibl>Philostratus, Vit. Apollon. iv.16.4</bibl>.
                            According to the usual tradition, it was Neoptolemus who slew the maiden
                            on his father's tomb. Pictures of the sacrifice were to be seen at <name type="place" key="perseus,Athens">Athens</name> and <name type="place" key="perseus,Pergamon">Pergamus</name> (<bibl n="Paus. 1.22.6">Paus. 1.22.6</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 10.25.10">Paus.

                                980</bibl>. From Strabo we learn that the riddle of Calchas
                            concerning the wild fig-tree was recorded by Hesiod, and that the riddle
                            of Mopsus concerning the sow was recorded by Pherecydes. Our authorities
                            vary somewhat in regard to the latter riddle. According to Pherecydes,
                            the true answer was, “Three little pigs, and one of them a female.”
                            According to Tzetzes, Calchas could not solve the riddle, so Mopsus
                            solved it by saying that the sow would farrow ten little pigs, of which
                            one would be a male. Strabo also tells us that the oracle which doomed
                            Calchas to death whenever he should meet a diviner more skilful than
                            himself, was mentioned by Sophocles in his play <title>The Demand for

                            “Apollodorus and the rest.” According to <bibl n="Serv. A. 2.166">Serv.
                                Verg. A. 2.166</bibl>, it was the soothsayer Helenus who, foreseeing
                            the shipwreck of the Greek leaders, warned Neoptolemus to return home by
                            land; hence in gratitude for this benefit Neoptolemus at his death
                            bequeathed Andromache to Helenus to be his wife (<bibl n="Serv. A. 3.297">Serv. Verg. A. 3.297</bibl>). Neoptolemus was on
                            friendly terms with Helenus, because the seer had revealed to the Greeks
                            the means by which <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>
                            could be taken, and because in particular he had recommended the
                            fetching of Neoptolemus himself from Scyros. See above, <bibl n="Apollod. Epit. E.5.10">Apollod. E.5.10</bibl>. A different
                            tradition is recorded by <bibl>Eustathius on Hom. Od. 3.189, p.
                                1463</bibl>. He says that Neoptolemus sailed across the sea to <name type="place" key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</name> and there burned his
                            ships by the advice of Thetis; after which, being directed by the
                            soothsayer Helenus to settle wherever he should find a house with
                            foundations of iron, walls of wood, and roof of wool, he marched inland
                            till he came to the lake Pambotis in <name type="place" key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</name>, where he fell in with some people
                            camping under blankets supported by spears, of which the blades were
                            stuck into the earth. Compare <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Od.
                            iii.188</bibl>, who adds that, “having laid waste Molossia, he begot
                            Molossus by Andromache, and from Molossus is descended the race of the
                            kings of Molossia, as Eratosthenes relates.” The lake Pambotis is
                            believed to be what is now called the lake of Joannina, near which <name type="place" key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</name> was situated. <bibl n="Paus. 1.11.1">Paus. 1.11.1</bibl> mentions that Pyrrhus

                            this passage of Euripides (<date value="1128">1128</date>) says that
                            Peleus was expelled by Acastus's two sons, Archander and Architeles, and
                            that the exiled king, going to meet his grandson Neoptolemus, was driven
                            by a storm to the island of Cos, where he was entertained by a certain
                            Molon and died. As to an early connexion between <name type="place" key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</name> and Cos, see <bibl>W. R. Paton and
                                E. L. Hicks, <title>The Inscriptions of Cos</title>, pp.
                                344ff.</bibl> A different and much more detailed account of the
                            exile of Peleus is furnished by <bibl>Dictys Cretensis vi.7-9</bibl>.
                            According to it, when Neoptolemus was refitting his shattered ships in
                            Molossia, he heard that Peleus had been deposed and expelled by Acastus.
                            Hastening to the aid of his aged grandfather, he found him hiding in a
                            dark cave on the shore of one of the Sepiades Islands, where he eagerly
                            scanned every passing sail in hopes that one of them would bring his
                            grandson to his rescue. By disguising himself Neoptolemus contrived to
                            attack and kill Acastus's two sons, Menalippus and Plisthenes, when they
                            were out hunting. Afterwards, disguising himself as a Trojan captive, he
                            lured Acastus himself to the cave and would have slain him there, if it
                            had not been for the intercession of Thetis, who had opportunely arrived
                            from the sea to visit her old husband Peleus. Happy at his escape,
                            Acastus resigned the kingdom on the spot to Neoptolemus, and that hero
                            at once took possession of the realm in company with his grandfather,
                            his divine grandmother Thetis, and the companions of his voyage. This
                            romantic narrative may be based on a lost Greek tragedy, perhaps on the
                                <title>Peleus</title> of Sophocles, a play in which the dramatist
                            appears to have dealt with the fortunes of Peleus in his old age. See <bibl>
                                <title>The Fragments of Sophocles</title>, ed. A. C. Pearson, vol.
                                ii. pp. 140ff.</bibl> The statement of Dictys Cretensis that Peleus
                            took refuge in one of the Sepiades Islands suggests that in the
                                <bibl>Scholium on Eur. Tro. 1126-1130</bibl> the name Icos should be
                            read instead of Cos, as has been argued by several scholars (<bibl>A. C.
                                Pearson, op. cit. ii.141</bibl>); for Icos was a small island near
                                <name type="place" key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</name> (<bibl>Stephanus
                                Byzantius, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">*)iko/s</foreign>
                            </bibl>), and would be a much more natural place of refuge for Peleus
                            than the far more distant island of Cos. Moreover, we have the positive
                            affirmation of the poet Antipater of <name type="place" key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</name> that Peleus was buried in Icos
                                (<bibl>Anth. Pal. vii.2.9ff.</bibl>). The connexion of Peleus with
                            the Sepiades Islands is further supported by Euripides; for in his play
                                <title>Andromache</title> (<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 1253">Eur. And.
                                1253-1269</bibl>) he tells how Thetis bids her old husband Peleus
                            tarry in a cave of these islands, till she should come with a band of
                            Nereids to fetch him away, that he might dwell with her as a god for
                            ever in the depths of the sea. In the same play (<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 22">Eur. And. 22ff.</bibl>) Euripides says that Neoptolemus refused to
                            accept the sceptre of Pharsalia in the lifetime of his grandfather
                            Peleus.</note> and died, Neoptolemus <pb n="253"/>succeeded to his

                        <note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">In this passage
                            Apollodorus appears to follow the account given by Euripides in his
                                <title>Andromache</title>, (<bibl n="Eur. Andr. 967">Eur. And.
                                967-981</bibl>). According to that account, Menelaus gave his
                            daughter Hermione in marriage to her cousin Orestes, the son of
                            Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra. But in the Trojan war he afterwards
                            promised the hand of Hermione to Neoptolemus, if Neoptolemus should
                            succeed in capturing <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>.
                            Accordingly on his return from the war Neoptolemus claimed his bride
                            from her husband Orestes, who was then haunted and maddened by the
                            Furies of his murdered mother Clytaemnestra. Orestes protested, but in
                            vain; Neoptolemus insolently reproached him with his crime of matricide
                            and with the unseen avengers of blood by whom he was pursued. So Orestes
                            was obliged to yield up his wife to his rival, but he afterwards took
                            his revenge by murdering Neoptolemus at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>. This version of the legend is
                            followed also by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 123</bibl>. An obvious difficulty
                            is presented by the narrative; for if Menelaus had given his daughter in
                            marriage to Orestes, how could he afterwards have promised her to
                            Neoptolemus in the lifetime of her first husband? This difficulty was
                            met by another version of the story, which alleged that Hermione was
                            betrothed or married to Orestes by her grandfather Tyndareus in the
                            absence of her father Menelaus, who was then away at the Trojan war;
                            that meantime, in ignorance of this disposal of his daughter, Menelaus
                            had promised her hand to Neoptolemus before <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, and that on his return from the war
                            Neoptolemus took her by force from Orestes. See <bibl>Eustathius on Hom.
                                Od. iv.3, p. 1479</bibl>; <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. Od. iv.4</bibl>;

                                Verg. A. 3.330, compare on 297</bibl>. According to the tragic poet
                            Philocles, not only had Hermione been given in marriage by Tyndareus to
                            Orestes, but she was actually with child by Orestes when her father
                            afterwards married her to Neoptolemus. See <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Andr.
                                32</bibl>. This former marriage of Hermione to Orestes, before she
                            became the wife of Neoptolemus, is recognized by <bibl n="Verg. A. 3.330">Verg. A. 3.330</bibl>, and <bibl>Ovid, Heroides,
                                viii. passim</bibl>, but it is unknown to Homer. On the other hand,
                            Homer records that Menelaus betrothed Hermione to Neoptolemus at <name type="place" key="perseus,Troy">Troy</name>, and celebrated the

                            Sophocles wrote a tragedy <title> Hermione </title>, the plot of which

                            consistent in his view that Neoptolemus forcibly deprived Orestes of
                            Hermione and married her himself; for in his play Orestes (<bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1653">Eur. Or. 1653-1657</bibl>) he makes Apollo
                            prophesy to Orestes that he shall wed Hermione, but that Neoptolemus
                            shall never do so.</note>; and for that reason he was slain by Orestes

                        But some say that he went to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> to demand satisfaction from Apollo for the death of his
                        father, and that he rifled the votive offerings and set fire to the temple,
                        and was on that account slain by Machaereus the Phocian.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The murder of Neoptolemus at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>, as Apollodorus

                            paid two visits to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>. On the first occasion he went to claim redress from

                            occasion he went to excuse himself to the god for the rashness and
                            impiety of which he had been guilty in calling the deity to account for
                            the murder; and it was then that Orestes, enraged at having been robbed
                            of his wife Hermione by Neoptolemus, waylaid and murdered his rival in
                            the temple of Apollo, the fatal blow being struck, however, not by
                            Orestes but by “a Delphian man.” See <bibl n="Eur. Andr. 49">Eur. And.

                            death by a man in a brawl concerning the flesh of the victim, and that
                            after death he was supposed to dwell within the sacred precinct and to
                            preside over the processions and sacrifices in honour of heroes. See
                                <bibl n="Pind. N. 7">Pind. N. 7.34(50)-47(70)</bibl>; compare
                                <bibl>Pind. Pa. 6.117ff.</bibl>P The Scholiast on the former of
                            these passages of Pindar, <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. Pa. 42(62)</bibl>,
                            explains the brawl by saying that it was the custom of the Delphians to
                            appropriate (<foreign lang="greek">a(rpa/zein</foreign>) the sacrifices;
                            that Neoptolemus attempted to prevent them from taking possession of his
                            offerings, and that in the squabble the Delphians despatched him with
                            their swords. This explanation seems to be due to Pherecydes, for a
                                <bibl>Scholiast on Eur. Or. 1655</bibl> quotes the following passage
                            from that early historian: “When Neoptolemus married Hermione, daughter
                            of Menelaus, he went to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> to inquire about offspring; for he had no children by
                            Hermione. And when at the oracle he saw the Delphians scrambling for
                                (<foreign lang="greek">diarpa/zontas</foreign>) the flesh, he
                            attempted to take it from them. But their priest Machaereus killed him
                            and buried him under the threshold of the temple.” This seems to have
                            been the version of the story followed by Pausanias, for he mentions the
                            hearth at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> on which
                            the priest of Apollo slew Neoptolemus (<bibl n="Paus. 10.24.4">Paus.
                                10.24.4</bibl>), and elsewhere he says that “the Pythian priestess
                            ordered the Delphians to kill Pyrrhus (Neoptolemus), son of Achilles”
                                (<bibl n="Paus. 1.13.9">Paus. 1.13.9</bibl>; compare <bibl n="Paus. 4.17.4">Paus. 4.17.4</bibl>). That the slayer of
                            Neoptolemus was called Machaereus is mentioned also by a <bibl>Scholiast
                                on Eur. Andr. 53</bibl> and by <bibl n="Strab. 9.3.9">Strab.
                                9.3.9</bibl>, who says that Neoptolemus was killed “because he
                            demanded satisfaction from the god for the murder of his father, or,
                            more probably, because he had made an attack on the sanctuary.” Indeed,
                            Asclepiades, in his work <title>Tragodoumena</title>, wrote as follows:
                            “About his death almost all the poets agree that he was killed by
                            Machaereus and buried at first under the threshold of the temple, but
                            that afterwards Menelaus came and took up his body, and made his grave
                            in the precinct. He says that Machaereus was a son of Daetas.” See
                                <bibl>Scholiast on Pind. N. 7.42(62)</bibl>. The story that
                            Neoptolemus came to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> to plunder the sanctuary, which is noticed by
                            Apollodorus and preferred by Strabo, is mentioned by <bibl n="Paus. 10.7.1">Paus. 10.7.1</bibl> and a <bibl>Scholiast on Pind.
                                N. 7.58, Boeckh</bibl>. It is probably not inconsistent with the
                            story that he went to demand satisfaction from, or to inflict punishment
                            on, the god for the death of his father; for the satisfaction or
                            punishment would naturally take the shape of a distress levied on the
                            goods and chattels of the defaulting deity. The tradition that the slain
                            Neoptolemus was buried under the threshold of Apollo's temple is
                            remarkable and, so far as I remember, unique in Greek legend. The
                            statement that the body was afterwards taken up and buried within the
                            precinct agrees with the observation of <bibl n="Paus. 10.24.6">Paus.
                                10.24.6</bibl> that “quitting the temple and turning to the left you
                            come to an enclosure, inside of which is the grave of Neoptolemus, son
                            of Achilles. The Delphians offer sacrifice to him annually as to a
                            hero.” From <bibl n="Pind. N. 7">Pind. N. 7.44(65)ff.</bibl> we learn
                            that Neoptolemus even enjoyed a preeminence over other heroes at <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name>, being called on to
                            preside over the processions and sacrifices in their honour. The
                            Aenianes of <name type="place" key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</name> used to
                            send a grand procession and costly sacrifices to <name type="place" key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</name> every fourth year in honour of
                            Neoptolemus. The ceremony fell at the same time as the Pythian games.
                            See <bibl>Heliodorus, Aeth. ii.34-iii.6</bibl>. It is a little difficult
                            to understand how a man commonly accused of flagrant impiety and
                            sacrilege should have been raised to such a pitch of glory at the very
                            shrine which he was said to have attacked and robbed. The apparent
                            contradiction might be more intelligible if we could suppose that, as
                            has been suggested, Neoptolemus was publicly sacrificed as a scapegoat,
                            perhaps by being stoned to death, as seems to have been the fate of the
                            human victims at the Thargelia, whose sacrifice was justified by a
                            legend that the first of their number had stolen some sacred cups of
                            Apollo. See <bibl>Harpocration, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">fa/rmakos</foreign>
                            </bibl>; and as to the suggestion that Neoptolemus may have been
                            sacrificed as a scapegoat, see <bibl>J. Toepffer, “Thargelienbrauche,”

                            responded to his endearments by bursting into leaf; hence leaves, which
                            had been called <foreign lang="greek">pe/tala</foreign> before, were

                        he did depart. And Phyllis accompanied him as far as what are called the
                        Nine Roads, and she gave him a casket, telling him that it contained a

                                Lycophron 440-442)</bibl> and <bibl n="Strab. 14.5.16">Strab.

                            time to <name type="place" key="perseus,Argos">Argos</name> (probably
                                <name type="place" key="perseus,Amphilochian Argos">Amphilochian
                                Argos</name>; see above, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.7.7">Apollod.
                                3.7.7</bibl>). So he departed after entrusting the kingdom or
                            priesthood to Mopsus in his absence. Dissatisfied with the state of
                            affairs at <name type="place" key="perseus,Argos">Argos</name>, he
                            returned in a year and reclaimed the kingdom or priesthood from Mopsus.
                            But, acting on the principle <foreign lang="la">Beati
                                possidentes</foreign>, the viceroy refused to cede the crown or the
                            mitre to its proper owner; accordingly they had recourse to the ordeal
                            of battle, in which both combatants perished. Their bodies were buried
                            in graves which could not be seen from each other; for the people built
                            a tower between them, in order that the rivals, who had fought each
                            other in life, might not scowl at each other in death. However, their
                            rivalry did not prevent them working an oracle in partnership after
                            their decease. In the second century of our era the oracle enjoyed the
                            highest reputation for infallibility (<bibl n="Paus. 1.34.3">Paus.
                                1.34.3</bibl>). The leading partner of the firm was apparently
                            Amphilochus, for he is usually mentioned alone in connexion with the
                            oracle; <bibl>Plut. De defectu oraculorum 45</bibl> is the only ancient
                            writer from whom we learn that Mopsus took an active share in the
                            business though Cicero mentions the partners together (<bibl>Cicero, De
                                divinatione i.40.88</bibl>). According to Plutarch and <bibl>Dio
                                Cassius lxxii.7</bibl>, the oracles were communicated in dreams; but
                            Lucian says (<bibl>Philopseudes 38</bibl>) that the inquirer wrote down
                            his question on a tablet, which he handed to the prophet. The charge for
                            one of these infallible communications was only two obols, or about
                            twopence halfpenny. See <bibl>Lucian, Alexander 19</bibl>; <bibl>Lucian,
                                Deorum concilium 12</bibl>. The ancients seem to have been divided
                            in opinion on the important question whether the oracular Amphilochus at
                                <name type="place" key="tgn,7002594">Mallus</name> was the son or
                            the grandson of Amphiaraus. Apollodorus calls him the son of Alcmaeon,
                            which would make him the grandson of Amphiaraus, for Alcmaeon was a son
                            of Amphiaraus. But Tzetzes, in reporting what he describes as the usual
                            version of the story, calls Amphilochus the son, not the grandson of
                            Amphiaraus (<bibl>Scholiast on Lycophron 440-442</bibl>). Compare <bibl n="Strab. 14.1.27">Strab. 14.1.27</bibl>; <bibl>Quintus Smyrnaeus,
                                Posthomerica xiv.365-369</bibl>. Lucian is inconsistent on the
                            point; for while in one passage he calls Amphilochus the son of
                            Amphiaraus (<bibl>Lucian, Alexander 19</bibl>), in another passage he
                            speaks of him sarcastically as the noble son of an accurst matricide, by
                            whom he means Alcmaeon (<bibl>Quintus Smyrnaeus, Deorum concilium
                                12</bibl>). Elsewhere Apollodorus mentions both Amphilochus, the son
                            of Amphiaraus, and Amphilochus, the son of Alcmaeon. See above, <bibl n="Apollod. 3.7.2">Apollod. 3.7.2</bibl> and <bibl n="Apollod. 3.7.7">Apollod. 3.7.7</bibl>.</note>

                            every year is similarly told by Tzetzes, who adds some interesting
                            particulars omitted by Apollodorus. From him we learn that when the
                            maidens arrived, the Trojans met them and tried to catch them. If they
                            caught the maidens, they killed them and burned their bones with the
                            wood of wild trees which bore no fruit. Having done so, they threw the
                            ashes from Mount Traron into the sea. But if the maidens escaped from
                            their pursuers, they ascended secretly to the sanctuary of Athena and
                            became her priestesses, sweeping and sprinkling the sacred precinct; but
                            they might not approach the goddess, nor quit the sanctuary except by
                            night. Tzetzes agrees with Apollodorus in describing the maidens during
                            their term of service as barefoot, with cropped hair, and clad each in a
                            single tunic. He refers to the Sicilian historian Timaeus as his
                            authority for the statement that the custom was observed for a thousand
                            years, and that it came to an end after the Phocian war (<dateRange from="-357" to="-346">357</dateRange>-346 B.C.). See <bibl>Tzetzes,
                                Scholiast on Lycophron 1141</bibl>. The maidens were chosen by lot
                            from the hundred noblest families in <name type="place" key="tgn,7010899">Locris</name> (<bibl>Polybius xii.5</bibl>); and
                            when they escaped death on landing, they served the goddess in the
                            sanctuary for the term of their lives (<bibl>Plut. De sera numinis
                                vindicta 12</bibl>), or, at all events, till their successors
                            arrived (<bibl>Suidas, s.v. <foreign lang="greek">kategh/rasan</foreign>
                            </bibl>). For other references to this very remarkable custom, which
                            appears to be well authenticated, see <bibl n="Strab. 13.1.40">Strab.

                            the priest drew blood with a sword from the throat of a man, and this
                            was regarded as a substitute for the sacrifice of Orestes, of which the
                            goddess had been defrauded by his escape. Such a custom is explained
                            most naturally as a mitigation of an older practice of actually
                            sacrificing human beings to the goddess; and the tradition of such
                            sacrifices at <name type="place" key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</name>
                            would suffice to give rise to the story that the image of the cruel
                            goddess had been brought from the land of ferocious barbarians on the
                            Black Sea. For similar mitigations of an old custom of human sacrifice,

                            many images of Artemis in many places (<bibl>Aelius Lampridius,

                            mention their parentage, but by using the dual in reference to them
                                (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 12.52">Hom. Od. 12.52</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Od. 12.167">Hom. Od. 12.167</bibl>) he indicates that they

                            called the Sirens daughters of Phorcus, and agreed with Homer in
                            recognizing only two of them. See <bibl>Plut. Quaest. Conviv.

                            Terpsichore bore the Sirens to Achelous (<bibl>Ap. Rhod., Argon.
                                iv.895ff.</bibl>). Hyginus names four of them, Teles, Raidne, Molpe,
                            and Thelxiope (<bibl>Hyginus, Fab. praefat. p. 30, ed. Bunte</bibl>),
                            and, in agreement with Apollodorus, says that they were the offspring of
                            Achelous by the Muse Melpomene. Tzetzes calls them Parthenope, Leucosia,
                            and Ligia, but adds that other people named them Pisinoe, Aglaope, and
                            Thelxiepia, and that they were the children of Achelous and Terpsichore.
                            With regard to the parts which they took in the bewitching concert, he
                            agrees with Apollodorus. See <bibl>Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron
                                712</bibl>. According to a <bibl>Scholiast on Ap. Rhod.,
                                Argon.iv.892</bibl>, their names were Thelxiope, or Thelxione,
                            Molpe, and Aglaophonus. As to their names and parents see also

                        played the flute, and by these means they were fain to persuade passing

                                Rhod., Argon. iv.898ff.</bibl>) describes the Sirens as partly
                            virgins and partly birds. Aelian tells us (<bibl>Ael., Nat. Anim.
                                xvii.23</bibl>) that poets and painters represented them as winged
                            maidens with the feet of birds. Ovid says that the Sirens had the feet
                            and feathers of birds, but the faces of virgins; and he asks why these
                            daughters of Achelous, as he calls them, had this hybrid form. Perhaps,
                            he thinks, it was because they had been playing with Persephone when
                            gloomy Dis carried her off, and they had begged the gods to grant them
                            wings, that they might search for their lost playmate over seas as well
                            as land. See <bibl n="Ov. Met. 5.552">Ov. Met. 5.552-562</bibl>. In like
                            manner Hyginus describes the Sirens as women above and fowls below, but
                            he says that their wings and feathers were a punishment inflicted on
                            them by Demeter for not rescuing Persephone from the clutches of Pluto.
                            See <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 125, 141</bibl>. Another story was that they
                            were maidens whom Aphrodite turned into birds because they chose to
                            remain unmarried. See <bibl>Eustathius on Hom. Od. 12.47, p.
                            1709</bibl>. It is said that they once vied with the Muses in singing,
                            and that the Muses, being victorious, plucked off the Siren's feathers
                            and made crowns out of them for themselves (<bibl n="Paus. 9.34.3">Paus.
                                9.34.3</bibl>). In ancient art, as in literature, the Sirens are
                            commonly represented as women above and birds below. See <bibl>Miss J.

                        Sailing by them, Ulysses wished to hear their song, so by Circe's advice he
                        stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should
                        himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger,
                        he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he <pb n="293"/>sailed past. Now it was predicted of the Sirens that they should
                        themselves die when a ship should pass them; so die they did.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">This is not mentioned by

                            said that the Sirens cast themselves into the sea and were drowned from

                            where a wayfarer would mistake for a winnowing-fan the oar which Ulysses
                            was carrying on his shoulder. There Ulysses was to sacrifice a ram, a

                            itself and the sacrifice are not recorded by Homer. In a little island
                            off Cos a Greek skipper told Dr. W. H. D. Rouse a similar story about
                            the journey inland of the prophet Elias. The prophet, according to this
                            account, was a fisherman who, long buffeted by storms, conceived a
                            horror of the sea, and, putting an oar on his shoulder, took to the
                            hills and walked till he met a man who did not know what an oar was.
                            There the prophet planted his oar in the ground, and there he resolved
                            to abide. That is why all the prophet's chapels are on the tops of
                            hills. This legend was published by Dr. Rouse in <title>The Cambridge
                                Review</title> under the heading of “A Greek skipper.” This and the
                            remaining part of Apollodorus are probably drawn from the epic poem
                                <title>Telegony</title>, a work by Eugammon of <name type="place" key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</name>, of which a short abstract by

                                G. Kinkel, pp. 57ff.</bibl> The author of the abstract informs us
                            that after the death and burial of the suitors “Ulysses sacrificed to
                            the nymphs and sailed to <name type="place" key="perseus,Elis">Elis</name> to inspect the herds. And he was entertained by
                            Polyxenus and received a present of a bowl. And after that followed the
                            episodes of Trophonius, and Agamedes, and Augeas. Then he sailed home to
                                <name type="place" key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</name> and offered the
                            sacrifices prescribed by Tiresias. And after these things he went to the
                            Thesprotians and married Callidice, queen of the Thesprotians. Then the
                            Thesprotians made war on the Brygians, under the leadership of Ulysses.
                            There Ares put Ulysses and his people to flight, and Athena engaged him
                            in battle; but Apollo reconciled them. And after Callidice's death,
                            Polypoetes, son of Ulysses, succeeded to the kingdom, and Ulysses
                            himself went to <name type="place" key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</name>.
                            Meanwhile Telegonus, sailing in search of his father, landed in <name type="place" key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</name> and ravaged the island;
                            and marching out to repel him Ulysses was killed by his son in
                            ignorance. Recognizing his error, Telegonus transported his father's
                            body, and Telemachus, and Penelope to his mother, and she made them
                            immortal. And Telegonus married Penelope, and Telemachus married Circe.”
                            The tradition, mentioned also by <bibl>Hyginus, Fab. 127</bibl>, that
                            one son of Ulysses (Telegonus) married his father's widow (Penelope),
                            and that another son (Telemachus) married his father's concubine
                            (Circe), is very remarkable, and may possibly point to an old custom
                            according to which a son inherited his father's wives and concubines,
                            with the exception of his own mother. Compare <bibl n="Apollod. 2.7.7">Apollod. 2.7.7</bibl>, with <bibl>Frazer's note (vol. i. p.

                            The fish (<foreign lang="greek">trugw/n</foreign>), whose spine is said
                            to have barbed the fatal spear, is the common stingray (<foreign lang="la">Trygon pastinaca</foreign>), as I learn from Professor
                            D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, who informs me that the fish is abundant in
                            the Mediterranean and not uncommon on our southern coasts. For ancient
                            descriptions of the fish he refers me to <bibl>Oppian, Halieut.

                            stingray is incurable. Hercules is said to have lost one of his fingers
                            by the bite of a stingray (<bibl>Ptolemy Hephaest., Nov. Hist. ii. in
                                Westermann's Mythographi Graeci, p. 184</bibl>). Classical scholars,
                            following Liddell and Scott, sometimes erroneously identify the fish
                            with the roach. The death of Ulysses through the wound of a stingray is
                            foreshadowed in the prophecy of Tiresias that his death would come from
                            the sea (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.134">Hom. Od. 11.134ff.</bibl>). According
                            to a <bibl>Scholiast on Hom. (Scholia Graeca in Homeri Odysseam, ed. G.
                                Dindorf, vol. i. p. 6)</bibl>, Hyginus, and Dictys Cretensis,
                            Ulysses had been warned by an oracle or a dream to beware of his son,
                            who would kill him; accordingly, fearing to be slain by Telemachus, he
                            banished him to Cephallenia (<bibl>Dictys Cretensis vi.14</bibl>). But
                            he forgot his son Telegonus, whom he had left behind with his mother
                            Circe in her enchanted island. The death of Ulysses at the hands of his
                            son Telegonus was the subject of a tragedy by Sophocles. See <bibl>
