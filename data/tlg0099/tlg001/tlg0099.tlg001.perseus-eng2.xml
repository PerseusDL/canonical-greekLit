<head>NOTICE.</head>

<p>THE present translation of Strabo, the great Geographer

of Antiquity, is the first which has been laid before the

English public. It is curious that a classic of so much

renown and intrinsic value should have remained a

comparatively sealed book to this country for so many

centuries; yet such is the fact. It is true that the imperfect state of the Greek text, and the difficulty of

geographical identification, have always been appalling

obstacles; yet, after the acute and valuable labours of

Gossellin, Du Theil, Groskurd, and especially of Gustav

Cramer of <placeName key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, (whose text is followed in the present volume,) we might fairly have expected that some

English scholar would have ventured to enter the field.

But the task, like many in a similar position, has been

reserved for the publisher of the Classical Library, and

he trusts it will be found conscientiously fulfilled.
</p><p>The translation was, in the first instance, intrusted to

Mr. H. C. Hamilton, whose knowledge of the subject,

and familiarity with the various languages concerned,

peculiarly fitted him for the undertaking. His official



<pb n="vi"/>



duties, however, added to his anxious examination of

every thing which tended to illustrate his author, prevented his proceeding with much speed; and it was

only after the lapse of three years that he had reached

the end of the sixth book. In the mean time it transpired

that Mr. W. Falconer, son of the editor of the <placeName key="tgn,2049755">Oxford</placeName>

edition of the Greek text, had, after several years of

care and attention, produced a very excellent translation, meaning to publish it. Under the circumstances

it was deemed advisable to amalgamate the rival undertakings, and it is a source of gratification to the publisher that the respective translators were each so well

satisfied with the labours of the other, that they assented readily to his proposal of associating their names.
</p><p>This is all it seems necessary to state here. In the

third volume will be given some account of the life and

labours of Strabo, and of the manuscripts and principal

editions; also a complete index of the places mentioned

in the text, accompanied, where possible, by the modern

names.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>

<p>STRABO, the author of this work, was born at <placeName key="tgn,7002337">Amasia</placeName>, or

Amasijas, a town situated in the gorge of the mountains

through which passes the river Iris, now the Ieschil Irmak,

in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, which he has described in the 12th book.<note anchored="yes">Book xii. c. iii. 39. Vol. ii. page 311, 312.</note> He

lived during the reign of Augustus, and the earlier part of the

reign of Tiberius; for in the 13th book<note anchored="yes">Book xiii. c. iv. § 8. Vol. ii. page 405.</note> he relates how <placeName key="tgn,7002615">Sardes</placeName>

and other cities, which had suffered severely from earthquakes,

had been repaired by the provident care of Tiberius the present Emperor; but the exact date of his birth, as also of

his death, are subjects of conjecture only. Coraÿ and Groskurd conclude, though by a somewhat different argument,

that he was born in the year B. C. <date value="-66">66</date>, and the latter that

he died A. D. <date value="24">24</date>. The date of his birth as argued by

Groskurd, proceeds on the assumption that Strabo was in

his thirty-eighth year when he went from Gyaros to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,

at which latter place Octavianus Cæsar was then staying on

his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-31">31</date>. We

may, perhaps, be satisfied with following <placeName key="tgn,2244545">Clinton</placeName>, and place it

not later than B. C. <date value="-54">54</date>.
</p><p>In the 17th book our author speaks of the death of <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>

as a recent occurrence. This event took place A. D. <date value="21">21</date>, or

A. D. <date value="18">18</date> or 19, according to other chronologists; he, therefore,

outlived that king, but for how long a period we have no

means of ascertaining.
</p><p>The only information which we can obtain of the personal

history of Strabo is to be collected from the scanty references

made to himself in the course of this work;<note anchored="yes">Book x. c. iv. § 10, and book xii. c. iii. § 33. Vol. ii. pp. 197, 307, of this Translation</note> for although a

writer of the Augustan age, his name and his works appear



<pb n="vi"/>



to have been generally unknown to his contemporaries, and

to have been passed over in silence by subsequent authors

who occupied themselves with the same branch of study.

The work being written in Greek, and the subject itself not of

a popular kind, would be hindrances to its becoming generally

known; and its voluminous character would prevent many

copies being made; moreover, the author himself, although

for some time a resident at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, appears to have made

<placeName key="tgn,7002337">Amasia</placeName> his usual place of residence, and there to have composed his work. But wherever it was, he had the means of

becoming acquainted with the chief public events that took

place in the Roman Empire.
</p><p>It is remarkable that of his father and his father's family he

is totally silent, but of his mother and her connexions he has left

us some notices. She was of a distinguished family who had

settled at <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and her ancestors had been intimately connected with Mithridates Euergetes and Mithridates Eupator, kings of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>; their fortunes consequently

depended on those princes.
</p><p>Dorylaüs, her great grandfather, was a distinguished officer,

and friend of Euergetes; but the latter being assassinated at

<placeName key="perseus,Sinope">Sinope</placeName>, whilst Dorylaüs was engaged in levying troops in

<placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, he determined to remain there. In that island he obtained the highest honours, having successfully, as general of

the Cnossians, terminated a war between that people and

the Gortynians. He married a Macedonian lady, of the

name of Sterope; the issue of which marriage was Lagetas,

Stratarchas, and a daughter. He died in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. Lagetas had

a daughter, who, says Strabo, was <q direct="unspecified">the mother of my

mother.</q>
</p><p>Mithridates Eupator, who succeeded to the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> on the death of his father, had formed from infancy a close

friendship with another Dorylaüs, son of Philetærus (brother

of the first-mentioned Dorylaüs), and besides conferring on him

distinguished honours, appointed him high priest of Comana

Pontica. The king extended also his protection to his cousins,

Lagetas and Stratarchas, who were recalled from Crete. The

prosperity of the family suddenly terminated by the discovery

of an intrigue carried on by Dorylaüs with the Romans, for

the overthrow of his benefactor. The motives assigned by

Strabo for his disaffection and treachery were the declining



<pb n="vii"/>



prospects of the king, and the execution of his son Theophilus

and a nephew Tibius.
</p><p>Dorylaüs made overtures to Lucullus for the revolt of the

kingdom of Pontus to the Romans, and in return received great

promises of reward, which were never fulfilled. Lucullus ceased

to command in the war, and was succeeded by Pompey, who,

through enmity and jealousy, prevailed on the senate not to

confirm the conditions entered into by his predecessor. As

before observed, there is no mention of Strabo's father in the

works which have come down to us. Malte-Brun, in his Life

of Strabo in the Biographie Universelle, collects several passages tending to show that he was a Roman. The name of

Strabo, or <q direct="unspecified">squinting,</q> originally Greek, was used by the

Romans, and applied to the father of Pompey the Great, among

others. How the geographer acquired this name is not related.
</p><p>When a very young man, he received instruction in grammar and rhetoric from Aristodemus, at Nysa in Caria.<note anchored="yes">Book xiv. c. i. § 48. Vol. iii. p. 26.</note> He

afterwards studied philosophy under Xenarchus of Seleucia,

the Peripatetic philosopher.<note anchored="yes">Book xiv. c. v. § 4. Vol. iii. p. 53.</note> Strabo does not say whether he

heard him at Seleucia in Cilicia, or at Rome, where he afterwards taught.
</p><p>Strabo also attended the lessons of Tyrannio of Amisus,<note anchored="yes">Book xii. c. iii. § 16. Vol. ii. p. 296, 380.</note>

the grammarian. This must have been at Rome; for Tyrannio

was made prisoner by Lucullus, B. C. <date value="-71">71</date>, and carried to Rome.

probably not later than B. C. <date value="-66">66</date>.
</p><p>In book xvi.,<note anchored="yes">c ii. § 24. Vol. iii. p. 173.</note> Strabo states that he studied the philosophy

of Aristotle with Boethus of Sidon, who afterwards became a

Stoic philosopher. Notwithstanding all these advantages,

Strabo was not possessed of all the knowledge of his times,

particularly in astronomy and mathematics, but he was well

acquainted with history and the mythological traditions of his

nation. He was a devout admirer of Homer, and acquainted

with the other great poets.
</p><p>The philosophical sect to which he belonged was the Stoic,

as plainly appears from many passages in his Geography.
</p><p>He wrote a History, which he describes (vol. i. p. 21) as

composed in a lucid style; it is cited by Plutarch, and also by



<pb n="viii"/>



Josephus in his Jewish Antiquities, xiv. 7. It consisted of

forty-three books, which began where the history of Polybius

ended, and was probably continued to the battle of Actium

This valuable History is lost.
</p><p>Strabo was a great traveller, and apparently had no professional or other occupation. We may therefore conclude

that his father left him a good property. Much of his geographical information is the result of personal observation.

In a passage of his 2nd book<note anchored="yes">Book ii. c. v. § 10. Vol. i. p, 176, of this Translation.</note> he thus speaks: <q direct="unspecified">Our descriptions shall consist of what we ourselves have observed in

our travels by land and sea, and of what we conceive to be

credible in the statements and writings of others; for in a westerly direction we have travelled from Armenia to that part of

Tyrrhenia which is over against Sardinia; and southward, from

the Euxine to the frontiers of Ethiopia. Of all the writers on

geography, not one can be mentioned who has travelled over

a wider extent of the countries described than we have. Some

may have gone farther to the west, but then they have never

been so far east as we have; again, others may have been

farther east, but not so far west; and the same with respect

to north and south. However, in the main, both we and they

have availed ourselves of the reports of others, from which to

describe the form, size, and other peculiarities of the country.</q>

He mentions having been in Egypt, the island Gyarus, Populonium near Elba, Comana in Cappadocia, Ephesus, Mylasa,

Nysa, and Hierapolis in Phrygia. He visited Corinth, Argos,

Athens, and Megara; but, on the whole, he does not appear to

have seen more of Greece than in passing through it on his

way to Brundusium, while proceeding to Rome. Populonium

and Luna in Italy were the limit of his travels northwards.

It is probable he obtained his information as to Spain, France,

Britain, and Germany, while staying at Rome.
</p><p>The first systematic writer on geography was Eratosthenes,

who died at the age of 80, about B. C. <date value="-196">196</date>. His work consisted of three books.
</p><p>There is no ground for considering the Geography of Strabo

an improved edition of that of Eratosthenes. Strabo's work

was intended for the information of persons in the higher departments of administration, and contains such geographical

and historical information as those engaged in political em-



<pb n="ix"/>



ployments cannot dispense with. Consistently with this object he avoids giving minute descriptions, except where the

place is of real interest, but supplies some account of the important political events that had occurred in various countries,

and sketches of the great men who had flourished or laboured in them. It is a lively, well-written book, intended to be

read, and forms a striking contrast to the Geography of Ptolemy. His language is simple, appropriate to the matter,

without affectation, and mostly clear and intelligible, except

in those passages where the text has been corrupted. Like

many other Greeks, Strabo looked upon Homer as the depository of all knowledge, but he frequently labours to interpret the poet's meaning in a manner highly uncritical. What

Homer only partially knew or conjectured, Strabo has made

the basis of his description, when he might have given an independent description, founded on the actual knowledge of his

time: these observations apply especially to his books on

Greece. He does not duly appreciate Herodotus; nor does

he discriminate between the stories which Herodotus tells

simply as stories he had heard, and the accounts he relates as

derived from personal observation. He likewise rejects the

evidence of Pytheas of Marseilles as to the northern regions

of Europe, and on more than one occasion calls him a liar,

although it is very certain that Pytheas coasted along the whole

distance from Gadeira, now Cadiz, in Spain, to the river he

calls Tanais, but which was probably the Elbe; however,

from the extracts which have been preserved it seems that

he did not give simply the results of his own observations, but

added reports which he collected respecting distant countries,

without always drawing a distinction between what he saw

himself and what was derived from the report of others.
</p><p>Strabo's authorities are for the most part Greek, and he

seems to have neglected the Latin memoirs and historical

narratives of the campaigns of the Romans, which might have

furnished him with many valuable geographical facts for the

countries as well of Asia as of Europe. He made some use

of Cæsar's description of France, the Alps, and Britain; he

alludes to the voyage of Publius Crassus in speaking of the

Cassiterides, and also the writings of Asinius Pollio, Fabius

Pictor, and an anonymous writer whom he calls the Chorographer; but he might have obtained much additional inform-



<pb n="x"/>



ation if he had taken pains to avail himself of the materials

he could have procured during his stay at Rome.
</p><p>Strabo considered that mathematical and astronomical

knowledge was indispensable to the science of geography; he

says in book i.,<note anchored="yes">Chap. i. § 20</note> that without some such assistance it would

be impossible to be accurately acquainted with the configuration of the earth; and that every one who undertakes to give

an accurate description of a place, should describe its astronomical and geometrical relations, and explain its extent, distance,

latitude, and climate.<note anchored="yes">Chap. i. § 13.</note> As the size of the earth, he says, has

been demonstrated by other writers, we shall take for granted

what they have advanced. We shall also assume that the

earth is spheroidal, and that bodies have a tendency towards

its centre. He likewise says, the convexity of the sea is

a further proof that the earth is spheroidal to those who

have sailed; for they cannot perceive lights at a distance when

placed at the same level as their eyes, but if raised on high,

they at once become perceptible.<note anchored="yes">Chap. i. § 20.</note> He also observes, <q direct="unspecified">our

gnomons are, among other things, evidence of the revolution

of the heavenly bodies, and common sense at once shows us

that if the depth of the earth were infinite, such a revolution

could not take place.</q><note anchored="yes">Ibid.</note> But Strabo did not consider the exact

division of the earth into climates or zones, in the sense in

which Hipparchus used the term, and the statement of the

latitudes and longitudes of places, which in many instances

were pretty well determined in his time, as essential to his

geographical description.
</p><p>With regard to the lost continent of Atlantis, Strabo is

very cautious in criticising<note anchored="yes">Book ii. c. 3, § 6. Vol. i. p. 154.</note> Poseidonius; he observes, <q direct="unspecified">he

did well, too, in citing the opinion of Plato, that the tradition

concerning the island of Atlantis might be received as something more than a mere fiction, it having been related by

Solon, on the authority of the Egyptian priests, that this

island, almost as large as a continent, was formerly in existence, although now it had disappeared,</q> and remarks that

Poseidonius thought it better to quote this than to say, He

who brought it into existence can also cause it to disappear,

as the poet did the wall of the Achivi.
</p><p>The measure adopted by Strabo was the stadium. In book



<pb n="xi"/>



vii. chap. vii. § 4, he says, <q direct="unspecified">From Apollonia to Macedonia is

the Egnatian Way; its direction is towards the east, and the

distance is measured by pillars at every mile, as far as Cypsela and the river Hebrus. The whole distance is 535 miles.

But reckoning, as the generality of persons do, a mile at eight

stadia, there may be 4280 stadia. And, according to Polybius, who adds two plethra, which are a third of a stadium,

to every eight stadia we must add 178 stadia more,—a third

part of the number of miles.</q> In book xi. chap. xi. § 5, he

compares the parasang with the stadium, and states that some

writers reckoned it at 60, others at 40, and others at 30 stadia.
</p><p>Dr. Smith, in his Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, says, <q direct="unspecified">We think that Ukert has satisfactorily shown

an accurate description of a place should be particular to add

its astronomical and geometrical relations, explaining care

fully its extent, distance, degrees of latitude, and temperature

of atmosphere. He says likewise, as the size of the earth has

been demonstrated by other writers, we shall take for granted

that the Greeks had not different standards of length, but

always used the Olympic stadium and the foot corresponding

to it. He states that the stadium was equal to 600 Greek, or

625 Roman feet, or to 125 Roman paces, and the Roman

mile contained 8 stadia. Hence the stadium contained 606

feet 9 inches, English. This standard prevailed throughout

Greece under the name of the Olympic stadium, because it

was the exact length of the stadium or foot-race course at

Olympia, measured between the pillars at the two extremities

of the course.</q> Still Dr. Smith further observes, <q direct="unspecified">But although

the stadium and the foot connected with it were single definite

measures throughout Greece, yet we find in the eastern countries, Babylon, Syria, and Egypt, and in some neighboring

Greek states, feet longer than the Olympic, the origin of which

is to be explained by the coëxistence, in the Babylonian system, of a <emph rend="ital">royal</emph> or <emph rend="ital">sacred</emph> and a <emph rend="ital">common</emph> foot and cubit, which

were so related to one another, that the royal cubit was three

finger-breadths longer than the common.</q>
</p><p>We may conclude that Strabo's stadium varied considerably,

as he sometimes received his distance from personal observation or credible report, and often quoted other writers, and

reduced other standards, as the mile, the parasang, and the



<pb n="xii"/>



schœnus, to the stadium. In addition to this, the most ancient

mode of reckoning distances was by the number of days required to perform the journey, and this was transferred into

stadia by reckoning a certain number of stadia to a day's

journey.<note anchored="yes">Herodotus iv. 85, 86.</note>
</p><p>Siebenkees and Heeren (De Fontibus Geographicorum Strabonis) have examined the authorities to which Strabo had, or

might have had, access, and Groskurd has availed himself

of their researches.
</p><p>The following is a short summary of the seventeen books

from these sources, but for a more detailed account of their

contents the translation itself must be referred to.
</p><p>The first two books may be considered as an independent

treatise, and by themselves form a remarkable contrast with

the rest of the work, in the manner of treating the subjects,

and in the difficulties which they present both of language

and matter.
</p><p>In the 1st book, the author enters into a long discussion

on the merits of Homer, whom he considers to have been

the earliest geographer, and defends him against the errors

and misconceptions of Eratosthenes. He corrects some faults

of Eratosthenes, and, in his inquiry concerning the natural

changes of the earth's surface defends Eratosthenes against

Hipparchus. In conclusion, he again corrects Eratosthenes

as regards the magnitude and divisions of the inhabited world.

The most remarkable passage in this book is that in which

he conjectures the existence of the great Western Continents.<note anchored="yes">Book i. c. iv. § 6. Vol. i. p. 102, of the Translation.</note>
</p><p>The 2nd book is chiefly occupied with some accounts of

mathematical geography, and the Author defends against

Hipparchus the division of the inhabited world adopted by

Eratosthenes into sections. Then follows a criticism of the

division of the earth into six zones, as taught by Poseidonius

and Polybius. The pretended circumnavigation of Africa by

Eudoxus is referred to, as well as some geographical errors of

Polybius. He makes observations of his own on the form and

size of the earth in general, as well as of the inhabited portion

of it, describing the method of representing it on a spherical

or plane surface. A short outline is given of seas, countries,



<pb n="xiii"/>



and nations; and he concludes with remarks on the system of

climates,<note anchored="yes">Book ii. c. i. i § 20. Vol. i. p. 119, of the Translation.</note> and on the shadows projected by the sun.
</p><p>The 3rd book commences with Iberia, and the subject of

Europe is continued to the end of the 10th book. His references

are the Periplus of Artemidorus, Polybius, and Poseidonius;

all three of whom wrote as eye-witnesses. For descriptions and

measurement of distances, Artemidorus is chiefly depended

upon. The information possessed by Eratosthenes of these

countries was meagre and uncertain. For the nations of

southern Iberia, he adopts the account of Asclepiades of Myrlea,

who had lived and been educated there. Some statements also

are borrowed from Roman authors.
</p><p>The 4th book contains Gallia, according to the four divisions then existing, viz. Gallia Narbonensis, Acquitanensis,

Lugdunensis, and the Belgæ; also Britain, with Ierne, and

Thule; and lastly, the Alps.
</p><p>Here Eratosthenes and Ephorus are of little service. His

chief guide is Julius Caesar, whom he frequently quotes <emph rend="ital">verbatim.</emph> Polybius is his guide for the Alps. Pytheas is the

source of some scanty information respecting Ierne and Thule.

Throughout his description he adds accounts obtained at Rome

from travellers.
</p><p>The 5th book commences with a general sketch of Italy,

and refers principally to northern Italy. Dividing its history

into ancient and modern, his chief reference for the former is

Polybius, and for the latter we are indebted to the observations of the author himself, or to accounts received from others.

Still the description of Upper Italy is poor and unsatisfactory,

from the author not sufficiently availing himself of Roman

resources. Then follows some account of Etruria with its

neighbouring islands, Umbria, Samnium, Latium, and Rome,

chiefly the result of the author's own researches and observations. The book concludes with some remarks on the inhabitants of the mountainous districts of Samnium and Campania.
</p><p>The 6th book is a continuation of the same subject. Magna

Græcia, Sicily, and the adjacent islands, are noticed, and the

author concludes with a short discussion on the extent of the

Roman Empire. Descriptions of some places are from his

own observations; but the sources whence he takes his



<pb n="xiv"/>



other account of Italy and the islands are the works of Polybius, Eratosthenes, Artemidorus, Ephorus, Fabius Pictor,

Cæcilius (of Cale Acte in Sicily), and some others, besides an

anonymous chorographer, supposed to be a Roman, from the

circumstance of his distances being given, not in stadia, but

in Roman miles.
</p><p>The 7th book relates, first, to the people north of the Danube,

—the Germans, Cimbri, Getæ, Dacians (particularly the European Scythians), and the Crimea; secondly, to the people

south of the Danube, viz. those inhabiting Illyricum, Pannonia, Dalmatia, the eastern coast of Thrace to the Euxine, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hellespont. The latter part

of this book is not preserved entire in any manuscript, but

Kramer has, in his own opinion, succeeded in restoring from

the epitomes left to us the greater part of what was wanting.

Of Germany, Strabo had tolerable information, but he nowhere states whence it is derived; he may have been partly

indebted to Asinius Pollio, whose work he had already examined for the Rhine. For the remaining northern countries,

he had Poseidonius and the historians of the Mithridatic war.

For the southern countries, he had a lost work of Aristotle on

forms of government, Polybius, Poseidonius, and his chief

disciples, Theopompus and Ephorus. Incidentally also he

quotes Homer and his interpreters, and Philochorus.
</p><p>The three following books are dedicated to the description of

Greece, with the adjacent islands. The 8th comprises the

Peloponnesus and its well-known seven provinces, Elis, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Corinthia with Sicyonia, Achaia, and

Arcadia: the 9th, Attica, with Megaris, Bœotia, Phocis, both

Locri and Thessaly: the 10th, Eubœa, Ætolia, and Acarnania,

with the islands. After a long digression on the subject of

the Curetes, the description of Europe closes with some account of Crete and the islands of the Ægean Sea. The design

and construction of these three books differ considerably from

the preceding. Homer is adopted as the foundation of his

geographical descriptions; some things Strabo must have

learnt as an eye-witness, but more from <emph rend="ital">vivâ voce</emph> communications at Athens or at Corinth. All is interwoven together

without any clear line of separation, and the result is some

confusion. Athens, Corinth, Argos, and their neighbourhood,

were the only parts of Greece our author saw. Heeren, in-

deed, maintains that he had seen the whole of it, and the

Archipelago, but satisfactory proof of this is altogether

wanting.
</p><p>The 11th book commences with the description of the countries separated from Europe by the Tanaïs or Don. Asia is divided by our author (who here follows Eratosthenes) into two

parts by the Taurus, which runs in a direction east and west.

The northern part of Asia (or this side Taurus) is divided into

four parts. The first part comprises the countries lying between the Don, the Sea of Azoff, the Euxine, and the Caspian;

the second, the countries east of the Caspian; and the third,

the countries south of Caucasus. These three parts of the

first or northern division of Asia are contained in the 10th

book; the remaining fourth part occupies the 12th, 13th, and

14th books.
</p><p>The chief authorities for the first part are, besides information obtained from travellers and merchants at Amasia,

Herodotus for the Don; Artemidorus and Eratosthenes for

distances; Poseidonius and Theophanes of Mitylene, historians,

of the Mithridatic war; Metrodorus of Skepsis; Hypsicrates

of Amisus; and Cleitarchus for the digression on the Amazons.
</p><p>For the second part, are principally Patrocles and Aristobulus, historians of the Asiatic campaigns of Alexander.

For the third part, or Media and Armenia, are, Dellius, who

wrote a history of the war against the Parthians, in which he

had served under Antony; Apollonides of Nicæa, who wrote

a Periplus of Europe; and other writers before mentioned.
</p><p>The 12th book commences with a detailed account of Anatolia, and contains the northern part. It was to have been

expected that Strabo would have described most of these

countries as an eye-witness, lying, as they do, so near his native country, Cappadocia. But this expectation vanishes,

when we discover the meagreness of his account. With the

exception of Pontus and Cappadocia, he had seen little of the

rest, and depends upon historians and oral information. For

earlier times, his authorities are Herodotus, Hellanicus, Theopompus, Ephorus, Artemidorus, Apollodorus, and Demetrius

of Skepsis; for later times, historians of the wars of Mithridates and Pompey. For the ancient history of the Mysians

and Phrygians, he is indebted to the celebrated Lydian historian Xanthus, and Menecrates.



<pb n="xvi"/>


</p><p>The 13th book continues the description of Anatolia. The

greater part of the book is occupied with a dissertation on the

Troad. Strabo had travelled over the country himself, but

his great authority is Homer and Demetrius of Skepsis, the

author of a work in twenty-six books, containing an historical

and geographical commentary on that part of the second book

of the Iliad, in which the forces of the Trojans are enumerated.

A learned digression on the Leleges, Cilices, and Pelasgi, who

preceded the Æolians and Ionians in the occupation of the

country, is principally taken from Menecrates and Demetrius

of Skepsis. The description then turns to the interior, and

the account of the Æolian cities is probably due to Poseidonius. Throughout this book are evidences of great care and

desire for accuracy.
</p><p>The 14th book continues with the remainder of Anatolia,

and an account of the islands Samos, Chios, Rhodes, and Cyprus.

The authorities followed are, on the whole, the same as in the

previous book—Herodotus, Thucydides, Ephorus, Artemidorus,

Eratosthenes, and Poseidonius; besides Pherecydes of Syros

who wrote on the Ionian migration, and Anaximenes of Lampsacus, the author of a history in Greek of the Milesian colonies. For Caria, he had the historians of Alexander and an

author named Philip, who wrote on the Leleges and Carians.

For Cyprus he had Damastes and Eratosthenes.
</p><p>The 15th and 16th books contain a description of the second

portion of Asia, namely, the southern or the other side of

Taurus. In the 15th book, Strabo describes India and Persia,

the latter in two chief divisions, viz. Ariana or East Persia,

and Persis or West Persia. These countries Strabo never

saw; his description, therefore, is founded on the authority of

travellers and historians. The topography of India is meagre,

and limited to a few towns and rivers; but his account of the

people of the country is more copious, he being supplied

with materials from the historians of Alexander and of the

campaigns of Seleucus in India. He looks on Megasthenes,

Onesicritus, Deimachus, and Cleitarchus as fabulous writers:

but his confidence rests chiefly on Patrocles, Aristobulus (one of

the companions and historians of Alexander), and Nearchus,

the chief commander of Alexander's fleet. Artemidorus

and Nicolaus of Damascus are occasionally consulted. For

Ariana or East Persia, he had for his principal authority Era-



<pb n="xvii"/>



tosthenes; and for Persia Proper, he had, besides the above

authors, Herodotus, Xenophon, and Polycletus of Larissa, an

historian of Alexander.
</p><p>In the 16th book, he describes the westerly half of south

Asia, viz. Assyria with Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria,

Phoenicia, and Palestine, the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, the

coast of Ethiopia, and lastly, Arabia. For the three first countries (the old Assyrian kingdom), his chief authorities are,

besides some of Alexander's historians, Eratosthenes, Poseidonius, and Herodotus; for the remainder he had, in addition to

the same writers, Artemidorus, and probably also Nicolaus of

Damascus. The account of Moses and the Jews, Heeren surmises, comes from Poseidonius, but it probably proceeds from

oral communication had in Egypt; of these countries our author

could describe nothing as an eye-witness, except the northwest of Syria. The accounts of Arabia, the Indian and the

Red Seas, are from Agatharchides; and much that he describes

of Arabia was obtained from his friends, Ælius Gallus and

the Stoic, Athenodorus.
</p><p>The 17th book concludes the work with the description of

Egypt, Ethiopia, and the north coast of Africa. Strabo had

travelled through the whole of Egypt, as far as Syene and

Philæ, and writes with the decided tone of an eye-witness.

Much verbal information, also, he collected at Alexandria.

His most important written authorities are, for the Nile, Eratosthenes (who borrowed from Aristotle), Eudoxus, and Aristo.

For the most remarkable events of Egyptian history, he had

Polybius, and for later times probably Poseidonius, besides <emph rend="ital">vivâ</emph>

<emph rend="ital">voce</emph> accounts.
</p><p>For the oracle at Ammon, he had the historians of Alexander; for Ethiopia, the accounts of Petronius, who had carried on war there, Agatharchides, and Herodotus. Of Libya

or Africa Proper he had nothing new or authentic to say.

Besides Eratosthenes, Artemidorus, and Poseidonius, his chief

authorities, he had Iphicrates, who wrote on the plants and

animals of Libya. The whole concludes with a short notice

of the Roman Empire.
</p><p>The dates at which particular books were written, as attempted to be given by Groskurd and Coraÿ, must be received with caution.
</p><p>In book iv. c. vi. § 9, Strabo says that the Carni and Tau-



<pb n="xviii"/>



risci had quietly paid tribute for thirty-three years; and both

these tribes were reduced to subjection by Tiberius and Drusus, B. C. <date value="-14">14</date>. This book was therefore written in A. D. <date value="19">19</date>.
</p><p>In book vi. c. iv. § 2, Cæsar Germanicus is spoken of as

still living. He died in Syria, A. D. <date value="20">20</date> (19). This book was

therefore written before that year.
</p><p>In book xii. c. viii. § 11, Strabo says that Cyzicus was

still a free state. It lost its liberty A. D. <date value="25">25</date>. This book was

therefore written before A. D. <date value="25">25</date>. Whether Strabo was alive

or dead at this date, we have no means of determining.
</p><p>The codices or manuscripts which exist of Strabo's work

appear to be copies of a single manuscript existing in the

middle ages, but now lost. From the striking agreement of

errors and omissions in all now extant (with such differences

only as can be accounted for, arising from the want of ability

or carelessness of the copyist), it appears most probable that

to this single manuscript we are indebted for the preservation

of the work. Strabo himself describes the carelessness of

bad scribes both at Rome and Alexandria,<note anchored="yes">Book xiii. c. i. § 54, vol. ii. p. 380.</note> in the following

expressive language: <q direct="unspecified">Some vendors of books, also, employed

bad scribes and neglected to compare the copies with the

originals. This happens in the case of other books, which

are copied for sale both here and at Alexandria.</q> After what

Kramer has done for the text, we can hope for little improvement, unless, what is beyond all expectation, some other

manuscript should be discovered which is either derived from

another source, or is a more correct copy.
</p><p>The following is some account of those in existence:—
</p><p>Codices in the Imperial Library, Paris:
</p><p>No. <date value="1397">1397</date> of the catalogue. This is the principal codex

existing in the Imperial Library, and was written in the 12th

century. It was formerly in the Strozzi Palace at Rome, and

was brought to Paris by Maria de Medici. Not only are parts

of the leaves, but even whole leaves of the 9th book, damaged or destroyed by damp, mice, bad binding, and careless

attempts at correction. This codex contains the first nine

books; the second part, containing the last eight, is lost. Collated by Kramer, and partly for Falconer, by Villebrune.
</p><p>No. <date value="1393">1393</date> of the catalogue. On this codex Brequigny

chiefly depended for his edition. Montfaucon says that it is



<pb n="xix"/>



of the 12th or 13th century; Kramer, however, judging from

the character of the handwriting and contractions, maintains

that it belongs to the end of the 13th or beginning of the

14th century. It contains the whole seventeen books of the

Geography, and was written in the East (not, however, by the

same hand throughout), and brought from Constantinople to

Paris by the Abbé Servin in <date value="1732">1732</date>, to whom it had been presented by a Greek named Maurocordato. Collated by Villebrune for Falconer, and partly by Kramer.
</p><p>No. <date value="1408">1408</date> contains the seventeen books, and appears to

have been written towards the end of the 15th century. In

general, the geography of Strabo is divided by transcribers into

two parts, the first containing nine books, the second, the last

eight; but in this codex there is a blank leaf inserted between

the 10th and 11th books, from which it would appear that

there was also another division of the work, separating the

subjects, Europe and Asia. Partly collated by Villebrune for

Falconer.
</p><p>No. <date value="1394">1394</date>. This contains the seventeen books, and is

very beautifully written, and illuminated with arabesque designs. It was made by the order of Lorenzo the Magnificent;

and its date, therefore, is after the middle of the 15th century.

Collated, as before, by Villebrune.
</p><p>No. <date value="1396">1396</date> contains the whole seventeen books, and was

probably written about the end of the 15th or the beginning of

the 16th century. The division of the work is into ten books

and seven books. In the beginning, it is stated to be <q direct="unspecified">the gift

of Antony the Eparch to Francis the great and illustrious

</p><p>No. <date value="1395">1395</date> contains the whole seventeen books, and served

for the Aldine edition of Strabo. The handwriting of this

whole lines: it is corrupt beyond description, and among the

worst we possess. Collated in some parts by Kramer.
</p><p>No. <date value="1398">1398</date>, written about the end of the 15th century. It

contains the epitome of the first ten books, by Gemistus Pletho,

and the last seven books entire. It is a copy of No. 397, in the

ning, probably, of the 14th century, and is remarkable for being

the work of thirteen different transcribers. It is much to be lamented, that the greater part of it is lost; it begins from

the end of the 12th book only, and a part of the last leaf of

the 17th book is also destroyed; what remains to us surpasses

all others in correctness of the text. The whole has been collated for the first time by Kramer.
</p><p>No. 174 is of the 15th century, and contains the seventeen

books: the first nine books are written by one transcriber, the

list eight by another hand. The first nine books have been

collated by Kramer.
</p><p>No. 173 contains the first ten books, and is of the middle of

the 15th century. It is badly and incorrectly written. The

last seven books, which would complete the codex, are, as

Kramer conjectures from the paper and handwriting, in the

Library of the Grand Duchy of Parma. From a note in Greek

at the end of the 10th book, it appears to have been brought

to Rome A. D. <date value="1466">1466</date>. Books 1, 2, 4, and 5, collated by

Kramer.
</p><p>No. 81 is tolerably well and correctly written. It contains

the last eight books, and is of the end of the 15th century. It

appears to be a copy of, or served as a copy to, the codex in

the Laurentian Library, No. 19. Partially collated by Kramer.
</p><p>Medicean Codices, in the Laurentian Library, Florence:
</p><p>Codex 5 is elegantly and correctly written; it is of the beginning, probably, of the 15th century, and contains the first

ten books. The 8th and 9th books are not entire; passages

are curtailed, and much is omitted, to which the attention is

not drawn, the lines being run on without spaces left to mark

omissions. Errors of the first transcriber are corrected by a

later hand, and noticed in the margin or between the lines.

Collated by Bandini for Falconer, and almost the whole by

Kramer.

the former. It was written after the middle of the 15th

</p><p>Venetian Codices:
</p><p>No. 377 of the catalogue contains the first twelve books,

and is written in the 15th century. Formerly the property

of Cardinal Bessarion.
</p><p>No. 378 contains the seventeen books, of which the first

twelve are apparently copies of the above, No. 377; the remaining five are transcribed from some other codex. This was, also,

formerly the property of Cardinal Bessarion.
</p><p>No. 640 contains the last eight books. It was written, as

appears from a note A. D. <date value="1321">1321</date>, by different hands. A great

part of the 14th book is wanting; eight blank pages are left

for the completion of it; but this was not done by the transcriber to whom this portion was assigned. It is placed by

Kramer in the first class of manuscripts, and was wholly collated by him.
</p><p>No. 379 is of the 15th century. It contains the Epitome of

Gemistus Pletho of the first ten books, and the whole of the

last seven books. It is the codex which served for the copy,

No. <date value="1398">1398</date>, in the Imperial Library at Paris. Formerly the

property of Cardinal Bessarion.
</p><p>No. 606 contains the last eight books, and was written towards the end of the 15th century. It contains nothing which

size, nor in consecutive order, although by the same hand.

Book ii. is to be found in Codex N. 289, together with

portions of other authors, written by a different transcriber,

no doubt with the intention of completing this codex. According to Kramer, the first ten books are copied from Codex

5 of the Medici MS. The 13th, 14th, 12th books (the order

in which they stand) from the Medici MS. 19, and the

11th, 15th, 16th, 17th, from the Medici MS. 15. Partly

collated by Kramer.
</p><p>Codex G. 53 contains the seventeen books, and is of the

end of the 15th century. Five leaves at the beginning, and

two at the end, are destroyed by damp, traces of which are to

be seen throughout. Partly collated by Kramer.
</p><p>In the Library of Eton College is a codex containing the

first ten books; it was written at Constantinople. Kramer,



<pb n="xxii"/>



who, however, did not see it, conjectures that the Medici

MS., Codex 15, containing the last eight books, was formerly

united to it, and completed the whole work. Collated for

Falconer.
</p><p>In the Library of the Escurial is a codex completed, as we

are informed by a note at the end, A. D. <date value="1423">1423</date>. Collated by

Bayer for Falconer.
</p><p>The Madrid Library possesses a codex written in the latter part of the 15th century, containing the seventeen books.
</p><p>In the Library at Moscow is a codex containing the seventeen

books; it was written at the end of the 15th or beginning

of the 16th century. The first nine books resemble the Paris

Codex, No. <date value="1397">1397</date>; the last eight, the Venetian Codex, No. 640.

It came from one of the monasteries of Mount Athos, and

was not destroyed, as Groskurd suspects, in the great fire of

<date value="1812">1812</date>, but is still to be found in the Library of the Holy Synod, under No. 204 (Matt. ccv.), as I am informed by the

Archimandrite Sabba, who dates from the Kremlin, April

4th, <date value="1857-04-04">1857</date>.
</p><p>A codex also is yet to be found in one of the monasteries

of Mount Athos. From the accounts of learned travellers

(Zacharias, <emph rend="ital">Reise in den Orient,</emph> and Fallmerayer, in the <emph rend="ital">Allgem.</emph>

<emph rend="ital">Zeitg.</emph> 5 <emph rend="ital">Jun.</emph> <date value="1843-00">1843</date>), it contains nothing which can supply

the deficiencies of those MSS. with which we are acquainted.
</p><p>Besides the above codices, there exist four epitomes of the

Geography of Strabo, of which,
</p><p>The Epitome Palatina, in the Heidelberg Library, is the

oldest of all MSS. of this work. It is probably of the beginning of the 10th century, although Dodwell places it between

976 and 996. The codex from which it was copied appears

to have been perfect, and contained the whole of the 7th book,

which is imperfect in all other codices. It is, however, to be

regretted that the author did not confine himself to following

the text of Strabo; he has not only indulged in curtailing,

transposing, and changing the words and sentences of the

original, but has sometimes also added expressions of his own.
</p><p>The Vatican Epitome is of more value than the preceding; the extracts are more copious, the author seldom

wanders from the text of Strabo, and in no instance inserts

language of his own. The codex which served as the basis

for the Epitome contained the 7th book entire, and from this



<pb n="xxiii"/>



and the Palatine Epitome Kramer collected the fragments of

the last part of the 7th book, which appear for the first time

in his edition (see vol. i. of the Translation, p. 504). This

codex was written in the middle of the 14th century, and has

suffered much by time and carelessness; several leaves are

lost, and lines of the text at the top and bottom of the pages

have been cut off in the binding.
</p><p>The Parisian Epitome, on which no great value is placed

by Kramer.
</p><p>The Epitome of Gemistus Pletho, referred to above, is

of great value, and held in the highest estimation by all

editors.
</p><p>The first appearance of Strabo's work in print was a Latin

translation by Guarini, of Verona, and Gregorio of Tiferno.

Of this, thirteen editions were printed, the first in <date value="1469">1469</date> or

<date value="1471">1471</date>, the twelfth in <date value="1559">1559</date>, and the last in <date value="1652">1652</date>. It is not

known from what manuscripts the translation was taken, nor

whether they now exist; but, though the translation itself

is barbarous, and in many passages erroneous, its fidelity to

the original is so apparent, that all editors to the present time

have consulted it as a manuscript.
</p><p>The first edition of the Greek text was printed at Venice

by Aldus in <date value="1516">1516</date>, and was taken from so corrupt a manuscript

that Coraÿ compares it to the Augean stable. The second

edition was a repetition of the Aldine, accompanied by the

Latin translation of Guarini, and was published by Hopper

and Heresbach, at Bâsle, in <date value="1549">1549</date>. The third edition, by Xylander, in <date value="1570">1570</date>, was also a repetition of the text of Aldus; but

a new Latin translation accompanied it. The fourth and fifth

editions, which do not essentially differ, were published in

<date value="1587">1587</date> and <date value="1620">1620</date>, by Isaac Casaubon. He collated for his

edition four manuscripts, which he obtained from his father-in-law, H. Stephens, and was the first to add a commentary;

but it is not known what manuscripts were made use of. The

edition of Almeloveen, <date value="1707">1707</date>, being a reprint of Casaubon,

with notes, and an edition commenced by Brequigny, Paris,

<date value="1763">1763</date>, but not continued beyond the first three books, can

scarcely be placed among the number of new editions. Brequigny left a French translation in manuscript and notes in

Latin, which were consulted by the French translators.
</p><p>The seventh edition was that of Thomas Falconer of Ches-



<pb n="xxiv"/>



ter, and of Brasennose College, published in 2 vols. folio, at

Oxford, <date value="1807">1807</date>. For the first time since Casaubon's last

edition, nearly 200 years before, manuscripts were collated

for this edition, namely, those of Eton, Moscow, the Escurial,

and the Laurentian library; the conjectural emendations

of Tyrwhitt, and notes of the editor and others, are added.

<q direct="unspecified">It has everything that is valuable in Casaubon's edition,

besides having corrected numberless typographical errors.

in <date value="1792">1792</date>. A little more than the two first books were edited

by John Parsons, Bishop of Peterborough, and formerly

the former), of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who completed it and wrote the preface. A complete revisal of the

text, however, was not attempted.
</p><p>The eighth edition was that of Professor J. P. Siebenkees,

of which great expectations were formed. The deficiencies of

his performance are strongly commented on by Kramer. Siebenkees lived to complete only the first six books; the remainder of the work was undertaken by Tzchucke, and conducted with greater skill and ability than by his predecessor.

It was published in <date value="1811">1811</date>, 6 vols. 8vo.
</p><p>The ninth edition is that by Coraÿ, Paris, <date value="1815">1815</date>–<date value="1818">1818</date>, 4 vols.

8vo. Kramer passes an unfavourable opinion on it. The editor,

according to him, did not possess an aptitude for discriminating the value of the different manuscripts he collated, and

considered more what he thought ought to have been written

than what were really the author's words. Hence, although

he was successful in restoring the true readings of many passages, he corrupted not a few, and left untouched many errors.

Yet he was a very able scholar, and has the merit of attempting the first critical edition of Strabo.
</p><p>The tenth edition is that by Professor Gustavus Kramer,

in 3 vols. 8vo, the first of which appeared in <date value="1844">1844</date>, the last in

unwearied labour; of the many years spent in the preparation

of it, three were passed in Italy for the purpose of collating

manuscripts. This edition surpasses all others in completeness, and little is left for correction by subsequent editors.

</p><p>In modern languages, we have a translation by Alfonso

It is a very literal translation from a manuscript, and is frequently quoted by the French translators. Also a translation

books are translated by De la Porte du Theil and Coraÿ together. The 4th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th books are

by Coraÿ; the 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 11th, by De la Porte

du Theil; on the death of the latter, Letronne undertook the

translation of the 16th and 17th books. The whole is accompanied by very copious notes by the translators, and others

on geographical and mathematical subjects, by Gossellin. As

might be expected from the united labour of such distinguished men, this translation, which was undertaken at the command of Napoleon I., has been held in high estimation. De

la Porte du Theil, for the purpose of conveying to the reader

a more accurate idea of the state of the text of the ninth book

than could be given by description or notes, has prefaced his

translation by a copy, page for page and line for line, of the

original manuscript. The number of mutilated passages

amounts to two thousand. For the purpose of restoring the

text, recourse has been had to other manuscripts, to conjectures, to extracts from the Epitomes, and to quotations of

Strabo's work contained in the Geographical Lexicon of Stephanus of Byzantium, composed before the seventh century,



<pb n="xxvi"/>



and in the Commentaries of Eustathius on Homer, which were

written towards the end of the twelfth century. It is an example of Kramer's just remark, that no work of any ancient

author, which has descended to our time, has suffered more

from various causes.

at Madrid, <date value="1788">1788</date>, and is well spoken of. The best translation

of the whole work—and too much cannot be said in praise of it

—is in German, by Groskurd, 4 vols. 8vo, Berlin, <date value="1831">1831</date>–<date value="1834">1834</date>. The last volume contains a very copious index.
</p><p>In conclusion, I have to acknowledge considerable obligations to the notes and prefaces of Groskurd, Kramer, the

</p><p>The part of the translation for which I am responsible

commences at chap. iv. book vii., vol. i. p. 473, to the end of

the work, and is partly based on an incomplete translation in

MS. by my late father, the Rev. Dr. T. Falconer. The previous portion is the work of Hans C. Hamilton, Esq., F. S. A.,

to whom I am indebted for his continued interest in the

translation throughout, for his care in correcting the press,

and for valuable suggestions.
</p><p>A complete index, which concludes the third volume, has

been compiled with the greatest regard to accuracy, by a

gentleman of tried skill and ability. It contains every geographical name mentioned by Strabo; and the modern names,

printed in italics, are also added, as far as can be ascertained:

they are not given with perfect confidence in all cases; discussion on doubtful points would have exceeded the limits of

this work; and reference may be advantageously made, where

more minute detail is required, to the able articles in Dr. W.

Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography.

<argument>
<p>SUMMARY.</p>

<p>That geographical investigation is not inconsistent with philosophy.—That

Homer gives proof of it throughout his poems.—That they who first wrote

on the science have omitted much, or given disjointed, defective, false, or

inconsistent accounts.—Proofs and demonstrations of the correctness of

this statement, with general heads containing a summary description of the

disposition of the whole habitable earth.—Credit to be attached to the

probabilities and evident proofs that in many regions the land and sea have

been shifted, and exchanged places with each other.</p></argument>

<p><note anchored="yes">The chapters and sectional divisions of Kramer's edition of the Greek

text have been generally followed in this translation.</note> IF the scientific investigation of any subject be the proper

avocation of the philosopher, Geography, the science of which

we propose to treat, is certainly entitled to a high place; and

this is evident from many considerations. They who first

ventured to handle the matter were distinguished men.

Homer, Anaximander the Milesian, and Hecatæus, (his fellow-citizen according to Eratosthenes,) Democritus, Eudoxus,

Dicæarchus, Ephorus, with many others, and after these

Erastosthenes, Polybius, and Posidonius, all of them philosophers.

constitute what is called philosophy. In addition to its vast

with the occupants of the land and ocean, and the vegetation,

fruits, and peculiarities of the various quarters of the earth,

a knowledge of which marks him who cultivates it as a man

earnest in the great problem of life and happiness.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Admitting this, let us examine more in detail the points

we have advanced.
</p><p>And first, [we maintain,] that both we and our predecessors,

amongst whom is Hipparchus, do justly regard Homer as the

founder of geographical science, for he not only excelled all,

ancient as well as modern, in the sublimity of his poetry, but

also in his experience of social life. Thus it was that he not

only exerted himself to become familiar with as many historic facts as possible, and transmit them to posterity, but also

with the various regions of the inhabited land and sea, some

intimately, others in a more general manner. For otherwise

he would not have reached the utmost limits of the earth, traversing it in his imagination.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>First, he stated that the earth was entirely encompassed

by the ocean, as in truth it is; afterwards he described the

countries, specifying some by name, others more generally by

various indications, explicitly defining Libya,<note anchored="yes">Africa.</note> Ethiopia, the Sidonians, and the Erembi (by which latter are probably intended the Troglodyte Arabians); and alluding to those farther east and west as the lands washed by the ocean, for in ocean he believed both the sun and constellations to rise and

set.

Zephyr breathe, there the poet feigned the fields of Elysium,

<p>The Isles of the Blest<note anchored="yes">The Isles of the Blest are the same as the Fortunate Isles of other

geographers. It is clear from Strabo's description that he alludes to the

Canary Islands; but as it is certain that Homer had never heard of these,

it is probable that the passages adduced by Strabo have reference to the

Elysian Fields of Baïa in Campania.</note> are on the extreme west of

Maurusia,<note anchored="yes">The Maurusia of the Greeks (the Mauritania of the Latins) is now

known as Algiers and Fez in Africa.</note> near where its shore runs parallel to the opposite

Blest, from their contiguity to the Islands.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He tells us also, that the Ethiopians are far removed, and

bounded by the ocean: far removed,—

Nor was he mistaken in calling them separated into two

divisions, as we shall presently show: and next to the ocean,—

occupied the sea-coast of the Atlantic, and the shores of the Arabian Gulf.

It is with this view of the name that Strabo explains the passage of

Homer; but the Mediterranean was the boundary of the poet's geographical knowledge; and the people he speaks of were doubtless the inhabitants

of the southern parts of Phoenicia, who at one time were called Ethiopians. We may here remark too, that Homer's ocean frequently means

the Mediterranean, sometimes probably the Nile. See also p. 48, <emph rend="ital">n.</emph> 2.</note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad i. 423</bibl></cit>


Speaking of the Bear, he implies that the most northern part

of the earth is bounded by the ocean:

Now, by the <q direct="unspecified">Bear</q> and the <q direct="unspecified">Wain,</q> he means the Arctic

Circle; otherwise he would never have said, <q direct="unspecified">It <emph rend="ital">alone</emph> is deprived of the baths of the ocean,</q> when such an <emph rend="ital">infinity</emph> of

stars is to be seen continually revolving in that part of the

hemisphere. Let no one any longer blame his ignorance for

being merely acquainted with one Bear, when there are two.

It is probable that the second was not considered a constellation until, on the Phœnicians specially designating it, and employing it in navigation, it became known as one to the Greeks.<note anchored="yes">We are informed by Diogenes Laertius, that Thales was the first to

make known to the Greeks the constellation of the Lesser Bear. Now

this philosopher flourished 600 years before the Christian era, and consequently some centuries after Homer's death. The name of <foreign lang="greek">Foini/kh</foreign> which

it received from the Greeks, is proof that Thales owed his knowledge of it to

the Phœnicians. Conf. Humboldt's Cosmos, vol. iii. p. 160, Bohn's edition.</note>

Such is the case with the Hair of Berenice, and Canopus,

whose names are but of yesterday; and, as Aratus remarks,

there are numbers which have not yet received any designation. Crates, therefore, is mistaken when, endeavouring to

amend what is correct, he reads the verse thus:



<quote><lg>
<l><foreign lang="greek">Oi(=os d' a)/mmoro/s e)sti loetrw=n,</foreign></l></lg></quote>


replacing <foreign lang="greek">oi)/h</foreign> by <foreign lang="greek">oi)=s,</foreign> with a view to make the adjective agree



<pb n="5"/>



with the Arctic Circle, which is masculine; instead of the

Arctic Constellation, which is feminine. The expression of

Heraclitus is far more preferable and Homeric, who thus figuratively describes the Arctic Circle as the Bear,—<q direct="unspecified">The Bear

is the limit of the dawn and of the evening, and from the re-

gion of the Bear we have fine weather.</q> Now it is not the

constellation of the Bear, but the Arctic Circle, which is the

limit of the rising and the setting stars.
</p><p>By the Bear, then, which he elsewhere calls the Wain,

and describes as pursuing Orion, Homer means us to under-

stand the Arctic Circle; and by the ocean, that horizon into

which, and out of which, the stars rise and set. When he

says that the Bear turns round and is deprived of the ocean,

he was aware that the Arctic Circle [always] extended to the

sign opposite the most northern point of the horizon. Adapting the words of the poet to this view, by that part of the

earth nearest to the ocean we must understand the horizon, and

by the Arctic Circle that which extends to the signs which

seem to our senses to touch in succession the most northern

point of the horizon. Thus, according to him, this portion of

the earth is washed by the ocean. With the nations of the

North he was well acquainted, although he does not mention

them by name, and indeed at the present day there is no regular title by which they are all distinguished. He informs

us of their mode of life, describing them as <q direct="unspecified">wanderers,</q>

<q direct="unspecified">noble milkers of mares,</q> <q direct="unspecified">living on cheese,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">without

wealth.</q><note anchored="yes">Iliad xiii. 5. Gosselin says, Thrace (the present Roumelia) was in-

disputably the most northern nation known to Homer. He names the people

<foreign lang="greek">Ipphmo/lgoi,</foreign> or living on mares' milk, because in his time they were a

pomade race. Strabo evidently gives a forced meaning to the words of

the poet, when he attempts to prove his acquaintance with the Scythians

and Sarmatians.</note>

<p>In the following speech of Juno, he states that the ocean

surrounds the earth.

</p><p>Does he not here assert that ocean bounds all its extremities,

and does it not surround these extremities? Again, in the



<pb n="6"/>



Hoplopœia,<note anchored="yes">The eighteenth book of the Iliad.</note> he places the ocean in a circle round the border

of Achilles' shield. Another proof of the extent of his knowledge, is his acquaintance with the ebb and flow of the sea,

calling it <q direct="unspecified">the ebbing ocean.</q><note anchored="yes">Iliad xviii. 399; Odyss. xx. 65.</note> Again,



<cit><quote><lg>
<l>Each day she thrice disgorges, and again
</l><l>Thrice drinks, insatiate, the deluge down.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>Thrice indeed each day it lets loose its waves, and thrice it ebbs

them back.</quote><bibl>Odyss. xii. 105.</bibl></cit>
<p>Gosselin remarks, <q direct="unspecified">I do not find any thing in these different passages of

Homer to warrant the conclusion that he was aware of the ebb and flow

of the tide; every one knows that the movement is hardly perceptible in

the Mediterranean. In the Euripus, which divides the Isle of Negropont

from Bœotia, the waters are observed to flow in opposite directions several times a day. It was from this that Homer probably drew his ideas;

and the regular current of the Hellespont, which carries the waters of the

Black Sea into the Mediterranean, led him to think that the whole ocean,

or Mediterranean, had one continued flow like the current of a river.</q></p></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyss. xii. 105.</bibl></cit>


The assertion of thrice, instead of twice, is either an error of

the author, or a blunder of the scribe, but the phenomenon is

the same, and the expression soft-flowing,<note anchored="yes">Iliad vii. 422.</note> has reference to

the flood-tide, which has a gentle swell, and does not flow with

a full rush. Posidonius believes that where Homer describes

the rocks as at one time covered with the waves, and at another left bare, and when he compares the ocean to a river, he

alludes to the flow of the ocean. The first supposition is correct, but for the second there is no ground; inasmuch as there

can be no comparison between the flow, much less the ebb of

the sea, and the current of a river. There is more probability

in the explanation of Crates, that Homer describes the whole

ocean as deep-flowing, ebbing, and also calls it a river, and

that he also describes a part of the ocean as a river, and the

flow of a river; and that he is speaking of a part, and not the

whole, when he thus writes:—



<cit><quote><lg>
<l>When down the smooth Oceanus impell'd
</l><l>By prosperous gales, my galley, once again,
</l><l>Cleaving the billows of the spacious deep,
</l><l>Had reach'd the Ææan isle.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But when the ship left the stream of the river-ocean, and entered

on the wave of the wide-wayed sea. </quote><bibl>Odyssey xii. l.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey xii. l.</bibl></cit>



He does not, however, mean the whole, but the flow of the river

in the ocean, which forms but a part of the ocean. Crates



<pb n="7"/>



says, he speaks of an estuary or gulf, extending from the

winter tropic towards the south pole.<note anchored="yes">This direction would indicate a gulf, the seaward side of which

should be opposite the Libo-notus of the ancients. Now the mutilated

passage of Crates has reference to the opening of the twelfth book of the

Odyssey, descriptive of Ulysses' departure from Cimmeria, after his visit

to the infernal regions. Those Cimmerians were the people who inhabited Campania, and the land round Baïa, near to lake Avernus, and the

entrance into Hades. As these places are situated close to the bay of

Naples, which occupies the exact position described by Crates, it is probable this was the bay he intended.</note> Now any one quitting

this, might still be in the ocean; but for a person to leave

the whole and still to be in the whole, is an impossibility.

But Homer says, that leaving the flow of the river, the

ship entered on the waves of the sea, which is the same as the

ocean. If you take it otherwise you make him say, that departing from the ocean he came to the ocean. But this requires further discussion.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Perception and experience alike inform us, that the earth

we inhabit is an island: since wherever men have approached

the termination of the land, the sea, which we designate ocean,

has been met with: and reason assures us of the similarity of

those places which our senses have not been permitted to survey. For in the east<note anchored="yes">What Strabo calls the eastern side of the continent, comprises that

portion of India between Cape Comorin and Tana-serim, to the west of

the kingdom of Siam: further than which he was not acquainted.</note> the land occupied by the Indians, and

in the west by the Iberians and Maurusians,<note anchored="yes">Strabo's acquaintance with Western Africa did not go further than

Cape Nun, 214 leagues distant from the Strait of Gibraltar.</note> is wholly encompassed [by water], and so is the greater part on the south<note anchored="yes">By the south is intended the whole land from the Arabian Gulf or

Red Sea to Cape Comorin.</note>

and north.<note anchored="yes">From Cape Finisterre to the mouth of the Elbe.</note> And as to what remains as yet unexplored by

us, because navigators, sailing from opposite points, have not

hitherto fallen in with each other, it is not much, as any one

may see who will compare the distances between those places

with which we are already acquainted. Nor is it likely that

the Atlantic Ocean is divided into two seas by narrow

isthmuses so placed as to prevent circumnavigation: how

much more probable that it is confluent and uninterrupted!

Those who have returned from an attempt to circumnavigate



<pb n="8"/>



the earth, do not say they have been prevented from con-

tinuing their voyage by any opposing continent, for the sea remained perfectly open, but through want of resolution, and

the scarcity of provision. This theory too accords better with

the ebb and flow of the ocean, for the phenomenon, both in the

increase and diminution, is every where identical, or at all

events has but little difference, as if produced by the agitation of one sea, and resulting from one cause.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We must not credit Hipparchus, who combats this opinion,

denying that the ocean is every where similarly affected; or that

even if it were, it would not follow that the Atlantic flowed in

a circle, and thus continually returned into itself. Seleucus,

the Babylonian, is his authority for this assertion. For a further

investigation of the ocean and its tides we refer to Posidonius

and Athenodorus, who have fully discussed this subject: we

will now only remark that this view agrees better with the uniformity of the phenomenon; and that the greater the amount

of moisture surrounding the earth, the easier would the

heavenly bodies be supplied with vapours from thence.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Homer, besides the boundaries of the earth, which he

fully describes, was likewise well acquainted with the Mediterranean. Starting from the Pillars,<note anchored="yes">The rocks of Gibraltar and Ceuta.</note> this sea is encompassed by Libya, Egypt, and Phoenicia, then by the coasts

opposite Cyprus, the Solymi,<note anchored="yes">The mountaineers of the Taurus, between Lycia and Pisidia.</note> Lycia, and Caria, and then by

the shore which stretches between Mycale<note anchored="yes">A mountain of Ionia near to the Meander, and opposite the Isle of Samos.</note> and Troas, and

the adjacent islands, every one of which he mentions, as well

as those of the Propontis<note anchored="yes">The Sea of Marmora.</note> and the Euxine, as far as Colchis,

and the locality of Jason's expedition. Furthermore, he was

acquainted with the Cimmerian Bosphorus,<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Caffa, which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of

the Cimmerians,<note anchored="yes">The Cimmerians, spoken of in Homer, were undoubtedly the in-

He must also have been acquainted with the Ister,<note anchored="yes">The Danube.</note> since he

speaks of the Mysians, a Thracian race, dwelling on the banks

of the Ister. He knew also the whole Thracian<note anchored="yes">Ancient Thrace consisted of the modern provinces of Bulgaria and

From hence to Thesprotis<note anchored="yes">Thesprotis, in Epirus, opposite Corfu.</note> is the Grecian

shore, with the whole of which he was acquainted. He was

besides familiar with the whole of Italy, and speaks of Te-

mese<note anchored="yes">Afterwards named Temsa. This town was in Citerior Calabria.

its fertility, as we have said before. If he omits various intermediate places this must be pardoned, for even the compiler

of a Geography overlooks numerous details. We must forgive him too for intermingling fabulous narrative with his historical and instructive work. This should not be complained

of; nevertheless, what Eratosthenes says is false, that the

poets aim at amusement, not instruction, since those who have

treated upon the subject most profoundly, regard poesy in

the light of a primitive philosophy. But we shall refute

Eratosthenes<note anchored="yes">This writer occupies so prominent a position in Strabo's work, that

no apology I think will be needed for the following extract from Smith's

Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.

<p>"Eratosthenes of Cyrene was, according to Suidas, the son of Aglaus,

according to others, the son of Ambrosius, and was born B. C. <date value="-276">276</date>. He

was taught by Ariston of Chius, the philosopher, Lysanias of Cyrene, the

grammarian, and Callimachus, the poet. He left Athens at the invitation

of Ptolemy Euergetes, who placed him over the library at Alexandria.

Here he continued till the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes. He died at the

age of eighty, about B. C. <date value="-196">196</date>, of voluntary starvation, having lost his

sight, and being tired of life. He was a man of very extensive learning:

we shall first speak of him as a geometer and astronomer.
</p><p>"It is supposed that Eratosthenes suggested to Ptolemy Euergetes the

construction of the large <emph rend="ital">armillœ,</emph> or fixed circular instruments, which

were long in use at Alexandria; but only because it is difficult to imagine

to whom else they are to be assigned, for Ptolemy the astronomer, though

he mentions them, and incidentally their antiquity, does not state to whom

they were due. In these circles each degree was divided into six parts.

We know of no observations of Eratosthenes in which they were probably

employed, except those which led him to the obliquity of the ecliptic,

which he must have made to be 23° 51′ 20″; for he states the distance of

the tropics to be eleven times the eighty-third part of the circumference.

This was a good observation for the times. Ptolemy the astronomer was

content with it, and according to him Hipparchus used no other. Of his

measure of the earth we shall presently speak. According to Nicomachus, he was the inventor of the <foreign lang="greek">ko/skinon,</foreign> or Cribrum Arithmeticum, as it

has since been called, being the well-known method of detecting the

prime numbers by writing down all odd numbers which do not end

with 5, and striking out successively the multiples of each, one after the

other, so that only prime numbers remain.
</p><p>"We still possess under the name of Eratosthenes a work, entitled

<foreign lang="greek">Kataseo|ismoi/,</foreign> giving a slight account of the constellations, their fabulous

history, and the stars in them. It is however acknowledged on all hands

that this is not a work of Eratosthenes. * * * The only other writing of Eratosthenes which remains, is a letter to Ptolemy on the duplication of the cube, for the mechanical performance of which he had

contrived an instrument, of which he seems to contemplate actual use in

measuring the contents of vessels, &amp;c. He seems to say that he has had

his method engraved in some temple or public building, with some verses,

which he adds. Eutocius has preserved this letter in his comment on

book ii. prop. 2, of the sphere and cylinder of Archimedes.
</p><p>"The greatest work of Eratosthenes, and that which must always make

his name conspicuous in scientific history, is the attempt which he made

to measure the magnitude of the earth, in which he brought forward and

used the method which is employed to this day. Whether or no he was

successful cannot be told, as we shall see; but it is not the less true that

he was the originator of the process by which we now know, very nearly

indeed, the magnitude of our own planet. Delambre says that if it were

he who advised the erection of the circular instruments above alluded to,

he must be considered as the founder of astronomy: to which it may be

added, that he was the founder of geodesy without any <emph rend="ital">if</emph> in the case.

The number of ancient writers who have alluded to this remarkable operation (which seems to have obtained its full measure of fame) is very great,

and we shall not attempt to combine their remarks or surmises: it is

enough to say that the most distinct account, and one of the earliest, is

found in the remaining work of Cleomedes.
</p><p>"At Syene in Upper Egypt, which is supposed to be the same as, or near

to, the town of Assouan, (Lat. 24° 10′ N., Long. 32° 59′ E. of Greenwich,)

Eratosthenes was told (that he observed is very doubtful) that deep wells

were enlightened to the bottom on the day of the summer solstice, and

that vertical objects cast no shadows. He concluded therefore, that Syene

was on the tropic, and its latitude equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic,

which, as we have seen, he had determined: he presumed that it was in

the same longitude as Alexandria, in which he was out about 3°, which

is not enough to produce what would at that time have been a sensible

error. By observations made at Alexandria, he determined the zenith of

that place to be distant by the fiftieth part of the circumference from the

solstice, which was equivalent to saying that the arc of the meridian between the two places is 7° 12′. Cleomedes says that he used the <foreign lang="greek">ska/fh,</foreign>

or hemispherical dial of Berosus, in the determination of this latitude.

Delambre rejects the idea with infinite scorn, and pronounces Cleomedes

unworthy of credit; and indeed it is not easy to see why Eratosthenes

should have rejected the gnomon and the large circular instruments, unless, perhaps, for the following reason. There is a sentiment of Cleomedes

which seems to imply that the disappearance of the shadows at Syene on

the day of the summer solstice was noticed to take place for 300 stadia

every way round Syene. If Eratosthenes took his report about the phenomenon (and we have no evidence that he went to Syene himself) from

those who could give no better account than this, we may easily understand why he would think the <foreign lang="greek">ska/fh</foreign> quite accurate enough to observe

with at his own end of the arc, since the other end of it was uncertain by

as much as 300 stadia. He gives 500 stadia for the distance from Alexandria to Syene, and this round number seems further to justify us in

concluding that he thought the process to be as rough as in truth it was.

Martianus Capella states that he obtained this distance from the measures

made by order of the Ptolemies (which had been commenced by Alexander): this writer then implies that Eratosthenes did not go to Syene

himself.
</p><p><q direct="unspecified">The result is 250,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth, which

Eratosthenes altered into 252,000, that his result might give an exact

number of stadia for the degree, namely, 700; this of course should

have been 694 4/9. Pliny calls this 31,500 Roman miles, and therefore

supposes the stadium to be the eighth part of a Roman mile, or takes

for granted that Eratosthenes used the Olympic stadium. It is likely

enough that the Ptolemies naturalized this stadium in Egypt; but nevertheless, it is not unlikely that an Egyptian stadium was employed. If

we assume the Olympic stadium, (202 1/4 yards,) the degree of Eratosthenes is more than 79 miles, upwards of 10 miles too great. Nothing

is known of any Egyptian stadium. Pliny asserts that Hipparchus, but

for what reason he does not say, wanted to add 25,000 stadia to the circumference as found by Eratosthenes. According to Plutarch, Eratosthenes made the sun to be 804 millions of stadia from the earth, and the

moon 780,000. According to Macrobius, he made the diameter of the

sun to be 27 times that of the earth. With regard to the other merits of

Eratosthenes, we must first of all mention what he did for geography,

which was closely connected with his mathematical pursuits. It was

Eratosthenes who raised geography to the rank of a science; for previous to his time it seems to have consisted, more or less, of a mass of in-

formation scattered in books of travel, descriptions of particular countries,

and the like. All these treasures were accessible to Eratosthenes in the

libraries of Alexandria; and he made the most profitable use of them,

by collecting the scattered materials, and uniting them into an organic

system of geography, in his comprehensive work entitled <foreign lang="greek">Gewgo|afika/,</foreign> or

as it is sometimes but erroneously called, <foreign lang="greek">gewgo|ou/mena</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">gewgo|afi/a.</foreign> It consisted of three books, the first of which, forming a sort of Introduction, contained a critical review of the labours of his predecessors

from the earliest to his own times, and investigations concerning the form

and nature of the earth, which, according to him, was an immoveable

globe, on the surface of which traces of a series of great revolutions were

still visible. He conceived that in one of these revolutions the Mediterranean had acquired its present form; for according to him it was at one

time a large lake covering portions of the adjacent countries of Asia and

Libya, until a passage was forced open by which it entered into communication with the ocean in the west. The second book contained what is

now called mathematical geography. His attempt to measure the magnitude of the earth has been spoken of above. The third book contained

the political geography, and gave descriptions of the various countries,

derived from the works of earlier travellers and geographers. In order

to be able to determine the accurate site of each place, he drew a line

parallel with the equator, running from the Pillars of Hercules to the

extreme east of Asia, and dividing the whole of the inhabited earth into

two halves. Connected with this work was a new map of the earth, in

which towns, mountains, rivers, lakes, and climates were marked according to his own improved measurements. This important work of Eratosthenes forms an epoch in the history of ancient geography: but unfortunately it is lost, and all that has survived consists in fragments quoted

by later geographers and historians, such as Polybius, Strabo, Marcianus,

Pliny, and others, who often judge of him unfavourably, and controvert

his statements; while it can be proved that in a great many passages they

adopt his opinions without mentioning his name. Marcianus charges

Eratosthenes with having copied the substance of the work of Timosthenes on Ports, (<foreign lang="greek">peri\ lime/nwn,</foreign>) to which he added but very little of his

own. This charge may be well-founded, but cannot have diminished the

value of the work of Eratosthenes, in which that of Timosthenes can

have formed only a very small portion. It seems to have been the very

overwhelming importance of the geography of Eratosthenes, that called

forth a number of opponents, among whom we meet with the names of

Polemon, Hipparchus, Polybius, Serapion, and Marcianus of Heracleia.

* * * Another work of a somewhat similar nature, entitled <foreign lang="greek">(Eemh=s,</foreign> was

written in verse, and treated of the form of the earth, its temperature,

the different zones, the constellations, and the like. * * * Eratosthenes

distinguished himself also as a philosopher, historian, grammarian, &amp;c.</q></p></note> more at length, when we have occasion again

his track are also well known as great men and true philosophers. The two immediately succeeding Homer, according

the equator, which they named <foreign lang="greek">kli/mata.</foreign> The extent of each zone was

determined by the length of the solstitial day, and thus each diminished

moderns have substituted a mode of reckoning the degrees by the elevation of the pole, which gives the latitudes with much greater accuracy.</note> Again, the only means we possess of becoming acquainted with the longitudes of different places is afforded by

such phenomena as each of us may notice; in which too, very

considerable differences appear, according to the various

points of observation. How could any one undertake to

write accurately and with propriety on the differences of the

various parts of the earth, who was ignorant of these matters?

its size, its features, and its position in the universe; whether

other portions are inhabited besides those on which we dwell,

and if so, their amount? What is the extent of the regions

not peopled? what their peculiarities, and the cause of their

remaining as they are? Thus it appears that the knowledge

of geography is connected with meteorology<note anchored="yes">Meteorology, from <foreign lang="greek">metew/ros,</foreign> aloft, is the science which describes and

</p><p>Such information greatly enlarges our sphere of knowledge,

</p><p>All that we have previously stated is confirmed both by the

however appears to bear in a peculiar manner on the case in

point; viz. the importance of geography in a political view.

For the sea and the earth in which we dwell furnish theatres

for action; limited, for limited actions; vast, for grander

deeds; but that which contains them all, and is the scene of

the greatest undertakings, constitutes what we term the habitable earth; and they are the greatest generals who, subduing

nations and kingdoms under one sceptre, and one political

administration, have acquired dominion over land and sea. It is

clear then, that geography is essential to all the transactions of

the statesman, informing us, as it does, of the position of the

continents, seas, and oceans of the whole habitable earth. Information of especial interest to those who are concerned to

know the exact truth of such particulars, and whether the places

have been explored or not: for government will certainly be better administered where the size and position of the country, its

own peculiarities, and those of the surrounding districts, are

understood. Forasmuch as there are many sovereigns who rule

in different regions, and some stretch their dominion over others'

territories, and undertake the government of different nations

and kingdoms, and thus enlarge the extent of their dominion,

it is not possible that either themselves, nor yet writers on

geography, should be equally acquainted with the whole, but

to both there is a great deal more or less known. Indeed,

were the whole earth under one government and one administration, it is hardly possible that we should be informed of

every locality in an equal degree; for even then we should be

most acquainted with the places nearest us: and after all, it

is better that we should have a more perfect description of

these, since, on account of their proximity, there is greater

reed for it. We see there is no reason to be surprised that

there should be one chorographer<note anchored="yes">Chorography, a term used by Greek writers, meaning the description

of particular districts.</note> for the Indians, another for

the Ethiopians, and a third for the Greeks and Romans.

What use would it be to the Indians if a geographer should

thus describe Bœotia to them, in the words of Homer:—

To us this is of value, while to be acquainted with the Indies



<pb n="17"/>



and their various territorial divisions would be useless, as it

could lead to no advantage, which is the only criterion of the

worth of such knowledge.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Even if we descend to the consideration of such trivial

matters as hunting, the case is still the same; for he will be

most successful in the chase who is acquainted with the size

and nature of the wood, and one familiar with the locality

will be the most competent to superintend an encampment,

an ambush, or a march. But it is in great undertakings that

the truth shines out in all its brilliancy, for here, while the

success resulting from knowledge is grand, the consequences

of ignorance are disastrous. The fleet of Agamemnon, for instance, ravaging Mysia, as if it had been the Trojan territory,

was compelled to a shameful retreat. Likewise the Persians

and Libyans,<note anchored="yes">By Libyans are here intended Carthaginians. The events alluded to

by Strabo may be found in Pomponius Mela and Valerius Maximus, whose

accounts however do not entirely accord. That of Valerius Maximus, who

is followed by Servius, tells us that Hannibal, on his return to Africa,

observed his pilot Pelorus was taking the ships by the coast of Italy, and

suspecting him therefore of treachery, caused him to be executed. He

did not know at the time the intention of Pelorus to take him through

the Strait of Messina, but afterwards, when aware of the excellence of the

passage, caused a monument to be raised to the memory of the unfortunate pilot. Strabo, in his ninth book, gives us the history of Salganeus,

and the monument erected to him on the shores of Negropont.</note> supposing certain straits to be impassable, were

very near falling into great perils, and have left behind them

memorials of their ignorance; the former a monument to

Salganeus on the Euripus, near Chalcis, whom the Persians

slew, for, as they thought, falsely conducting their fleet from the

Gulf of Malea<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Zeitun.</note> to the Euripus; and the latter to the memory

of Pelorus, who was executed on a like occasion. At the time

of the expedition of Xerxes, the coasts of Greece were covered

with wrecks, and the emigrations from Æolia and Ionia furnish numerous instances of the same calamity. On the other

hand, matters have come to a prosperous termination, when

judiciously directed by a knowledge of the locality. Thus it

was at the pass of Thermopylæ that Ephialtes is reported to

have pointed out to the Persians a pathway over the mountains, and so placed the band of Leonidas at their mercy, and

opened to the Barbarians a passage into Pylæ. But passing

over ancient occurrences, we think that the late expeditions



<pb n="18"/>



of the Romans against the Parthians furnish an excellent ex-

ample, where, as in those against the Germans and Kelts, the

Barbarians, taking advantage of their situation, [carried on the

war] in marshes, woods, and pathless deserts, deceiving the

ignorant enemy as to the position of different places, and concealing the roads, and the means of obtaining food and

necessaries.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As we have said, this science has an especial reference

to the occupations and requirements of statesmen, with whom

also political and ethical philosophy is mainly concerned; and

here is an evidence. We distinguish the different kinds of

civil government by the office of their chief men, denominating one government a monarchy, or kingdom, another an

aristocracy, a third a democracy; for so many we consider

are the forms of government, and we designate them by

these names, because from them they derive their primary

characteristic. For the laws which emanate from the sovereign, from the aristocracy, and from the people all are different. The law is in fact a type of the form of government.

It is on this account that some define right to be the interest of the strongest. If, therefore, political philosophy

is advantageous to the ruler, and geography in the actual

government of the country, this latter seems to possess some

little superiority. This superiority is most observable in

real service.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But even the theoretical portion of geography is by no

means contemptible. On the one hand, it embraces the arts,

mathematics, and natural science; on the other, history and

fable. Not that this latter can have any distinct advantage:

for instance, if any one should relate to us the wanderings of

Ulysses, Menelaus, and Jason, he would not seem to have

added directly to our fund of practical knowledge thereby,

(which is the only thing men of the world are interested in,)

unless he should convey useful examples of what those wanderers were compelled to suffer, and at the same time afford

matter of rational amusement to those who interest themselves

in the places which gave birth to such fables. Practical men

interest themselves in these pursuits, since they are at once

commendable, and afford them pleasure; but yet not to any

great extent. In this class, too, will be found those whose

main object in life is pleasure and respectability: but these



<pb n="19"/>



by no means constitute the majority of mankind, who naturally prefer that which holds out some direct advantage. The

geographer should therefore chiefly devote himself to what is

practically important. He should follow the same rule in

regard to history and the mathematics, selecting always

that which is most useful, most intelligible, and most authentic.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Geometry and astronomy, as we before remarked, seem

absolutely indispensable in this science. This, in fact, is evident, that without some such assistance, it would be impossible to be accurately acquainted with the configuration of the

earth; its climata,<note anchored="yes">Vide preceding note on this word, p. 13, n. 1.</note> dimensions, and the like information.
</p><p>As the size of the earth has been demonstrated by other

writers, we shall here take for granted and receive as accurate

what they have advanced. We shall also assume that the

earth is spheroidal, that its surface is likewise spheroidal, and

above all, that bodies have a tendency towards its centre,

which latter point is clear to the perception of the most average understanding. However we may show summarily that

the earth is spheroidal, from the consideration that all things

however distant tend to its centre, and that every body is attracted towards its centre of gravity; this is more distinctly

proved from observations of the sea and sky, for here the

evidence of the senses, and common observation, is alone requisite. The convexity of the sea is a further proof of this

to those who have sailed; for they cannot perceive lights at a

distance when placed at the same level as their eyes, but if

raised on high, they at once become perceptible to vision,

though at the same time further removed. So, when the eye

is raised, it sees what before was utterly imperceptible.

Homer speaks of this when he says,

Still, we do not expect that they should be such thorough

masters of the subject as to know what stars rise and set

together for the different quarters of the earth; those which

have the same meridian line, the elevation of the poles, the

signs which are in the zenith, with all the various phenomena

which differ as well in appearance as reality with the variations of the horizon and arctic circle. With some of these

matters, unless as philosophical pursuits, they should not burden themselves at all; others they must take for granted without searching into their causes. This must be left to the care

of the philosopher; the statesman can have no leisure, or very

little, for such pursuits. Those who, through carelessness and

ignorance, are not familiar with the globe and the circles

traced upon it, some parallel to each other, some at right

angles to the former, others, again, in an oblique direction;

by which we reckon the changes of season and the winds,)

writers. In our opinion, though they may have perfectly

treated some subjects, in others they have still left much to

be completed; and we shall be justified in our performance,

if we can add to their information even in a trifling degree.

At the present moment the conquests of the Romans and Parthians have added much to our knowledge, which (as was well

observed by Eratosthenes) had been considerably increased by

the expedition of Alexander. This prince laid open to our

view the greater part of Asia, and the whole north of Europe

as far as the Danube. And the Romans [have discovered to us]

the entire west of Europe as far as the river Elbe, which divides Germany, and the country beyond the Ister to the river

Dniester. The country beyond this to the Mæotis,<note anchored="yes">The Sea of Azof.</note> and the

coasts extending along Colchis,<note anchored="yes">Mingrelia; east of the Euxine.</note> was brought to light by Mithridates, surnamed Eupator, and his generals. To the Parthians

before we knew but little. Thus we can add much information

not supplied by former writers, but this will best be seen when

we come to treat on the writers who have preceded us; and

this method we shall pursue, not so much in regard to the

primitive geographers, as to Eratosthenes and those subsequent

to him. As these writers far surpassed the generality in the

amount of their knowledge, so naturally it is more difficult to

detect their errors when such occur. If I seem to contradict

those most whom I take chiefly for my guides, I must claim

indulgence on the plea, that it was never intended to criticise

the whole body of geographers, the larger number of whom

are not worthy of consideration, but to give an opinion of

those only who are generally found correct. Still, while

many are beneath discussion, such men as Eratosthenes, Posidonius, Hipparchus, Polybius, and others of their stamp,

deserve our highest consideration.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let us first examine Eratosthenes, reviewing at the same

time what Hipparchus has advanced against him. Eratosthenes is much too creditable an historian for us to believe

what Polemon endeavours to charge against him, that he had

not even seen Athens. At the same time he does not merit

that unbounded confidence which some seem to repose in him,

although, as he himself tells us, he passed much of his time

with first-rate [characters]. Never, says he, at one period,

and in one city, were there so many philosophers flourishing

together as in my time. In their number was Ariston and

Arcesilaus. This, however, it seems is not sufficient, but you

must also be able to choose who are the real guides whom it is

your interest to follow. He considers Arcesilaus and Ariston

to be the coryphæi of the philosophers who flourished in his

time, and is ceaseless in his eulogies of Apelles and Bion,

course between the man who devotes himself to philosophy,

and the man who cannot make up his mind to dedicate himself to it: and to have studied the science merely as a relief

from his other pursuits, or as a pleasing and instructive recreation. In his other writings he is just the same; but let

these things pass. We will now proceed as well as we can to

the task of rectifying his geography.
</p><p>First, then, let us return to the point which we lately deferred.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes says that the poet directs his whole attention to the amusement of the mind, and not at all to its instruction. In opposition to his idea, the ancients define poesy

as a primitive philosophy, guiding our life from infancy, and

pleasantly regulating our morals, our tastes, and our actions.

The [Stoics] of our day affirm that the only wise man is the

poet. On this account the earliest lessons which the citizens

of Greece convey to their children are from the poets; cer-

tainly not alone for the purpose of amusing their minds, but

for their instruction. Nay, even the professors of music, who

give lessons on the harp, lyre, and pipe, lay claim to our consideration on the same account, since they say that [the accomplishments which they teach] are calculated to form and

improve the character. It is not only among the Pythagoreans

that one hears this claim supported, for Aristoxenus is of that

opinion, and Homer too regarded the bards as amongst the

wisest of mankind.
</p><p>Of this number was the guardian of Clytemnestra, <q direct="unspecified">to

</p><p>But apart from all such considerations, Eratosthenes contradicts himself; for a little previously to the sentence which

we have quoted, at the commencement of his Essay on Geography, he says, that <q direct="unspecified">all the ancient poets took delight in

showing their knowledge of such matters. Homer inserted

into his poetry all that he knew about the Ethiopians, Egypt,

and Libya. Of all that related to Greece and the neighbouring places he entered even too minutely into the details, describing Thisbe as <q direct="unspecified">abounding in doves,</q> Haliartus, <q direct="unspecified">grassy,</q>

Anthedon, the <q direct="unspecified">far distant,</q> Litæa, <q direct="unspecified">situated on the sources

meaning.</q> But in pursuing this method, what object has he

in view, to amuse [merely], or to instruct? The latter, doubtless. Well, perhaps he has told the truth in these instances,

but in what was beyond his observation both he and the other

writers have indulged in all the marvels of fable. If such be

the case the statement should have been, that the poets relate

some things for mere amusement, others for instruction; but

he affirms that they do it altogether for amusement, without

any view to information; and by way of climax, inquires,

What can it add to Homer's worth to be familiar with many

lands, and skilled in strategy, agriculture, rhetoric, and similar information, which some persons seem desirous to make

him possessed of. To seek to invest him with all this knowledge is most likely the effect of too great a zeal for his honour.

Hipparchus observes, that to assert he was acquainted with

every art and science, is like saying that an Attic eiresionè<note anchored="yes">A harvest-wreath of laurel or olive wound round with wool, and

bears pears and apples.
</p><p>As far as this goes, Eratosthenes, you are right enough;

not so, however, when you not only deny that Homer was

possessed of these vast acquirements, but represent poetry in

general as a tissue of old wives' fables, where, to use your

own expression, every thing thought likely to amuse is

cooked up. I ask, is it of no value to the auditors<note anchored="yes">Auditors,] <foreign lang="greek">a)ko|owme/nois.</foreign> In Greece there was a class of lectures

Who can suppose that a poet capable of effectively introducing into his scenes rhetoricians, generals, and various other

characters, each displaying some peculiar excellence, was nothing more than a droll or juggler, capable only of cheating

or flattering his hearer, and not of instructing him.
</p><p>Are we not all agreed that the chief merit of a poet consists in his accurate representation of the affairs of life? Can

this be done by a mere driveller, unacquainted with the world?

standard as that of a mechanic or a blacksmith, where honour

and virtue have nothing to do with our estimate. But the

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To deny that our poet possesses the graces of oratory is

using us hardly indeed. What is so befitting an orator, what

so poetical as eloquence, and who so sweetly eloquent as Homer? But, by heaven! you'll say, there are other styles of

eloquence than those peculiar to poetry. Of course [I admit

this]; in poetry itself there is the tragic and the comic style;

in prose, the historic and the forensic. But is not language



<pb n="28"/>



a generality, of which poetry and prose are forms? Yes, language is; but are not the rhetorical, the eloquent, and the

florid styles also? I answer, that flowery prose is nothing but

an imitation of poetry. Ornate poetry was the first to make

its appearance, and was well received. Afterwards it was

closely imitated by writers in the time of Cadmus, Pherecydes, and Hecatæus. The metre was the only thing dispensed with, every other poetic grace being carefully preserved.

As time advanced, one after another of its beauties was

discarded, till at last it came down from its glory into our

common prose. In the same way we may say that comedy

took its rise from tragedy, but descended from its lofty grandeur into what we now call the common parlance of daily life.

And when [we find] the ancient writers making use of the

expression <q direct="unspecified">to sing,</q> to designate eloquence of style, this

in itself is an evidence that poetry is the source and origin

of all ornamented and rhetorical language. Poetry in ancient days was on every occasion accompanied by melody.

The song or ode was but a modulated speech, from whence the

words rhapsody, tragedy, comedy,<note anchored="yes">So much of the meaning of this sentence depends upon the orthography, that its force is not fully perceptible in English; the Greek is as

follows: <foreign lang="greek">tou=to d' h\=n h( w)|dh\ lo/gos memelisme/nos a)f' ou/= dh\ r(ayw|di/ah t) e)/legon kai\ to|agw|di/an kai\ kwmw|di/an.</foreign></note> are derived; and since

originally eloquence was the term made use of for the poetical

effusions which were always of the nature of a song, it soon

happened [that in speaking of poetry] some said, to sing, others,

to be eloquent; and as the one term was early misapplied to

prose compositions, the other also was soon applied in the

same way. Lastly, the very term <emph rend="ital">prose,</emph> which is applied to

language not clothed in metre, seems to indicate, as it were,

its descent from an elevation or chariot to the ground.<note anchored="yes">This last sentence can convey little or no meaning to the English

reader; its whole force in the original depending on verbal association.

Its general scope however will be evident, when it is stated that in

Greek, the same word, <foreign lang="greek">pezo\s,</foreign> which means a <q direct="unspecified">foot-soldier,</q> signifies also

<q direct="unspecified">prose composition.</q> Hence Strabo's allusion to the chariot. The

<p>Homer accurately describes many distant countries, and

not only Greece and the neighbouring places, as Eratosthenes

asserts. His romance, too, is in better style than that of his successors. He does not make up wondrous tales on every occasion,



<pb n="29"/>



but to instruct us the better often, and especially in the Odyssey, adds to the circumstances which have come under his

actual observation, allegories, wise harangues, and enticing

narrations. Concerning which, Eratosthenes is much mistaken when he says that both Homer and his commentators

are a pack of fools. But this subject demands a little more of

our attention.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To begin. The poets were by no means the first to

avail themselves of myths. States and lawgivers had taken

advantage of them long before, having observed the constitutional bias of mankind. Man is eager after knowledge, and

the love of legend is but the prelude thereto. This is why

children begin to listen [to fables], and are acquainted with

them before any other kind of knowledge; the cause of this is

that the myth introduces them to a new train of ideas, relating

not to every-day occurrences, but something in addition to

these.
</p><p>A charm hangs round whatever is new and hitherto unknown, inspiring us with a desire to become acquainted with

it, but when the wonderful and the marvellous are likewise

present, our delight is increased until at last it becomes a

philtre of study. To children we are obliged to hold out such

enticements, in order that in riper years, when the mind is

powerful, and no longer needs such stimulants, it may be

prepared to enter on the study of actual realities.
</p><p>Every illiterate and uninstructed man is yet a child, and

takes delight in fable. With the partially informed it is much

the same; reason is not all-powerful within him, and he still

possesses the tastes of a child. But the marvellous, which

is capable of exciting fear as well as pleasure, influences not

childhood only, but age as well. As we relate to children

pleasing tales to incite them [to any course] of action, and

frightful ones to deter them, such as those of Lamia,<note anchored="yes">A female phantom said to devour children, used by nurses as a bugbear to intimidate their refractory charges.</note> Gorgo,<note anchored="yes">In later times there were three Gorgons, Stheino, Euryale, and Medusa, but Homer seems to have known but one.</note>

Ephialtes,<note anchored="yes">One of the giants, who in the war against the gods was deprived of

his left eye by Apollo, and of the right by Hercules.</note> and Mormolyca.<note anchored="yes">The same phantom as Mormo, with which the Greeks used to frighten little children.</note> So numbers of our citizens are



<pb n="30"/>



incited to deeds of virtue by the beauties of fable, when they

hear the poets in a strain of enthusiasm recording noble actions, such as the labours of Hercules or Theseus, and the

honours bestowed on them by the gods, or even when they

see paintings, sculptures, or figures bearing their romantic

evidence to such events. In the same way they are restrained from vicious courses, when they think they have

received from the gods by oracles or some other invisible intimations, threats, menaces, or chastisements, or even if they

only believe they have befallen others. The great mass of

women and common people, cannot be induced by mere force

of reason to devote themselves to piety, virtue, and honesty;

superstition must therefore be employed, and even this is insufficient without the aid of the marvellous and the terrible.

For what are the thunderbolts, the ægis, the trident, the

torches, the dragons, the barbed thyrses, the arms of the gods,

and all the paraphernalia of antique theology, but fables employed by the founders of states, as bugbears to frighten

timorous minds.
</p><p>Such was mythology; and when our ancestors found it capable of subserving the purposes of social and political life,

and even contributing to the knowledge of truth, they continued the education of childhood to maturer years, and maintained that poetry was sufficient to form the understanding of

every age. In course of time history and our present philosophy were introduced; these, however, suffice but for the

chosen few, and to the present day poetry is the main agent

which instructs our people and crowds our theatres. Homer

here stands pre-eminent, but in truth all the early historians

and natural philosophers were mythologists as well.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Thus it is that our poet, though he sometimes employs

fiction for the purposes of instruction, always gives the preference to truth; he makes use of what is false, merely tolerating it in order the more easily to lead and govern the multitude. As a man

so Homer, heightening by fiction actual occurrences, adorns

and embellishes his subject; but his end is always the same

as that of the historian, who relates nothing but facts. In



<pb n="31"/>



this manner he undertook the narration of the Trojan war,

gilding it with the beauties of fancy and the wanderings of

Ulysses; but we shall never find Homer inventing an empty

fable apart from the inculcation of truth. It is ever the case

that a person lies most successfully, when he intermingles

[into the falsehood] a sprinkling of truth. Such is the remark of Polybius in treating of the wanderings of Ulysses;

such is also the meaning of the verse,



<cit><quote><lg>
<l>He fabricated many falsehoods, relating them like truths:<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Odyssey xix. 203.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey xix. 203.</bibl></cit>



not <emph rend="ital">all,</emph> but <emph rend="ital">many</emph> falsehoods, otherwise it would not have

looked like the truth. Homer's narrative is founded on history.

He tells us that king Æolus governed the Lipari Islands, that

around Mount Ætna and Leontini dwelt the Cyclopæ, and certain Læstrygonians inhospitable to strangers. That at that

time the districts surrounding the strait were unapproachable;

and Scylla and Charybdis were infested by banditti. In like

manner in the writings of Homer we are informed of other

freebooters, who dwelt in divers regions. Being aware that

the Cimmerians dwelt on the Cimmerian Bosphorus, a dark

northern country, he felicitously locates them in a gloomy region close by Hades, a fit theatre for the scene in the wanderings of Ulysses. That he was acquainted with these people

we may satisfy ourselves from the chroniclers, who report an

incursion made by the Cimmerians either during his life-time

or just before.

which render the passage through the Strait of Constantinople so difficult, also afforded matter to our poet. The

actual existence of a place named Æa, stamped credibility

upon his Ææa; so did the Symplegades upon the Planctæ,

(the Jostling Rocks upon the Wandering Rocks,) and the

passage of Jason through the midst of them; in the same

way Scylla and Charybdis accredited the passage [of Ulysses]

past those rocks. In his time people absolutely regarded the

Euxine as a kind of second ocean, and placed those who had

crossed it in the same list with navigators who had passed the

Pillars.<note anchored="yes">Unfortunately for Strabo's illustration, no Grecian navigator had ever

passed the Strait of Gibraltar in Homer's time.</note> It was looked upon as the largest of our seas,

and was therefore <emph rend="ital">par excellence</emph> styled the Sea, in the

same way as Homer [is called] the Poet. In order therefore to be well received, it is probable he transferred the scenes

from the Euxine to the ocean, so as not to stagger the general

belief. And in my opinion those Solymi who possess the

highest ridges of Taurus, lying between Lycia and Pisidia,

and those who in their southern heights stand out most conspicuously to the dwellers on this side Taurus, and the inhabitants of the Euxine by a figure of speech, he describes as

being beyond the ocean. For narrating the voyage of Ulysses

in his ship, he says,

<p>Having premised thus much, we must now take into

makes Ulysses wander to Sicily or Italy, and also of those who

denied this. The truth is, he may be equally interpreted on

this subject either way, according as we take a correct or incorrect view of the case. Correct, if we understand that he

was convinced of the reality of Ulysses' wanderings there,

and taking this truth as a foundation, raised thereon a poetical superstructure. And so far this description of him is

right; for not about Italy only, but to the farthest extremities

of Spain, traces of his wanderings and those of similar adventurers may still be found. Incorrect, if the scene-painting is

received as fact, his Ocean, and Hades, the oxen of the sun,

his hospitable reception by the goddesses, the metamorphoses,

the gigantic size of the Cyclopæ and Læstrygonians, the monstrous appearance of Scylla, the distance of the voyage, and

other similar particulars, all alike manifestly fabulous. It is

as idle to waste words with a person who thus openly maligns

our poet, as it would be with one who should assert as true

all the particulars of Ulysses' return to Ithaca,<note anchored="yes">There is some doubt as to the modern name of the island of Ithaca.

stadia distant,<note anchored="yes">The stadia here mentioned are 700 to a degree; thus 2000 stadia

<p>Further, if those who describe the geography of certain

places do not agree in every particular, are we justified in at

once rejecting their whole narration? Frequently this is a

reason why it should receive the greater credit. For example, in the investigation whether the scene of Ulysses' wanderings were Sicily or Italy, and the proper position of the

Sirenes, they differ in so far that one places them at Pelorus,

and the other at Sirenussæ, but neither of them dissents from

the idea that it was some where near Sicily or Italy. They

add thereby strength to this view, inasmuch as though they

are not agreed as to the exact locality, neither of them makes

any question but that it was some where contiguous to Italy or

Sicily. If a third party should add, that the monument of

Parthenope, who was one of the Sirens, is shown at Naples,

this only confirms us the more in our belief, for though a

third place is introduced to our notice, still as Naples is situated in the gulf called by Eratosthenes the Cumæan, and



<pb n="35"/>



which is formed by the Sirenussæ, we are more confident

still that the position of the Sirenes was some where close by.
</p><p>That the poet did not search for accuracy in every minor

detail we admit, but neither ought we to expect this of him;

at the same time we are not to believe that he composed his

poem without inquiring into the history of the Wandering,

nor where and how it occurred.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes <q direct="unspecified">thinks it probable that Hesiod, having

heard of the wanderings of Ulysses, and of their having taken

place near to Sicily and Italy, embraced this view of the case,

and not only describes the places spoken of by Homer, but

also Ætna, the Isle of Ortygia,<note anchored="yes">Now the Island of St. Marcian.</note> near to Syracuse, and Tyrrhenia. As for Homer, he was altogether unacquainted with

these places, and further, had no wish to lay the scene of the

wanderings in any well-known locality.</q> What! are then

Ætna and Tyrrhenia such well-known places, and Scyllæum,

Charybdis, Circæum,<note anchored="yes">Monte Circello, near to Terracina.</note> and the Sirenussæ, so obscure? Or is

Hesiod so correct as never to write nonsense, but always follow in the wake of received opinions, while Homer blurts out

whatever comes uppermost? Without taking into consideration our remarks on the character and aptitude of Homer's

myths, a large array of writers who bear evidence to his statements, and the additional testimony of local tradition, are

sufficient proof that his are not the inventions of poets or contemporary scribblers, but the record of real actors and real

scenes.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The conjecture of Polybius in regard to the particulars

of the wandering of Ulysses is excellent. He says that Æolus

instructed sailors how to navigate the strait, a difficult matter

on account of the currents occasioned by the ebb and flow.

and was therefore called the dispenser of the winds, and reputed their king.
</p><p>In like manner Danaus for pointing out the springs of

water that were in Argos, and Atreus for showing the retrograde movement of the sun in the heavens, from being

mere soothsayers and diviners, were raised to the dignity of

kings. And the priests of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans,

and Magi, distinguished for their wisdom above those around

them, obtained from our predecessors honour and authority;



<pb n="36"/>



and so it is that in each of the gods, we worship the discoverer

of some useful art.
</p><p>Having thus introduced his subject, he does not allow us to

consider the account of Æolus, nor yet the rest of the Odyssey, as altogether mythical. There is a spice of the fabulous

here, as well as in the Trojan War,<note anchored="yes">The Iliad.</note> but as respects Sicily,

the poet accords entirely with the other historians who

have written on the local traditions of Sicily and Italy. He

altogether denies the justness of Eratosthenes' dictum, <q direct="unspecified">that

we may hope to discover the whereabout of Ulysses' wanderings, when we can find the cobbler who sewed up the winds

in the leathern sack.</q> "And [adds Polybius] his description

of the hunt of the galeotes<note anchored="yes">Sword-fish.</note> at Scylla,



<cit><quote><lg>
<l>'Plunged to her middle in the horrid den
</l><l>She lurks, protruding from the black abyss

accords well with what takes place around Scyllæum: for the

thunny-fish, carried in shoals by Italy, and not being able to

reach Sicily, fall into [the Strait], where they become the

prey of larger fish, such as dolphins, dog-fish, and other ceta-

cea, and it is by this means that the galeotes (which are also

called sword-fish) and dogs fatten themselves. For the same

thing occurs here, and at the rising of the Nile and other

rivers, as takes place when a forest is on fire. Vast crowds

of animals, in flying from the fire or the water, become the

prey of beasts more powerful than themselves."

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He then goes on to describe the manner in which they

catch the sword-fish at Scyllæum. One look-out directs the

whole body of fishers, who are in a vast number of small

boats, each furnished with two oars, and two men to each

boat. One man rows, the other stands on the prow, spear in

hand, while the look-out has to signal the appearance of a

sword-fish. (This fish, when swimming, has about a third of

its body above water.) As it passes the boat, the fisher darts

the spear from his hand, and when this is withdrawn, it leaves

the sharp point with which it is furnished sticking in the flesh



<pb n="37"/>



of the fish: this point is barbed, and loosely fixed to the spear

for the purpose; it has a long end fastened to it; this they pay

out to the wounded fish, till it is exhausted with its struggling

and endeavours at escape. Afterwards they trail it to the

shore, or, unless it is too large and full-grown, haul it into

the boat. If the spear should fall into the sea, it is not lost,

for it is jointed of oak and pine, so that when the oak sinks

on account of its weight, it causes the other end to rise, and

thus is easily recovered. It sometimes happens that the rower

is wounded, even through the boat, and such is the size of the

sword with which the galeote is armed, such the strength of

the fish, and the method of the capture, that [in danger] it is

not surpassed by the chase of the wild boar. From these facts

(he says) we may conclude that Ulysses' wanderings were close

to Sicily, since Homer describes Scylla<note anchored="yes">There is a very fine medallion in the Bibliothèque Nationale de

France, portraying Scylla as half woman, half dolphin, with a trident

in her left hand, and seizing a fish with her right. From her middle protrude two half-bodied dogs, who assist the monster in swimming.</note> as engaging in a pur-

suit exactly similar to that which is carried on at Scyllæum.

As to Charybdis, he describes just what takes place at the

Strait of Messina:

Pillars to be 22,500 stadia, and supposing the rate of

passage was the same throughout the nine days, the voyage

must have been accomplished at the speed of 2500 stadia per

or Rhodes to Alexandria, a distance of 4000 stadia, has been

made in two days? To those who demand how it was that

Ulysses, though he journeyed thrice to Sicily, never once navigated the Strait, we reply that, long after his time, voyagers

always sedulously avoided that route.</q>

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such are the sentiments of Polybius; and in many

respects they are correct enough; but when he discusses the

voyage beyond the ocean, and enters on minute calculations

of the proportion borne by the distance to the number of days,

he is greatly mistaken. He alleges perpetually the words of

the poet,

though so plainly expressed, Polybius slily manages to overlook

them. Here he is altogether wrong, though quite correct

about the wandering of Ulysses having taken place round

Sicily and Italy, a fact which Homer establishes himself.

Otherwise, what poet or writer could have persuaded the

Neapolitans to assert that they possessed the tomb of Parthe-

of Messina, and Scylla, and Charybdis, and Æolus, all which

things should neither be examined into too rigorously, nor

yet [despised] as groundless and without foundation, alike remote from truth and historic value.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes seems to have had something like this

view of the case himself, when he says, <q direct="unspecified">Any one would believe that the poet intended the western regions as the scene

of Ulysses' wanderings, but that he has departed from fact,

sometimes through want of perfect information, at other times

because he wished to give to scenes a more terrific and marvellous appearance than they actually possessed.</q> So far

this is true, but his idea of the object which the poet had in



<pb n="40"/>



view while composing, is false; real advantage, not trifling,

being his aim. We may justly reprehend his assertion on this

point, as also where he says, that Homer places the scene of

his marvels in distant lands that he may lie the more easily.

Remote localities have not furnished him with near so many

wonderful narrations as Greece, and the countries thereto adjacent; witness the labours of Hercules, and Theseus, the

fables concerning Crete, Sicily, and the other islands; besides

those connected with Cithærum, Helicon,<note anchored="yes">Cythæron and Helicon, two mountains of Bœotia, the latter of which

is now named Zagaro Voreni.</note> Parnassus,<note anchored="yes">Parnassus, a mountain of Phocis, near Delphi.</note> Pelion,<note anchored="yes">Pelion, a mountain of Magnesia, in Thessaly.</note>

and the whole of Attica and the Peloponnesus. Let us not

therefore tax the poets with ignorance on account of the myths

which they employ, and since, so far from myth being the

staple, they for the most part avail themselves of actual occurrences, (and Homer does this in a remarkable degree,) the

inquirer who will seek how far these ancient writers have

wandered into fiction, ought not to scrutinize to what extent

the fiction was carried, but rather what is the truth concerning those places and persons to which the fictions have been

applied; for instance, whether the wanderings of Ulysses did

actually occur, and where.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>On the whole, however, it is not proper to place the

works of Homer in the common catalogue of other poets,

without challenging for him a superiority both in respect of

his other [excellences] and also for the geography on which

our attention is now engaged.
</p><p>If any one were to do no more than merely read through

the Triptolemus of Sophocles, or the prologue to the Bacchæ

of Euripides, and then compare them with the care taken by

Homer in his geographical descriptions, he would at once

perceive both the difference and superiority of the latter, for

wherever there is necessity for arrangement in the localities

he has immortalized, he is careful to preserve it as well in

regard to Greece, as to foreign countries.

and Bion the astronomer, entertain so mistaken an opinion in

regard to the winds. They say that the north-east (Cæcias)

blows from the commencement of summer, and that the southwest wind (Libs), which is exactly opposite to this, blows from

the decline of winter. And again, the south-east wind (Eurus),

which is opposite to the north-west wind (Argestes), from the

commencement of winter. The east and west winds being

<p>Persisting in his false views in relation to Homer, he

he mentions not only the Nile, but also the Po, with which certainly Homer

had not then been given to the river, and as to the mouths, if

they were obscure and little known, will not every one excuse

him for not being aware whether there were several or merely

one? At that time, the river, its rising, and its mouths were

considered, as they are at the present day, amongst the most

remarkable, the most wonderful, and most worthy of recording of all the peculiarities of Egypt: who can suppose that

those who told our poet of the country and river of Egypt, of

Egyptian Thebes, and of Pharos, were unaware of the many

embouchures of the Nile; or that being aware, they would

not have described them, were it not that they were too generally known? <q direct="unspecified">But is it not inconceivable that Homer

should describe Ethiopia, and the Sidonians, the Erembi, and

the Exterior Sea,<note anchored="yes">By this expression is intended the Atlantic.</note>—should tell us that Ethiopia was divided

into two parts, and yet nothing about those things which were

nearer and better known?</q> Certainly not, his not describing

these things is no proof that he was not acquainted with them.

He does not tell us of his own country, nor yet many other

things. The most probable reason is, they were so generally

known that they did not appear to him worth recording.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin remarks that the arguments made use of by Strabo are not

sufficiently conclusive. The country with which the Greeks were best

acquainted was Greece, undoubtedly, and it is this land which Homer

has described with the greatest exactness of detail.</note>

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, they are entirely wrong when they allege as a

mark of Homer's ignorance, that he describes the island of

Pharos<note anchored="yes">An island opposite to Alexandria, and seven stadia distant therefrom.

The Ptolemies united it to the main-land by means of a pier, named

Hepta-stadium, in allusion to its length. The sands which accumulated

against the pier became the site of the present city of Alexandria. It

was not on this island that the celebrated Pharos of Alexandria was

erected, but on a desolate rock a little to the N. E. It received the same

name as the island, to which it was joined by another pier. As to the

passage of Homer, (Odyssey iv. 354–357,) where he says that Pharos is

one day's sail from the Egyptus, he does not mean Egypt, as Strabo fancies, but the mouth of the Nile, which river in his time was called the

Egyptus, and probably fell into the sea about one day's sail from Pharos.</note> as entirely surrounded by the sea. On the contrary,

it might be taken advantage of as a proof that our poet was

not unacquainted with a single one of the points concerning

Egypt which we have just been speaking of: and thus we



<pb n="47"/>



demonstrate it:—Every one is prone to romance a little in

narrating his travels, and Menelaus was no exception to the

rule. He had been to Ethiopia,<note anchored="yes">We have before remarked that the Ethiopia visited by Menelaus

was not the country above Egypt, generally known by that name, but an

Ethiopia lying round Jaffa, the ancient Joppa.</note> and there heard much discussion concerning the sources of the Nile, and the alluvium

which it deposited, both along its course, and also at its

mouths, and the large additions which it had thereby made to

the main-land, so as fully to justify the remark of Herodotus<note anchored="yes"><q direct="unspecified">The priests stated also that Menes was the first of mortals that

ever ruled over Egypt; to this they added that in the days of that

king, all Egypt, with the exception of the Thebaic nome, was but a

morass; and that none of the lands now seen below Lake Mœris, then

existed; from the sea up to this place is a voyage by the river of seven

days. I myself am perfectly convinced the account of the priests in this

particular is correct; for the thing is evident to every one who sees and

has common sense, although he may not have heard the fact, that the

Egypt to which the Hellenes navigate, is a land annexed to the Egyptians, and a gift from the river; and that even in the parts above the lake

just mentioned, for three days' sail, concerning which the priests relate

nothing, the country is just of the same description.</q> Herod. ii. § 5.</note>

that the whole of Egypt was a gift from the river; or if not

the whole, at all events that part of it below the Delta, called

Lower Egypt. He had heard too that Pharos was entirely

surrounded by sea, and therefore misrepresented it as entirely

surrounded by the sea, although it had long ago ceased so to

be. Now the author of all this was Homer, and we therefore

infer that he was not ignorant concerning either the sources

or the mouths of the Nile.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They are again mistaken when they say that he was

not aware of the isthmus between the sea of Egypt and the

Arabian Gulf, and that his description is false,

Nevertheless he is correct, and the criticism of the moderns

is quite out of place: indeed, there is so little truth in the

assertion that Homer was ignorant of this isthmus, that I will

venture to affirm he was not only acquainted with it, but has

also accurately defined it. But none of the grammarians, not



<pb n="48"/>



even the chiefs of their number, Aristarchus and Crates, have

understood the words of our poet on this subject. For they

disagree as to the words which follow this expression of

Homer,



<cit><quote><lg>

</l><l>These eastward situate, those towards the west,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Odyssey i. 23.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey i. 23.</bibl></cit>



Aristarchus writing,



<quote><lg>

<l>These towards the west, and those towards the east,</l></lg></quote>



and Crates,



<quote><lg>

<l>As well in the west as also in the east.</l></lg></quote>



However, in regard to their hypotheses, it makes no difference

whether the passage were written this way or that. One of

them, in fact, takes what he considers the mathematical

view of the case, and says that the torrid zone is occupied by

the ocean,<note anchored="yes">Many ancient writers entertained the opinion that the regions surrounding the terrestrial equator were occupied by the ocean, which formed

a circular zone, separating our continent from that which they supposed

to exist in the southern hemisphere. To the inhabitants of this second

continent they gave the name of Antichthones.</note> and that on each side of this there is a temperate

zone, one inhabited by us and another opposite thereto. And

as we call the Ethiopians, who are situated to the south, and

dwell along the shores of the ocean, the most distant on the

face of the inhabited globe; so he supposed that on the other

side of the ocean,<note anchored="yes">The Southern Ocean.</note> there were certain Ethiopians dwelling

along the shores, who would in like manner be considered the

most distant<note anchored="yes">Or nearest to the equator.</note> by the inhabitants of the other temperate zone;

and thus that the Ethiopians were double, separated into two

divisions by the ocean. He adds, <q direct="unspecified">as well in the west as also

in the east,</q> because as the celestial zodiac always corresponds

to the terrestrial, and never exceeds in its obliquity the space

occupied by the two Ethiopias, the sun's entire course must

necessarily be within this space, and also his rising and setting,

as it appears to different nations according to the sign which

he may be in.
</p><p>He (Crates) adopted this version, because he considered it

the more astronomical. But it would have maintained his

opinion of the division of the Ethiopians into two parts, and



<pb n="49"/>



at the same time have been much more simple, had he said

that the Ethiopians dwelt on either side of the ocean from the

rising to the setting of the sun. In this case what difference

does it make whether we follow his version, or adopt the

reading of Aristarchus,



<quote><lg>

<l>These towards the west, and those towards the east?</l></lg></quote>



which also means, that whether east or west, on either side

of the ocean, Ethiopians dwell. But Aristarchus rejects this

hypothesis. He says, <q direct="unspecified">The Ethiopians with whom we are

acquainted, and who are farthest south from the Greeks,

are those described by the poet as being separated into two

divisions. But Ethiopia is not so separated as to form two

countries, one situated towards the west, the other towards

the east, but only one, that which lies south of the Greeks

and adjoins Egypt; but of this the poet was ignorant, as well

as of other matters enumerated by Apollodorus, which he has

falsely stated concerning various places in his second book,

containing the catalogue of the ships.</q>

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To refute Crates would require a lengthened argument, which here perhaps may be considered out of place.

Aristarchus we commend for rejecting the hypothesis of

Crates, which is open to many objections, and for referring

the expression of the poet to our Ethiopia. But the remainder of his statement we must discuss. First, his minute examination of the reading is altogether fruitless, for whichever

way it may have been written, his interpretation is equally

applicable to both; for what difference is there whether you

say thus—In our opinion there are two Ethiopias, one towards the east, the other to the west; or thus—For they

are as well towards the east as the west? Secondly, He

makes false assumptions. For admitting that the poet was

ignorant of the isthmus,<note anchored="yes">The isthmus of Suez.</note> and that he alludes to the Ethiopia

contiguous to Egypt, when he says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>The Ethiopians separated into two divisions;<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Odyssey i. 23.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey i. 23.</bibl></cit>



what then? Are they not separated into two divisions, and

could the poet have thus expressed himself if he had been in

ignorance? Is not Egypt, nay, are not the Egyptians, sepa-



<pb n="50"/>



rated into two divisions by the Nile from the Delta to Syene,<note anchored="yes">This explanation falls to the ground when we remember, that prior to

the reign of Psammeticus no stranger had ever succeeded in penetrating

into the interior of Egypt. This was the statement of the Greeks themselves. Now as Psammeticus did not flourish till two and a half centuries after Homer, that poet could not possibly have been aware of the

circumstances which Strabo brings forward to justify his interpretation

of this passage which he has undertaken to defend.</note>



<quote><lg>

<l>These towards the west, those towards the east?</l></lg></quote>



And what else is Egypt, with the exception of the island

formed by the river and overflowed by its waters; does it not

lie on either side of the river both east and west?
</p><p>Ethiopia runs in the same direction as Egypt, and resembles it both in its position with respect to the Nile, and

in its other geographical circumstances. It is narrow, long,

and subject to inundation; beyond the reach of this inundation it is desolate and parched, and unfitted for the habitation

of man; some districts lying to the east and some to the west

of [the river]. How then can we deny that it is separated into

two divisions? Shall the Nile, which is looked upon by some

people as the proper boundary line between Asia and Libya,<note anchored="yes">Africa.</note>

and which extends southward in length more than 10,000 stadia,

embracing in its breadth islands which contain populations of

above ten thousand men, the largest of these being Meroe, the

seat of empire and metropolis of the Ethiopians, be regarded

as too insignificant to divide Ethiopia into two parts? The

greatest obstacle which they who object to the river being

made the line of demarcation between the two continents are

able to allege, is, that Egypt and Ethiopia are by this means

divided, one part of each being assigned to Libya, and the

other to Asia, or, if this will not suit, the continents cannot

be divided at all, or at least not by the river.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But besides these there is another method of dividing

Ethiopia. All those who have sailed along the coasts of

Libya, whether starting from the Arabian Gulf,<note anchored="yes">The Red Sea.</note> or the

Pillars,<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Gibraltar.</note> after proceeding a certain distance, have been

obliged to turn back again on account of a variety of

accidents; and thus originated a general belief that it was

divided midway by some isthmus, although the whole of



<pb n="51"/>



the Atlantic Ocean is confluent, more especially towards

the south. Besides, all of these navigators called the final

country which they reached, Ethiopia, and described it

under that name. Is it therefore at all incredible, that

Homer, misled by such reports, separated them into two

divisions, one towards the east and the other west, not

knowing whether there were any intermediate countries

or not? But there is another ancient tradition related by

Ephorus, which Homer had probably fallen in with. He

tells us it is reported by the Tartessians,<note anchored="yes">The Tartessians were the inhabitants of the island of Tartessus, formed

by the two arms of the Bætis, (the present Guadalquiver,) near the mouth

of this river. One of these arms being now dried up, the island is reunited to the mainland. It forms part of the present district of Andalusia.

The tradition, says Gosselin, reported by Ephorus, seems to me to resemble that still preserved at Tingis, a city of Mauritania, so late as the sixth

century. Procopius (Vandalicor. ii. 10) relates that there were two

columns at Tingis bearing the following inscription in the Phœnician

language, <q direct="unspecified">We are they who fled before the brigand Joshua, the son of

Naue (Nun).</q> It does not concern us to inquire whether these columns

actually existed in the time of Procopius, but merely to remark two independent facts. The first is the tradition generally received for more

than twenty centuries, that the coming of the Israelites into Palestine

drove one body of Canaanites, its ancient inhabitants, to the extremities

of the Mediterranean, while another party went to establish, among the

savage tribes of the Peloponnesus and Attica, the earliest kingdoms known

in Europe. The second observation has reference to the name of Ethiopians given by Ephorus to this fugitive people, as confirming what we

have before stated, that the environs of Jaffa, and possibly the entire of

Palestine, anciently bore the name of Ethiopia: and it is here we must

leek for the Ethiopians of Homer, and not in the interior of Africa.</note> that some of the

Ethiopians, on their arrival in Libya,<note anchored="yes">Africa.</note> penetrated into the

extreme west, and settled down there, while the rest occupied

the greater part of the sea-coast; and in support of this statement he quotes the passage of Homer,



<quote>The Ethiopians, the farthest removed of men, separated into two divisions.</quote>



<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These and other more stringent arguments may be

urged against Aristarchus and those of his school, to clear

our poet from the charge of such gross ignorance. I assert

that the ancient Greeks, in the same way as they classed all

the northern nations with which they were familiar under the

one name of Scythians, or, according to Homer, Nomades, and



<pb n="52"/>



afterwards becoming acquainted with those towards the west,

styled them Kelts and Iberians; sometimes compounding the

names into Keltiberians, or Keltoscythians, thus ignorantly

uniting various distinct nations; so I affirm they designated

as Ethiopia the whole of the southern countries towards the

ocean. Of this there is evidence, for Æschylus, in the Pro-

metheus Loosed,<note anchored="yes">This piece is now lost.</note> thus speaks:



<quote>There [is] the sacred wave, and the coralled bed of the Erythræan

Sea, and [there] the luxuriant marsh of the Ethiopians, situated near

the ocean, glitters like polished brass; where daily in the soft and tepid

stream, the all-seeing sun bathes his undying self, and refreshes his weary

steeds.</quote>



And as the ocean holds the same position in respect to the

sun, and serves the same purpose throughout the whole southern region,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">to\ meshmbo|ino\n kli/ma.</foreign></note> he<note anchored="yes">Æschylus.</note> therefore concludes that the Ethiopians inhabited the whole of the region.
</p><p>And Euripides in his Phaeton<note anchored="yes">This piece is now lost.</note> says that Clymene was

given



<quote><lg>

<l>To Merops, sovereign of that land
</l><l>Which from his four-horsed chariot first
</l><l>The rising sun strikes with his golden rays;
</l><l>And which its swarthy neighbours call
</l><l>The radiant stable of the Morn and Sun.</l></lg></quote>



Here the poet merely describes them as the common stables

of the Morning and of the Sun; but further on he tells us

they were near to the dwellings of Merops, and in fact the

whole plot of the piece has reference to this. This does not

therefore refer alone to the [land] next to Egypt, but rather

to the whole southern country extending along the sea-coast.

<milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus likewise shows us the opinion of the ancients

respecting Ethiopia, in his Treatise on Europe. He says, <q direct="unspecified">If

the whole celestial and terrestrial globe were divided into

four parts, the Indians would possess that towards the east,

the Ethiopians towards the south, the Kelts towards the

west, and the Scythians towards the north.</q> He adds that

Ethiopia is larger than Scythia; for, says he, it appears that

the country of the Ethiopians extends from the rising to the

setting of the sun in winter; and Scythia is opposite to it.

we should take this in a general sense, and understand by it

those of Pisidia, but certain others merely imaginary, having

the same name, and bearing the like relation to the navigators in [Ulysses'] ship, and the southern inhabitants there

and the inhabitants of Egyptian Ethiopia. What he says

about the cranes must likewise be understood in a general

sense.

For it is not in Greece alone that the crane is observed to

emigrate to more southern regions, but likewise from Italy

and Iberia,<note anchored="yes">Gosselin is of opinion that this Iberia has no reference to Spain, but

is a country situated between the Euxine and Caspian Seas, and forms

part of the present Georgia. He assigns as his reason, that if Strabo had

meant to refer to Spain, he would have mentioned it before Italy, so as

not to interrupt the geographical order, which he is always careful to

observe.</note> from [the shores of] the Caspian, and from Bactriana. But since the ocean extends along the whole southern coast, and the cranes fly to all parts of it indiscriminately

at the approach of winter, we must likewise believe that the

Pygmies<note anchored="yes">Pygmy, (<foreign lang="greek">pugmai=os,</foreign>) a being whose length is a <foreign lang="greek">pugmh\,</foreign> that is, from the

elbow to the hand. The Pygmæi were a fabulous nation of dwarfs, the

Lilliputians of antiquity, who, according to Homer, had every spring to

sustain a war against the cranes on the banks of Oceanus. They were

believed to have been descended from Pygmræus, a son of Dorus and

grandson of Epaphus. Later writers usually place them near the sources

of the Nile, whither the cranes are said to have migrated every year

to take possession of the field of the Pygmies. The reports of them have

been embellished in a variety of ways by the ancients. Hecatæus, for

example, related that they cut down every corn-ear with an axe, for they

were conceived to be an agricultural people. When Hercules came into

their country, they climbed with ladders to the edge of his goblet to

drink from it; and when they attacked the hero, a whole army of them

made an assault upon his left hand, while two made the attack on his

right. Aristotle did not believe that the accounts of the Pygmies were

altogether fabulous, but thought that they were a tribe in Upper Egypt,

who had exceedingly small horses, and lived in caves. In later times we

also hear of Northern Pygmies, who lived in the neighbourhood of Thule:

they are described as very short-lived, small, and armed with spears like

needles. Lastly, we also have mention of Indian Pygmies, who lived

under the earth on the east of the river Ganges. Smith, Diet. Biog. and

Mythol. Various attempts have been made to account for this singular

belief, which however seems to have its only origin in the love of the

Marvellous.</note> were equally considered to inhabit the whole of it.



<pb n="55"/>



And if the moderns have confined the term of Ethiopians

to those only who dwell near to Egypt, and have also restricted the Pygmies in like manner, this must not be

allowed to interfere with the meaning of the ancients. We

do not speak of all the people who fought against Troy as

merely Achæans and Argives, though Homer describes the

whole under those two names. Similar to this is my remark

concerning the separation of the Ethiopians into two divisions, that under that designation we should understand the

whole of the nations inhabiting the sea-board from east to

west. The Ethiopians taken in this sense are naturally separated into two parts by the Arabian Gulf, which occupies

a considerable portion of a meridian circle,<note anchored="yes">It must be observed that the Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea, does not run

parallel to the equator, consequently it could not form any considerable part of a meridian circle; thus Strabo is wrong even as to the physical position of the Gulf, but this is not much to be wondered at, as he supposed

in equatorial division of the earth into two hemispheres by the ocean.</note> and resembles a

river, being in length nearly 15,000 stadia,<note anchored="yes">15,000 of the stadia employed by Strabo were equivalent to 21° 25′

Mandeb, following our better charts, is 20° 15′. Strabo says nearly 15,000

stadia; and this length may be considered just equal to that of the Arabian

Gulf. Its breadth, so far as we know, is in some places equal to <date value="1800">1800</date>

above 1000 at the widest point. In addition to the length,

the recess of the Gulf is distant from the sea at Pelusium only

three or four days' journey across the isthmus. On this account those who are most felicitous in their division of Asia

and Africa, prefer the Gulf<note anchored="yes">The Arabian Gulf, or Red Sea.</note> as a better boundary line for the

from sea to sea, whereas the Nile is so remote from the ocean

that it does not by any means divide the whole of Asia from

Africa. On this account I believe it was the Gulf which the

poet looked upon as dividing into two portions the whole

southern regions of the inhabited earth. Is it possible, then,

that he was unacquainted with the isthmus which separates

this Gulf from the Egyptian Sea?<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note>

measure of the coasts of the Delta furnished by that historian with our

actual information. The length of this stadium may likewise be ascertained by reference to Aristotle. In the time of Eratosthenes and Strabo,

the stadium of 700 to a degree was employed in Egypt. Now 6360 stadia of <date value="1111">1111</date> 1/9 to a degree make just 4006 stadia of 700: consequently

these two measures are identical, their apparent inconsistency merely resulting from the different scales by which preceding authors had expressed

them.</q> This reasoning seems very plausible, but we must remark that

Col. Leake, in a valuable paper <q direct="unspecified">On the Stade as a Linear Measure,</q>

there, whose breadth is not more than 1000 stadia. Still

more, would it not be ridiculous to believe that Homer was

aware the Nile was called by the same name as the vast country

[of Egypt], and yet unacquainted with the reason why?

especially since the saying of Herodotus would occur to him,

that the country was a gift from the river, and it ought there-

fore to bear its name. Further, the best known peculiarities

of a country are those which have something of the nature of

a paradox, and are likely to arrest general attention. Of this

kind are the rising of the Nile, and the alluvial deposition at its mouth. There is nothing in the whole country to

which travellers in Egypt so immediately direct their inquiries,

as the character of the Nile; nor do the inhabitants possess

any thing else equally wonderful and curious, of which to inform foreigners; for in fact, to give them a description of the

river, is to lay open to their view every main characteristic of

the country. It is the question put before every other by

those who have never seen Egypt themselves. To these considerations we must add Homer's thirst after knowledge, and

his delight in visiting foreign lands, (tastes which we are assured both by those who have written histories of his life, and

also by innumerable testimonies throughout his own poems,

he possessed in an eminent degree,) and we shall have abundant evidence both of the extent of his information, and the

felicity with which he described objects he deemed important,

and passed over altogether, or with slight allusion, matters

which were generally known.

becomes more excellent, when the title of <q direct="unspecified">heaven-sent</q> is

given to the Nile. The mountain torrent has a better claim

to be called heaven-sent than other rivers, but the Nile exceeds the mountain torrents, both in its size and the lengthened

period of its overflow. Since, then, the wonders of this river

were known to our poet, as we have shown in this defence,

when he applies this epithet to the Nile, it must only be understood in the way we have explained. Homer did not

think it worth mentioning, especially to those who were acquainted with the fact, that the Nile had many mouths, since

this is a common feature of numerous other rivers. Alcæus<note anchored="yes">Alcæus of Mitylene in the island of Lesbos, the earliest of the Æolian lyric poets, began to flourish in the forty-second Olympiad (B. C.

<date value="-610">610</date>). In the second year of this Olympiad we find Cicis and Antimenidas, the brothers of Alcæus, fighting under Pittacus against Melanchrus, who is described as the tyrant of Lesbos, and who fell in the conflict.

Alcæus does not appear to have taken part with his brothers on this occasion; on the contrary, he speaks of Melanchrus in terms of high praise.

Alcæus is mentioned in connexion with the war in Troas, between the

Athenians and Mitylenæans, for the possession of Sigæum. During the

period which followed this war, the contest between the nobles and the

people of Mitylene was brought to a crisis. The party of Alcæus engaged actively on the side of the nobles, and was defeated. When he and

his brother Antimenidas perceived that all hope of their restoration to

Mitylene was gone, they travelled over different countries. Alcæus visited

Egypt, and appears to have written poems in which his adventures by

sea were described. Horace, Carm. ii. 13. 26. See Smith's Diet. of

Biog. and Mythol.</note>

does not mention it, although he tells us he had been in

Egypt. One might infer the fact of its alluvial deposit, both

From the rising [of the river] and what Homer tells us concerning Pharos. For his account, or rather the vulgar report



<pb n="59"/>



concerning Pharos, that it was distant from the mainland a

whole day's voyage, ought not to be looked upon as a down-

right falsehood.
</p><p>It is clear that Homer was only acquainted with the rising

and deposit of the river in a general way, and concluding

from what he heard that the island had been further removed

in the time of Menelaus from the mainland, than it was in

his own, he magnified the distance, simply that he might

heighten the fiction. Fictions however are not the offspring

of ignorance, as is sufficiently plain from those concerning

Proteus, the Pygmies, the efficacy of charms, and many others

similar to these fabricated by the poets. They narrate these

things not through ignorance of the localities, but for the sake

of giving pleasure and enjoyment. But [some one may in-

quire], how could he describe [Pharos], which is without

water as possessed of that necessary?



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>The haven there is good, and many a ship

[I answer,] It is not impossible that the sources of water may

since have failed. Besides, he does not say that the water

was procured from the island, but that they went thither on

account of the safety of the harbour; the water was probably

obtained from the mainland, and by the expression the poet

seems to admit that what he had before said of its being

wholly surrounded by sea was not the actual fact, but a hyperbole or fiction.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As his description of the wanderings of Menelaus may

seem to authenticate the charge of ignorance made against

him in respect to those regions, it will perhaps be best to

point out the difficulties of the narrative, and their explanation, and at the same time enter into a fuller defence of our

poet. Menelaus thus addresses Telemachus, who is admiring

the splendour of his palace:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>After numerous toils
</l><l>And perilous wanderings o'er the stormy deep,

</p><p>It is asked, What Ethiopians could he have met with on

his voyage from Egypt? None are to be found dwelling by our

sea,<note anchored="yes">On the coasts of the Mediterranean.</note> and with his vessels<note anchored="yes">Strabo intends to say that the ships of Menelaus were not constructed

so as to be capable of being taken to pieces, and carried on the backs of

cataracts of the Nile. Next, who are the Sidonians? Certainly not the inhabitants of Phoenicia; for leaving mentioned

the genus, he would assuredly not particularize the species.<note anchored="yes">Having mentioned the Phœnicians, amongst whom the Sidonians are

comprised, he certainly would not have enumerated these latter as a

separate people.</note>

And then the Erembi; this is altogether a new name. Our

contemporary Aristonicus, the grammarian, in his [observations] on the wanderings of Menelaus, has recorded the

opinions of numerous writers on each of the heads under

discussion. It will be sufficient for us to refer to them

very briefly. They who assert that Menelaus went by sea to

Ethiopia, tell us he directed his course past Cadiz into the

Indian Ocean;<note anchored="yes">That is to say, that he made the entire circuit of Africa, starting

from Cadiz, and doubling the Cape of Good Hope. Such was the opinion

of Crates, who endeavoured to explain all the expressions of Homer after

mathematical hypotheses. If any one were to inquire how Menelaus, who

was wandering about the Mediterranean, could have come into Ethiopia,

Crates would answer, that Menelaus left the Mediterranean and entered

the Atlantic, whence he could easily travel by sea into Ethiopia. In

this he merely followed the hypothesis of the mathematicians, who said

that the inhabited earth in all its southern portion was traversed by the

Atlantic Ocean, and the other seas contiguous thereto.</note> with which, say they, the long duration of his

wanderings agrees, since he did not arrive there till the eighth

year. Others, that he passed through the isthmus<note anchored="yes">The Isthmus of Suez. This isthmus they supposed to be covered

by the sea, as Strabo explains further on.</note> which

enters the Arabian Gulf; and others again, through one of

the canals. At the same time the idea of this circumnavigation, which owes its origin to Crates, is not necessary; we do

not mean it was impossible, (for the wanderings of Ulysses are



<pb n="61"/>



not impossible,) but neither the mathematical hypothesis, not

yet the duration of the wandering, require such an explanation; for he was both retarded against his will by accidents

in the voyage, as by [the tempest] which he narrates five

only of his sixty ships survived; and also by voluntary delays

for the sake of amassing wealth. Nestor says [of him],



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Thus he, provision gathering as he went,
</l><l>And gold abundant, roam'd to distant lands.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>Thus far he, collecting much property and gold, wandered with his

</p><p>As to the navigation of the isthmus, or one of the canals,

if it had been related by Homer himself, we should have

counted it a myth; but as he does not relate it, we regard

it as entirely extravagant and unworthy of belief. We

say unworthy of belief, because at the time of the Trojan war

no canal was in existence. It is recorded that Sesostris, who

had planned the formation of one, apprehending that the level

of the sea was too high to admit of it, desisted from the undertaking.<note anchored="yes">Strabo here appears to have followed Aristotle, who attributes to Sesostris the construction of the first canal connecting the Mediterranean,

or rather the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, with the Red Sea. Pliny has

followed the same tradition. Strabo, Book xvii., informs us, that

other authors attribute the canal to Necho the son of Psammeticus; and

this is the opinion of Herodotus and Diodorus. It is possible these authors may be speaking of two different attempts to cut this canal. Sesostris flourished about <date value="1356">1356</date> years before Christ, Necho 615 years before the

same era. About a century after Necho, Darius the son of Hystaspes

made the undertaking, but desisted under the false impression that the

level of the Red Sea was higher than that of the Mediterranean. Ptolemy

Philadelphus proved this to be an error, by uniting the Red Sea to the

Nile without causing any inundation. At the time of Trojan and Hadrian

the communication was still in existence, though subsequently it became

choked up by an accumulation of sand. It will be remembered that a

recent proposition for opening the canal was opposed in Egypt on similar

grounds.</note>
</p><p>Moreover the isthmus itself was not passable for ships, and

Eratosthenes is unfortunate in his conjecture, for he considers that the strait at the Pillars was not then formed,



<pb n="62"/>



so that the Atlantic should by that channel communicate

with the Mediterranean, and that this sea being higher

than the Isthmus [of Suez], covered it; but when the Strait

[of Gibraltar] was formed, the sea subsided considerably; and

left the land about Casium<note anchored="yes">Mount El Kas.</note> and Pelusium<note anchored="yes">Tineh.</note> dry as far over

as the Red Sea.
</p><p>But what account have we of the formation of this strait,

supposing it were not in existence prior to the Trojan war?

Is it likely that our poet would make Ulysses sail out through

the Strait [of Gibraltar] into the Atlantic Ocean, as if that

strait already existed, and at the same time describe Menelaus conducting his ships from Egypt to the Red Sea, as if it

did not exist. Further, the poet introduces Proteus as saying to him,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Thee the gods
</l><l>Have destined to the blest Elysian Isles,
</l><l>Earth's utmost boundaries.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But the immortals will send you to the Elysian plain, and the boundaries of the earth. </quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 563.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 563.</bibl></cit>



And what this place was, namely, some far western region,

is evident from [the mention of] the Zephyr in connexion

with it:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>But Zephyr always gently from the sea
</l><l>Breathes on them.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But ever does the ocean send forth the gently blowing breezes of the

west wind. </quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 567.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 567.</bibl></cit>



This, however, is very enigmatical.

<milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But if our poet speaks of the Isthmus of Suez as ever

having been the strait of confluence between the Mediterranean and the Red Seas, how much more credit may we attribute to his division of the Ethiopians into two portions, being

thus separated by so grand a strait! And what commerce

could he have carried on with the Ethiopians who dwelt by

the shores of the exterior sea and the ocean? Telemachus

and his companions admire the multitude of ornaments that

were in the palace,

part a needy and nomad race. True, [you say,] but adjoining them is Arabia, and the whole country as far as India.

One of these is distinguished above all other lands by the

title of Felix,<note anchored="yes">Blessed.</note> and the other, though not dignified by that

name, is both generally believed and also said to be preeminently Blessed.
</p><p>But [we reply], Homer was not acquainted with India, or

he would have described it. And though he knew of the

Arabia which is now named Felix, at that time it was by no

means wealthy, but a wild country, the inhabitants of which

dwelt for the most part in tents. It is only a small district

which produces the aromatics from which the whole territory

afterwards received its name,<note anchored="yes">The name of Arabia Felix is now confined to Yemen. A much

larger territory was anciently comprehended under this designation, containing the whole of Hedjaz, and even Nedjed-el-Ared. It is probable

that Strabo here speaks of Hedjaz, situated about two days' journey

south of Mecca.</note> owing to the rarity of the commodity amongst us, and the value set upon it. That the

Arabians are now flourishing and wealthy is due to their vast

and extended traffic, but formerly it does not appear to have

been considerable. A merchant or camel-driver might attain

to opulence by the sale of these aromatics and similar commodities; but Menelaus could only become so either by plunder, or presents conferred on him by kings and nobles, who

had the means at their disposal, and wished to gratify one so

distinguished by glory and renown. The Egyptians, it is

true, and the neighbouring Ethiopians and Arabians, were

not so entirely destitute of the luxuries of civilization, nor so

unacquainted with the fame of Agamemnon, especially after the

termination of the Trojan war, but that Menelaus might have

expected some benefits from their generosity, even as the

breastplate of Agamemnon is said to be

and by violence, and especially by the plunder of those who had

been the allies of Troy. They however who dwelt on the exterior ocean, and the distant barbarians, held out no such encouragement: and when Menelaus is said to have been in

Ethiopia, it is because he had reached the frontiers of that country next Egypt. But perhaps at that time the frontiers lay more

contiguous to Thebes than they do now. At the present day the

nearest are the districts adjacent to Syene and Philæ,<note anchored="yes">Philæ was built on a little island formed by the Nile, now called El-Heif.</note> the former

town being entirely in Egypt, while Philæ is inhabited by a

therefore he had arrived at Thebes, and thus reached the

boundary-line of Ethiopia, where he experienced the munificence of the king, we must not be surprised if he is described

as having passed through the country.<note anchored="yes">This is evidently Strabo's meaning; but the text, as it now stands,

visited those places. In the same manner Menelaus is said

to have been to Ethiopia and Libya, because here and there

Posidonius seems to me to adopt the better plan after all, in

looking for the etymology of names in nations of one stock and

community; thus between the Armenians, Syrians, and Arabians there is a strong affinity both in regard to dialect, mode

of life, peculiarities of physical conformation, and above all

in the contiguity of the countries. Mesopotamia, which is a

motley of the three nations, is a proof of this; for the similarity amongst these three is very remarkable. And though in

is that by which the Greeks anciently designated the Arabs;

the etymon of the word certainly strengthens the idea. Many

deduce the etymology of the Erembi from <foreign lang="greek">e)/ran e)m&lt;*&gt;ai/nein,</foreign> (to go

into the earth,) which [they say] was altered by the people of a

later generation into the more intelligible name of Troglodytes,<note anchored="yes">Dwelling in caverns.</note>

by which are intended those Arabs who dwell on that side of

the Arabian Gulf next to Egypt and Ethiopia. It is probable

then that the poet describes Menelaus as having visited these

people in the same way that he says he visited the Ethiopians;

for they are likewise near to the Thebaid; and he mentions them

not on account of any commerce or gain, (for of these there

was not much,) but probably to enhance the length of the

journey and his meed of praise: for such distant travelling

was highly thought of. For example,—

<p>There are many who would make the Erembi a tribe

with little trust; since their opinion is not only incredible,

different characters of history and fable. In the same category

must be reckoned those who place the Sidonians and Phœnicians in the Persian Gulf, or somewhere else in the Ocean, and

make the wanderings of Menelaus to have happened there.

Not the least cause for mistrusting these writers is the manner in which they contradict each other. One half would have

us believe that the Sidonians are a colony from the people

whom they describe as located on the shores of the [Indian]

Ocean, and who they say were called Phoenicians from the

colour of the Erythræan Sea, while the others declare the

opposite.<note anchored="yes">That is, that the Phœnicians and Sidonians dwelling around the Persian Gulf are colonies from those inhabiting the shores of the Mediterranean.</note>

and this not from any ignorance of the topography of those

places, but by a kind of mythic fiction similar to those of

Hesiod and other writers censured by Apollodorus, who, however, couples Homer with them, without, as it appears, any

cause. He cites as instances what Homer relates of the

Euxine and Egypt, and accuses him of ignorance for pretending to speak the actual truth, and then recounting fable, all the

while ignorantly mistaking it for fact. Will anyone then accuse

Hesiod of ignorance on account of his <emph rend="ital">Hemicynes,</emph><note anchored="yes">Half men, half dogs.</note> his <emph rend="ital">Macro-</emph>

prose writers, and in works bearing the appearance of veritable history, we frequently meet with similar narrations, and

that without any admission of their having inserted such

myths. Indeed it becomes immediately evident that they

have woven together a tissue of myths not through ignorance



<pb n="69"/>



of the real facts, but merely to amuse by a deceptive narration of the impossible and marvellous. If they appear to do

this in ignorance, it is because they can romance more frequently and with greater plausibility on those things which

are uncertain and unknown. This Theopompus plainly confesses in the announcement of his intention to relate the fables

in his history in a better style than Herodotus, Ctesias, Hellanicus, and those who had written on the affairs of India.

<milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Homer has described to us the phenomena of the ocean

under the form of a myth; this [art] is very desirable in a

poet; the idea of his Charybdis was taken from the ebb

and flow of the tide, and was by no means a pure invention of his own, but derived from what he knew concerning

the Strait of Sicily.<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Messina.</note> And although he states that the ebb

and flow occurred thrice during the four and twenty hours,

instead of twice,

we must suppose that he said this not through any ignorance

of the fact, but for tragic effect, and to excite the fear which

Circe endeavours to infuse into her arguments to deter

Ulysses from departing, even at a little expense of truth.

The following is the language Circe makes use of in her

speech to him:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Each day she thrice disgorges, and each day
</l><l>Thrice swallows it. Ah! well-forewarn'd beware
</l><l>What time she swallows, that thou come not nigh,

And yet when Ulysses was ingulfed in the eddy he was not

lost. He tells us himself,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>'It was the time when she absorb'd profound
</l><l>The briny flood, but by a wave upborne,
</l><l>I seized the branches fast of the wild fig,

<pb n="70"/>



And then having waited for the timbers of the wreck he seized

hold of them, and thus saved himself. Circe, therefore, had

exaggerated both the peril, and also the fact of its vomiting

forth thrice a day instead of twice. However, this latter is a

hyperbole which every one makes use of; thus we say thrice-

happy and thrice-miserable.
</p><p>So the poet,

Any one, too, might conclude from the passage itself that

Homer even here hinted at the truth, for the long time which

the remains of the wreck lay under water, which Ulysses, who

was all the while hanging suspended to the branches, so anxiously desired to rise, accords much better with the ebb and

flow taking place but twice during the night and day instead

of thrice.

wreck would not have appeared likely, if he had brought it

back again with the return of the wave, before it had been

first carried a long way off.

<p>Apollodorus, who agrees with Eratosthenes, throws

much blame upon Callimachus for asserting, in spite of his

character as a grammarian, that Gaudus<note anchored="yes">Gaudus, the little island of Gozo near Malta, supposed by Callimachus to have been the Isle of Calypso.</note> and Corcyra<note anchored="yes">It seems more probable that Callimachus intended the island of Corsura, now Pantalaria, a small island between Africa and Sicily.</note> were

among the scenes of Ulysses' wandering, such an opinion

being altogether in defiance of Homer's statement, and his description of the places as situated in the exterior ocean.<note anchored="yes">The Atlantic.</note>
</p><p>This criticism is just if we suppose the wandering to have

never actually occurred, and to be merely the result of Homer's imagination; but if it did take place, although in other

regions, Apollodorus ought plainly to have stated which they

were, and thus set right the mistake of Callimachus. Since,

however, after such evidence as we have produced, we cannot

believe the whole account to be a fiction, and since no other more

likely places have as yet been named, we hold that the grammarian is absolved from blame.

<milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Demetrius of Skepsis is also wrong, and, in fact, the

cause of some of the mistakes of Apollodorus. He eagerly

objects to the statement of Neanthes of Cyzicus, that the

Argonauts, when they sailed to the Phasis,<note anchored="yes">A river of Colchis, <emph rend="ital">hodie</emph> Fasz or Rion.</note> founded at

Cyzicus the temples of the Idæan Mother.<note anchored="yes">Cybele, so named because she had a temple on Mount Ida.</note> Though their

voyage is attested both by Homer and other writers, he

denies that Homer had any knowledge whatever of the departure of Jason to the Phasis. In so doing, he not only

contradicts the very words of Homer, but even his own assertions. The poet informs us that Achilles, having ravaged

Lesbos<note anchored="yes">An island in the Ægæan, now Meteline.</note> and other districts, spared Lemnos<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Hodie</emph> Lemno or Stalimene.</note> and the adjoining

islands, on account of his relationship with Jason and his son

Euneos,<note anchored="yes">Euneos was the eldest of the children which Hypsipele, daughter of

Thoas, king of Lemnos, had by Jason during his stay in that island.</note> who then had possession of the island. How should

he know of a relationship, identity of race, or other connexion existing between Achilles and Jason, which, after all,

was nothing else than that they were both Thessalians, one

being of Iolcos,<note anchored="yes">A town situated at the bottom of the Pelasgic Gulf, <emph rend="ital">hodie</emph> Volo.</note> the other of the Achæan Pthiotis,<note anchored="yes">A country of Thessaly, which received its designation of Achæan

<pb n="72"/>



was not aware how it happened that Jason, who was a Thes-

salian of Iolcos, should leave no descendants in the land of his

nativity, but establish his son as ruler of Lemnos? Homer

then was familiar with the history of Pelias and the daughters

of Pelias, of Alcestis, who was the most charming of them

all, and of her son

and was yet ignorant of all that befell Jason, and Argo, and

the Argonauts, matters on the actual occurrence of which all

the world is agreed. The tale then of their voyage in the

ocean from Æeta, was a mere fiction, for which he had no

authority in history.

<milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
<p>If, however, the expedition to the Phasis, fitted out by

Pelias, its return, and the conquest of several islands, have at

the bottom any truth whatever, as all say they have, so also

has the account of their wanderings, no less than those of

Ulysses and Menelaus; monuments of the actual occurrence

of which remain to this day elsewhere than in the writings of

Homer. The city of Æa, close by the Phasis, is still pointed

Out Æetes is generally believed to have reigned in Colchis,

the name is still common throughout the country, tales of the

sorceress Medea are yet abroad, and the riches of the country

in gold, silver, and iron, proclaim the motive of Jason's expedition, as well as of that which Phrixus had formerly undertaken. Traces both of one and the other still remain.

Such is Phrixium,<note anchored="yes">Named Ideessa in the time of Strabo. Strabo, book xi. c. ii. § 18.</note> midway between Colchis and Iberia, and

the Jasonia, or towns of Jason, which are every where met

with in Armenia, Media, and the surrounding countries.

Many are the witnesses to the reality of the expeditions of

Jason and Phrixus at Sinope<note anchored="yes">Sinub.</note> and its shore, at Propontis, at the

Hellespont, and even at Lemnos. Of Jason and his Colchian

followers there are traces even as far as Crete,<note anchored="yes">Candia.</note> Italy, and the

Adriatic. Callimachus himself alludes to it where he says,

</p><p>Some writers assert that Jason and his companions sailed

high up the Ister, others say he sailed only so far as to be

able to gain the Adriatic: the first statement results altogether

from ignorance; the second, which supposes there is a second

<p>Starting from these premises, the poet, in conformity

both with general custom and his own practice, narrates some

circumstances as they actually occurred, and paints others in

the colours of fiction. He follows history when he tells us of

Æetes and Jason also, when he talks of Argo, and on the authority of [the actual city of Æa], feigns his city of Ææa,

when he settles Euneos in Lemnos, and makes that island

friendly to Achilles, and when, in imitation of Medea, he makes

the sorceress Circe

he adds the fiction of the entrance of the Argonauts into the

exterior ocean as the sequel to their wanderings on their return home. Here, supposing the previous statements admitted, the truth of the phrase <q direct="unspecified">the renowned Argo,</q><note anchored="yes">Odyssey xii. 70.</note> is evident,

since, in that case, the expedition was directed to a populous

and well-known country. But if, as [Demetrius] of Skepsis asserts, on the authority of Mimnermus, Æetes dwelt by

the Ocean, and Jason was sent thither far east by Pelias,

to bring back the fleece, it neither seems probable that such

an expedition would have been undertaken into unknown and

obscure countries after the Fleece, nor could a voyage to

lands desert, uninhabited, and so far remote from us, be considered either glorious or renowned.

<p>ERATOSTHENES is guilty of another fault in so frequently referring to the works of men beneath his notice,

sometimes for the purpose of refuting them; at others,

when he agrees with them, in order to cite them as authorities. I allude to Damastes, and such as him, who even when

they speak the truth, are utterly unworthy of being appealed

to as authorities, or vouchers for the credibility of a statement.

For such purposes the writings of trustworthy men should only

be employed, who have accurately described much; and though

perhaps they may have omitted many points altogether, and

barely touched on others, are yet never guilty of wilfully falsifying their statements. To cite Damastes as an authority is

little better than to quote the Bergæan,<note anchored="yes">Antiphanes of Berga, a city of Thrace. This writer was so noted for

himself sneers at for their absurdities. Why, he even points

out as one of the follies of this Damastes, his observation that

the Arabian Gulf was a lake;<note anchored="yes">Thirty years before the time of this Damastes, Herodotus had demonstrated to the Greeks the real nature of the Arabian Gulf.</note> likewise the statement that

Diotimus, the son of Strombicus and chief of the Athenian

legation, sailed through Cilicia up the Cydnus<note anchored="yes">This river, called by the Turks Kara-sui, rises somewhere in Mount

Choaspes,<note anchored="yes">The Ab-Zal of oriental writers.</note> which flows by Susa,<note anchored="yes">The ancient capital of the kings of Persia, now Schuss.</note> and so arrived at that capital

after forty days' journey. This particular he professes to state

wonder whether the Cydnus could actually cross the Euphrates

and Tigris in order to disgorge itself into the Choaspes.<note anchored="yes">The very idea that Diotimus could sail from the Cydnus into the Euphrates is most absurd, since, besides the distance between the two rivers, they are separated by lofty mountain-ridges.</note>

<p>However, this is not all we have to say against him.

Of many places he tells us that nothing is known, when

in fact they have every one been accurately described. Then

he warns us to be very cautious in believing what we are

told on such matters, and endeavours by long and tedious

arguments to show the value of his advice; swallowing at

the same time the most ridiculous absurdities himself concerning the Euxine and Adriatic. Thus he believed the

Bay of Issus<note anchored="yes">Now the Bay of Ajazzo.</note> to be the most easterly point of the Mediterranean, though Dioscurias,<note anchored="yes">Iskuriah.</note> which is nearly at the bottom of the

Pontus Euxinus, is, according to his own calculations, farther

east by a distance of 3000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin justly remarks that this is a mere disputing about terms,

since, though it is true the Mediterranean and Euxine flow into each

other, it is fully admissible to describe them as separate. The same authority proves that we ought to read 3600 and not 3000 stadia, which he

supposes to be a transcriber's error.</note> In describing the northern

and farther parts of the Adriatic he cannot refrain from similar romancing, and gives credit to many strange narrations

concerning what lies beyond the Pillars of Hercules, informing us of an Isle of Kerne there, and other places now nowhere to be found, which we shall speak of presently.

Jason, who leaving his vessels at Colchis penetrated into Armenia and Media on foot, he proceeds to tell us that formerly

no one dared to navigate either the Euxine or the seas by

Libya, Syria, and Cilicia. If by <emph rend="ital">formerly</emph> he means periods so long past that we possess no record of them, it is of

little consequence to us whether they navigated those seas or

not, but if [he speaks] of times of which we know any thing,

to have made longer journeys both by sea and land than their

successors; witness Bacchus, Hercules, nay Jason himself,

not merely of the habitable earth, an account of which would

have been very suitable, but of the whole earth, which should

certainly have been given too, but not in this disorderly manner. He proceeds to tell us that the earth is spheroidal, not

occasioned by water, fire, earthquakes, eruptions, and the

like; all of which is entirely out of place, for the spheroidal

form of the whole earth is the result of the system of the universe, and the phenomena which he mentions do not in the

formerly been where the land now was. Strato, who went more

deeply into the causes of these phenomena, was of opinion that

formerly there was no exit to the Euxine as now at Byzantium, but that the rivers running into it had forced a way

through, and thus let the waters escape into the Propontis,

and thence to the Hellespont.<note anchored="yes">The Strait of the Dardanelles.</note> And that a like change had

occurred in the Mediterranean. For the sea being overflowed

by the rivers, had opened for itself a passage by the Pillars of

Hercules, and thus, much that was formerly covered by water,

had been left dry.<note anchored="yes">At the time of Diodorus Siculus, the people of the Isle of Samothracia preserved the tradition of an inundation caused by a sudden rising of the waters of the Mediterranean, which compelled the inhabitants

to fly for refuge to the summits of the mountains; and long after, the

fishermen's nets used to be caught by columns, which, prior to the catastrophe, had adorned their edifices. It is said that the inundation originated in a rupture of the chain of mountains which enclosed the valley which

has since become the Thracian Bosphorus or Strait of Constantinople,

through which the waters of the Black Sea flow into the Mediterranean.
</note> He gives as the cause of this, that anciently the levels of the Mediterranean and Atlantic were not

the same, and states that a bank of earth, the remains of

the ancient separation of the two seas, is still stretched under

water from Europe to Africa. He adds, that the Euxine is

the most shallow, and the seas of Crete, Sicily, and Sardinia

much deeper, which is occasioned by the number of large



<pb n="79"/>



rivers flowing into the Euxine both from the north and east,

and so filling it up with mud, whilst the others preserve their

depth. This is the cause of the remarkable sweetness of the

Euxine Sea, and of the currents which regularly set towards the

deepest part. He gives it as his opinion, that should the rivers

continue to flow in the same direction, the Euxine will in time

be filled up [by the deposits], since already the left side of the

sea is little else than shallows, as also Salmydessus,<note anchored="yes">Now Midjeh, in Roumelia, on the borders of the Black Sea. Strabo

alludes rather to the banks surrounding Salmydessus than to the town

itself.</note> and the

shoals at the mouth of the Ister, and the desert of Scythia,<note anchored="yes">The part of Bulgaria next the sea, between Varna and the Danube,

now Dobrudzie.</note>

which the sailors call the Breasts. Probably too the temple of

Ammon was originally close to the sea, though now, by the continual deposit of the waters, it is quite inland: and he conjectures that it was owing to its being so near the sea that it became so celebrated and illustrious, and that it never would have

enjoyed the credit it now possesses had it always been equally

remote from the sea. Egypt too [he says] was formerly

covered by sea as far as the marshes near Pelusium,<note anchored="yes">Tineh.</note> Mount

Casius,<note anchored="yes">El-Kas.</note> and the Lake Sirbonis.<note anchored="yes">Lake Sebaket-Bardoil.</note> Even at the present time,

when salt is being dug in Egypt, the beds are found under

layers of sand and mingled with fossil shells, as if this district

had formerly been under water, and as if the whole region

about Casium and Gerrha<note anchored="yes">Probably the present Maseli. Most likely the place was so named

from the <foreign lang="greek">ge/r)r(a,</foreign> or wattled huts, of the troops stationed there to prevent

the ingress of foreign armies into Egypt.</note> had been shallows reaching to the

Arabian Gulf. The sea afterwards receding left the land uncovered, and the Lake Sirbonis remained, which having afterwards forced itself a passage, became a marsh. In like

manner the borders of the Lake Mœris resemble a sea-beach

rather than the banks of a river. Every one will admit that

formerly at various periods a great portion of the mainland

has been covered and again left bare by the sea. Likewise

that the land now covered by the sea is not all on the same

level, any more than that whereon we dwell; which is now



<pb n="80"/>



uncovered and has experienced so many changes, as Eratosthenes has observed. Consequently in the reasoning of Xanthus there does not appear to be any thing out of place.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In regard to Strato, however, we must remark that,

leaving out of the question the many arguments he has properly stated, some of those which he has brought forward are

quite inadmissible. For first he is inaccurate in stating that

the beds of the interior and the exterior seas have not the

same level, and that the depth of those two seas is different:

whereas the cause why the sea is at one time raised, at another depressed, that it inundates certain places and again

retreats, is not that the beds have different levels, some

higher and some lower, but simply this, that the same beds

are at one time raised, at another depressed, causing the sea

to rise or subside with them; for having risen they cause

an inundation, and when they subside the waters return to

their former places. For if it is so, an inundation will of

course accompany every sudden increase of the waters of

the sea, [as in the spring-tides,] or the periodical swelling

of rivers, in the one instance the waters being brought together from distant parts of the ocean, in the other, their

volume being increased. But the risings of rivers are not

violent and sudden, nor do the tides continue any length of

time, nor occur irregularly; nor yet along the coasts of our

sea do they cause inundations, nor any where else. Consequently we must seek for an explanation of the cause

either in the stratum composing the bed of the sea, or in that

which is overflowed; we prefer to look for it in the former,

since by reason of its humidity it is more liable to shiftings

and sudden changes of position, and we shall find that in these

matters the wind is the great agent after all. But, I repeat

it, the immediate cause of these phenomena, is not in the fact

of one part of the bed of the ocean being higher or lower than

another, but in the upheaving or depression of the strata on

which the waters rest. Strato's hypothesis evidently originated

in the belief that that which occurs in rivers is also the case in

regard to the sea; viz. that there is a flow of water from the

higher places. Otherwise he would not have attempted to account for the current he observed at the Strait of Byzantium in

the manner he does, attributing it to the bed of the Euxine being



<pb n="81"/>



higher than that of the Propontis and adjoining ocean, and

even attempting to explain the cause thereof: viz. that the

bed of the Euxine is filled up and choked by the deposit of

the rivers which flow into it; and its waters in consequence

driven out into the neighbouring sea. The same theory he

would apply in respect to the Mediterranean and Atlantic,

alleging that the bed of the former is higher than that of the

latter, in consequence of the number of rivers which flow into

it, and the alluvium they carry along with them. In that case

there ought to be a like influx at the Pillars and Calpe,<note anchored="yes">This city of Calpe was near Mount Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules.</note> as

there is at Byzantium. But I waive this objection, as it might

be asserted that the influx was the same in both places, but

owing to the interference of the ebb and flow of the sea, became imperceptible.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>I rather make this inquiry:—If there were any reason

why, before the outlet was opened at Byzantium, the bed of the

Euxine (being deeper than either that of the Propontis<note anchored="yes">Sea of Marmora.</note> or of

the adjoining sea<note anchored="yes">The Ægæan.</note>) should not gradually have become more

shallow by the deposit of the rivers which flow into it, allowing it formerly either to have been a sea, or merely a vast

lake greater than the Palus Mæotis? This proposition being

conceded, I would next ask, whether before this the bed of

the Euxine would not have been brought to the same level as

the Propontis, and in that case, the pressure being counterpoised, the overflowing of the water have been thus avoided;

and if after the Euxine had been filled up, the superfluous waters

would not naturally have forced a passage and flowed off, and

by their commingling and power have caused the Euxine and

Propontis to flow into each other, and thus become one sea?

no matter, as I said above, whether formerly it were a sea or a

lake, though latterly certainly a sea. This also being conceded,

they must allow that the present efflux depends neither upon

the elevation nor the inclination of the bed, as Strato's theory

would have us consider it.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We would apply the same arguments to the whole of the

Mediterranean and Atlantic, and account for the efflux of the

former, not by any [supposed] difference between the elevation

and inclination of its bed and of that of the Atlantic, but at-



<pb n="82"/>



tribute it to the number of rivers which empty themselves into

it. Since, according to this supposition, it is not incredible that,

had the whole of the Mediterranean Sea in times past been but

a lake filled by the rivers, and having overflowed, it might have

broken through the Strait at the Pillars, as through a cataract;

and still continuing to swell more and more, the Atlantic in

course of time would have become confluent by that channel,

and have run into one level, the Mediterranean thus becoming

a sea. In fine, the Physician did wrong in comparing the sea

to rivers, for the latter are borne down as a descending stream,

but the sea always maintains its level. The currents of

straits depend upon other causes, not upon the accumulation

of earth formed by the alluvial deposit from rivers, filling up

the bed of the sea. This accumulation only goes on at the

mouths of rivers. Such are what are called the Stethe or

Breasts at the mouth of the Ister,<note anchored="yes">Danube.</note> the desert of the Scythians,

and Salmydessus, which are partially occasioned by other

winter-torrents as well; witness the sandy, low, and even coast

of Colchis,<note anchored="yes">Mingrelia.</note> at the mouth of the Phasis,<note anchored="yes">The river Fasz.</note> the whole of the coast

of Themiscyra,<note anchored="yes">Now Djanik.</note> named the plain of the Amazons, near the

mouths of the Thermodon<note anchored="yes">The river Thermeh.</note> and Iris,<note anchored="yes">The Jekil-Irmak.</note> and the greater part of

Sidene.<note anchored="yes">Sidin, or Valisa, is comprised in the territory of Djanik, being part of

the ancient kingdom of Pontus.</note> It is the same with other rivers, they all resemble

the Nile in forming an alluvial deposit at their mouths, some

more, some less than others. Those rivers which carry but

little soil with them deposit least, while others, which traverse

an extended and soft country, and receive many torrents in

their course, deposit the greatest quantity. Such for example

is the river Pyramus,<note anchored="yes">The river Geihun.</note> by which Cilicia has been considerably

augmented, and concerning which an oracle has declared, <q direct="unspecified">This

shall occur when the wide waters of the Pyramus have enlarged

their banks as far as sacred Cyprus.</q><note anchored="yes">Gosselin remarks that the alluvial deposit of this river is now no

Cilicia<note anchored="yes">Cilicia and Cataonia are comprised in the modern Aladeuli.</note> by the defiles of the Taurus, discharges itself into the

sea which flows between that country and the island of Cyprus.



<pb n="83"/>



<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These river deposits are prevented from advancing further into the sea by the regularity of the ebb and flow, which

continually drive them back. For after the manner of living

creatures, which go on inhaling and exhaling their breath continually, so the sea in a like way keeps up a constant motion

in and out of itself. Any one may observe who stands on the

sea-shore when the waves are in motion, the regularity with

which they cover, then leave bare, and then again cover up

his feet. This agitation of the sea produces a continual movement on its surface, which even when it is most tranquil has

considerable force, and so throws all extraneous matters on

to the land, and

<l>Flings forth the salt weed on the shore.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Iliad ix. 7.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad ix. 7.</bibl></cit>



This effect is certainly most considerable when the wind is on

the water, but it continues when all is hushed, and even when

it blows from land the swell is still carried to the shore against

the wind, as if by a peculiar motion of the sea itself. To this

the verses refer—

<p>The wave, as it advances, possesses a kind of power,

which some call the purging of the sea, to eject all foreign

substances. It is by this force that dead bodies and wrecks

are cast on shore. But on retiring it does not possess sufficient power to carry back into the sea either dead bodies,

wood, or even the lightest substances, such as cork, which

may have been cast out by the waves. And by this means

when places next the sea fall down, being undermined by the

wave, the earth and the water charged with it are cast back

again; and the weight [of the mud] working at the same

time in conjunction with the force of the advancing tide, it is

the sooner brought to settle at the bottom, instead of being



<pb n="84"/>



carried out far into the sea. The force of the river current

ceases at a very little distance beyond its mouth. Otherwise,

supposing the rivers had an uninterrupted flow, by degrees

the whole ocean would be filled in from the beach onwards, by the alluvial deposits. And this would be inevitable

even were the Euxine deeper than the sea of Sardinia, than

which a deeper sea has never been sounded, measuring, as it

does, according to Posidonius, about 1000 fathoms.<note anchored="yes">The word <foreign lang="greek">o)/rguia,</foreign> here rendered fathoms, strictly means the length

of the outstretched arms. As a measure of length it equals four <foreign lang="greek">ph/xeis,</foreign>

or six feet one inch. Gosselin seems to doubt with reason whether they

ever sounded such a depth as this would give, and proposes to compute

it by a smaller stadium in use at the time of Herodotus, which would

have the effect of diminishing the depth by almost one half.</note>

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some, however, may be disinclined to admit this explanation, and would rather have proof from things more

manifest to the senses, and which seem to meet us at every

turn. Now deluges, earthquakes, eruptions of wind, and

risings in the bed of the sea, these things cause the rising

of the ocean, as sinking of the bottom causes it to become

lower. It is not the case that small volcanic or other islands

can be raised up from the sea, and not large ones, nor that

all islands can, but not continents, since extensive sinkings

of the land no less than small ones have been known;

witness the yawning of those chasms which have ingulfed

whole districts no less than their cities, as is said to have

happened to Bura,<note anchored="yes">A city of Achaia near to the Gulf of Corinth. Pliny tells us it was

submerged during an earthquake, about 371 years before the Christian

who places it about 40 stadia from the sea, it was only partially demolished.</note> and many other towns at the

time of earthquakes: and there is no more reason why one

should rather think Sicily to have been disjoined from the

<p>However, so nice a fellow is Eratosthenes, that though



<pb n="85"/>



he professes himself a mathematician,<note anchored="yes">We have here followed the earlier editions, as preferable to Kramer,

who supplies <foreign lang="greek">mh\</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">maqhmstiko\s.</foreign></note> he rejects entirely the

dictum of Archimedes, who, in his work <q direct="unspecified">On Bodies in Suspension,</q> says that all liquids when left at rest assume a spherical

form, having a centre of gravity similar to that of the earth.

A dictum which is acknowledged by all who have the slightest pretensions to mathematical sagacity. He says that the

Mediterranean, which, according to his own description, is one

entire sea, has not the same level even at points quite close

to each other; and offers us the authority of engineers for

this piece of folly, notwithstanding the affirmation of mathematicians that engineering is itself only one division of the

mathematics. He tells us that Demetrius<note anchored="yes">Demetrius Poliorcetes: the same intention is narrated by Pliny and

other historians of Julius Cæsar, Caligula, and Nero.</note> intended to cut

through the Isthmus of Corinth, to open a passage for his

fleet, but was prevented by his engineers, who, having taken

measurements, reported that the level of the sea at the Gulf

of Corinth was higher than at Cenchrea,<note anchored="yes">Kankri.</note> so that if he cut

through the isthmus, not only the coasts near Ægina, but

even Ægina itself, with the neighbouring islands, would be

laid completely under water, while the passage would prove

of little value. According to Eratosthenes, it is this which

occasions the current in straits, especially the current in the

Strait of Sicily,<note anchored="yes">Strait of Messina.</note> where effects similar to the flow and ebb of

the tide are remarked. The current there changes twice in

the course of a day and night, like as in that period the

tides of the sea flow and ebb twice. In the Tyrrhenian sea<note anchored="yes">The sea which washes the shores of Tuscany. Strabo applies the

term to the whole sea from the mouth of the Arno to Sicily.</note>

the current which is called descendent, and which runs towards the sea of Sicily, as if it followed an inclined plane,

corresponds to the flow of the tide in the ocean. We may

remark, that this current corresponds to the flow both in the

time of its commencement and cessation. For it commences

at the rising and setting of the moon, and recedes when that

satellite attains its meridian, whether above [in the zenith] or

below the earth [in the nadir]. In the same way occurs the

opposite or ascending current, as it is called. It corresponds to



<pb n="86"/>



the ebb of the ocean, and commences as soon as the moon has

reached either zenith or nadir, and ceases the moment she

reaches the point of her rising or setting. [So far Eratosthenes.]

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The nature of the ebb and flow has been sufficiently treated of by Posidonius and Athenodorus. Concerning the flux and

reflux of the currents, which also may be explained by physics, it will suffice our present purpose to observe, that in the

various straits these do not resemble each other, but each strait

has its own peculiar current. Were they to resemble each other,.

the current at the Strait of Sicily<note anchored="yes">Strait of Messina.</note> would not change merely

twice during the day, (as Eratosthenes himself tells us it does,)

and at Chalcis seven times;<note anchored="yes">Gosselin observes that Le Père Babin, who had carefully examined

the currents of the Euripus of Chalcis, says that they are regular during

eighteen or nineteen days of every month, the flux and reflux occurring

twice in the twenty-four hours, and following the same laws as in

the ocean; but from the ninth to the thirteenth, and from the twenty-first to the twenty-sixth, of each lunar month they become irregular, the

flux occurring from twelve to fourteen times in the twenty-four hours,

and the reflux as often.</note> nor again that of Constantinople,

which does not change at all, but runs always in one direction

from the Euxine to the Propontis, and, as Hipparchus tells us,

sometimes ceases altogether. However, if they did all depend on one cause, it would not be that which Eratosthenes

has assigned, namely, that the various seas have different levels.

The kind of inequality he supposes would not even be found

in rivers only for the cataracts; and where these cataracts

occur, they occasion no ebbing, but have one continued downward flow, which is caused by the inclination both of the flow

and the surface; and therefore though they have no flux or

reflux they do not remain still, on account of a principle of

flowing which is inherent in them; at the same time they

cannot be on the same level, but one must be higher and one

lower than another. But who ever imagined the surface of

the ocean to be on a slope, especially those who follow a system which supposes the four bodies we call elementary, to be

spherical.<note anchored="yes">See Plutarch, de Plac. Philos. lib. i. c. 14, and Stobæus, Ecl. Phys.

<p>To what we cited before concerning the temple of Ammon and Egypt, Eratosthenes adds, that to judge from appearances, Mount Casius<note anchored="yes">El-Kas.</note> was formerly covered by sea, and

the whole district now known as Gerra lay under shoal water

touching the bay of the Erythræan Sea,<note anchored="yes">The Arabian Gulf. Mr. Stephenson, while examining the Temsah Lakes, anciently called the Bitter Lakes, discovered recent marine remains similar to those on the shores of the present sea,

water extended as far as the Arabian Gulf, but on that passage being forced open, the Mediterranean, discharging itself

by the strait, became lower, and the land was left dry.
</p><p>On the other hand, Hipparchus understands by the term

the Erythræan Sea, and he inquires how it could happen,

that as the Mediterranean flowed out by this new vent at the

Pillars of Hercules, the Erythræan Sea, which was all one

with it, did not flow away too, and thus become lower, but has

always retained the same level? and since Eratosthenes supposes the whole exterior sea to be confluent, it follows that the

Western Ocean<note anchored="yes">The Atlantic.</note> and the Erythræan Sea are all one; and thus

[remarks Hipparchus] as a necessary consequence, the sea beyond the Pillars of Hercules, the Erythræan Sea, and that also

which is confluent with it,<note anchored="yes">Viz. the Mediterranean.</note> have all the same level.

14. But, Eratosthenes would reply, I never said that, in con-

sequence of the repletion of the Mediterranean, it actually

flowed into the Erythræan Sea, but only that it approached

very near thereto: besides, it does not follow, that in one and

the self-same sea, the level of its surface must be all the same;

to instance the Mediterranean itself, no one, surely, will say it

is of the same height at Lechæum<note anchored="yes">The western part of the town of Corinth situated in the sea of

answer Hipparchus anticipated in his Critique; and being

aware of the opinion of Eratosthenes, was justified in attacking

his arguments. But he ought not to have taken it for granted,

that when Eratosthenes said the exterior sea was all one, he

necessarily implied that its level was every where the same.

<p>Hipparchus rejects as false the [account] of the inscription on the dolphins <q direct="unspecified">by the delegates from Cyrene,</q> but the

reason he assigns for this is insufficient, viz. that though Cyrene

was built in times of which we have record, no one mentions the

oracle,<note anchored="yes">Viz. the temple of Jupiter Ammon, mentioned above.</note> as being situated on the sea-shore. But what matters

it that no historian has recorded this, when amongst the other

proofs from which we infer that this place was formerly on

the sea-shore, we number this of the dolphins which were set

up, and the inscription, <q direct="unspecified">by the delegates from Cyrene?</q><note anchored="yes">Gosselin remarks, Cyrene was founded 631 years before the Christian

era, and at that time the limits of the Mediterranean were the same as

of the principal seaport towns; and if the delegates from Cyrene set up

this symbol of their country in the temple of Ammon, I see no reason

why Eratosthenes and Strabo should regard the offering as a proof that

the temple was on the sea-shore.</note> Hipparchus agrees that if the bottom of the sea were raised up,

it would lift the water with it, and might therefore overflow

the land as far as the locality of the oracle, or more than 3000

stadia from the shore; but he will not allow that the rising

would be sufficient to overflow the Island of Pharos and the

major portion of Egypt, since [he says] the elevation would

not be sufficient to submerge these. He alleges that if before

the opening of the passage at the Pillars of Hercules, the

Mediterranean had been swollen to such an extent as Eratosthenes affirms, the whole of Libya, and the greater part of

Europe and Asia, must long ago have been buried beneath its

waves. Besides, he adds, in this case the Euxine would in

certain places have been connected with the Adriatic, since

if the waters of the Mediterranean were raised in the manner proposed

by Eratosthenes, the valley through which that river flows would have

been submerged, and so formed a kind of strait by which the Euxine

would have been connected to the Adriatic Gulf.</note> To this we object, that the Ister

does not take its rise at all in the vicinity of the Euxine, but,

on the contrary, beyond the mountains of the Adriatic; neither

does it flow into both the seas, but into the Euxine alone, and

only becomes divided just above its mouths. This latter,

however, was an error into which he fell in common with

many of his predecessors. They supposed that there was

another river in addition to the former Ister, bearing the

same name, which emptied itself into the Adriatic, and from

which the country of Istria, through which it flowed, gained

that appellation. It was by this river they believed Jason

returned on his voyage from Colchis.

up, and that nearly two-thirds of Sidon also fell, but not suddenly, and therefore with no great loss of life. That the same

occurred, though in a lighter form, throughout nearly the whole

of Syria, and was felt even in some of the Cyclades and the

Island of Eubœa,<note anchored="yes">Egripo.</note> so that the fountains of Arethusa, a spring

in Chalcis, were completely obstructed, and after some time

forced for themselves another opening, and the whole island

one. The Kimmerians, or a separate tribe of them, called the

<p>We must now return to the point whence we digressed.

Herodotus having observed that there could be no such people

as Hyperborean, inasmuch as there were no Hypernotii,<note anchored="yes">By Hyperboreans are meant people who dwelt beyond the point from

whence the north wind proceeded: Hypernotii therefore should be those

who lived beyond the point of the procession of the south wind. The

remark of Herodotus will be found, lib. iv. § 36. It is simply this: Supposing Hyperboreans, there ought likewise to be Hypernotii.</note>

Eratosthenes calls this argument ridiculous, and compares

it to the sophism, that there are no epichærekaki,<note anchored="yes">Those who exult over the misfortunes of their neighbours.</note> inasmuch

as there are no epichæragathi;<note anchored="yes">Those who rejoice in others' prosperity.</note> [adding] perhaps there are

Hypernotii; since at all events in Ethiopia Notus does not

blow, although lower down it does.
</p><p>It would indeed be strange, since winds blow under every

latitude, and especially the southern wind called Notus, if any

region could be found where this latter was not felt. On

the contrary, not only does Ethiopia experience our Notus,

but also the whole country which lies above as far as the

equator.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin observes, that what Strabo here says, is in accordance with

the geographical system of the ancients, who supposed that Africa did

not extend as far as the equator. As they distinguished the continent

situated in the northern from a continent which they believed to exist

in the southern hemisphere, and which they styled the Antichthones,

they called the wind, blowing from the neighbourhood of the equator,

in the direction of the two poles, a south wind for either hemisphere.

For example, if sailors should be brought to the equator by a north

wind, and that same wind should continue to waft them on their course

after having passed the line, it would no longer be called a north, but a

south wind.</note>
</p><p>If Herodotus must be blamed at all, it is for supposing that

the Hyperboreans were so named in consequence of Boreas, or

the north wind, not blowing upon them. The poets are allowed

much licence in their modes of expression; but their commentators, who endeavour always to give us the correct view,

tell us that the people who dwelt in the extreme north, were

styled Hyperboreans. The pole is the boundary of the northern

other limit.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes next finds fault with the writers who fill

their narrative with stories evidently feigned and impossible;

some as mere fable, but others as history, which did not deserve mention. In the discussion of a subject like his, he

should not have wasted his time about such trifles. Such is

the way in which this writer completes the First Book of his

Memoirs.


</p></div2><div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>IN his Second Book Eratosthenes endeavours to correct

some errors in geography, and offers his own views on the

subject, any mistakes in which we shall endeavour in our turn

to set right. He is correct in saying that the inductions of

mathematics and natural philosophy should be employed, and

that if the earth is spheroidal like the universe, it is inhabited

in all parts; together with some other things of this nature.

Later writers do not agree with him as to the size of the

earth,<note anchored="yes">According to Gosselin, this does not allude to the size of the whole

earth, but merely that part of it which, according to the theory of the

ancients, was alone habitable.</note> nor admit his measurement. However Hipparchus,

when noting the celestial appearances for each particular locality, adopts his admeasurements, saying that those taken for

the meridian of Meroe,<note anchored="yes">Most probably Gherri in Sennaar.</note> Alexandria, and the Dnieper, differ but very slightly from the truth. Eratosthenes then enters into a long discussion concerning the figure of the globe,

proving that the form of the earth together with the water is

spheroidal, as also the heavens. This however we imagine

was foreign to his purpose, and should have been disposed of

in the compass of a few words.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After this he proceeds to determine the breadth of the

habitable earth: he tells us, that measuring from the meridian

of Meroe<note anchored="yes">Eratosthenes supposed that Meroe, Alexandria, the Hellespont, and

the mouth of the Borysthenes or Dnieper, were all under the same

meridian.</note> to Alexandria, there are 10,000 stadia.



<pb n="99"/>



From thence to the Hellespont<note anchored="yes">The Dardanelles.</note> about 8100. Again;

from thence to the Dnieper, 5000; and thence to the parallel

of Thule,<note anchored="yes">Iceland.</note> which Pytheas says is six days' sail north from

Britain, and near the Frozen Sea, other 11,500. To which

if we add 3400 stadia above Meroe in order to include the

Island of the Egyptians,<note anchored="yes">This Island of the Egyptians is the same which Strabo elsewhere calls

the Island of the Exiles, because it was inhabited by Egyptians who had

revolted from Psammeticus, and established themselves in the island. Its

exact situation is unknown.</note> the Cinnamon country, and Taprobane,<note anchored="yes">Ceylon.</note> there will be in all 38,000 stadia.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We will let pass the rest of his distances, since they are

something near,—but that the Dnieper is under the same

parallel as Thule, what man in his senses could ever agree to

this? Pytheas, who has given us the history of Thule, is known

to be a man upon whom no reliance can be placed, and other

writers who have seen Britain and Ierne,<note anchored="yes">Ireland.</note> although they tell

us of many small islands round Britain, make no mention

whatever of Thule. The length of Britain itself is nearly the

same as that of Keltica,<note anchored="yes">France.</note> opposite to which it extends. Altogether it is not more than 5000 stadia in length, its outermost points corresponding to those of the opposite continent.

In fact the extreme points of the two countries lie opposite to

each other, the eastern extremity to the eastern, and the

western to the western: the eastern points are situated so

close as to be within sight of each other, both at Kent and at

the mouths of the Rhine. But Pytheas tells us that the island [of Britain] is more than 20,000 stadia in length, and

that Kent is some days' sail from France. With regard to

the locality of the Ostimii, and the countries beyond the

Rhine,<note anchored="yes">Between the Rhine and Elbe.</note> as far as Scythia, he is altogether mistaken. The

veracity of a writer who has been thus false in describing

countries with which we are well acquainted, should not be

too much trusted in regard to unknown places.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Further, Hipparchus and many others are of opinion

that the parallel of latitude of the Dnieper does not differ



<pb n="100"/>



from that of Britain; since that of Byzantium and Marseilles

are the same. The degree of shadow from the gnomon which

Pytheas states he observed at Marseilles being exactly equal

to that which Hipparchus says he found at Byzantium; the

periods of observation being in both cases similar.<note anchored="yes">The latitudes of Marseilles and Constantinople differ by 2° 16′ 21″.

Gosselin enters into a lengthened explanation on this subject, i. 158.</note> Now

from Marseilles to the centre of Britain is not more than

5000 stadia; and if from the centre of Britain we advance

north not more than 4000 stadia, we arrive at a temperature in

which it is scarcely possible to exist. Such indeed is that of

Ierne.<note anchored="yes">Ireland.</note> Consequently the far region in which Eratosthenes

places Thule must be totally uninhabitable. By what guesswork he arrived at the conclusion that between the latitude

of Thule and the Dnieper there was a distance of 11,500

stadia I am unable to divine.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes being mistaken as to the breadth [of the

habitable earth], is necessarily wrong as to its length. The

most accurate observers, both ancient and modern, agree that

the known length of the habitable earth is more than twice

its breadth. Its length I take to be from the [eastern] extremity of India<note anchored="yes">The eastern mouth of the Ganges.</note> to the [westernmost] point of Spain;<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> and

its breadth from [the south of] Ethiopia to the latitude of Ierne.

Eratosthenes, as we have said, reckoning its breadth from the

extremity of Ethiopia to Thule, was forced to extend its length

beyond the true limits, that he might make it more than twice

as long as the breadth he had assigned to it. He says that

India, measured where it is narrowest,<note anchored="yes">In the opinion of Strabo and Eratosthenes, the narrowest portion of

India was measured by a line running direct from the eastern embouchure

of the Ganges to the sources of the Indus, that is, the northern side of India

bounded by the great chain of the Taurus.</note> is 16,000 stadia to the

river Indus. If measured from its most prominent capes it

extends 3000 more.<note anchored="yes">Cape Comorin is the farthest point on the eastern coast. Strabo

probably uses the plural to indicate the capes generally, not confining

himself to those which project a few leagues farther than the rest.</note> Thence to the Caspian Gates, 14,000.

the Euphrates to the Nile, 5000.<note anchored="yes">The Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, now Thineh or Farameh.</note> Thence to the Canopic<note anchored="yes">Close by Aboukir.</note> mouth, <date value="1300">1300</date>. From the Canopic mouth to Carthage,

13,500. From thence to the Pillars at least 8000. Which

make in all 70,800 stadia. To these [he says] should be added the curvature of Europe beyond the Pillars of Hercules,

fronting the Iberians, and inclining west, not less than 3000

stadia, and the headlands, including that of the Ostimii, named

Cabæum,<note anchored="yes">Cape S. Mahé.</note> and the adjoining islands, the last of which, named

Uxisama,<note anchored="yes">Ushant.</note> is distant, according to Pytheas, a three days' sail.

But he added nothing to its length by enumerating these last,

viz. the headlands, including that of the Ostimii, the island of

Uxisama, and the rest; they are not situated so as affect the

length of the earth, for they all lie to the north, and belong to

Keltica, not to Iberia; indeed it seems but an invention of

Pytheas. Lastly, to fall in with the general opinion that the

breadth ought not<note anchored="yes">The text has <foreign lang="greek">to\ ple/on,</foreign> but we have followed the suggestions of the

commentators in reading <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ ple/on.</foreign></note> to exceed half the length, he adds to the

stated measure of its length 2000 stadia west, and as many east.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Further, endeavouring to support the opinion that it

is in accordance with natural philosophy to reckon the greatest dimension of the habitable earth from east to west, he

says that, according to the laws of natural philosophy, the

habitable earth ought to occupy a greater length from east to

west, than its breadth from north to south. The temperate

zone, which we have already designated as the longest zone,

is that which the mathematicians denominate a continuous

circle returning upon itself. So that if the extent of the

Atlantic Ocean were not an obstacle, we might easily pass by

sea from Iberia to India,<note anchored="yes">It is remarkable that this is the same idea which led Columbus to

the discovery of America, and gave to the islands off that continent the

name of the West Indies.</note> still keeping in the same parallel;

the remaining portion of which parallel, measured as above

in stadia, occupies more than a third of the whole circle:

since the parallel drawn through Athens,<note anchored="yes">We have followed Kramer in reading <foreign lang="greek">di' )/Aqhnw=n,</foreign> instead of the <foreign lang="greek">dia\ qinw=n</foreign> of former editions.</note> on which we have

taken the distances from India to Iberia, does not contain in

the whole 200,000 stadia.



<pb n="102"/>



Here too his reasoning is incorrect. For this speculation

respecting the temperate zone which we inhabit, and whereof

the habitable earth is a part, devolves properly on those who

make mathematics their study. But it is not equally the

province of one treating of the habitable earth. For by this

term we mean only that portion of the temperate zone where

we dwell, and with which we are acquainted. But it is quite

possible that in the temperate zone there may be two or even

more habitable earths, especially near the circle of latitude

which is drawn through Athens and the Atlantic Ocean. After

this he returns to the form of the earth, which he again

declares to be spheroidal. Here he exhibits the same churlishness we have previously pointed out, and goes on abusing

Homer in his old style. He proceeds:

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p><q direct="unspecified">There has been much argument respecting the continents. Some, considering them to be divided by the rivers Nile

and Tanais,<note anchored="yes">The Nile being thought to separate Africa from Asia, and the Tanais,

or Don, Europe.</note> have described them as islands; while others suppose them to be peninsulas connected by the isthmuses between

the Caspian and the Euxine Seas, and between the Erythræan

Sea<note anchored="yes">The Red Sea.</note> and Ecregma.</q><note anchored="yes">The name of the mouth of the lake Sirbonis or Sebaket-Bardoil,

which opens into the Mediterranean. A line drawn from this embouchure to the bottom of the Arabian Gulf, would give the boundary between

Africa and Asia.</note> He adds, that this question does not appear to him to be of any practical importance, but rather, as

Democritus observed, a bone of contention for angry litigants.

Where there are no precise boundary marks, columns, or walls,

as at Colyttus and Melitè,<note anchored="yes">Places in Attica.</note> it is easy for us to say such a place

is Colyttus, and such another Melitè, but not so easy to show

the exact limits: thus disputes have frequently arisen concerning certain districts; that, for instance, between the

Argives and Lacedæmonians concerning [the possession of]

Thyrea,<note anchored="yes">Probably Thyros, a place situated close to the sea, just at the boundary of the two countries.</note> and that between the Athenians and Bœotians relative to Oropus.<note anchored="yes">Oropo, on the confines of Attica and Bœotia.</note> Further, in giving names to the three continents, the Greeks did not take into consideration the whole

habitable earth, but merely their own country and the land

exactly opposite, namely, Caria, which is now inhabited by



<pb n="103"/>



the Ionians and other neighbouring tribes. In course of time,

as they advanced further and daily became acquainted with

new countries, this their division came to be general."
</p><p>I take this last part first, and (to use Eratosthenes' own

words, not those of Democritus) willing to pick my bone of contention, inquire, whether they who first made the division of

the three continents were the same persons as those who first

desired to distinguish their own land from that of the Carians

opposite, or whether they were only acquainted with Greece,

Caria, and some few other adjoining countries, and not with

Europe, Asia, or Africa; but that others who followed them,

and were able to write a description of the habitable earth,

were the real authors of the division into three continents.

How did he know that these were not the men who made this

division of the habitable earth? And he who divided the

earth into three parts, giving to each portion the name of

<q direct="unspecified">continent,</q> could he not form in his mind a just idea of that

taken as a whole, which he had so parcelled out. But if indeed he were not acquainted with the whole habitable earth,

but merely made a division of some part thereof, pray what

portion of that part did he denominate Asia, or Europe, or

simply continent? Such talk is altogether nonsense.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The reasoning of Eratosthenes, however, is still more

absurd, when he declares that he sees no advantage in being

acquainted with the exact boundaries of countries, and then

cites the example of Colyttus and Melitè, which prove just

the contrary of his assertion. Surely if a want of certainty

respecting the boundaries of Thyrea and Oropus gave rise to

war, a knowledge of the limits of different districts must be

of practical importance. Will he tell us that the boundaries

of districts, or the limits of kingdoms, may be of some service,

but when applied to continents it is carrying the matter too

far. We reply, it is of equal consequence here. Suppose a

dispute between two powerful princes, one claiming the possession of Asia and the other of Africa, to which of these should

Egypt, I mean the country called Lower Egypt, appertain.

Will any one paws over such cases on account of their rarity?

By no means. It is acknowledged by every one that the

limits of each continent ought to be defined by some notable

boundary, indicated by the configuration of the whole habitable earth. In following out this principle, we should not be



<pb n="104"/>



very particular if they who determine boundaries by the rivers

leave some districts undefined, since the rivers do not reach

from sea to sea, nor leave the continents altogether as islands.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>At the close of the book Eratosthenes blames the system

of those who would divide all mankind into Greeks and Barbarians, and likewise those who recommended Alexander to

treat the Greeks as friends, but the Barbarians as enemies.<note anchored="yes">Aristotle was the giver of this sage counsel.</note>

He suggests, as a better course, to distinguish them according to their virtues and their vices, <q direct="unspecified">since amongst the

those men who thus divided the human race, abandoning one

portion to contempt, and exalting to dignity the other, were

not actuated to this because they found that on one side justice,

knowledge, and the force of reason reigned supreme, but their

contraries on the other. Alexander did not disregard the

advice tendered him, but gladly embraced and followed it,

respecting the wisdom of those who gave it; and so far from

taking the opposite course, he closely pursued that which they

pointed out.

<p>SUMMARY.</p>

<p>In the Second Book, having proposed for discussion the [opinions] of Eratosthenes, he examines and refutes whatever that writer may have incorrectly said, determined, or laid down. He likewise brings forward many

statements of Hipparchus, which he disproves, and finishes with a short

exposition or synopsis of the whole subject, namely, geographical knowledge.</p></argument>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>IN the Third Book of his Geography Eratosthenes furnishes

us with a chart of the habitable earth. This he divides into

two portions, by a line running from east to west parallel to

the equator. He makes the Pillars of Hercules the boundary

of this line to the west, and to the east the farthest ridges of

those mountains which bound India on the north. From the

Pillars he draws the line through the Strait of Sicily,<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Messina.</note> and the

southern extremities of Peloponnesus and Attica, to Rhodes

and the Gulf of Issus.<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Aïas. The town of Aïas has replaced Issus, at the eastern

extremity of the Mediterranean.</note> He says, <q direct="unspecified">Through the whole of this

distance the line mentioned is drawn across the sea <note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> and adjacent continents; the whole length of the Mediterranean as

far as Cilicia extending in that direction. Thence it runs

nearly in a straight line along the whole chain of the Taurus

to India. The Taurus continuing in a straight line from the

Pillars divides Asia through its whole length into two halves,

north and south. So that both the Taurus and the sea from

the Pillars hither <note anchored="yes">That is, the Mediterranean on the coast of Syria.</note> lie under the parallel of Athens.</q>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He then declares that the ancient geographical chart

wants revision; that in it the eastern portion of the Taurus



<pb n="106"/>



is made to run too far north, India itself being also too much

drawn in the same direction. One proof which he offers in

support of this is, that the most southern extremities of India

are under the same latitude as Meroe, as attested by many,

both from astronomical observations and the temperature of

the climate. From thence to the most northerly point by the

mountains of the Caucasus,<note anchored="yes">Strabo does not here mean the Caucasus or Balkan, but the mountains which stretch from Persia to Cochin China. At a later period the

several chains were known to the Greeks by the names of Paropamisus,

Emodi Montes, Imaüs, &amp;c.</note> there are 15,000 stadia, according to Patrocles, a writer whom we are bound to believe, both

on account of his worth, and the vast amount of his geographical attainments. Now since the distance from Meroe to

the parallel of Athens is nearly the same, the most northerly

points of India next to the Caucasian mountains ought to be

under the same degree of latitude.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But there is another method (says Eratosthenes) of

proving this. The distance from the Gulf of Issus to the

Euxine, proceeding in a northerly direction towards Amisus<note anchored="yes">Samsun.</note>

and Sinope,<note anchored="yes">Sinub.</note> is about 3000 stadia, which is as much as the

supposed extent of the mountains [of the Taurus].<note anchored="yes">The great chain of the Taurus was supposed to occupy the whole

breadth of Asia Minor, a space of 3000 stadia. Eratosthenes is here attempting to prove that these mountains occupy a like space in the north

of India.</note> The traveller who directs his course from Amisus due east,<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Lit.</emph> to the equinoctial rising.</note> arrives

first at Colchis, then at the high lands by the Hyrcanian

Sea,<note anchored="yes">Another designation of the Caspian.</note> afterwards at the road leading to Bactra,<note anchored="yes">Balk</note> and beyond to

the Scythians; having the mountains always on the right.

The same line drawn through Amisus westward, crosses the

Propontis and Hellespont. From Meroe to the Hellespont

there are not more than 18,000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">Read 18,100 stadia.</note> The distance is just

the same from the southern extremity of India to the land of

Bactria, if we add to the 15,000 stadia of that country the

3000 which its mountains occupy in breadth.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Hipparchus tries to invalidate this view of Eratosthenes,

by sneering at the proofs on which it rests. Patrocles, he

says, merits little credit, being contradicted by the two writers



<pb n="107"/>



Deimachus and Megasthenes, who say that the distance<note anchored="yes">i. e. The breadth of India.</note>

taken from the southern ocean, is in some places 20,000, in

others 30,000 stadia; that in this assertion they are supported

by the ancient charts, and he considers it absurd to require

us to put implicit faith in Patrocles alone, when there is so

much testimony against him; or that the ancient charts should

be corrected; but rather that they should be left as they are

until we have something more certain on the subject.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This argument, I think, is in many instances unfounded.

Eratosthenes availed himself of the statements of many

writers, although Hipparchus alleges he was solely led by

Patrocles. Who then are the authors of the statement that

the southern extremity of India is under the same parallel

as Meroe; and who are they who estimate<note anchored="yes">Literally, <q direct="unspecified">estimate at so much,</q> referring to the estimate at the

conclusion of § 2.</note> the distance from

Meroe to the parallel passing through Athens? Or who, again,

were those who asserted that the whole breadth occupied by

the mountains<note anchored="yes">Caucasus, in the north of India.</note> was equal to the distance from Cilicia to

Amisus? Or who made known that, travelling from Amisus,

the course lay in a straight line due east through Colchis, the

[sea of] Hyrcania, so on to Bactria, and beyond this to the

eastern ocean,<note anchored="yes">By the term <foreign lang="greek">e(w/|a qa/latta,</foreign> rendered <q direct="unspecified">eastern ocean,</q> we must

understand Strabo to mean the Bay of Bengal.</note> the mountains being always on the right hand;

and that this same line carried west in a straight line, traverses the Propontis and the Hellespont? These things Eratosthenes advances on the testimony of men who had been on

the spot, and from the study of those numerous memoirs which

he had for reference in that noble library<note anchored="yes">The Alexandrian.</note> which Hipparchus

himself acknowledges to be gigantic.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Besides, the credibility of Patrocles can be proved by a

variety of evidence—the princes<note anchored="yes">Seleucus Nicator and Antiochus Soter.</note> who confided to him so important trusts—the authors who follow his statements—and

those, too, who criticise them, whose names Hipparchus has

recorded. Since whenever these are refuted, the credit of

Patrocles is by so much advanced. Nor does Patrocles appear to state any thing improbable when he says that the army



<pb n="108"/>



of Alexander took but a very hasty view of every thing [in

India], but Alexander himself a more exact one, causing the

whole country to be described by men well acquainted with

it. Which description he says was afterwards put into his

hands by Xenocles the treasurer.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, in the second volume of his Commentaries, Hipparchus accuses Eratosthenes of himself throwing discredit on

the statement of Patrocles, on account of his differing with Megasthenes, as to the length of India on its northern side;<note anchored="yes">The length of India is its measurement from west to east.</note> Megasthenes stating the length at 16,000 stadia, and Patrocles

at 1000 less. Being biassed by a certain Itinerary, Eratosthenes was led to reject them both on account of this discrepancy, and to follow the Itinerary. If then merely the difference of 1000 stadia is sufficient to cause the authority of Patrocles to be rejected, how much more should this be the

case when we find a difference of 8000 stadia between his

statement and that of two writers who agree perfectly in

theirs, that the breadth of India is 20,000 stadia, while he

gives only 12,000!

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We reply, that [Eratosthenes] did not object [to the

statement of Patrocles] merely because it differed [from that

of Megasthenes], but because the statement of this latter as to

the stadia was confirmed by the Itinerary, an authority of no

mean importance. There is nothing wonderful in this, that

though a certain statement may be credible, another may be

more credible; and that while in some instances we follow the

former, in others we may dissent from it on finding a more

trust-worthy guide. It is ridiculous to say that the greater

the difference of one writer from others, the less he should be

trusted. On the contrary, such a rule would be more applicable in regard to small differences; for in little particulars

the ordinary observer and the man of great ability are equally

liable to err. On the other hand, in great matters, the ordinary run of men are more like to be deceived than the man

of superior talent, to whom consequently in such cases greater

deference is paid.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the men who hitherto have written

on the affairs of India, were a set of liars. Deimachus holds

the first place in the list, Megasthenes comes next, while



<pb n="109"/>



Onesicritus and Nearchus, with others of the same class,

manage to stammer out a few words [of truth]. Of this we

became the more convinced whilst writing the history of

Alexander. No faith whatever can be placed in Deimachus

and Megasthenes. They coined the fables concerning men

with ears large enough to sleep in, men without any mouths,

without noses, with only one eye, with spider-legs, and with

fingers bent backward. They renewed Homer's fable concerning the battles of the Cranes and Pygmies, and asserted

the latter to be three spans high. They told of ants digging

for gold, of Pans with wedge-shaped heads, of serpents swallowing down oxen and stags, horns and all; meantime, as

Eratosthenes has observed, reciprocally accusing each other

of falsehood. Both of these men were sent ambassadors to

Palimbothra,<note anchored="yes">Not Allahabad, as supposed by D'Anville, but Patelputer, or Patali-

putra, near Patna.</note>—Megasthenes to Sandrocottus, Deimachus to

Allitrochades his son; and such are the notes of their residence

abroad, which, I know not why, they thought fit to leave.

Patrocles certainly does not resemble them; nor do any other

of the authorities consulted by Eratosthenes contain such

absurdities.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p><note anchored="yes">There would seem to be some omission here, although none of the

MSS. have any blank space left to indicate it. Groskurd has been at considerable pains to supply what he thinks requisite to complete the sense,

but in a matter so doubtful we deemed it a surer course to follow the

Greek text as it stands.</note> If the meridian of Rhodes and Byzantium has

been rightly determined to be the same, then that of Cilicia and Amisus has likewise been rightly determined; many

observations having proved that the lines are parallel, and

that they never impinge on each other.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In like manner, that the voyage from Amisus to

Colchis, and the route to the Caspian, and thence on to

Bactra, are both due east, is proved by the winds, the seasons, the fruits, and even the sun-risings. Frequently evidence such as this, and general agreement, are more to be

relied on than the measurement taken by means of instruments. Hipparchus himself was not wholly indebted to

instruments and geometrical calculations for his statement

that the Pillars and Cilicia lie in a direct line due east. For



<pb n="110"/>



that part of it included between the Pillars and the Strait of

Sicily he rests entirely on the assertion of sailors. It is

therefore incorrect to say that, because we cannot exactly

determine the duration of the longest and shortest days, nor

the degree of shadow of the gnomon throughout the mountainous region between Cilicia and India, that therefore we

are unable to decide whether the line traced obliquely on

the ancient charts should or should not be parallel, and

consequently must leave it unreformed, keeping it oblique

as the ancient charts have it. For in the first place, not

to determine any thing is to leave it undetermined; and

to leave a thing undetermined, is neither to take one view

of the matter nor the other: but to agree to leave it as

the ancients have, that is to take a view of the case. It

would have been more consistent with his reasoning, if he

had told us to leave Geography alone altogether, since we

are similarly unable to determine the position of the Alps,

the Pyrenees, and the mountains of Thrace,<note anchored="yes">Thrace, now Roumelia.</note> Illyria,<note anchored="yes">The situation of Illyria was on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Venice.</note> and

Germany. Wherefore should we give more credit to the

ancient writers than to the modern, when we call to mind

the numerous errors of their charts which have been pointed

out by Eratosthenes, and which Hipparchus has not attempted

to defend.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But the system of Hipparchus altogether teems with difficulties. Reflect for an instant on the following absurdity; after

admitting that the southern extremity of India is under the

same degree of latitude as Meroe, and that the distance from

Meroe to the Strait of Byzantium is about 18,000<note anchored="yes">Read 18,100 stadia.</note> stadia,

lie then makes the distance from the southern extremity of

India to the mountains 30,000 stadia. Since Byzantium

and Marseilles are under the same parallel of latitude, as

Hipparchus tells us they are, on the authority of Pytheas,

and since Byzantium and the Dnieper<note anchored="yes">The mouth of the Dnieper.</note> have also the same

meridian, as Hipparchus equally assures us, if we take his

assertion that there is a distance of 3700<note anchored="yes">Hipparchus stated 3800 stadia, not 3700.</note> stadia between

Byzantium and the Dnieper, there will of course be a

like difference between the latitude of Marseilles and the



<pb n="111"/>



Dnieper. This would make the latitude of the Dnieper

identical with that of Keltica next the Ocean; for on proceeding 3700 stadia [north of Marseilles], we reach the

ocean.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin remarks that these 3700, or rather 3800 stadia, on proceeding from Marseilles, would reach the latitude of Paris, and that of the

coasts in the neighbourhood of Tréguier. Eratosthenes and Hipparchus

were out but 14′ and some seconds in their calculation of the latitude of

Marseilles; but Strabo's error touching the same amounted to 3° 43′ 28″;

he consequently fixed the northern coasts of France at 45° 17′ 18″, which is about the latitude of the mouth of the Garonne.</note>

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, we know that the Cinnamon Country is the

most southerly point of the habitable earth. According to

Hipparchus's own statement, the latitude of this country,

which marks the commencement of the temperate zone, and

likewise of the habitable earth, is distant from the equator

about 8800 stadia.<note anchored="yes">These 8800 stadia, at 700 to a degree, amount to 12° 34′ 17″ of latitude. This would be about the middle of Abyssinia.</note> And since he likewise says that from

the equator to the parallel of the Dnieper there are 34,000

stadia, there will remain a distance of 25,200 stadia between the parallel of the Dnieper (which is the same as

that which passes over the side of Keltica next the Ocean)

to that which separates the torrid from the temperate zone.

It is said that the farthest voyages now made north of Keltica

are to Ierne,<note anchored="yes">Ireland.</note> which lies beyond Britain, and, on account of

its extreme cold, barely sustains life; beyond this it is thought

to be uninhabitable. Now the distance between Keltica and

Ierne is estimated at not more than 5000 stadia; so that on

this view they must have estimated the whole breadth of the

habitable earth at 30,000 stadia, or just above.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let us then transport ourselves to the land opposite the

Cinnamon Country, and lying to the east under the same

parallel of latitude; we shall there find the country named

Taprobane.<note anchored="yes">The island of Ceylon.</note> This Taprobane is universally believed to be a

large island situated in the high seas, and lying to the south

opposite India. Its length in the direction of Ethiopia is above

5000 stadia, as they say. There are brought from thence to

the Indian markets, ivory, tortoise-shells, and other wares in

large quantities. Now if this island is broad in proportion to



<pb n="112"/>



its length, we cannot suppose that the whole distance,<note anchored="yes">Viz. between its southern extremity and that of India.</note> inclusive of the space which separates it from India, is less than

3000 stadia, which is equal to the distance of the southern

extremity of the habitable earth from Meroe, since the

[southern] extremities of India and Meroe are under the same

parallel. It is likely there are more than 3000 stadia,<note anchored="yes">Strabo and Eratosthenes supposed the extremity of India farther

south than Meroe; Hipparchus fixes it a little north of that city, at a

distance of 12,600 stadia from the equator.</note> but

taking this number, if we add thereto the 30,000 stadia, which

Deimachus states there are between [the southern extremity

of India] and the country of the Bactrians and Sogdians, we

shall find both of these nations lie beyond the temperate zone

and habitable earth.<note anchored="yes">These 30,000 stadia, added to the 12,600 of the preceding note, would

place Bactria under 60° 51′ 26″ north latitude, which is more than 24

degrees too far north.</note> Who will venture to affirm such to be

the case, hearing, as they must, the statement made both by

ancients and moderns of the genial climate and fertility of

northern India, Hyrcania, Aria, Margiana,<note anchored="yes">Both Aria and Margiana are in the present Khorasan.</note> and Bactriana

also? These countries are all equally close to the northern

side of the Taurus, Bactriana being contiguous to that part

of the chain<note anchored="yes">This portion of the Taurus is called by the Indians Hindou Kho.</note> which forms the boundary of India. A country

blessed with such advantages must be very far from uninhabitable. It is said that in Hyrcania each vine produces a

metrete<note anchored="yes">This was the principal Greek liquid measure, and was 3–4ths of the

the grains of wheat which fall from the husk on to the earth

spring up the year following; that bee-hives are in the trees,

with in the part of Media called Matiana,<note anchored="yes">Matiana was a province of Media on the frontiers of the present

sena and Araxena, countries of Armenia. In these three it

is not so much to be wondered at, since they lie more to the

south than Hyrcania, and surpass the rest of the country in

the beauty of their climate; but in Hyrcania it is more remarkable. It is said that in Margiana you may frequently

meet with a vine whose stock would require two men with

outstretched arms to clasp it, and clusters of grapes two cubits

long. Aria is described as similarly fertile, the wine being

still richer, and keeping perfectly for three generations in

unpitched casks. Bactriana, which adjoins Aria, abounds in

the same productions, if we except olives.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>That there are cold regions in the high and mountainous

parts of these countries is not to be wondered at; since in the

[more] southern climates the mountains, and even the tablelands, are cold. The districts next the Euxine, in Cappadocia,

are much farther north than those adjoining the Taurus.

Bagadania, a vast plain, situated between the mountains of

<p>The great fertility of Bactriana, according to Strabo, appeared to be inconsistent with a position so far towards the north. In this he was

correct.</p></note>

And that Bactra is still farther north than the mouth of the

Caspian or Hyrcanian Sea, which is distant about 6000 stadia

from the recess of the Caspian and the mountains of Armenia

and Media, and which appears to be the most northerly point

of the whole coast as far as India, with a sea navigable to

India all the way, as Patrocles, who had the government of

these regions, affirms. Now Bactriana stretches 1000 stadia

farther north. Beyond this the Scythians occupy a much

larger territory, bounded by the Northern Ocean: here they

dwell, though to be sure theirs is a nomade life. But we ask

how they could exist here at all, supposing even Bactra to be

beyond the limits of the habitable globe. The distance from

the Caucasus to the Northern Sea through Bactra would be

rather more than 4000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">These 4000 stadia do not accord with the distances elsewhere propounded by Strabo. Possibly he had before him various charts constructed on different hypotheses, and made his computations not always

from the same.</note> This being added to the

number<note anchored="yes">Viz. 3800.</note> of stadia north of Ierne<note anchored="yes">Ireland.</note> above-mentioned, will give

us the whole amount of uninhabitable land from Ierne northward 7800 stadia, and even omitting the 4000 stadia altogether, those parts of Bactriana next the Caucasus will still

be 3800 stadia farther north than Ierne, and 8800 farther

north than Keltica,<note anchored="yes">France.</note> and [the mouth] of the Dnieper.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Hipparchus narrates that at the Dnieper and [the

north of] Keltica, during the whole of the summer nights there

is one continued twilight from sun-set to sun-rise, but at the

winter solstice the sun never rises more than nine cubits above

the horizon.<note anchored="yes">The astronomical cubit of the ancients equalled 2 degrees. It therefore follows that in the regions alluded to by Hipparchus, the sun at the

winter solstice rose no higher than 18 degrees above the horizon. This

Would give a latitude of a little above 48 degrees. We afterwards find that

Hipparchus placed the mouth of the Dnieper, and that part of France

here alluded to, under 48° 29′ 19″, and we know that at this latitude, which is only 20′ 56″ different from that of Paris, there is no real night during the longest days of the summer.</note> He adds that this phenomenon is yet more remarkable in regions 6300<note anchored="yes">Read 7700.</note> stadia north of Marseilles, (these

regions he supposes to be peopled by Kelts, but I believe are

inhabited by Britons, and 2500 stadia north of Keltica,) where

the sun at the winter solstice<note anchored="yes">Lit., during the winter days, but the winter solstice is evidently

intended.</note> rises only six cubits above the

horizon. That at 9100<note anchored="yes">Read about 10,500. This correction is borne out by the astronomical

four cubits, and not so much as three in the countries beyond,

north of this he considered to be altogether uninhabitable on account of

their inclemency.</note> However, Hipparchus, on the authority of Pytheas, places them

south of Britain, and says that the longest day there consists

only of 19 hours;<note anchored="yes">Equinoctial hours.</note> while in countries where the sun rises but

stadia north of Marseilles, the day has 18 hours. Consequently [according to his hypothesis] the most southerly parts

of Britain must be north of these regions. They must therefore

be under the same parallel, or almost the same, as the parts of

Bactriana next to the Caucasus, which I have shown are, according to the followers of Deimachus, 3800 stadia farther

north than Ierne.<note anchored="yes">Ireland.</note> Now if we add this to the number between Marseilles and Ierne, we shall get 12,500 stadia. But

who ever made known to us that, in those parts, I mean, in

the vicinity of Bactra, this was the duration of the longest

day, or the height which the sun attains in the meridian at the

winter solstice? All these things are patent to the eyes of

every man, and require no mathematical investigation; therefore they certainly would have been mentioned by numerous

writers both amongst the ancients who have left us histories

of Persia, and by the later writers too, who have carried them

down to our own time. How, too, would their fertility,

which I have described above, harmonize with such a latitude? The facts here advanced are sufficient to give an

idea of the learned manner in which Hipparchus attempts to

controvert the reasoning of Eratosthenes by mere petitiones

principii.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, Eratosthenes wished to show the ignorance of

Deimachus, and his want of information concerning such matters, as proved by his assertion that India lies between the

autumnal equinox<note anchored="yes">The equinoctial line.</note> and winter tropic.<note anchored="yes">There is no doubt that the expressions which Deimachus appears to

have used were correct. It seems that he wished to show that beyond

the Indus the coasts of India, instead of running in a direction almost due

east, as the Greeks imagined they did, sloped in a direction between the

south and the north-east, which is correct enough. As Deimachus had

resided at Palibothra, he had had an opportunity of obtaining more exact

information relative to the form of India than that which was current at

Alexandria. This seems the more certain, as Megasthenes, who had also

lived at Palibothra, stated that by measuring India from the Caucasus to the

southern extremity of the continent, you would obtain, not its length, as

the Greeks imagined, but its breadth. These correct accounts were obstinately rejected by the speculative geographers of Alexandria, because

they imagined a certain uninhabitable zone, into which India ought not to

penetrate.</note> Also in his blaming

Megasthenes, where he says that in the southern parts of India

the Greater and Lesser Bear are seen to set, and the shadows



<pb n="118"/>



to fall both ways; assuring us that such is not the case in

India.<note anchored="yes">The truth of these facts depends on the locality where the observations are made. In the time of Alexander the most southern of the seven

principal stars which compose the Greater Bear had a declination of

about 61 degrees, so that for all latitudes above 29 degrees, the Wain

never set. Consequently if Deimachus were speaking of the aspect of

the heavens as seen from the northern provinces of India, the Punjaub

for instance, there was truth in his assertion, that the two Bears were

never seen to set there, nor the shadows to fall in contrary directions.

On the other hand, as Megasthenes appears to be speaking of the south of

India, that is, of the peninsula situated entirely south of the tropic, it is

certain that he was right in saying that the shadows cast by the sun fell

sometimes towards the north, at others towards the south, and that accordingly, as we proceeded towards the south, the Bears would be seen

to set. The whole of Ursa Major at that time set at 29 degrees, and our

present polar star at 13 degrees. <foreign lang="greek">b</foreign> of the Lesser Bear was at that time

the most northern of the seven principal stars of that constellation, and

set at 8° 45′. So that both Bears entirely disappeared beneath the horizon of Cape Comorin.</note> These assertions, says Eratosthenes, arise from the

ignorance of Deimachus. For it is nothing else than ignorance to suppose that the autumnal equinox is not equally

distant from the tropics with the vernal; since in both

equinoxes the sun rises at the same point, and performs a similar revolution. Further, [he continues,] the distance from

the terrestrial tropic to the equator, between which, according

to Deimachus himself, India is situated, has been proved by

measurement to be much less than 20,000 stadia, consequently

his own statements prove that my assertion is correct, and not

his. For supposing India to be twenty or thirty thousand

stadia [in breadth] it could not be contained in the given

space, but if my estimate be taken it is simple enough. It

is another evidence of his want of information, to say that the

two Bears are not seen to set, or the shadows to fall both ways,

in any part of India, since 5000 stadia south of Alexandria<note anchored="yes">This would be at Syene under the tropic.</note>

both of these phenomena are observable. Thus reasons Eratosthenes; whom Hipparchus again criticises in the same mistaken way. First he substitutes [in the text of Deimachus]

the summer in place of the winter tropic; then he says that

the evidence of a man ignorant of astronomy ought not to be

received in a mathematical question; as if Eratosthenes in the

main had actually been guided by the authority of Deimachus. Could he not see that Eratosthenes had followed



<pb n="119"/>



the general custom in regard to idle reasoners, one means of

refuting whom is to show that their arguments, whatever

they may be, go only to confirm our views.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is by assuming as a fact that the southern extremity

of India is under the same parallel as Meroe, a thing affirmed

and believed by most writers, that we shall be best able to

show the absurdities of the system of Hipparchus. In the first

book of his Commentaries he does not object to this hypothesis, but in the second book he no longer admits it; we must

examine his reasons for this. He says, <q direct="unspecified">when two countries

are situated under the same parallel, but separated by a great

distance, you cannot be certain that they are exactly under the

same parallel, unless the <emph rend="ital">climata</emph><note anchored="yes">Small zones parallel to the equator; they were placed at such a distance front each other, that there might be half an hour's difference between each on the longest day of summer. So by taking an observation on the longest day, you could determine the <emph rend="ital">clima</emph> and consequently

the position of a place. This was equivalent to observing the elevation

of the pole. At the end of this second book Strabo enters into a long

description of the <emph rend="ital">climata.</emph></note> of both the places are found

to be similar. Now Philo, in his account of a voyage by sea

to Ethiopia, has given us the <emph rend="ital">clima</emph> of Meroe. He says that at

that place the sun is vertical forty-five days before the summer solstice,<note anchored="yes">This observation, taken at the time of Hipparchus, would indicate a

latitude of 16° 48′ 34″.</note> he also informs us of the proportion of shadow

thrown by the gnomon both at the equinoxes and solstices.

Eratosthenes agrees almost exactly with Philo. But not a

single writer, not even Eratosthenes, has informed us of the

<emph rend="ital">clima</emph> of India; but if it is the case, as many are inclined to

believe on the authority of Nearchus,<note anchored="yes">Nearchus in speaking of the southern extremity of India, near Cape

Comorin, was correct in the assertion that in his time the two Bears

were there seen to set.</note> that the two Bears

are seen to set in that country, then certainly Meroe and

the southern extremity of India cannot be under the same

parallel.</q><note anchored="yes">Hipparchus fixed the latitude of Meroe at 16° 51′ 25″, and the extremity of India at 18°. In the time of Alexander, the Lesser Bear was

not observed to set for either of these latitudes. Strabo therefore drew

the conclusion, that if Hipparchus had adopted the opinion of Nearchus,

he would have fixed the extremity of India south of Meroe, instead of

north of that city.</note> [Such is the reasoning of Hipparchus, but we

reply,] If Eratosthenes confirms the statement of those authors



<pb n="120"/>



who tell us that in India the two Bears are observed to set,

how can it be said that not a single person, not even Eratosthenes, has informed us of any thing concerning the <emph rend="ital">clima</emph> of

India? This is itself information on that point. If, however, he has not confirmed this statement, let him be exonerated from the error. Certain it is he never did confirm the

statement. Only when Deimachus affirmed that there was no

place in India from which the two Bears might be seen to set,

or the shadows fall both ways, as Megasthenes had asserted,

Eratosthenes thereupon taxed him with ignorance, regarding as absolutely false this two-fold assertion, one half of

which, namely, that concerning the shadows not falling both

ways, Hipparchus himself acknowledged to be false; for if

the southern extremity of India were not under the same

parallel as Meroe, still Hipparchus appears to have considered

it south of Syene.

<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the instances which follow, Hipparchus, treating of

these subjects, either asserts things similar to those which we

have already refuted, or takes for granted matters which are

not so, or draws improper sequences. For instance, from the

computation [of Eratosthenes] that the distance from Babylon to Thapsacus<note anchored="yes">Now Ruins, near Jerobolos, or Jerabees, the ancient Europus; not

Deer or Deir.</note> is 4800 stadia, and thence northward to

the mountains of Armenia<note anchored="yes">Probably the present Barena, a branch of the Taurus</note> 2100 stadia more, it does not follow that, starting from the meridian of that city, the distance

to the northern mountains is above 6000 stadia. Besides,

Eratosthenes never says that the distance from Thapsacus to

these mountains is 2100 stadia, but that a part thereof has

never yet been measured; so that this argument [of Hipparchus], founded on a false hypothesis, amounts to nothing. Nor

(lid Eratosthenes ever assert that Thapsacus lies more than

4500 stadia north of Babylon.

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, Hipparchus, ever anxious to defend the [accuracy of the] ancient charts, instead of fairly stating the words

of Eratosthenes concerning his third section of the habitable

earth, wilfully makes him the author of an assertion easy of

disproof. For Eratosthenes, following the opinion we before

mentioned, that a line drawn from the Pillars of Hercules

across the Mediterranean, and the length of the Taurus, would



<pb n="121"/>



run due west and east,<note anchored="yes">This is rather free, but the text could not well otherwise be rendered

intelligibly.</note> divides, by means of this line, the habit-

able earth into two portions, which he calls the northern and

southern divisions; each of these he again essays to subdivide

into as many smaller partitions as practicable, which he denominates sections.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">sfo|agi/das</foreign> is the Greek word; for which <emph rend="ital">section</emph> is a poor equivalent,

but the best we believe the language affords.</note> He makes India the first section of the

southern part, and Ariana<note anchored="yes">The name of a considerable portion of Asia.</note> the second; these two countries possessing a good outline, he has been able not only to give us an

accurate statement of their length and breadth, but an almost

geometrically exact description of their figure. He tells us that

the form of India is rhomboidal, being washed on two of its sides

by the southern and eastern oceans [respectively], which do not

deeply indent its shores, The two remaining sides are contained

by its mountains and the river [Indus], so that it presents a

kind of rectilinear figure.<note anchored="yes">From Eratosthenes' description of India, preserved by our author in

his 15th book, we gather that he conceived the country to be something in

the form of an irregular quadrilateral, having one right, two obtuse, and

one acute angle, consequently none of its sides parallel to each other. On

the whole Eratosthenes' idea of the country was not near so exact as

that of Megasthenes.</note> As to Ariana, he considered three

of its sides well fitted to form a parallelogram; but of the

western side he could give no regular definition, as it was inhabited by various nations; nevertheless he attempts an idea

of it by a line drawn from the Caspian Gates<note anchored="yes">The Caspian Gates are now known as the Strait of Firouz Koh.</note> to the limits

of Carmania, which border on the Persian Gulf. This side

he calls western, and that next the Indus eastern, but he does

not tell us they are parallel to each other; neither does he say

this of the other sides, one bounded by the mountains, and the

other by the sea; he simply calls them north and south.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Having in this manner but imperfectly traced the outlines of his second section, the third section, for various reasons, is still less exact. The first cause has been already

explained, viz. that the line from the Caspian Gates to Carmania is not clearly defined, as the side of the section is

common both to the third and second sections. Secondly,

on account of the Persian Gulf interrupting the continuity of



<pb n="122"/>



the southern side, as he himself tells us, he has been obliged to

take the measured road running through Susa and Persepolis to

the boundaries of Carmania and Persia, and suppose it straight.<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Babylon, still called Babil, are on the Euphrates, neat

Hilleh. Susa is now Suz or Schuss, and not Schoster or Toster. The

ruins of Persepolis remain, and may be seen near Istakar, Tchilminan

and Nakchi-Rustan.</note>

This road, which he calls the southern side, is a little more than

9000 stadia. He does not, however, tell us, that it runs parallel

to the northern side. It is also clear that the Euphrates, which

he makes the western boundary, is any thing but a straight

line. On leaving the mountains it flows south, but soon shifts

its course to the east; it then again pursues a southerly direction till it reaches the sea. In fact, Eratosthenes himself

acknowledges the indirect course of this river, when he compares the shape of Mesopotamia, which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, to the cushion on a rower's

bench. The western side bounded by the Euphrates is not

entirely measured; for he tells us that he does not know the

extent of the portion between Armenia and the northern

mountains,<note anchored="yes">Between Thapsacus and Armenia.</note> as it has not been measured. By reason of these

hinderances he states that he has been only able to give a very

superficial view of the third section, and that his estimate of

the distances is borrowed from various Itineraries, some of

them, according to his own description, anonymous. Hipparchus therefore must be considered guilty of unfairness, for

criticising with geometrical precision a work of this general

nature. We ought rather to be grateful to a person who gives

us any description at all of the character of such [unknown]

places. But when he urges his geometrical objections not

against any real statement of Eratosthenes, but merely against

imaginary hypotheses of his own creation, he shows too plainly

the contradictory bent of his mind.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is in this general kind of description of the third

section that Eratosthenes supposes 10,000 stadia from the

Caspian Gates to the Euphrates. This he again divides

according to former admeasurements which he found preserved. Starting from the point where the Euphrates passes

near to Thapsacus, he computes from thence to the place

where Alexander crossed the Tigris 2400 stadia. The route



<pb n="123"/>



thence through Gaugamela,<note anchored="yes">Karmelis.</note> the Lycus,<note anchored="yes">The Altun-Suyi, or River of Gold.</note> Arbela,<note anchored="yes">Erbil.</note> and Ecbatana,<note anchored="yes">Hamedan.</note> whither Darius fled from Gaugamela to the Caspian

Gates, makes up the 10,000 stadia, which is only 300 stadia

too much. Such is the measure of the northern side given

by Eratosthenes, which he could not have supposed to be parallel to the mountains, nor yet to the line drawn from the

Pillars of Hercules through Athens and Rhodes. For Thapsacus is far removed from the mountains, and the route from

Thapsacus to the Caspian Gates only falls in with the mountains at that point.<note anchored="yes">Viz. at the Gates of the Caspian</note> Such is the boundary on the northern

side.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Thus, says Eratosthenes, we have given you a description

of the northern side; as for the southern, we cannot take its

measure along the sea, on account of the Persian Gulf,

which intercepts [its continuity], but from Babylon through

Susa and Persepolis to the confines of Persia and Carmania

there are 9200 stadia. This he calls the southern side, but

he does not say it is parallel to the northern. The difference of length between the northern and southern sides is

caused, he tells us, by the Euphrates, which after running

south some distance shifts its course almost due east.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of the two remaining sides, he describes the western

first, but whether we are to regard it as one single straight

line, or two, seems to be undecided. He says,—From Thapsacus to Babylon, following the course of the Euphrates, there

are 4800 stadia; from thence to the mouth of the Euphrates<note anchored="yes">This ancient embouchure of the Euphrates is now known as Khor-

Abdillah.</note>

and the city of Teredon, 3000<note anchored="yes">Read 3300.</note> more; from Thapsacus northward to the Gates of Armenia, having been measured, is

stated to be <date value="1100">1100</date> stadia, but the distance through Gordyæa

and Armenia, not having yet been measured, is not given.

The eastern side, which stretches lengthwise through

Persia from the Red Sea towards Media and the north,

does not appear to be less than 8000 stadia, and measured

from certain headlands above 9000, the rest of the distance

through Parætacena and Media to the Caspian Gates being

3000 stadia. The rivers Tigris and Euphrates flowing

from Armenia towards the south, after having passed the



<pb n="124"/>



Gordytæan mountains, and having formed a great circle which

embraces the vast country of Mesopotamia, turn towards the

rising of the sun in winter and the south, particularly the

Euphrates, which, continually approaching nearer and nearer

to the Tigris, passes by the rampart of Semiramis,<note anchored="yes">Thought by Col. Rawlinson to be the Chal-i-Nimrud, usually sup.

posed to mark the site of the Median wall of Xenophon.</note> and at

about 200 stadia from the village of Opis,<note anchored="yes">Situated on the Tigris.</note> thence it flows

through Babylon, and so discharges itself into the Persian

Gulf. Thus the figure of Mesopotamia and Babylon resembles the cushion of a rower's bench.—Such are the words of

Eratosthenes.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the Third Section it is true he does make some mistakes, which we shall take into consideration; but they are

nothing like the amount which Hipparchus attributes to

him. However, we will examine his objections. [In the

first place,] he would have the ancient charts left just as

they are, and by no means India brought more to the south,

as Eratosthenes thinks proper. Indeed, he asserts that the

very arguments adduced by that writer only confirm him the

more in his opinion. He says, <q direct="unspecified">According to Eratosthenes,

the northern side of the third section is bounded by a line of

10,000 stadia drawn from the Caspian Gates to the Euphrates,

the southern side from Babylon to the confines of Carmania

is a little more than 9000 stadia. On the western side, following the course of the Euphrates, from Thapsacus to Babylon

there are 4800 stadia, and thence to the outlets of the river

3000 stadia more. Northward from Thapsacus [to the Gates

of Armenia] is reckoned <date value="1100">1100</date> stadia; the rest has not been

measured. Now since Eratosthenes says that the northern

side of this Third Section is about 10,000 stadia, and that the

right line parallel thereto drawn from Babylon to the eastern

side is computed at just above 9000 stadia, it follows that

<p>We answer, that if the Caspian Gates and the boundary

line of Carmania and Persia were exactly under the same meridian, and if right lines drawn in the direction of Thapsacus

and Babylon would intersect such meridian at right angles,



<pb n="125"/>



the inference would be just.<note anchored="yes">A line drawn from the frontiers of Carmania to Babylon would form

with the meridian an angle of about 500. One from the Caspian Gates

to Thapsacus would form with the parallel merely an angle of about 30°</note> For then the line [from the

common frontier of Carmania and Persia] to Babylon if produced to the meridian of Thapsacus, would appear to the eye

equal, or nearly equal, to that from the Caspian Gates to

Thapsacus. Consequently, Babylon would only be east of

Thapsacus in the same proportion as the line drawn from the

Caspian Gates to Thapsacus exceeds the line drawn from the

frontier of Carmania to Babylon.<note anchored="yes">Namely, 1000 stadia, by the hypothesis of Hipparchus, or 800 according to Eratosthenes.</note> Eratosthenes, however,

does not tell us that the line which bounds the western coast

of Ariana follows the direction of the meridian; nor yet that

a line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus would form

right angles with the meridian of the Caspian Gates. But

rather, that the line which would form right angles with the

meridian, would be one which should follow the course of the

Taurus, and with which the line drawn from the Caspian

Gates to Thapsacus would form an acute angle. Nor, again,

does he ever say that a line drawn from Carmania to Babylon

would be parallel to that drawn [from the Caspian Gates] to

Thapsacus; and even if it were parallel, this would prove

nothing for the argument of Hipparchus, since it does not

form right angles with the meridian of the Caspian Gates.

<milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But taking this for granted, and proving, as he imagines,

that, according to Eratosthenes, Babylon is east of Thapsacus

rather more than 1000 stadia, he draws from this false hypothesis a new argument, which he uses to the following

purpose; and says, If we suppose a right line drawn from

Thapsacus towards the south, and another from Babylon perpendicular thereto, a right-angled triangle would be the result;

whose sides should be, 1. A line drawn from Thapsacus to

Babylon; 2. A perpendicular drawn from Babylon to the

meridian of Thapsacus; 3. The meridian line of Thapsacus.

The hypotenuse of this triangle would be a right line drawn

from Thapsacus to Babylon, which he estimates at 4800 stadia.

The perpendicular drawn from Babylon to the meridian of

Thapsacus is scarcely more than 1000 stadia; the same

amount by which the line drawn [from the Caspian Gates] to



<pb n="126"/>



Thapsacus exceeds that [from the common frontier of Carmania and Persia] to Babylon. The two sides [of the triangle] being given, Hipparchus proceeds to find the third,

which is much greater than the perpendicular<note anchored="yes">Or second side.</note> aforesaid. To

this he adds the line drawn from Thapsacus northwards to

the mountains of Armenia, one part of which, according to

Eratosthenes, was measured, and found to be <date value="1100">1100</date> stadia; the

other, or part unmeasured by Eratosthenes, Hipparchus estimates to be 1000 stadia at the least: so that the two together

amount to 2100 stadia. Adding this to the [length of the]

side upon which falls the perpendicular drawn from Babylon,

Hipparchus estimated a distance of many thousand stadia

from the mountains of Armenia and the parallel of Athens

to this perpendicular, which falls on the parallel of Babylon.<note anchored="yes">Hipparchus found by this operation that the distance from the parallel of Babylon to that of the mountains of Armenia was 6795 stadia.</note>

From the parallel of Athens<note anchored="yes">See Humboldt, Cosmos ii. p. 556, note, Bohn's edition.</note> to that of Babylon he shows

that there cannot be a greater distance than 2400 stadia, even

admitting the estimate supplied by Eratosthenes himself of

the number of stadia which the entire meridian contains;<note anchored="yes">Eratosthenes estimated 252,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth.</note>

and that if this be so, the mountains of Armenia and the

Taurus cannot be under the same parallel of latitude as

Athens, (which is the opinion of' Eratosthenes,) but many

thousand stadia to the north, as the data supplied by that

writer himself prove.
</p><p>But here, for the formation of his right-angled triangle, Hipparchus not only makes use of propositions already overturned,

but assumes what was never granted, namely, that the hypotenuse subtending his right angle, which is the straight line

from Thapsacus to Babylon, is 4800 stadia in length. What

Eratosthenes says is, that this route follows the course of the

Euphrates, and adds, that Mesopotamia and Babylon are encompassed as it were by a great circle formed by the Euphrates and

Tigris, but principally by the former of these rivers. So that

a straight line from Thapsacus to Babylon would neither follow

the course of the Euphrates, nor yet be near so many stadia

in length. Thus the argument [of Hipparchus] is overturned.

We have stated before, that supposing two lines drawn from



<pb n="127"/>



the Caspian Gates, one to Thapsacus, and the other to

the mountains of Armenia opposite Thapsacus, and distant

therefrom, according to Hipparchus's own estimate, 2100

stadia at the very least, neither of them would be parallel to

each other, nor yet to that line which, passing through Babylon, is styled by Eratosthenes the southern side [of the third

section]. As he could not inform us of the exact length of

the route by the mountains, Eratosthenes tells us the distance between Thapsacus and the Caspian Gates; in fact, to

speak in a general way, he puts this distance in place of the

other; besides, as he merely wanted to give the length of the

territory between Ariana and the Euphrates, he was not particular to have the exact measure of either route. To pretend

that he considered the lines to be parallel to each other, is

evidently to accuse the man of more than childish ignorance,

and we dismiss the insinuation as nonsense forthwith.

<milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There, however, are some instances in which one may

justly accuse Eratosthenes. There is a difference in dissecting <emph rend="ital">limb by limb,</emph> or merely cutting off <emph rend="ital">portions</emph> [indiscriminately], (for in the former you may only separate parts having

a natural outline, and distinguished by a regular form; this

the poet alludes to in the expression,

<l>Cutting them limb from limb;<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote></quote><bibl>Odyssey ix. 291; Iliad xxiv. 409</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey ix. 291; Iliad xxiv. 409</bibl></cit>



whereas in regard to the latter this is not the case,) and we

may adopt with propriety either one or other of these plans

according to the time and necessity. So in Geography, if you

enter into every detail, you may sometimes be compelled to

divide your territories into <emph rend="ital">portions,</emph> so to speak, but it is a more

preferable way to separate them into limbs, than into such

chance pieces; for thus only you can define accurately particular

<emph rend="ital">points and boundaries,</emph> a thing so necessary to the geographer.

When it can be done, the best way to define a country is by

the rivers, mountains, or sea; also, where possible, by the

nation or nations [who inhabit it], and by its size and configuration. However, in default of a geometrical definition,

a simple and general description may be said always to answer the purpose. In regard to size, it is sufficient to state

the greatest length and breadth; for example, that the habit-



<pb n="128"/>



able earth is 70,000 stadia long, and that its breadth is scarcely

half its length.<note anchored="yes">Strabo estimated the length of the continent at 70,000 stadia from

Cape St. Vincent to Cape Comorin, and 29,300 stadia as its breadth.</note> And as to form, to compare a country to

any geometrical or other well-known figure. For example,

Sicily to a triangle, Spain to an ox-hide, or the Peloponnesus

to a plane-leaf.<note anchored="yes">The ancient geographers often speak of these kind of resemblances.

They have compared the whole habitable earth to a soldier's cloak or

mantle, as also the town of Alexandria, which they styled <foreign lang="greek">xlamudoeide/s.</foreign> Italy at one time to a leaf of parsley, at another to an oak-leaf. Sardinia to a human foot-print. The isle of Naxos to a vine-leaf. Cyprus

to a sheep-skin; and the Black Sea to a Scythian bow, bent. The earliest coins of Peloponnesus, struck about 750 years before the Christian

era, bear the impress of a tortoise, because that animal abounded on

the shores, and the divisions and height of its shell were thought to offer

some likeness to the territorial divisions of the little states of Peloponnesus and the mountain-ridges which run through the middle of that

country. The Sicilians took for their symbol three thighs and legs,

arranged in such an order that the bended knees might resemble the

three capes of that island and its triangular form.</note> The larger the territory to be divided, the

more general also ought its divisions to be.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>[In the system of Eratosthenes], the habitable earth

has been admirably divided into two parts by the Taurus and

the Mediterranean Sea, which reaches to the Pillars. On the

southern side, the limits of India have been described by a

variety of methods; by its mountains,<note anchored="yes">The chain of the Taurus.</note> its river,<note anchored="yes">The Indus.</note> its seas,<note anchored="yes">The Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.</note>

and its name,<note anchored="yes">India.</note> which seems to indicate that it is inhabited

only by one people.<note anchored="yes">Viz. Indians.</note> It is with justice too that he attributes

to it the form of a quadrilateral or rhomboid. Ariana is not

so accurately described, on account of its western side being

interwoven with the adjacent land. Still it is pretty well

distinguished by its three other sides, which are formed by

three nearly straight lines, and also by its name, which shows

it to be only one nation.<note anchored="yes">Ariana, or the nation of the Arians.</note> As to the Third Section of Eratos-

thenes, it cannot be considered to be defined or circumscribed

at all; for that side of it which is common to Ariana is but

ill defined, as before remarked. The southern side, too,

is most negligently taken: it is, in fact, no boundary to the

section at all, for it passes right through its centre, leaving

entirely outside of it many of the southern portions. Nor



<pb n="129"/>



yet does it represent the greatest length of the section, for

the northern side is the longest.<note anchored="yes">By 800 stadia.</note> Nor, lastly, can the Euphrates be its western boundary, not even if it flowed in a

right line, since its two extremes<note anchored="yes">Viz. of the Euphrates.</note> do not lie under the same

meridian. How then is it the western rather than the southern boundary? Apart from this, the distance to the Seas of

Cilicia and Syria is so inconsiderable, that there can be no

reason why he should not have enlarged the third section,

so as to include the kingdoms of Semiramis and Ninus, who

are both of them known as Syrian monarchs; the first built

Babylon, which he made his royal residence; the second

Ninus,<note anchored="yes">Or Nineveh.</note> the capital of Syria;<note anchored="yes">Syria, properly so called, extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. Between the Euphrates and the Tigris lay

Mesopotamia, and beyond the Tigris, Assyria. The whole of these

countries formerly bore the name of Syria. The Hebrews denominated

Mesopotamia, Syria of the Rivers. The name Assyria seems to be nothing more than Syria with the article prefixed. Nineveh stood on the

eastern bank of the Tigris.</note> and the same dialect still exists on both sides of the Euphrates. The idea of thus dismembering so renowned a nation, and allotting its portions

to strange nations with which it had no connexion, is as peculiarly unfortunate. Eratosthenes cannot plead that he was

compelled to do this on account of its size, for had it extended

as far as the sea and the frontiers of Arabia Felix and Egypt,

even then it would not have been as large as India, or even

Ariana. It would have therefore been much better to have

enlarged the third section, making it comprehend the whole

space as far as the Sea of Syria; but if this were done, the

southern side would not be as he represents it, nor yet in a

straight line, but starting from Carmania would follow the

right side of the sea-shore from the Persian Gulf to the

mouth of the Euphrates; it would then approach the limits

of Mesene<note anchored="yes">Mesene comprehends the low and sandy grounds traversed by the

Euphrates, immediately before it discharges itself into the Persian Gulf.</note> and Babylon, where the Isthmus commences

which separates Arabia Felix from the rest of the continent.

Traversing the Isthmus, it would continue its course to the

recess of the Arabian Gulf and Pelusium,<note anchored="yes">Tineh.</note> thence to the

mouth of the Nile at Canopus.<note anchored="yes">Moadieh, near to Aboukir.</note> Such would be the southern

side. The west would be traced by the sea-shore from the

[river's] mouth at Canopus to Cilicia.<note anchored="yes">Along the coasts of Egypt, past Palestine and Syria, to the recess

of the Gulf of Issus, where Cilicia commences.</note>

<milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The fourth section would consist of Arabia Felix,

the Arabian Gulf, and the whole of Egypt and Ethiopia. Its

length bounded by two meridians, one drawn through its most

western point, the other through its most eastern; and its

breadth by two parallels through its most northern and southern points. For this is the best way to describe the extent

of irregular figures, whose length and breadth cannot be determined by their sides.
</p><p>In general it is to be observed, that length and breadth are

to be understood in different ways, according as you speak of

the whole or a part. Of a whole, the greater distance is

called its length, and the lesser its breadth; of a part, that

is to be considered the length which is parallel to the length

of the whole, without any regard whether it, or that

which is left for the breadth, be the greater distance. The

length of the whole habitable earth is measured from east to

west by a line drawn parallel to the equator, and its breadth

from north to south in the direction of the meridian; consequently, the length of any of the parts ought to be portions

of a line drawn parallel to the length of the whole, and their

breadth to the breadth of the whole. For, in the first place,

by this means the size of the whole habitable earth will be

best described; and secondly, the disposition and configuration

of its parts, and the manner in which one may be said to be

greater or less than another, will be made manifest by thus

comparing them.

<milestone n="33" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes, however, measures the length of the

habitable earth by a line which he considers straight, drawn

from the Pillars of Hercules, in the direction of the Caspian

Gates and the Caucasus. The length of the third section,

by a line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Thapsacus,

and of the fourth, by one running from Thapsacus through

Heroopolis to the country surrounded by the Nile: this

must necessarily be deflected to Canopus and Alexandria,

for there is the last mouth of the Nile, which goes by the

name of the Canopic<note anchored="yes">Canopus, near to Aboukir.</note> or Heracleotic mouth. Whether



<pb n="131"/>



therefore these two lengths be considered to form one

straight line, or to make an angle with Thapsacus, certain it is that neither of them is parallel to the length of the

habitable earth; this is evident from what Eratosthenes has

himself said concerning them. According to him the length

of the habitable earth is described by a right line running

through the Taurus to the Pillars of Hercules, in the direction of the Caucasus, Rhodes, and Athens. From Rhodes to

Alexandria, following the meridian of the two cities, he says

there cannot be much less than 4000 stadia,<note anchored="yes">It was a mistake common to Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and Strabo,

to fancy that Rhodes and Alexandria were under the same meridian. The

Longitude of the two cities differs by 2° 22′ 45″.</note> consequently there

must be the same difference between the latitudes of Rhodes

and Alexandria. Now the latitude of Heroopolis is about the

same as Alexandria, or rather more south. So that a line,

whether straight or broken, which intersects the parallel of

Heroopolis, Rhodes, or the Gates of the Caspian, cannot be

parallel to either of these. These lengths therefore are

not properly indicated, nor are the northern sections any

better.

<milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We will now return at once to Hipparchus, and see

what comes next. Continuing to palm assumptions of his own

[upon Eratosthenes], he goes on to refute, with geometrical

accuracy, statements which that author had made in a mere

general way. <q direct="unspecified">Eratosthenes,</q> he says, <q direct="unspecified">estimates that there

are 6700 stadia between Babylon and the Caspian Gates,

and from Babylon to the frontiers of Carmania and Persia

above 9000 stadia; this he supposes to lie in a direct line

towards the equinoctial rising,<note anchored="yes">Due east.</note> and perpendicular to the common side of his second and third sections. Thus, according

to his plan, we should have a right-angled triangle, with the

right angle next to the frontiers of Carmania, and its hypotenuse less than one of the sides about the right angle!

Consequently Persia should be included in the second section.</q><note anchored="yes">The following is a <emph rend="ital">Resumé</emph> of the argument of Hipparchus, <q direct="unspecified">The

hypotenuse of the supposed triangle, or the line drawn from Babylon to

the Caspian Gates being only 6700 stadia, would be necessarily shorter

than either of the other sides, since the line from Babylon to the frontiers of Carmania is estimated by Eratosthenes at 9170, and that from

the frontiers of Carmania to the Caspian Gates above 9000 stadia.

The frontiers of Carmania would thus be east of the Caspian Gates,

and Persia would consequently be comprised, not in the third, but in the

second section of Eratosthenes, being east of the meridian of the Caspian

Gates, which was the boundary of the two sections.</q> Strabo, in the text,

points out the falsity of this argument.</note>



<pb n="132"/>


</p><p>To this we reply, that the line drawn from Babylon to Carmania was never intended as a parallel, nor yet that which

divides the two sections as a meridian, and that therefore nothing has been laid to his charge, at all events with any just

foundation. In fact, Eratosthenes having stated the number

of stadia from the Caspian Gates to Babylon as above

given,<note anchored="yes">Viz. 6700 stadia.</note> [from the Caspian Gates] to Susa 4900 stadia,

and from Babylon [to Susa] 3400 stadia, Hipparchus runs

away from his former hypothesis, and says that [by drawing lines from] the Caspian Gates, Susa, and Babylon,

an obtuse-angled triangle would be the result, whose sides

should be of the length laid down, and of which Susa

would form the obtuse angle. He then argues, that <q direct="unspecified">according to these premises, the meridian drawn from the Gates of

the Caspian will intersect the parallel of Babylon and Susa

4400 stadia more to the west, than would a straight line

drawn from the Caspian to the confines of Carmania and

Persia; and that this last line, forming with the meridian of

the Caspian Gates half a right angle, would lie exactly

in a direction midway between the south and the equinoctial

rising. Now as the course of the Indus is parallel to this

line, it cannot flow south on its descent from the mountains, as

Eratosthenes asserts, but in a direction lying between the

south and the equinoctial rising, as laid down in the ancient

charts.</q> But who is there who will admit this to be an obtuse-angled triangle, without also admitting that it contains a

right angle? Who will agree that the line from Babylon to

Susa, which forms one side of this obtuse-angled triangle, lies

parallel, without admitting the same of the whole line as far

as Carmania? or that the line drawn from the Caspian Gates

to the frontiers of Carmania is parallel to the Indus? Nevertheless, without this the reasoning [of Hipparchus] is worth

nothing
</p><p><q direct="unspecified">Eratosthenes himself also states,</q> [continues Hipparchus,<note anchored="yes">These two words, <emph rend="ital">continues Hipparchus,</emph> are not in the text, but the argument is undoubtedly his.</note>]



<pb n="133"/>



<q direct="unspecified">that the form of India is rhomboidal; and since the whole

eastern border of that country has a decided tendency towards the east, but more particularly the extremest cape,<note anchored="yes">Cape Comorin.</note>

which lies more to the south than any other part of the coast,

the side next the Indus must be the same.</q>

<milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These arguments may be very geometrical, but they

are not convincing. After having himself invented these

various difficulties, he dismisses them, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Had [Eratosthenes] been chargeable for small distances only, he might

have been excused; but since his mistakes involve thousands

of stadia, we cannot pardon him, more especially since he has

laid it down that at a mere distance of 400 stadia,<note anchored="yes">400 stadia, allowing 700 to a degree, would give 34′ 17″ latitude.

According to present astronomical calculations, the distance between the

parallels of Rhodes and Athens is 1° 36′ 30″.</note> such as

that between the parallels of Athens and Rhodes, there is a

sensible variation [of latitude].</q> But these sensible variations

are not all of the same kind, the distance [involved therein]

being in some instances greater, in others less; greater, when

for our estimate of the climata we trust merely to the eye, or

are guided by the vegetable productions and the temperature

of the air; less, when we employ gnomons and dioptric instruments. Nothing is more likely than that if you measure

the parallel of Athens, or that of Rhodes and Caria, by means

of a gnomon, the difference resulting from so many stadia<note anchored="yes">Viz. 400 stadia, or 34′ 17″ of latitude.</note>

will be sensible. But when a geographer, in order to trace a

line from west to east, 3000 stadia broad, makes use of a chain

of mountains 40,000 stadia long, and also of a sea which extends still farther 30,000 stadia, and farther wishing to point

out the situation of the different parts of the habitable earth

relative to this line, calls some southern, others northern, and

finally lays out what he calls the sections, each section consisting of divers countries, then we ought carefully to examine

in what acceptation he uses his terms; in what sense he says

that such a side [of any section] is the north side, and what

other is the south, or east, or west side. If he does not take

pains to avoid great errors, he deserves to be blamed, but

should he be guilty merely of trifling inaccuracies, he should

be forgiven. But here nothing shows thoroughly that Era-



<pb n="134"/>



tosthenes has committed either serious or slight errors, for on

one hand what he may have said concerning such great distances, can never be verified by a geometrical test, and on

the other, his accuser, while endeavouring to reason like a

geometrician, does not found his arguments on any real data,

but on gratuitous suppositions.

<milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The fourth section Hipparchus certainly manages

better, though he still maintains the same censorious tone,

and obstinacy in sticking to his first hypotheses, or others

similar. He properly objects to Eratosthenes giving as the

length of this section a line drawn from Thapsacus to Egypt,

as being similar to the case of a man who should tell us that

the diagonal of a parallelogram was its length. For Thapsacus and the coasts of Egypt are by no means under the

same parallel of latitude, but under parallels considerably

distant from each other,<note anchored="yes">The difference of latitude between Thapsacus and Pelusium is about 4° 27′.</note> and a line drawn from Thapsacus to

Egypt would lie in a kind of diagonal or oblique direction

between them. But he is wrong when he expresses his surprise that Eratosthenes should dare to state the distance between Pelusium and Thapsacus at 6000 stadia, when he says

there are above 8000. In proof of this he advances that the

parallel of Pelusium is south of that of Babylon by more than

2500 stadia, and that according to Eratosthenes (as he supposes)

the latitude of Thapsacus is above 4800 stadia north of that

of Babylon; from which Hipparchus tells us it results that

[between Thapsacus and Pelusium] there are more than

8000 stadia. But I would inquire how he can prove that

Eratosthenes supposed so great a distance between the parallels of Babylon and Thapsacus? He says, indeed, that such

is the distance from Thapsacus to Babylon, but not that there

is this distance between their parallels, nor yet that Thapsacus

and Babylon are under the same meridian. So much the

contrary, that Hipparchus has himself pointed out, that, according to Eratosthenes, Babylon ought to be east of Thapsacus

more than 2000 stadia. We have before cited the statement

of Eratosthenes, that Mesopotamia and Babylon are encircled

by the Tigris and Euphrates, and that the greater portion of

the Circle is formed by this latter river, which flowing north

and south takes a turn to the east, and then, returning to a



<pb n="135"/>



southerly direction, discharges itself [into the sea]. So long

as it flows from north to south, it may be said to follow a

southerly direction; but the turning towards the east and

Babylon is a decided deviation from the southerly direction,

and it never recovers a straight course, but forms the circuit

we have mentioned above. When he tells us that the journey

from Babylon to Thapsacus is 4800 stadia, he adds, following

the course of the Euphrates, as if on purpose lest any one

should understand such to be the distance in a direct line, or

between the two parallels. If this be not granted, it is altogether a vain attempt to show that if a right-angled triangle

were constructed by lines drawn from Pelusium and Thapsacus to the point where the parallel of Thapsacus intercepts

the meridian of Pelusium, that one of the lines which form the

right angle, and is in the direction of the meridian, would be

longer than that forming the hypotenuse drawn from Thapsacus to Pelusium.<note anchored="yes">The text here is evidently corrupt.</note> Worthless, too, is the argument in connexion with this, being the inference from a proposition not

admitted; for Eratosthenes never asserts that from Babylon to

the meridian of the Caspian Gates is a distance of 4800

stadia. We have shown that Hipparchus deduces this from

data not admitted by Eratosthenes; but desirous to controvert

every thing advanced by that writer, he assumes that from

Babylon to the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to the

mountains of Carmania, according to Eratosthenes' description, there are above 9000 stadia, and from thence draws his

conclusions.

<milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes<note anchored="yes">Gosselin makes some sensible remarks on this section; we have endeavoured to render it accurately, but much fear that the true meaning

of Strabo is now obscured by corruptions in the text.</note> cannot, therefore, be found fault with on

these grounds; what may be objected against him is as follows.

When you wish to give a general outline of size and configuration, you should devise for yourself some rule which

may be adhered to more or less. After having laid down

that the breadth of the space occupied by the mountains

which run in a direction due east, as well as by the sea which

reaches to the Pillars of Hercules, is 3000 stadia, would you

pretend to estimate different lines, which you may draw within

the breadth of that space, as one and the same line? We



<pb n="136"/>



should be more willing to grant you the power of doing so

with respect to the lines which run parallel to that space than

with those which fall upon it; and among these latter,

rather with respect to those which fall within it than to

those which extend without it; and also rather for those

which, in regard to the shortness of their extent, would not

pass out of the said space than for those which would. And

again, rather for lines of some considerable length than for any

thing very short, for the inequality of lengths is less perceptible in great extents than the difference of configuration.

For example, if you give 3000 stadia for the breadth at the

Taurus, as well as for the sea which extends to the Pillars of

Hercules, you will form a parallelogram entirely enclosing

both the mountains of the Taurus and the sea; if you divide it

in its length into several other parallelograms, and draw first

the diagonal of the great parallelogram, and next that of

each smaller parallelogram, surely the diagonal of the great

parallelogram will be regarded as a line more nearly parallel

and equal to the side forming the length of that figure than

the diagonal of any of the smaller parallelograms: and the

more your lesser parallelograms should be multiplied, the

more will this become evident. Certainly, it is in great

figures that the obliquity of the diagonal and its difference

from the side forming the length are the less perceptible, so that

you would have but little scruple in taking the diagonal as

the length of the figure. But if you draw the diagonal more

inclined, so that it falls beyond both sides, or at least beyond

one of the sides, then will this no longer be the case; and

this is the sense in which we have observed, that when you attempted to draw even in a very general way the extents of

the figures, you ought to adopt some rule. But Eratosthenes

takes a line from the Caspian Gates along the mountains,

running as it were in the same parallel as far as the Pillars,

and then a second line, starting directly from the mountains

to touch Thapsacus; and again a third line from Thapsacus

to the frontiers of Egypt, occupying so great a breadth. If then

in proceeding you give the length of the two last lines [taken

together] as the measure of the length of the district, you will

appear to measure the length of one of your parallelograms by

its diagonal. And if, farther, this diagonal should consist of

a broken line, as that would be which stretches from the



<pb n="137"/>



Caspian Gates to the embouchure of the Nile, passing by

Thapsacus, your error will appear much greater. This is the

sum of what may be alleged against Eratosthenes.

<p>In another respect also we have to complain of Hipparchus, because, as he had given a category of the statements of Eratosthenes, he ought to have corrected his mistakes, in the same way that we have done; but whenever he

has any thing particular to remark, he tells us to follow the

ancient charts, which, to say the least, need correction infinitely more than the map of Eratosthenes.
</p><p>The argument which follows is equally objectionable, being

founded on the consequences of a proposition which, as we

have shown, is inadmissible, namely, that Babylon was not

more than 1000 stadia east of Thapsacus; when it was

quite clear, from Eratosthenes' own words, that Babylon

was above 2400 stadia east of that place; since from Thapsacus to the passage of the Euphrates where it was crossed

by Alexander, the shortest route is 2400 stadia, and the

Tigris and Euphrates, having encompassed Mesopotamia,

flow towards the east, and afterwards take a southerly direction and approach nearer to each other and to Babylon at

the same time: nothing appears absurd in this statement of

Eratosthenes.

<milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The next objection of Hipparchus is likewise false.

He attempts to prove that Eratosthenes, in his statement

that the route from Thapsacus to the Caspian Gates is

10,000 stadia, gives this as the distance taken in a straight

line; such not being the case, as in that instance the distance

would be much shorter. His mode of reasoning is after this

fashion. He says, <q direct="unspecified">According to Eratosthenes, the mouth

of the Nile at Canopus,<note anchored="yes">Moadieh, the mouth of the river close to Aboukir.</note> and the Cyaneæ,<note anchored="yes">Certain little islets at the mouth of the canal of Constantinople, in the

Black Sea. These islands want about a degree and a quarter of being

under the same meridian as Moadieh.</note> are under the

same meridian, which is distant from that of Thapsacus 6300

stadia. Now from the Cyaneæ to Mount Caspius, which is

situated close to the defile<note anchored="yes">Gosselin remarks, that the defile intended by Strabo, was probably

the valley of the river Kur, or the ancient Cyrus, in Georgia; and by

Mount Caspius we are to understand the high mountains of Georgia, whence the waters, which fall on one side into the Black Sea, and on the

other into the Caspian, take their rise.</note> leading from Colchis to the Cas-



<pb n="138"/>



pian Sea, there are 6600 stadia,<note anchored="yes">Gosselin also observes, that on our charts this distance is about 8100

stadia of 700 to a degree. Consequently the difference between the

meridian of Thapsacus and that of Mount Caspius is as much as 4° 45′,

in place of the 300 stadia, or from 25′ to 26′ supposed by Hipparchus.</note> so that, with the exception

of about 300 stadia, the distance from the meridian of the

Cyaneæ to that of Thapsacus, or to that of Mount Caspius, is

the same: and both Thapsacus and Mount Caspius are, so

to speak, under the same meridian.<note anchored="yes">On the contrary, Mount Caspius is east of the meridian of Thapsacus

by about 2500 stadia, of 700 to a degree.</note> It follows from this

that the Caspian Gates are about equi-distant between Thapsacus and Mount Caspius, but that the distance between

them and Thapsacus is much less than the 10,000 stadia mentioned by Eratosthenes. Consequently, as the distance in a

right line is much less than 10,000 stadia, this route, which

he considered to be in a straight course from the Caspian

Gates to Thapsacus, must have been a circumbendibus.</q>
</p><p>To this we reply, that Eratosthenes, as is usual in Geography, speaks of right lines, meridians, and parallels to the

equator, with considerable latitude, whereas Hipparchus criticizes him with geometrical nicety, as if every line had been

measured with rule and compass. Hipparchus at the same

time himself frequently deciding as to right lines and parallels, not by actual measurement, but mere conjecture. Such

is the first error of this writer. A second is, that he never

lays down the distances as Eratosthenes has given them, nor

yet reasons on the data furnished by that writer, but from

mere assumptions of his own coinage. Thus, where Eratosthenes states that the distance from the mouth of the

[Thracian Bosphorus] to the Phasis is 8000 stadia, from

thence to Dioscurias <date value="-600">600</date> stadia,<note anchored="yes">Now Iskouriah. Dioscurias, however, is 800 stadia from the Phasis,

of 700 to a degree.</note> and from Dioscurias to Caspius five days' journey, (which Hipparchus estimates at 1000

stadia,) the sum of these, as stated by Eratosthenes, would

amount to 9600 stadia. This Hipparchus abridges in the following manner. From the Cyaneæ to the Phasis are 5600

stadia, and from the Phasis to the Caspius 1000 more.<note anchored="yes">According to our improved charts, the distance from the meridian of

the Cyaneæ to that of the Phasis is 6800 stadia, of 700 to a degree; from

the Cyaneæ to Mount Caspius, 8080.</note> There



<pb n="139"/>



fore it is no statement of Eratosthenes that the Caspius and

Thapsacus are under the same meridian, but of Hipparchus

himself. However, supposing Eratosthenes says so, does it

follow that the distance from the Caspius to the Caspian

Gates, and that from Thapsacus to the same point, are

equal.<note anchored="yes">The meridian of Mount Caspius is about 2625 stadia nearer the

Caspian Gates than that of Thapsacus.</note>

<milestone n="40" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the second book of his Commentaries, Hipparchus,

having again mooted the question concerning the mountains

of the Taurus, of which we have spoken sufficiently, proceeds

with the northern parts of the habitable earth. He then

notices the statement of Eratosthenes concerning the countries situated west of the Euxine,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">meta\ to\n Po/nton,</foreign> literally, after the Pontus.</note> namely, that the three

[principal] headlands [of this continent], the first the Peloponnesian, the second the Italian, the third the Ligurian, run

from north [to south], enclosing the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian

Gulfs.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin observes, that Eratosthenes took a general view of the salient

points of land that jutted into the Mediterranean, as some of the learned

of our own time have done, when remarking that most of the continents

terminated in capes, extending towards the south. The first promontory that

Eratosthenes speaks of terminated in Cape Malea of the Peloponnesus,

and comprised the whole of Greece; the Italian promontory likewise terminated Italy; the Ligurian promontory was reckoned to include all Spain,

it terminated at Cape Tarifa, near to the middle of the Strait of Gibraltar.

As the Ligurians had obtained possession of a considerable portion of the

coasts of France and Spain, that part of the Mediterranean which washes

the shores of those countries was named the Ligurian Sea. It extended

from the Arno to the Strait of Gibraltar. It is in accordance with this

nomenclature that Eratosthenes called Cape Tarifa, which projects farthest into the Strait, the Ligurian promontory.</note> After this general exposition, Hipparchus proceeds

to criticise each point in detail, but rather on geometrical than

geographical grounds; on these subjects, however, the number

of Eratosthenes' errors is so overwhelming, as also of Timosthenes the author of the Treatise on the Ports, (whom Eratosthenes prefers above every other writer, though he often decides

even against him,) that it does not seem to be worth my time

to review their faulty productions, nor even what Hipparchus

has to say about them; since he neither enumerates all their

blunders, nor yet sets them right, but only points out how



<pb n="140"/>



they falsify and contradict each other. Still any one might certainly object to the saying of Eratosthenes, that Europe has but

three headlands, and considering as one that which terminates

by the Peloponnesus, notwithstanding it is broken up into so

many divisions. In fact, Sunium<note anchored="yes">Cape Colonna.</note> is as much a promontory as

Laconia, and not very much less south than Malea,<note anchored="yes">Cape Malio, or St. Angelo.</note> forming a

considerable bay,<note anchored="yes">Strabo means the Saronic Gulf, now the Bay of Engia.</note> and the Thracian Chersonesus<note anchored="yes">The peninsula of Gallipoli by the Dardanelles.</note> and Sunium <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">po|o\s to\ Sou/nion.</foreign> Strabo's meaning is, that the entire space of sea,

Added to this, it is manifest that the majority of the distances

are falsely stated, thus arguing an ignorance of geography

scarcely credible, and so far from requiring geometrical demonstration that it stands out prominent on the very face of

the statements. For example, the distance from Epidamnus<note anchored="yes">Durazzo, on the coast of Albania.</note>

to the Thermaic Gulf<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Salonica.</note> is above 2000 stadia; Eratosthenes

gives it at 900. So too he states the distance from Alexandria

to Carthage at 13,000<note anchored="yes">Read 13,500 stadia.</note> stadia; it is not more than 9000, that

is, if, as he himself tells us, Caria and Rhodes are under

the same meridian as Alexandria,<note anchored="yes">It was an error alike shared in by Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and

Strabo, that Alexandria and Rhodes were under the same meridian, notwithstanding the former of these cities is 2° 22′ 45″ east of the latter.</note> and the Strait of Messina

under the same as Carthage,<note anchored="yes">This is an error peculiar to Eratosthenes The meridians of Carthage

and the Strait of Messina differ by 5° 45′.</note> for every one is agreed that the

voyage from Caria to the Strait of Sicily does not exceed

9000 stadia.
</p><p>It is doubtless permissible in very great distances to consider as under one and the same meridian places which are

not more east and west of each other than Carthage is west

of the Strait;<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Messina.</note> but an error of 3000 stadia is too much; and

when he places Rome under the same meridian as Carthage,

notwithstanding its being so far west of that city, it is but



<pb n="141"/>



the crowning proof of his extreme ignorance both of these

places, and likewise of the other countries farther west as far

as the Pillars of Hercules.

<milestone n="41" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Since Hipparchus does not furnish a Geography of his

own, but merely reviews what is said in that of Eratosthenes,

he ought to have gone farther, and corrected the whole of

that writer's mistakes. As for ourselves, it is only in those

particulars where Eratosthenes is correct (and we acknowledge that he frequently errs) that we have thought it our

duty to quote his own words, in order to reinstate them in

their position, and to defend him when he could be acquitted

of the charges of Hipparchus; never failing to break a

lance with the latter writer whenever his objections seemed

to be the result of a mere propensity to find fault. But when

Eratosthenes is grossly mistaken, and the animadversions of

Hipparchus are just, we have thought it sufficient in our

Geography to set him (Eratosthenes) right by merely stating

facts as they are. As the mistakes were so continual and

numerous, it was better not to mention them except in a

sparse and general manner. This principle in the details we

shall strive to carry out. In the present instance we shall

only remark, that Timosthenes, Eratosthenes, and those who

preceded them, were but ill acquainted with Iberia and Keltica,<note anchored="yes">Spain and France.</note> and a thousand times less with Germany, Britain,

and the land of the Getæ and Bastarnæ.<note anchored="yes">The Getæ occupied the east of Moldavia and Bessarabia, between

the Danube and the Dniester. The Bastarnæ inhabited the north of

Moldavia and a part of the Ukraine.</note> Their want of

knowledge is also great in regard to Italy, the Adriatic, the

Euxine, and the countries north of these. Possibly this last

remark may be regarded as captious, since Eratosthenes states,

that as to distant countries, he has merely given the admeasurements as he finds them supplied by others, without vouching for their accuracy, although he sometimes adds whether

the route indicated is more or less in a right line. We should

not therefore subject to a too rigorous examination distances

as to which no one is agreed, after the manner Hipparchus

does, both in regard to the places already mentioned, and also

to those of which Eratosthenes has given the distance from

Hyrcania to Bactria and the countries beyond, and those from



<pb n="142"/>



Colchis to the Sea of Hyrcania. These are points where we

should not scrutinize him so narrowly as [when he describes]

places situated in the heart of our continent,<note anchored="yes">The Greek has simply, <foreign lang="greek">kata\ th\n h)peirw=tin,</foreign>

<emph rend="ital">in the continent,</emph> but Strabo, by this expression, only meant to designate those parts of the

continent best known and nearest to the Greeks. The other countries,

in regard to which he pleads for some indulgence to be shown to Eratosthenes, are equally in the same continent. Kramer and other editors

suspect an error in the text here.</note> or others equally

well known; and even these should be regarded from a geographical rather than a geometrical point of view. Hipparchus, at the end of the second book of his Commentaries on

the Geography of Eratosthenes, having found fault with certain statements relative to Ethiopia, tells us at the commencement of the third, that his strictures, though to a certain

point geographical, will be mathematical for the most part.

As for myself, I cannot find any geography there. To me

it seems entirely mathematical; but Eratosthenes himself

set the example; for he frequently runs into scientific speculations, having little to do with the subject in hand, and

which result in vague and inexact conclusions. Thus he is

a mathematician in geography, and in mathematics a geographer; and so lies open to the attacks of both parties. In this

third book, both he and Timosthenes get such severe justice,

that there seems nothing left for us to do; Hipparchus is

quite enough.

<p>WE will now proceed to examine the statements made

by Posidonius in his Treatise on the Ocean. This Treatise

contains much geographical information, sometimes given in a

manner conformable to the subject, at others too mathematical.

It will not, therefore, be amiss to look into some of his statements, both now and afterwards, as opportunity occurs, taking

care to confine ourselves within bounds. He deals simply

with geography, when he tells us that the earth is spheroidal

and the universe too, and admits the necessary consequences

of this hypothesis, one of which is, that the earth contains

five zones.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius informs us that Parmenides was the first to

make this division of the earth into five zones, but that he

almost doubled the size of the torrid zone, which is situated

between the tropics, by bringing it beyond these into the

temperate zones.<note anchored="yes">According to Plutarch, both Thales and Pythagoras had divided the

earth into five zones. Since Parmenides lived one hundred and fifty years

after the first of these philosophers, he cannot be considered the author

of this division. As Posidonius and Strabo estimated the breadth of the

torrid zone at 8800 stadia, and Parmenides is said to have nearly doubled

it, this would give 17,600 stadia, or 25° 8′ 34″, taking this at 25° it would

appear that Parmenides extended the torrid zone one degree beyond the

tropics.</note> But according to Aristotle the torrid zone

is contained between the tropics, the temperate zones occupying the whole space between the tropics and the arctic circles.<note anchored="yes">The Arctic Circles of the ancients were not the same as ours, but

varied for every latitude. Aristotle limited the temperate zone to those

countries which had the constellation of the crown in their Arctic Circle,

the brilliant star of that constellation in his time had a northern declination of about 36° 30′, consequently he did not reckon that the temperate

zone reached farther north or south than 53° and a half. We shall see

that Strabo adopted much the same opinion, fixing the northern bounds

of the habitable earth at 54° 25′ 42″. Gosselin.</note> Both of these divisions Posidonius justly condemns,

for the torrid zone is properly the space rendered uninhabitable by the heat. Whereas more than half of the space between the tropics is inhabited, as we may judge by the

Ethiopians who dwell above Egypt. The equator divides the

whole of this space into two equal parts. Now from Syene,



<pb n="144"/>



which is the limit of the summer tropic, to Meroe, there are

5000 stadia, and thence to the parallel of the Cinnamon

region, where the torrid zone commences, 3000 stadia. The

whole of this distance has been measured, and it may be gone

over either by sea or land; the remaining portion to the equator is, if we adopt the measure of the earth supplied by Eratosthenes, 8800 stadia. Therefore, as 16,800 is to 8800, so is

the space comprised between the tropics to the breadth of the

torrid zone.
</p><p>If of the more recent measurements we prefer those which

diminish the size of the earth, such as that adopted by Posidonius, which is about 180,000 stadia,<note anchored="yes">For the circumference.</note> the torrid zone will still

only occupy half, or rather more than half, of the space comprised between the tropics; but never an equal space. [Respecting the system of Aristotle, Posidonius farther says,]

<q direct="unspecified">Since it is not every latitude which has Arctic Circles,<note anchored="yes">Viz. none for those who dwell under the equator, or at the poles.</note> and

even those which do possess them have not the same, how

can any one determine by them the bounds of the temperate

zones, which are immutable?</q> Nothing however is proved

[against Aristotle] from the fact that there are not Arctic

Circles for every latitude, since they exist for all the inhabitants of the temperate zone, on whose account alone the

zone receives its name of temperate. But the objection that

the Arctic Circles do not remain the same for every latitude,

but shift their places, is excellent.<note anchored="yes">Strabo's argument seems to be this. It matters but little that there

may not be Arctic Circles for every latitude, since for the inhabitants of

the temperate zone they do certainly exist, and these are the only people

of whom we have any knowledge. But at the same time the objection is

unanswerable, that as these circles differ in respect to various countries,

it is quite impossible that they can fix uniformly the limits of the temperate zone.</note>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius, who himself divides the earth into zones, tells

us that <q direct="unspecified">five is the number best suited for the explanation

of the celestial appearances, two of these are periscii,<note anchored="yes">The polar circles, where the shadow, in the summer season, travels all

tribes of barbarians; but it seems most frequently to a people of Gedrosia

on the coast of the Arabian Gulf. It is probably to these that Strabo

refers.</note> He further remarks, that these peculiarities are

quite sufficient to distinguish the zones in question: those

which are farther south having a more salubrious atmosphere,

and being more fruitful and better supplied with water.


</p></div2><div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>POLYBIUS supposes six zones: two situated between the

poles and the arctic circles; two between the arctic circles

and the tropics; and two between the tropics which are divided by the equator. However, it appears to me that the



<pb n="146"/>



division into five zones accords best both with the order of external nature and geography. With external nature, as respects the celestial phenomena, and the temperature of the

atmosphere. With respect to the celestial phenomena, as the

Periscii and Amphiscii are thereby divided in the best pos-

sible manner, and it also forms an excellent line of separation

in regard to those who behold the stars from an opposite point

of view.<note anchored="yes">Viz. the Heteroscii, or inhabitants of the temperate zones.</note> With respect to the temperature of the atmosphere,

inasmuch as looked at in connexion with the sun, there are

three main divisions, which influence in a remarkable degree

both plants, animals, and every other animated thing, existing

either in the air, or exposed to it, namely, excess of heat,

want of heat, and a moderate supply of heat. In the division

into [five] zones, each of these is correctly distinguished.

The two frigid zones indicate the want of heat, being alike in

the temperature of their atmosphere; the temperate zones

possess a moderate heat, and the remaining, or torrid zone, is

remarkable for its excess of heat.
</p><p>The propriety of this division in regard to geography is

equally apparent; the object of this science being to determine

the limits of that one of the temperate zones which we in-

habit. To the east and west, it is true, the boundaries are

formed by the sea, but to the north and south they are indicated by the atmosphere; which in the middle is of a grate-

ful temperature both to animals and plants, but on either

side is rendered intemperate either through excess or defect

of heat. To manifest this threefold difference, the division

of tile globe into five zones becomes necessary. In fact,

the division of the globe, by means of the equator, into two

hemispheres, the one northern, wherein we dwell, and the

other southern, points to this threefold division, for the regions next the equator and torrid zone are uninhabitable on

account of the heat, those next the poles on account of the

cold, but those in the middle are mild, and fitted for the habitation of man.
</p><p>Posidonius, in placing two zones under the tropics, pays no

regard to the reasons which influenced the division into five

zones, nor is his division equally appropriate. It is no more

than if he were to form his division into zones merely according

to the [countries inhabited] by different nations, calling one

of the north of Asia and Europe, Scythians; and those of the north-west of

Europe, Kelts.</note> and a third

the Intermediate zone.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Polybius, indeed, is wrong in bounding certain of his

zones by the arctic circles,<note anchored="yes">That is, by arctic circles which differed in respect to various latitudes. See Book ii. chap. ii. § 2. p. 144.</note> namely, the two which lie under

them, and the two between these and the tropics. The impropriety of using shifting points to mark the limits of those

which are fixed has been remarked before; and we have

likewise objected to the plan of making the tropics the

boundary of the torrid zone. However, in dividing the

torrid zone into two parts [Polybius] seems to have been

influenced by no inconsiderable reason, the same which led

us to regard the whole earth as properly divided by the equator into two hemispheres, north and south. We at once see

that by means of this division the torrid zone is divided into

two parts, thus establishing a kind of uniformity; each hemi-

sphere consisting of three entire zones, respectively similar to

each other. Thus this partition<note anchored="yes">Viz. The partition of the earth into two hemispheres, by means of

the equator.</note> will admit of a division

into six zones, but the other does not allow of it at all. Supposing you cut the earth into two portions by a line drawn

through the poles, you can find no sufficient cause for dividing the eastern and western hemispheres into six zones;

on the other hand, five would be preferable. For since both

the portions of the torrid zone, divided by the equator, are

similar and contiguous to each other, it would seem out of

place and superfluous to separate them; whereas the temperate

and frigid zones respectively resemble each other, although

lying apart. Wherefore, supposing the whole earth to consist of these two hemispheres, it is sufficient to divide them

into five zones. If there be a temperate region under the

equator, as Eratosthenes asserts, and is admitted by Polybius, (who adds, that it is the most elevated part of the

earth,<note anchored="yes">Gosselin concludes from this that Eratosthenes and Polybius gave to

the earth the form of a spheroid flattened at the poles. Other philosophers supposed it was elongated at the poles, and flattened at the equator.</note> and consequently subject to the drenching rains occa-



<pb n="148"/>



sioned by the monsoons bringing up from the north innumerable clouds, which discharge themselves on the highest lands,)

it would be better to suppose this a third narrow temperate

zone, than to extend the two temperate zones within the

circles of the tropics. This supposition is supported by the

statements of Posidonius, that the course of the sun, whether

in the ecliptic, or from east to west, appears most rapid in

tie region [of which we are speaking], because the rotations

of that luminary are performed with a speed increased in

proportion to the greater size of the circle.<note anchored="yes">Gosselin justly observes that this passage, which is so concise as to

appear doubtful to some, is properly explained by a quotation from Geminus, which states the arguments adduced by Polybius for believing that

there was a temperate region within the torrid zones.</note>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius blames Polybius for asserting that the region

of the earth, situated under the equator, is the highest, since

a spherical body being equal all round, no part can be described as high; and as to mountainous districts, there are

none under the equator, it is on the contrary a flat country,

about the same level as the sea; as for the rains which swell

the Nile, they descend from the mountains of Ethiopia. Although advancing this, he afterwards seems to adopt the other

opinion, for he says that he fancies there may be mountains

under the equator, around which the clouds assembling from

both of the temperate zones, produce violent rains. Here is

one manifest contradiction; again, in stating that the land

under the equator is mountainous, another contradiction ap-

pears. For they say that the ocean is confluent, how then

can they place mountains in the midst of it? unless they

mean to say that there are islands. However, whether such

be the fact does not lie within the province of geography to

determine, the inquiry would better be left to him who makes

the ocean in particular his study.

point out to those sent with him by the king, the route by sea

to India. Eudoxus was of the number thus sent. He set

sail with a good supply of presents, and brought back with

him in exchange aromatics and precious stones, some of which

the Indians collect from amongst the pebbles of the rivers,

others they dig out of the earth, where they have been formed

his journey back, he was carried by the winds above Ethiopia, and being thrown on certain [unknown] regions, he

conciliated the inhabitants by presents of grain, wine, and

cakes of pressed figs, articles which they were without;

receiving in exchange a supply of water, and guides for the

journey. He also wrote down several words of their language, and having found the end of a prow, with a horse

carved on it, which he was told formed part of the wreck

of a vessel coming from the west, he took it with him, and

proceeded on his homeward course. He arrived safely in

Egypt, where no longer Cleopatra, but her son,<note anchored="yes">Ptolemy VIII. was nominally king, but his mother Cleopatra still

held most of the real authority in her hands.</note> ruled; but

he was again stripped of every thing on the accusation of

having appropriated to his own uses a large portion of the

merchandise sent out.

Marseilles, and afterwards traversed the whole coast as far as

Gades. Declaring his enterprise everywhere as he journeyed,

he gathered money sufficient to equip a great ship, and two

Africa, and doubling Cape Bojador; and infers from hence that Eudoxus

never really went that expedition, and that Strabo himself was ignorant

of the true position of Africa.</note> However, they who accompanied

him becoming wearied with the voyage, steered their course

towards land, but much against his will, as he dreaded the

force of the ebb and flow. What he feared actually occurred.

The ship grounded, but gently, so that it did not break up at

once, but fell to pieces gradually, the goods and much of the

timber of the ship being saved. With these he built a third

vessel, closely resembling a ship of fifty oars, and continuing

his voyage, came amongst a people who spoke the same lan-

guage as that some words of which he had on a former occasion committed to writing. He further discovered, that they

were men of the same stock as those other Ethiopians, and

also resembled those of the kingdom of Bogus.<note anchored="yes">A name common to many sovereigns of the different parts of Mauritania; the king Bogus, or Bocchus, here spoken of, governed the kingdom of Fez.</note> However,

Having reached Maurusia in safety, lie disposed of his ves-

mended that sovereign to undertake an expedition thither.
</p><p>This, however, was prevented on account of the fear of the

[king's] advisers, lest the district should chance to expose then

to treachery, by making known a route by which foreigners

might come to attack them. Eudoxus, however, became aware,

that although it was given out that he was himself to be sent

on this proposed expedition, the real intent was to aban-

don him on some desert island. He therefore fled to the

Roman territory, and passed thence into Iberia. Again, he

equipped two vessels, one round and the other long, furnished

with fifty oars, the latter framed for voyaging in the high seas.

the other for coasting along the shores. He placed on board

agricultural implements, seed, and builders, and hastened on

the same voyage, determined, if it should prove too long, to

winter on the island he had before observed, sow his seed.

Posidonius is certainly a most strange writer; he considers

sufficient evidence, and also the account given by Herodotus

of those sent out [to explore] by Darius. But this Bergæan<note anchored="yes">A term by which incredible narrations were designated. It owes its

nonsense, either the coinage of his own brain, or of some other

story-teller, in whom he trusts, he pretends to be worthy of

our belief. But in the first place, what is there credible in this

tale of the Indian missing his way? The Arabian Gulf, which

resembles a river, is narrow, and in length is from 5000 to

10,000 stadia up to its mouth, where it is narrowest of all. It

is not likely that the Indians in their voyage out would have entered this Gulf by mistake. The extreme narrowness of the

mouth must have warned them of their error. And if they entered it voluntarily, then there was no excuse for introducing

the pretext of mistake and uncertain winds. And how did they

suffer all of themselves but one to perish through hunger? And

how was it that this surviver was able to manage the ship, which

could not have been a small one either, fitted as it was for

traversing such vast seas? What must have been his aptitude in learning the language of the country, and thus being

able to persuade the king of his competence, as leader of the

expedition? And how came it that Euergetes was in want of

such guides, so many being already acquainted with this sea?

How was it that he who was sent by the inhabitants of Cyzicus to carry libations and sacrifices, should forsake his city

and sail for India? How was it that so great an affair was



<pb n="153"/>



intrusted to him? And how came it that on his return, after

being deprived of every thing contrary to expectation, and

disgraced, a yet larger cargo of goods was intrusted to him?

And when he had again returned into Ethiopia, what cause

induced him to write down the words, or to inquire whence

came the portion of the prow of the boat? For to learn that

it was a ship of some sailing from the west, would have been

no information to him, as he himself would have to sail from the

west on his voyage back. When, on his return to Alexandria,

he was detected in having appropriated to himself much of

the merchandise, how came it that he was not punished, but

allowed to go about interrogating the pilots, and exhibiting

his bit of prow? And that one of these fellows actually recognised the relic, is it not delicious! Eudoxus too believed it,

this is still richer; and inspired by the hope, hastens home,

and then starts on a voyage beyond the Pillars of Hercules!

But he could never have left Alexandria without a passport, still less after having stolen the royal property. To set

sail on the sly was impossible, as the port and every other

exit was kept by a numerous guard, which still exists, as we

very well know who have lived in Alexandria for a long time,

although it is not so strict since the Romans have had possession, but under the kings the guards were infinitely more alert.

But allowing that he reached Gades, that he there constructed

ships, and sailed thence with quite a royal fleet, when his vessel

was shattered, by what means was he able to construct a third

boat in a desert land? And when, being again on his voyage, he

found that the Ethiopians of the West spoke the same language

as those of the East, how came it that he, so proud of his

travelling propensities, forgot the completion of his voyage,

when he must have had so good an expectation that there

was but little now left unexplored, but relinquishing these

prospects, set his mind on the expedition being undertaken

by Bogus? How did he become acquainted with the snare

spread for him by that king? And what advantage would

have accrued to Bogus by making away with the man, rather

than by dismissing him? When Eudoxus learned the plot

against himself, what means had he to escape to safer quarters? It is true that not one of these situations was actually

impossible, but still they were difficult circumstances, such as

one rarely escapes from by any prosperous fortune. How-



<pb n="154"/>



ever, he always came off with good luck, notwithstanding he

was never out of danger. Besides this, how did it happen, that

having escaped from Bogus, he was not afraid to sail round

Africa a second time, with all the requisites for taking up his

abode on the island? All this too closely resembles the false-

hoods of Pytheas, Euhemerus, and Antiphanes. They however may be pardoned; for their only aim was that of the juggler. But who can forgive a demonstrator and philosopher, and one too striving to be at the head of their order? it

is really too bad!

about 70,000 stadia, being the half of the whole circle on

one might, aided by a continual east wind, reach India in so

many thousand stadia.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next he undertakes to find fault with those who gave



<pb n="155"/>



to the continents their present division, instead of marking

them out by lines drawn parallel to the equator, by which

means the different animals, plants, and temperatures would

have been distinguished, according as they approached the

frigid or the torrid zones; so that each continent would have

formed a kind of zone. Afterwards, however, he overturns

and gives up altogether this view, bestowing every commendation on the existing system, and thus making his argument

altogether worthless and of no avail. In fact, the various arrangements [of a country] are not the result of premeditation, any more than the diversities of nations or languages; they all depend on circumstances and chance. Arts,

forms of government, and modes of life, arising from certain

[internal] springs, flourish under whatever climate they may

be situated; climate, however, has its influence, and therefore

while some peculiarites are due to the nature of the country,

others are the result of institutions and education. It is not

owing to the nature of the country, but rather to their education, that the Athenians cultivate eloquence, while the Lacedæmonians do not; nor yet the Thebans, who are nearer still.

Neither are the Babylonians and Egyptians philosophers by

nature, but by reason of their institutions and education. In

like manner the excellence of horses, oxen, and other animals,

results not alone from the places where they dwell, but also,

from their breeding. Posidonius confounds all these distinctions.
</p><p>In praising the division of the continents as it now stands,

he advances as an argument the difference between the Indians and the Ethiopians of Libya, the former being more

robust, and less dried by the heat of the climate. It is on this

account that Homer, who includes them all under the title of

Ethiopians, describes them as being separated into two divisions,

<l>These eastward situate, those toward the west.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote></quote><bibl>Odyssey i, 23.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey i, 23.</bibl></cit>



[Crates], to support his hypothesis, supposes another inhabited

earth, of which Horner certainly knew nothing; and says that

the passage ought to be read thus, <q direct="unspecified">towards the descending

sun,</q> viz. when having passed the meridian, it begins to decline.



<pb n="156"/>



<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>First, then, the Ethiopians next Egypt are actually separated into two divisions; one part being in Asia, the other

in Libya, otherwise there is no distinction between them. But

it was not on this account that Homer divided the Ethiopians,

nor yet because he was acquainted with the physical superiority of the Indians, (for it is not probable that Homer had

the slightest idea of the Indians, since, according to the assertion of Eudoxus, Euergetes was both ignorant of India, and of

the voyage thither,) but his division rather resulted from the

cause we formerly mentioned. We have shown that as for

the alteration of Crates, it makes no difference whether it be

read so or not. Posidonius, however, says that it does make

a difference, and would be better altered into <q direct="unspecified">towards the

descending [sun].</q> But in what can this be said to differ

from <q direct="unspecified">towards the west,</q> since the whole section of the hemisphere west of the meridian is styled <q direct="unspecified">the west,</q> not only

the mere semicircle of the horizon. This is manifested by the

following expression of Aratus,

<l>Where the extremities of the west and east blend together.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>Aratus, who lived about B. C. <date value="-270">270</date>, was the author of two Greek

However, if the reading of Posidonius be preferable to that of

Crates, any one may likewise claim for it a superiority over

that of Aristarchus. So much for Posidonius. There are, however, many particulars relating to Geography, which we shall

bring under discussion; others relating to Physics, which

must be examined elsewhere, or altogether disregarded; for

he is much too fond of imitating Aristotle's propensity for

diving into <emph rend="ital">causes,</emph> a subject which we [Stoics] scrupulously

avoid, simply because of the extreme darkness in which all

<p>POLYBIUS, in his Chorography of Europe, tells us that it is

not his intention to examine the writings of the ancient geographers, but the statements of those who have criticised them,



<pb n="157"/>



such as Dicæarchus, Eratosthenes, (who was the last of those

who [in his time] had laboured on geography,) and Pytheas,

by whom many have been deceived. It is this last writer

who states that he travelled all over Britain on foot, and that

the island is above 40,000 stadia in circumference. It is likewise he who describes Thule and other neighbouring places,

where, according to him, neither earth, water, nor air exist,

separately, but a sort of concretion of all these, resembling

marine sponge, in which the earth, the sea, and all things

were suspended, thus forming, as it were, a link to unite the

whole together. It can neither be travelled over nor sailed

through. As for the substance, he affirms that he has beheld

it with his own eyes; the rest, he reports on the authority of

others. So much for the statements of Pytheas, who tells us,

besides, that after he had returned thence, he traversed the

whole coasts of Europe from Gades to the Don.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Polybius asks, <q direct="unspecified">How is it possible that a private individual, and one too in narrow circumstances, could ever have

performed such vast expeditions by sea and land? And how

could Eratosthenes, who hesitates whether he may rely on his

statements in general, place such entire confidence in what

that writer narrates concerning Britain, Gades, and Iberia?</q>

says he, <q direct="unspecified">it would have been better had Eratosthenes trusted

to the Messenian<note anchored="yes">Evemerus, or Euhemerus, a Sicilian author of the time of Alexander the Great and his immediate successors, and a native of Messina. He is

said to have sailed down the Red Sea and round the southern coasts of

Asia to a very great distance, until he came to an island called Panchæa.

After his return from this voyage, he wrote a work entitled <foreign lang="greek">(Iera\ )Ana-</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">grafh/,</foreign> which consisted of at least nine books. The title of this <q direct="unspecified">Sacred

History,</q> as we may call it, was taken from the <foreign lang="greek">a)nagrafai/,</foreign> or the inscriptions on columns and walls, which existed in great numbers in the

temples of Greece; and Euhemerus chose it, because he pretended to have

derived his information from public documents of that kind, which he

had discovered in his travels, especially in the island of Panchæa. The

work contained accounts of the several gods, whom Euhemerus represented

as having originally been men who had distinguished themselves either

as warriors, kings, inventors, or benefactors of mankind, and who, after

their death, were worshipped as gods by the grateful people. This book,

which seems to have been written in a popular style, must have been

very attractive; for all the fables of mythology were dressed up in it as

so many true narratives; and many of the subsequent historians adopted

his mode of dealing with myths, or at least followed in his track, as we

find to be the case with Polybius and Dionysius. Vide Smith.</note> rather than to this writer. The former



<pb n="158"/>



merely pretends to have sailed into one [unknown] country,

viz. Panchæa, but the latter, that he has visited the whole of

the north of Europe as far as the ends of the earth; which

statement, even had it been made by Mercury, we should not

have believed. Nevertheless Eratosthenes, who terms Euhemerus a Bergæan, gives credit to Pytheas, although even

Dicæarchus would not believe him.</q>
</p><p>This argument, <q direct="unspecified">although even Dicæarchus would not believe him,</q> is ridiculous, just as if Eratosthenes ought to take

for his standard a writer whom Polybius is himself for ever

complaining of.<note anchored="yes">Every one will observe, that this criticism of Strabo is entirely gratuitous and captious. Polybius cites Dicæarchus as a most credulous

writer, but states that even he would not believe Pytheas: how then

</p><p>The ignorance of Eratosthenes respecting the western and

northern portions of Europe, we have before remarked. But

both he and Dicæarchus must be pardoned for this, as neither

of them were personally familiar with those localities. But

how can one excuse Polybius and Posidonius? especially Polybius, who treats as mere hearsay what Eratosthenes and

Dicæarchus report concerning the distances of various places;

and many other matters, about which, though he blames them,

he is not himself free from error. Dicæarchus states that

there are 10,000 stadia from the Peloponnesus to the Pillars,

and something above this number from the Peloponnesus to

the recess of the Adriatic.<note anchored="yes">On the contrary, the distance in a right line from Cape Tenarum, off

the Peloponnesus, to the recess of the Adriatic Gulf, is only about half

the distance from the Peloponnesus to the Pillars of Hercules. This

mistake of Dicæarchus is a proof of the very slight acquaintance the

Greeks could have had with the western portions of the Mediterranean

in his time, about 320 years before the Christian era.</note> He supposes 3000 stadia between

the Peloponnesus and the Strait of Sicily; thus there would

remain 7000 between the Strait of Sicily and the Pillars.<note anchored="yes">Literally, <q direct="unspecified">He assigns 3000 to the interval which stretches towards

the Pillars as far as the Strait, and 7000 from the Strait to the Pillars.</q>

The distance from Cape Tenarum to the Strait of Messina is in proportion to the distance from the Strait of Messina to Gibraltar, about

3 to 10, not 3 to 7 as given by Dicæarchus.</note>
</p><p><q direct="unspecified">I will not inquire,</q> says Polybius, <q direct="unspecified">whether the statement

concerning the 3000 stadia is correct or not, but 7000 stadia



<pb n="159"/>



is not the correct measure [from the Strait of Messina to the

Pillars of Hercules], whether taken along the sea-shore, or

right across the sea. The coast closely resembles an obtuse

angle, one side reaching to the Strait of Sicily, the other to

the Pillars, the vertex being Narbonne. Now let a triangle

be constructed, having for its base a right line drawn through

the sea, and its sides forming the aforementioned angle. The

side reaching from the Strait of Sicily to Narbonne is above

11,200 stadia, while the other is below 8000. Now the greatest distance from Europe to Libya, across the Tyrrhenian

Sea,<note anchored="yes">That part of the Mediterranean which lies on the coast of Italy,

from the mouth of the Arno to Naples.</note> is not above 3000 stadia, and across the Sea of Sardinia<note anchored="yes">The sea which washes the western coast of Sardinia.</note> it is less still. But supposing that it too is 3000 stadia

add to this 2000 stadia, the depth of the bay at Narbonne

as a perpendicular from the vertex to the base of the obtuse-

angled triangle. It will, then, be clear even to the geometrical powers of a child, that the entire coast from the Strait

of Sicily to the Pillars, does not exceed by more than 500

stadia the right line drawn across the sea; adding to these

the 3000 stadia from the Peloponnesus to the Strait of Sicily,

the whole taken together will give a straight line<note anchored="yes">Viz. from the Peloponnesus to the Pillars of Hercules.</note> above

double the length assigned by Dicæarchus; and, according to

his system, you must add in addition to these the stadia at the

recess of the Adriatic.</q>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>True, dear Polybius, (one might say,) this error [of Dicæarchus] is manifested by the proof which you yourself

have given when you inform us that from the Peloponnesus

to Leucas<note anchored="yes">Santa Maura, an island in the Ionian Sea.</note> there are 700 stadia; from thence to Corcyra<note anchored="yes">Corfu.</note> the

same number; and the same number again from Corcyra to

6150 stadia.<note anchored="yes">In all 8250 stadia.</note> But the statement of Dicæarchus, that the



<pb n="160"/>



distance from the Strait of Sicily to the Pillars is 7000 stadia,

and also your view of the matter, are both of them equally

incorrect. For almost every one is agreed that the distance

measured straight across the sea is 12,000 stadia, and this coincides with the received calculation of the length of the inhabited earth, which is estimated at above 70,000 stadia; the

western portion of this from the Gulf of Issus<note anchored="yes">Issus, now Aïas, a town of Cilicia on the confines of Syria, famous

for the battle between Alexander the Great and Darius, in consequence

of which it was called Nicopolis.</note> to the extreme western point of Iberia is little less than 30,000 stadia,

and is thus calculated: from the Gulf of Issus to Rhodes 5000

stadia; from thence to Cape Salmonium,<note anchored="yes">Salamoni.</note> which forms the

eastern extremity of Crete, 1000; the length of Crete to

Criu-metopon<note anchored="yes">Cape Krio.</note> above 2000; thence to Cape Pachynus<note anchored="yes">Cape Passaro.</note> in

Sicily 4500, and from Pachynus to the Strait of Sicily above

1000 stadia; the run from the Strait to the Pillars 12,000

and lastly, from the Pillars to the extremity of the said promontory<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> of Iberia, about 3000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">Total 28,500 stadia.</note>
</p><p>In addition to this, the perpendicular<note anchored="yes">Spoken of by Polybius.</note> is not correct, supposing it true that Narbonne lies under almost the same parallel as Marseilles, and that this latter place is under the

same parallel as Byzantium; which is the opinion of Hipparchus. Now the line drawn across the sea lies under the same

parallel as the Strait [of the Pillars] and Rhodes; and the distance from Rhodes to Byzantium, which both lie under the same

meridian, is estimated at about 5000 stadia; to which the

above-mentioned perpendicular ought to be equal. But since

they say that from the recess of the Galatic Gulf, the greatest distance across the sea from Europe to Libya is 5000

stadia, it seems to me that either there is some error in this

statement, or that at this point Libya must incline very much

to the north, and so come under the same parallel as the Pillars. Polybius is likewise mistaken in telling us that this

said perpendicular terminates close to Sardinia; for instead

of being lose to Sardinia, it is far west thereof, having

almost the whole of the sea of Liguria<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Genoa.</note> between it and that

island. Besides this he makes the length of the sea-coast too

great; but this [error] is not so considerable [as the two

preceding].

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After this Polybius proceeds to set right the mistakes of'

Eratosthenes. In this he is sometimes successful; at others

his corrections are for the worse. For example, Eratosthenes gives 300 stadia from Ithaca to Corcyra; Polybius makes it above 900. From Epidamnus to Thessa-

lonica Eratosthenes allows 900 stadia; Polybius says above

2000. In these instances he is correct. But where Era-

tosthenes states that from Marseilles to the Pillars there

are 7000 stadia, and from the Pyrenees [to the same place]

6000, and Polybius alters this to more than 9000 from Mar-

seilles, and little less than 8000 from the Pyrenees,<note anchored="yes">These measures are taken along the coast, in stadia of 700 to a degree. Of these, from Marseilles to Gibraltar there are 9300, and from

the ancient promontory of Pyrenæum to Gibraltar 7380. Consequently

the corrections of Polybius were neither inaccurate nor uncalled for.</note> he is

quite mistaken, and not so near to the truth as Eratos-

thenes. For all are now agreed that, barring the indirect-

than 6000 stadia<note anchored="yes">These 6000 stadia, taken in a direct line, are just the distance from

Cape St. Vincent to the chain of the Pyrenees.</note> from the Pyrenees to its western limits;

notwithstanding Polybius gives 8000 stadia for the length

of the river Tagus, from its source to its outlets, and this

in a straight line without any reference to its sinuosities,

which in fact never enter into the geographical estimate,

although the sources of the Tagus are above 1000 stadia from

the Pyrenees. His remark is quite correct, that Eratosthenes

knew little about Iberia, and on this account sometimes

makes conflicting statements concerning it. He tells us, for

example, that the portion of this country situated on the sea-

coast as far as Gades is inhabited by Galatæ,<note anchored="yes">Kelts.</note> who possess

western Europe as far as Gades; nevertheless, in his account

of Iberia he seems quite to have forgotten this, and makes

no mention of these Galatæ whatever.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Again, however, Polybius makes an incorrect assertion,

in stating that the whole length of Europe is unequal to that

of Africa and Asia taken together. He tells us "that the en-



<pb n="162"/>



trance at the Pillars corresponds in direction to the equinoctial

west, and that the Don flows from the summer rising,<note anchored="yes">The rising of the sun in summer.</note> consequently the length of Europe is less than that of Asia and

Africa taken together by the space between the summer rising

and the equinoctial rising,<note anchored="yes">The east.</note> since Asia occupies the eastern

portion of the northern semicircle. Now, in addition to

the obscurity which Polybius throws over subjects which

might have been simply stated, it is false that the river

Don flows from the summer rising. For all who are acquainted with these localities inform us that this river flows

from the north into the Mæotis, so that the mouth of the

river lies under the same meridian as that of the Mæotis;

and so in fact does the whole river as far as is known.<note anchored="yes">This is an error into which Strabo fell with most of the ancient geographers. The course of the Don certainly begins from the north, but

afterwards it turns eastward, and then suddenly shifts to the west. Sc

that its entire course as known in the time of Strabo, differed from the

Palus Mæotis and Sea of Azof by about 9 degrees of longitude. Polybius

is here more exact than Strabo.</note>

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Equally unworthy of credit is the statement of those

who tell us, that the Don rises in the vicinity of the Danube,

and flows from the west; they do not remember that between

these are the Dniester, the Dnieper, and the Bog, all great

rivers, which flow [into the Euxine Sea]; one runs parallel to

the Danube, the other two to the Don. Now if at the present

day we are ignorant of the sources both of the Dniester, and also

of the Dnieper and Bog, the regions farther north must certainly be still less known. It is therefore a fictitious and

idle assertion, that the Don crosses these rivers, and then

turns northward on its way to discharge itself into the

Mæbtis, it being well known that the outlets to this river are

in the most northern and eastern portions of the lake.<note anchored="yes">Palus Mæotis.</note>
</p><p>No less idle is the statement which has also been advanced.

that the Don, after crossing the Caucasus, flows northward

and then turns towards the Mæotis.<note anchored="yes">This was the opinion of Theophanes of Mytilene, who followed Pompey in his expeditions to the East. The Caucasus here mentioned is that

which bounds Georgia in the north, and from whence the modern river

Kuban (the Vardanus of Pompey) takes its rise. This river does incline

slightly to the north, and afterwards turns westward in its course to the

Palus Mæotis. It is possible that some confusion between this river and

the Don gave occasion to the belief that the latter rose in the Caucasus.</note> No one, however, [with

the exception of Polybius,] made this river flow from the east

If such were its course, our best geographers would never



<pb n="163"/>



have told us that its direction was contrary to that of the

Nile, and, so to speak, diametrically opposite thereto, as if the

course of both rivers lay under the same meridian.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Further, the length of the inhabited earth is measured

on a line parallel with the equator, as it is in this direction

that its greatest length lies: in the same way with respect

to each of the continents, we must take their length as it lies

between two meridians. The measure of these lengths consists of a certain number of stadia, which we obtain either

by going over the places themselves, or roads or ways parallel

thereto. Polybius abandons this method, and adopts the new

way of taking the segment of the northern semicircle comprised between the summer rising and the equinoctial rising.

But no one ought to calculate by variable rules or measures

in determining the length of fixed distances: nor yet should

he make use of the phenomena of the heavens, which appear

different when observed from different points, for distances

which have their length determined by themselves and remain unchanged. The length of a country never varies,

but depends upon itself; whereas, the equinoctial rising and

setting, and the summer and winter rising and setting, depend not on themselves, but on our position [with respect

to them]. As we shift from place to place, the equinoctial

rising and setting, and the winter and summer rising and

setting, shift with us; but the length of a continent always-

remains the same. To make the Don and the Nile the bounds

of -these continents, is nothing out of the way, but it is something strange to employ for this purpose the equinoctial rising

and the summer rising.

<p>Of the many promontories formed by Europe, a better description is given by Polybius than by Eratosthenes; but even

his is not sufficient. Eratosthenes only names three; one at

the Pillars of Hercules, where Iberia is situated; a second at

the Strait of Sicily, and containing Italy; the third terminated by the Cape of Malea,<note anchored="yes">Cape Malio, in the Morea. See also Humboldt's Cosmos ii. 482.</note> comprising all the countries situated between the Adriatic, the Euxine, and the Don. The two former of these Polybius describes in the same manner

by the Cape of Malea<note anchored="yes">Cape Malio. Gosselin is of opinion that some omission has occurred

in this passage, and proposes to substitute the following:<q direct="unspecified">The two

Also a fifth, about the Kimmerian Bosphorus and the mouth

of the Mæotis. Let us allow [to Polybius] his two former

[promontories], they are clearly distinguished by unmistakeable bays; the first by the bay between Calpé<note anchored="yes">The Rock of Gibraltar.</note> and the Sacred

Promontory<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> where Gades<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> is situated, as also by the sea

and the Adriatic,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Venice.</note> although it may be objected that the extremity of Iapygia,<note anchored="yes">Capo di Leuca.</note> being a promontory in itself, causes

Italy to have a double cape. But as for the remaining [pro-

montories of Polybius], they are plainly much more irregular,

and composed of many parts, and require some other division-

So likewise his plan of dividing [Europe] into six parts,

similar to that of the promontories, is liable to objection.
</p><p>However, we will set to rights each of these errors separately, as we meet with them, as well as the other blunders

into which he has fallen in his description of Europe, and the

journey round Africa. For the present we think that we have

sufficiently dwelt on those of our predecessors whom we have

thought proper to introduce as testimonies in our behalf, that

both in the matter of correction and addition we had ample

<p>AFTER these criticisms on the writers who have preceded us, we must now confine our attention to the ful-

filment of our promise. We start with a maxim we laid

down at the commencement, that whoever undertakes to

write a Chorography, should receive as axioms certain physical and mathematical propositions, and frame the rest of

his work in accordance with, and in full reliance on, these

principles. We have already stated [our opinion], that

neither builder nor architect could build house or city properly and as it ought to be, unless acquainted with the <emph rend="ital">climax</emph>

of the place, its position in respect to celestial appearances,

its shape, magnitude, degree of heat and cold, and similar

facts; much less should he [be without such information] who

undertakes to describe the situation of the various regions of

the inhabited earth.
</p><p>Represent to the mind on one and the same plane-surface

Iberia and India with the intermediate countries, and define

likewise the west, the east, and the south, which are common

to every country. To a man already acquainted with the arrangement and motions of the heavens, and aware that in

reality the surface of the earth is spherical, although here for

the sake of illustration represented as a plane, this will give a

sufficiently exact idea of the geographical [position of the various countries], but not to one who is unacquainted with those

matters. The tourist travelling over vast plains like those of

Babylon, or journeying by sea, may fancy that the whole

country stretched before, behind, and on either side of him is

a plane-surface; he may be unacquainted with the counter-

indications of the celestial phenomena, and with the motions

and appearance of the sun and stars, in respect to us. But

such facts as these should ever be present to the mind of

those who compose Geographies The traveller, whether

by sea or land, is directed by certain common appearances,

which answer equally for the direction both of the unlearned

and of the man of the world. Ignorant of astronomy, and

unacquainted with the varied aspect of the heavens, he be-



<pb n="166"/>



holds the sun rise and set, and attain the meridian, but with-

out considering how this takes place. Such knowledge could

not aid the object he has in view, any more than to know

whether the country he chances to be in may be under the

same latitude as his own or not. Even should he bestow a

slight attention to the subject, on all mathematical points he

will adopt the opinions of the place; and every country has

certain mistaken views of these matters. But it is not for

any particular nation, nor for the man of the world who cares

nothing for abstract mathematics, still less is it for the reaper

or ditcher, that the geographer labours; but it is for him who

is convinced that the earth is such as mathematicians declare

it to be, and who admits every other fact resulting from this

hypothesis. He requests that those who approach him shall

have already settled this in their minds as a fact, that they

may be able to lend their whole attention to other points.

He will advance nothing which is not a consequence of these

primary facts; therefore those who hear him, if they have

a knowledge of mathematics, will readily be able to turn his

instructions to account; for those who are destitute of this

information he does not pretend to expound Geography.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Those who write on the science of Geography should

trust entirely for the arrangement of the subject they are

engaged on to the geometers, who have measured the whole

earth; they in their turn to astronomers; and these again to

natural philosophers. Now natural philosophy is one of the

perfect sciences.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h( de\ fusikh\ a)o|eth\ tis.</foreign> We learn from the work entitled De Placitis

</p><p>The earth and heavens are spheroidal.

The tendency of all bodies having weight, is to a centre.

Further, the earth being spheroidal, and having the same

centre as the heavens, is motionless, as well as the axis which

passes through both it and the heavens. The heavens turn

round both the earth and its axis, from east to west. The

fixed stars turn round with it, at the same rate as the whole.<note anchored="yes">We have followed the suggestion of Gosselin in reading <foreign lang="greek">tw=|o(/lw|</foreign><emph rend="ital">the</emph>

<emph rend="ital">whole,</emph> instead of <foreign lang="greek">tw=| po/lw|,</foreign><emph rend="ital">the pole,</emph> as in the text.

These fixed stars follow in their course parallel circles;

the principal of which are, the equator, the two tropics, and

the arctic circles. While the planets, the sun, and the moon,

describe certain oblique circles comprehended within the zodiac. Admitting these points in whole or in part, astronomers

proceed to treat of other matters, [such as] the motions [of

the stars], their revolutions, eclipses, size, relative distance,

and a thousand similar particulars. On their side, geometers,

when measuring the size of the entire earth, avail themselves

of the data furnished by the natural philosopher and astronomer; and the geographer on his part makes use of those of

the geometer.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The heavens and the earth must be supposed to be

divided each into five zones, and the celestial zones to possess

the same names as those below. The motives for such a

division into zones we have already detailed. These zones

may be distinguished by circles drawn parallel to the equator,

on either side of it. Two of these will separate the torrid

from the temperate zones, and the remaining two, the temperate from the frigid. To each celestial circle there shall

be one corresponding on earth, and bearing the same name,

and likewise zone for zone. The [two] zones capable of being inhabited, are styled temperate. The remaining [three]

are uninhabitable, one on account of the heat, the others because of the extreme cold. The same is the case with regard to the tropical, and also to the arctic circles, in respect

of those countries for which arctic circles can be said to exist. Circles on the earth are supposed, corresponding to those

in the heavens, and bearing the same name, one for one.
</p><p>As the whole heaven is separated into two parts by its

equator, it follows that the earth must, by its equator, be

similarly divided. The two hemispheres, both celestial and



<pb n="168"/>



terrestrial, are distinguished into north and south. Likewise

the torrid zone, which is divided into two halves by the equator, is distinguished as having a northern and southern side.

Hence it is evident that of the two temperate zones, one

should be called northern, the other southern, according to

the hemisphere to which it belongs. The northern hemi-

sphere is that containing the temperate zone, in which looking

from east to west, you will have the pole on your right hand,

and the equator on the left, or, in which, looking south, the

west will be on the right hand, and the east on the left. The

southern hemisphere is exactly the contrary to this.
</p><p>It is clear that we are in one or other of these hemi-

spheres, namely, the north; we cannot be in both:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Broad rivers roll, and awful floods between,
</l><l>But chief the ocean.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote></quote><bibl>Odyssey xi. 156, 157.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey xi. 156, 157.</bibl></cit>



And next is the torrid zone. But neither is there any ocean

in the midst of the earth wherein we dwell, dividing the

whole thereof, nor yet have we any torrid region. Nor is

there any portion of it to be found in which the <emph rend="ital">climata</emph> are

opposite to those which have been described as characterizing

the northern temperate zone.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Assuming these data, and availing himself likewise of

astronomical observations, by which the position of every

place is properly determined, whether with respect to the

circles parallel to the equator, or to those which cut these

latter at right angles, in the direction of the poles, the geometer measures the region in which he dwells, and [judges

of the extent of] others by comparing the distance [between

the corresponding celestial signs]. By this means he discovers the distance from the equator to the pole, which is a

quarter of the largest circle of the earth; having obtained

this, he has only to multiply by four, the result is the [measure of the] perimeter of the globe.
</p><p>In the same manner as he who takes the measures of the

earth, borrows the foundation of his calculations from the

astronomer, who himself is indebted to the natural philosopher,

so in like manner the geographer adopts certain facts laid

down as established by the geometer, before setting forth his



<pb n="169"/>



description of the earth we inhabit; its size, form, nature, and

the proportion it bears to the whole earth. These latter points

are the peculiar business of the geographer. He will next

enter on a particular description of every thing deserving notice, whether on land or sea; he will likewise point out whatever has been improperly stated by those who have preceded

him, especially by those who are regarded as chief authorities

in these matters.<note anchored="yes">From this point Strabo, strictly speaking, commences his exposition

of the principles of Geography.</note>

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let it be supposed that the earth and sea together form

a spheroidal body, and preserve one and the same level in all

the seas. For though some portions of the earth may be

higher, yet this bears so small a relation to the size of the

whole mass, as need not be noticed. The spheroid in consequence is not so minutely exact as one might be made by the aid

of a turner's instrument, or as would answer the definition of a

geometer, still in general appearance, and looked at roughly, it is a spheroid. Let the earth be supposed to consist of

five zones, with (1.) the equatorial circle described round it,

(2.) another parallel to this,<note anchored="yes">Strabo supposed this circle at a distance of 38,100 stadia from the equator, or 54° 25′ 42″ or latitude.</note> and defining the frigid zone of the northern hemisphere, and (3.) a circle passing through the poles, and cutting the two preceding circles at right angles.

The northern hemisphere contains two quarters of the earth,

which are bounded by the equator and the circle passing

through the poles.
</p><p>Each of these [quarters] should be supposed to contain a

four-sided district, its northern side being composed of one

half of the parallel next the pole; its southern, by the half of

the equator; and its remaining sides, by [two] segments of the

circle drawn through the poles, opposite to each other, and

equal in length. In one of these quadrilaterals (which of

them is of no consequence) the earth that we inhabit is situated, surrounded by sea, and similar to an island. This, as we

said before, is evident both to our senses and to our reason.

But should any one doubt thereof, it makes no difference so

far as Geography is concerned, whether you suppose the portion of the earth we inhabit to be an island, or only admit

what we know from experience, viz. that whether you start



<pb n="170"/>



from the east or west, you may sail all round it. Certain

intermediate spaces may have been left [unexplored], but

these are as likely to be occupied by sea, as uninhabited

lands. The object of the geographer is to describe known

countries; those which are unknown he passes over equally

with those beyond the limits of the inhabited earth. It

will therefore be sufficient for describing the contour of the

island we have been speaking of, if we join by a right line

the utmost points which, up to this time, have been explored

by voyagers along the coast on either side.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let it be supposed that this island is contained in one

of the above quadrilaterals; we must obtain its apparent magnitude by subtracting our hemisphere from the whole extent

of the earth, from this take the half, and from this again the

quadrilateral, in which we state our earth to be situated. We

may judge also by analogy of the figure of the whole earth, by

supposing that it accords with those parts with which we are

acquainted. Now as the portion of the northern hemisphere,

between the equator and the parallel next the [north] pole, resembles a vertebre or joint of the back-bone in shape, and as the

circle which passes through the pole divides at the same time

the hemisphere and the vertebre into two halves, thus forming

the quadrilateral; it is clear that this quadrilateral to which

the Atlantic is adjacent, is but the half of the vertebre; while at

the same time the inhabited earth, which is an island in this,

and shaped like a chlamys or soldier's cloak, occupies less than

the half of the quadrilateral. This is evident from geometry,

also<note anchored="yes">The whole of what follows to the end of the section is extremely embarrassing in the original; we must therefore claim the indulgence of

the reader for any obscurity he may find in the translation.</note> from the extent of the surrounding sea, which covers

the extremities of the continents on either side, compressing

them into a smaller figure, and thirdly, by the greatest length

and breadth [of the earth itself]. The length being 70,000

stadia, enclosed almost entirely by a sea, impossible to navigate

owing to its wildness and vast extent, and the breadth 30,000

stadia, bounded by regions rendered uninhabitable on account

either of their intense heat or cold. That portion of the quadrilateral which is unfitted for habitation on account of the

heat, contains in breadth 8800 stadia, and in its greatest length

126,000 stadia, which is equal to one half of the equator, and



<pb n="171"/>



larger than one half the inhabited earth; and what is left is

still more.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These calculations are nearly synonymous with those

furnished by Hipparchus, who tells us, that supposing the

size of the globe as stated by Eratosthenes to be correct, we

can then subtract from it the extent of the inhabited earth,

since in noting the celestial appearances [as they are seen] in

different countries, it is not of much importance whether we

make use of this measure, or that furnished by later writers.

Now as the whole circle of the equator according to Eratosthenes contains 252,000 stadia, the quarter of this would be

63,000, that is, the space from the equator to the pole contains

fifteen of the sixty divisions<note anchored="yes">The Greeks, besides the division of the equator into 360 degrees, had

also another method of dividing it into sixty portions or degrees.</note> into which the equator itself is

divided. There are four [divisions] between the equator and

the summer tropic or parallel passing through Syene. The

distances for each locality are calculated by the astronomical

observations.
</p><p>It is evident that Syene is under the tropic, from the fact

that during the summer solstice the gnomon at mid-day casts

no shadow there. As for the meridian of Syene, it follows

very nearly the course of the Nile from Meroe to Alexandria,

a distance of about 10,000 stadia. Syene itself is situated

about mid-way between these places, consequently from thence

to Meroe is a distance of 5000 stadia. Advancing 3000

stadia southward in a right line, we come to lands unfitted for

habitation on account of the heat. Consequently the parallel

which bounds these places, and which is the same as that of

the Cinnamon Country, is to be regarded as the boundary and

commencement of the habitable earth on the south. If, then,

3000 stadia be added to the 5000 between Syene and Meroe,

there will be altogether 8000 stadia [from Syene] to the

[southern] extremity of the habitable earth. But from Syene

to the equator there are 16,800 stadia, (for such is the amount

of the four-sixtieths, each sixtieth being equivalent to

4200 stadia,) and consequently from the [southern] boundaries of the habitable earth to the equator there are 8800

stadia, and from Alexandria 21,800.<note anchored="yes">These 21,800 stadia would give to Alexandria a latitude of 31° 8′

34″; according to modern calculation it is 31° 11′ 20″ of latitude. The following presents Strabo's calculations of the latitude of the preceding

places in a tabular form.

fancy that the northern boundaries of the habitable earth are

greatly south of this. Modern writers tell us of nothing beyond Ierne, which lies just north of Britain, where the people live miserably and like savages on account of the severity

of the cold. It is here in my opinion the bounds of the habitable earth ought to be fixed.
</p><p>If on the one hand the parallels of Byzantium and Marseilles are the same, as Hipparchus asserts on the faith of

Pytheas, (for he<note anchored="yes">Hipparchus.</note> says that at Byzantium the gnomon indicates the same amount of shadow as Pytheas gives for

Marseilles,) and at the same time the parallel of the Dnieper

is distant from Byzantium about 3800 stadia, it follows, if

we take into consideration the distance between Marseilles

and Britain, that the circle which passes over the Dnieper

traverses Britain as well.<note anchored="yes">Hipparchus placed Marseilles and Byzantium at 30,142 stadia, or

43° 3′ 38″ of latitude, and estimated the parallel for the centre of Britain at 33,942 stadia, or 48° 29′ 19″. Whereas Strabo only allowed for this latter 32,700 stadia, or 46° 42′ 51″.</note> But the truth is that Pytheas,

who so frequently misleads people, deceives in this instance

too.

Keltica to Libya, starting from the bottom of the Galatic Bay, is

5000 stadia, and that this is likewise the greatest breadth of

the Mediterranean. Consequently from the said line to the

bottom of the bay is 2500 stadia; but to Marseilles the distance is rather less, in consequence of that city being more to

the south than the bottom of the bay.<note anchored="yes">Strabo having allowed 25,400 stadia, or 36° 17′ 8″, for the latitude

Rhodes to Byzantium is about 4900<note anchored="yes">Or about 70. The actual difference in latitude between Rhodes and

Byzantium is 4° 32′ 54″.</note> stadia, it follows that

Byzantium must be far north of Marseilles.<note anchored="yes">On the contrary, Marseilles is 2° 16′ 21″ north of Byzantium.</note> The distance

from this latter city to Britain is about the same as from Byzantium to the Dnieper.<note anchored="yes">3800 stadia, or 5° 25′ 43″.</note> How far it may be from Britain to the island of Ierne is not known. As to whether

beyond it there may still be habitable lands, it is not our business to inquire, as we stated before. It is sufficient for our

science to determine this in the same manner that we did the

southern boundaries. We there fixed the bounds of the habitable earth at 3000 stadia south of Meroe (not that these

were its exact limits, but because they were sufficiently near);

so in this instance they should be placed about the same number of stadia north of Britain, certainly not more than 4000.<note anchored="yes">The following is a tabular form of the latitudes as stated by Strabo:

It would not serve any political purpose to be well acquainted with these distant places and the people who inhabit

them; especially if they are islands whose inhabitants can

neither injure us, nor yet benefit us by their commerce. The

Romans might easily have conquered Britain, but they did

not care to do so, as they perceived there was nothing to fear

from the inhabitants, (they not being powerful enough to attack us,) and that they would gain nothing by occupying the

<p>We have now been tracing upon a spherical surface the

region which we state to be occupied by the habitable earth;

and whoever would represent the real earth as near as possible

by artificial means, should make a globe like that of Crates, and

upon this describe the quadrilateral within which his chart of

geography is to be placed. For this purpose, however, a large

globe is necessary, since the section mentioned, though but a

very small portion of the entire sphere, must be capable of

properly containing all the regions of the habitable earth, and

presenting an accurate view of them to all those who wish to

consult it. Any one who is able will certainly do well to obtain such a globe. But it should have a diameter of not less

than ten feet: those who cannot obtain a globe of this size,

or one nearly as large, had better draw their chart on a plane-

surface, of not less than seven feet. Draw straight lines,

some parallel, for the parallels [of latitude], and others at

right angles to these; we may easily imagine how the eye

can transfer the figure and extent [of these lines] from a

plane-surface to one that is spherical. What we have just

observed of the circles in general, may be said with equal

truth touching the oblique circles. On the globe it is true

that the meridians of each country passing the pole have a

tendency to unite in a single point, nevertheless on the plane-

surface of the map, there would be no advantage if the right

lines alone which should represent the meridians were drawn

slightly to converge. The necessity for such a proceeding

would scarcely ever be really felt. Even on our globe itself<note anchored="yes">The artificial globe of 10 ft. diameter.</note>

the tendency of those meridians (which are transferred to the

map as right lines) to converge is not much, nor any thing

near so obvious as their circular tendency.

<p>In what follows we shall suppose the chart drawn on

a plane-surface; and our descriptions shall consist of what we

ourselves have observed in our travels by land and sea, and

of what we conceive to be credible in the statements and

have travelled from Armenia to that part of Tyrrhenia<note anchored="yes">Tuscany.</note> which

is over against Sardinia; and southward, from the Euxine to

the frontiers of Ethiopia.<note anchored="yes">Strabo was of Amasea, a city of Pontus, close to the Euxine. He

not one can be mentioned who has travelled over a wider extent of the countries described than we have. Some may

have gone farther to the west, but then they have never been

so far east as we have; again, others may have been farther

east, but not so far west; and the same with respect to north

and south. However, in the main, both we and they have

availed ourselves of the reports of others, from which to

describe the form, the size, and the other peculiarities of the

country, what they are and how many, in the same way that

the mind forms its conceptions from the information of the

senses. The figure, colour, and size of an apple, its scent,

feel to the touch, and its flavour, are particulars communicated by the senses, from which the mind forms its conception of an apple. So in large figures, the senses observe the

various parts, while the mind combines into one conception

what is thus seen. And in like manner, men eager after knowledge, trusting to those who have been to various places,

and to [the descriptions of] travellers in this or that country,

gather into one sketch a view of the whole habitable earth.
</p><p>In the same way, the generals perform every thing, nevertheless, they are not present every where, but most of their

success depends on others, since they are obliged to trust to

messengers, and issue their commands in accordance with the

reports of others. To pretend that those only can know who

have themselves seen, is to deprive hearing of all confidence,

which, after all, is a better servant of knowledge than sight

<p>Our first and most imperative duty<note anchored="yes">Humboldt commends Strabo's zeal in prosecuting his gigantic work,

Cosmos ii. 557.</note> then, both in respect to science and to the necessities of the man of business,

is to undertake to lay down the projection of the different countries on the chart in as clear a style as possible, and to signify

at the same time the relation and proportion they bear to the

whole earth. For such is the geographer's peculiar province.

It belongs to another science to give an exact description of

the whole earth, and of the entire vertebre of either zone, and



<pb n="179"/>



as to whether the vertebre in the opposite quarter of the earth

is inhabited. That such is the case is most probable, but not

that it is inhabited by the same race of men as dwell with us.

And it must therefore be regarded as another habitable earth.

We however have only to describe our own.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In its figure the habitable earth resembles a chlamys,

or soldier's cloak, the greatest breadth of which would be

indicated by a line drawn in the direction of the Nile, commencing from the parallel of the Cinnamon Country, and the

Island of the Egyptian Exiles, and terminating at the parallel

of Ierna; and its length by a line drawn from the west at

right angles to the former, passing by the Pillars of Hercules

and the Strait of Sicily to Rhodes and the Gulf of Issus,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Aïas.</note>

then proceeding along the chain of the Taurus, which divides

Asia, and terminating in the Eastern Ocean,<note anchored="yes">The Bay of Bengal.</note> between India

and the Scythians dwelling beyond Bactriana.
</p><p>We must therefore fancy to ourselves a parallelogram, and

within it a chlamys-shaped figure, described in such a manner

that the length of the one figure may correspond to the length

and size of the other, and likewise breadth to breadth. The

habitable earth will therefore be represented by this kind of

chlamys. We have before said that its breadth is marked

out by parallels bounding its sides, and separating on either

side the portions that are habitable from those that are not.

On the north [these parallels] pass over Ierna,<note anchored="yes">Strabo seems here to confound the parallel of Ierna with that of the

northern limits of the habitable earth, although a little above, as we have

seen, he determines these limits at 15,000 stadia north of Ierna.</note> and on the

side of the torrid zone over the Cinnamon Country. These

lines being produced east and west to the opposite extremities

of the habitable earth, form, when joined by the perpendiculars falling from their extremities, a kind of parallelogram.

That within this the habitable earth is contained is evident,

since neither its greatest breadth nor length project beyond.

That in configuration it resembles a chlamys is also clear,

from the fact that at either end of its length, the extremities

taper to a point.<note anchored="yes">These narrowed extremities of the continent are, Spain on the west, terminated by Cape St. Vincent, and on the east the peninsula of India, terminated by Cape Comorin. This cape Strabo supposed was continued

also loses something in breadth. This we know from those

who have sailed round its eastern and western points. They

inform us that the island called Taprobana<note anchored="yes">The island of Ceylon.</note> is much to the

south of India, but that it is nevertheless inhabited, and is

situated opposite to the island of the Egyptians and the Cinnamon Country, as the temperature of their atmospheres is

similar. On the other side the country about the embouchure

of the Hyrcanian Sea<note anchored="yes">Strabo supposed the Hyrcanian or Caspian Sea communicated with

the northern ocean.</note> is farther north than the farthest Scythians who dwell beyond India, and Ierna still more so. It

is likewise stated of the country beyond the Pillars of Hercules, that the most western point of the habitable earth is

the promontory of the Iberians named the Sacred Promontory.<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note>

It lies nearly in a line with Gades, the Pillars of Hercules,

the Strait of Sicily, and Rhodes;<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent is north of Cadiz by 30′ 30″, north of the Strait of

could perceive it, and also of the tradition preserved at Cnidus; for the observatory of Eudoxus, from whence he is reported to have viewed Canopus, is not much higher than these

houses; and Cnidus is under the same parallel as Rhodes,

which is likewise that of Gades and its sea-coast.

an obtuse angle towards the east as far as the extremities

of the Pyrenees which terminate at the ocean. Northward and opposite to this are the western coasts of Britain.

Northward and opposite to the Artabri are the islands denominated Cassiterides,<note anchored="yes">The Scilly Islands off the Cornwall coast.</note> situated in the high seas, but under

nearly the same latitude as Britain. From this it appears to

what a degree the extremities of the habitable earth are narrowed by the surrounding sea.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such being the configuration of the whole earth, it

will be convenient to take two straight lines, cutting each

other at right angles, and running the one through its greatest

length, and the other through its breadth. The former of these

lines will represent one of the parallels, and the latter one of

the meridians.<note anchored="yes">We have long had the custom of tracing on every map the parallels

of latitude and longitude at every degree, or every five or ten degrees, as

the case may be. By means of these lines drawn at equal distances, the

eye at once recognises the relative position of any place in the map.

This method was not in use when Strabo wrote: at that time it was

customary to draw a meridian or longitude, and a parallel of latitude, for

every important place of which the position was considered as determined.

This was certainly an obscure way of dividing the globe; nevertheless it

is requisite to keep it in mind, in order that we may the more readily

understand the general language of our geographer, who instead of simply

stating the latitude and longitude of places, says such a place is situated

under the same latitude, or about the same latitude, as such another place,

&amp;c. Ptolemy seems to have been the first who freed the study of geography from the confusion inseparable from the ancient method. He substituted tables easy of construction and amendment; where the position

of each place was marked by isolated numbers, which denoted the exact

latitude and longitude.</note> Afterwards we must imagine other lines

parallel to either of these respectively, and dividing both the



<pb n="182"/>



land and sea with which we are acquainted. By this means

the form of the habitable earth will appear more clearly to be

such as we have described it; likewise the extent of the various lines, whether traced through its length or breadth, and

the latitudes [of places], will also be more clearly distinguished, whether north or south, as also [the longitudes] whether

east or west. However, these right lines should be drawn

through places that are known. Two have already been thus

fixed upon, I mean the two middle [lines] running through its

length and breadth, which have been already explained, and

by means of these the others may easily be determined. These

lines will serve us as marks to distinguish countries situated

under the same parallel, and otherwise to determine different

positions both in respect to the other portions of the earth, and

also of the celestial appearances.

<p>The ocean it is which principally divides the earth into

various countries, and moulds its form. It creates bays, seas,

straits, isthmuses, peninsulas, and capes; while rivers and

mountains serve to the same purpose. It is by these means

that continents, nations, and the position of cities are capable

of being clearly distinguished, together with those various

other details of which a chorographical chart is full. Amongst

these latter are the multitude of islands scattered throughout

the seas, and along every coast; each of them distinguished

by some good or bad quality, by certain advantages or disadvantages, due either to nature or to art.
</p><p>The natural advantages [of a place] should always be mentioned, since they are permanent. Advantages which are adventitious are liable to change, although the majority of those

which have continued for any length of time should not be

passed over, nor even those which, although but recent, have

yet acquired some note and celebrity. For those which continue, come to be regarded by posterity not as works of art,

but as the natural advantages of the place; these therefore it

is evident we must notice. True it is, that to many a city

we may apply the reflection of Demosthenes<note anchored="yes">Demosthenes, Philipp. III. edit. Reisk. t. i. p. 117, 1. 22.—Demosthenes is here alluding to the cities which different Grecian colonies had

<p>Continuing our former sketch, we now state that the

earth which we inhabit contains numerous gulfs, formed by

the exterior sea or ocean which surrounds it. Of these there

are four principal. The northern, called the Caspian, by

others designated the Hyrcanian Sea, the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, formed by the [Southern] Sea, the one being

nearly opposite to the Caspian, the other to the Euxine; the

fourth, which in size is much more considerable than the

others, is called the Internal and Our Sea.<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> It commences

in the west at the Strait of the Pillars of Hercules, and

continues in an easterly direction, but with varying breadth.

Farther in, it becomes divided, and terminates in two gulfs;

that on the left being called the Euxine Sea, while the other

consists of the seas of Egypt, Pamphylia, and Issus. All

these gulfs formed by the exterior sea, have a narrow entrance; those of the Arabian Gulf, however, and the Pillars

of Hercules are smaller than the rest.<note anchored="yes">The entrance to the Arabian Gulf is about six or seven marine

to the Persian Gulf is seven or eight leagues in extent; while the Caspian,

being a lake, has of course no outlet whatever.</note> The land which

surrounds these, as before remarked, consists of three divisions.

Of these, the configuration of Europe is the most irregular.

Libya, on the contrary, is the most regular; while Asia holds a

middle place between the two. In all of these continents, the

regularity or irregularity of form relates merely to the interior coasts; the exterior, with the exception of the gulfs be

fore mentioned, is unindented, and, as I have stated, resembles

a chlamys in its form; any slight differences being of course

overlooked, as in large matters what is insignificant passes for

nothing. Since in geographical descriptions we not only aim at

portraying the configuration and extent of various places, but

also their common boundaries, we will remark here, as we have

done before, that the coasts of the Internal Sea<note anchored="yes">Mediterranean.</note> present a

greater variety in their appearance than those of the Exterior

[Ocean]; the former is also much better known, its climate is

more temperate, and more civilized cities and nations are

here than there. We are also anxious to be informed where

the form of government, the arts, and whatever else ministers

to intelligence, produce the greatest results. Interest will

always lead us to where the relations of commerce and society

are most easily established, and these are advantages to be

found where government is administered, or rather where it is

well administered. In each of these particulars, as before

remarked, Our Sea<note anchored="yes">Strabo here means the countries bordering the Mediterranean.</note> possesses great advantages, and here

therefore we will begin our description.

<p>This gulf,<note anchored="yes">Viz. the Mediterranean.</note> as before stated, commences at the Strait

of the Pillars; this at its narrowest part is said to be 70 stadia.

Having sailed down a distance of 120 stadia, the shores widen

considerably, especially to the left, and you behold a vast sea,

bounded on the right by the shore of Libya as far as Carthage,

and on the opposite side by those of Iberia and Keltica as far

as Narbonne and Marseilles, thence by the Ligurian,<note anchored="yes">The state of Genoa.</note> and

finally by the Italian coast to the Strait of Sicily. The

eastern side of this sea is formed by Sicily and the straits on

either side of it. That next Italy being 7 stadia [in breadth],

and that next Carthage <date value="1500">1500</date> stadia. The line drawn from

the Pillars to the lesser strait of 7 stadia, forms part of the

line to Rhodes and the Taurus, and intersects the sea under

discussion about its middle; this line is said to be 12,000 stadia,

which is accordingly the length of the sea. Its greatest

breadth is about 5000 stadia, and extends from the Galatic

Gulf, between Marseilles and Narbonne, to the opposite coast

of Libya.

and Hellespont communicate with another sea to the north,

named the Propontis,<note anchored="yes">Sea of Marmora.</note> and this again with another called the

Euxine. This latter is, so to speak, a double sea, for towards

its middle are two projecting promontories, one to the north,

on the side of Europe, and the other opposite from the coast

of Asia, which leave only a narrow passage between them,

and thus form two great seas. The European promontory

now Ilan-Adassi.</note> The eastern

portion is oblong and terminates in the narrow recess

in which Dioscurias is situated. In length it is 5000 stadia,

or rather more, and in breadth about 3000. The entire circumference of the Euxine is about 25,000 stadia. Some have

compared the shape of its circumference to a Scythian bow

when bent, the string representing the southern portions of

the Euxine, (viz. the coast, from its mouth to the recess in

which Dioscurias is situated; for, with the exception of Carambis, the sinuosities of the shore are but trifling, so that it

may be justly compared to a straight line,) and the remainder

[of the circumference representing] the wood of the bow with

its double curve, the uppermost very much rounded, the lower

more in a straight line. So this sea forms two gulfs, the

western much more rounded than the other.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To the north of the eastern Gulf of the Pontus, is the

Lake Mæotis, whose perimeter is 9000 stadia or rather more.

It communicates with the Euxine by means of the Cimmerian

Bosphorus,<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Zabache.</note> and the Euxine with the Propontis<note anchored="yes">The Sea of Marmora.</note> by the Thracian Bosphorus, for such is the name given to the Strait of

Byzantium, which is four stadia in breadth. The length of

the Propontis from the Troad to Byzantium is stated to be

<date value="1500">1500</date> stadia. Its breadth is about the same. It is in this

sea that the Island of the Cyziceni<note anchored="yes">The Island of Cyzicus was joined to the mainland by Alexander, and

thus formed a peninsula, notwithstanding Strabo describes it as an island. Its present name is Artaki.</note> is situated, with the other

islands around it.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such and so great is the extent of the Ægæan Sea towards the north.<note anchored="yes">The extent of the Ægæan amongst the ancients was the same as the

Egio-Pelago, or Archipelago, with us. It was comprehended between the

southern coasts of Crete, the western coasts of Peloponnesus, the southern coasts of Macedonia and Thrace, and the western borders of Asia Minor.

Strabo however, in his description, seems to comprise under the name of

the Ægæan not only those parts of the Mediterranean south of the meridian of Cape Matapan, but also the Propontis and the Euxine, as far as

the mouth of the river Halys, now Kizil-Ermak. In this however he

seems to be unique.</note> Again, starting from Rhodes, the [Mediterranean] forms the seas of Egypt, Pamphylia, and Issus,

extending in an easterly direction from Cilicia to Issus, a distance of 5000 stadia, along the coasts of Lycia, Pamphylia,

and the whole of Cilicia. From thence Syria, Phœnicia, and

Egypt surround the sea to the south and west as far as Alexandria. The Island of Cyprus is situated in the Gulfs of

Issus and Pamphylia, close to the Sea of Egypt. The passage

between Rhodes and Alexandria from north [to south] is

about 4000 stadia;<note anchored="yes">This is just the distance, says Gosselin, from the northern part of Rhodes to Alexandria, but the route, instead of being from north to south as supposed by the ancients, is S.

<pb n="190"/>



is the distance according to some mariners, others avow distinctly that it amounts to 5000 stadia; while he himself, from

observations of the shadows indicated by the gnomon, calculates it at 3750.
</p><p>That part of the Mediterranean Sea which washes the coasts

of Cilicia and Pamphylia together with the right side of the

Euxine, the Propontis, and the sea-coast beyond this as far as

Pamphylia, form a kind of extensive Chersonesus, the isthmus

of which is also large, and reaches from the sea near Tarsus<note anchored="yes">Tarsous.</note>

to the city of Amisus,<note anchored="yes">Samsoun.</note> and thence to the Themiscyran<note anchored="yes">Themiscyra, a town of Cappadocia at the mouth of the Thermodon, (now the Termeh,) belonging to the kingdom of the Amazons.

of the Amazons. In fact the whole region within this line as

far as Caria and Ionia, and the nations dwelling on this side

the Halys,<note anchored="yes">Kizil-Ermak.</note> is entirely surrounded by the Ægæan and the

<p>To speak shortly, the southernmost point of Our Sea

is the recess of the Greater Syrtes;<note anchored="yes">The Sidra of the moderns.</note> next to this Alexandria

in Egypt, and the mouths of the Nile; while the most northerly is the mouth of the Dnieper, or if the Mæotis be considered to belong to the Euxine, (and it certainly does appear

to form a part of it,) the mouth of the Don. The Strait

at the Pillars is the most westerly point, and the most easterly

is the said recess, in which Dioscurias<note anchored="yes">Iskouriah.</note> is situated; and not,

as Eratosthenes falsely states, the Gulf of Issus,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Aïas.</note> which is

under the same meridian as Amisus<note anchored="yes">Samsoun.</note> and Themiscyra, and,

by sea is above 3000 stadia, as will be seen more plainly in

my detailed account of those countries. Such then is the Mediterranean.



<pb n="191"/>



<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We must now describe the countries which surround

it; and here we will begin from the same point, whence we

commenced our description of the sea itself.
</p><p>Entering the Strait at the Pillars, Libya, as far as the river

Nile, is on the right hand, and to the left, on the other side of

the Strait, is Europe, as far as the Don. Asia bounds both

these continents. We will commence with Europe, both because its figure is more varied, and also because it is the

quarter most favourable to the mental and social ennoblement

of man, and produces a greater portion of comforts than the

other continents.
</p><p>Now the whole of Europe is habitable with the exception

of a small part, which cannot be dwelt in, on account of the

severity of the cold, and which borders on the Hamaxœci,<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Dwellers in waggons,</emph> or huts fixed on wheels for the purpose of transportation from one pasturage to another, as necessity might require.</note>

who dwell by the Don, Mæotis, and Dnieper. The wintry and mountainous parts of the habitable earth would

seem to afford by nature but a miserable means of existence; nevertheless, by good management, places scarcely inhabited by any but robbers, may be got into condition. Thus

the Greeks, though dwelling amidst rocks and mountains,

live in comfort, owing to their economy in government and

the arts, and all the other appliances of life. Thus too the

Romans, after subduing numerous nations who were leading

a savage life, either induced by the rockiness of their countries, or want of ports, or severity of the cold, or for other

reasons scarcely habitable, have taught the arts of commerce

to many who were formerly in total ignorance, and spread

civilization amongst the most savage. Where the climate is

equable and mild, nature herself does much towards the production of these advantages. As in such favoured regions

every thing inclines to peace, so those which are sterile generate bravery and a disposition to war. These two races receive mutual advantages from each other, the one aiding by

their arms, the other by their husbandry, arts, and institutions.

Harm must result to both when failing to act in concert, but

the advantage will lie on the side of those accustomed to arms,

except in instances where they are overpowered by multitudes.

This continent is very much favoured in this respect, being in-



<pb n="192"/>



terspersed with plains and mountains, so that every where the

foundations of husbandry, civilization, and hardihood lie side by

side. The number of those who cultivate the arts of peace, is,

however, the most numerous, which preponderance over the

whole is mainly due to the influence of the government, first of

the Greeks, and afterwards of the Macedonians and Romans.
</p><p>Europe has thus within itself resources both for war [and

peace]. It is amply supplied with warriors, and also with men

fitted for the labours of agriculture, and the life of the towns.

It is likewise distinguished for producing in perfection those

fruits of the earth necessary to life, and all the useful metals.

Perfumes and precious stones must be imported from abroad,

but as far as the comfort of life is concerned, the want or the

possession of these can make no difference. The country like-

wise abounds in cattle, while of wild beasts the number is but

small. Such is the general nature of this continent.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We will now describe separately the various countries

into which it is divided. The first of these on the west is Iberia,

which resembles the hide of an ox [spread out]; the eastern

portions, which correspond to the neck, adjoining the neighbouring country of Gaul. The two countries are divided on

this side by the chain of mountains called the Pyrenees; on

all its other sides it is surrounded by sea; on the south, as

far as the Pillars, by Our Sea; and thence to the northern

extremity of the Pyrenees by the Atlantic. The greatest

length of this country is about 6000 stadia, its breadth 5000.<note anchored="yes">From Cape Gata in Granada to the borders of Asturias the distance

is about 5000 stadia. But the greatest breadth of Spain is from Cape Gata

to Cape Belem in Gallicia, which equals 5890 stadia of 700 to a degree.</note>

<milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
<p>East of this is Keltica, which extends as far as the

Rhine. Its northern side is washed by the entire of the

British Channel, for this island lies opposite and parallel to

it throughout, extending as much as 5000 stadia in length. Its

eastern side is bounded by the river Rhine, whose stream runs

parallel with the Pyrenees; and its southern side commencing

from the Rhine, [is bounded] partly by the Alps, and partly by

Our Sea; where what is called the Galatic Gulf<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Lyon.</note> runs in, and

on this are situated the far-famed cities of Marseilles and Narbonne. Right opposite to the Gulf on the other side of the

land, lies another Gulf, called by the same name, Galatic,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Aquitaine or Gascony.</note> look-



<pb n="193"/>



ing towards the north and Britain. It is here that the

breadth of Keltica is the narrowest, being contracted into

an isthmus less than 3000 stadia, but more than 2000. Within

this region there is a mountain ridge, named Mount Cemme-

nus,<note anchored="yes">The Cevennes.</note> which runs nearly at right angles to the Pyrenees, and

terminates in the central plains of Keltica.<note anchored="yes">This ridge commences at the eastern part of the Pyrenees. Its

ramifications extend to about Dijon.</note> The Alps, which

are a very lofty range of mountains, form a curved line, the

convex side of which is turned towards the plains of Keltica,

mentioned before, and Mount Cemmenus, and the concave

towards Liguria<note anchored="yes">Genoa.</note> and Italy.
</p><p>The Alps are inhabited by numerous nations, but all Keltic

with the exception of the Ligurians, and these, though of a

different race, closely resemble them in their manner of life.

They inhabit that portion of the Alps which is next the Apennines, and also a part of the Apennines themselves. This

latter mountain ridge traverses the whole length of Italy from

north to south, and terminates at the Strait of Sicily.

<milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>

slip, resembling a peninsula, traversed, as I have said,

throughout its length by the Apennines; its length is 7000

stadia, but its breadth is very unequal. The seas which form

the peninsula of Italy are, the Tyrrhenian, which commences

from the Ligurian, the Ausonian, and the Adriatic.<note anchored="yes">The Tyrrhenian or Tuscan Sea commenced about the mouth of the

that on the south [Asia] beyond the Taurus. Consequently

the parts adjacent to the Mæotis and Don are on this side

After these mountaineers come the people dwelling beyond

the Taurus. First amongst these is India, a nation greater

and more flourishing than any other; they extend as far as

the Eastern Sea<note anchored="yes">The Bay of Bengal.</note> and the southern part of the Atlantic. In

the most southerly part of this sea opposite to India is situated

the island of Taprobana,<note anchored="yes">Ceylon.</note> which is not less than Britain.

Beyond India to the west, and leaving the mountains [of the

Taurus] on the right, is a vast region, miserably inhabited,

on account of the sterility of its soil, by men of different

races, who are absolutely in a savage state. They are

named Arians, and extend from the mountains to Gedrosia

and Carmania.<note anchored="yes">The Arians inhabited Sigistan and a part of modern Persia. Strabo

gave the name of Arians to all the people who occupied the portions of

<p>After Asia comes Libya, which adjoins Egypt and

Ethiopia. The coast next us, from Alexandria almost to the

Pillars, is in a straight line, with the exception of the Syrtes,

the sinuosities of some moderately sized bays, and the projection of the promontories by which they are formed. The side

next the ocean from Ethiopia up to a certain point is almost

parallel to the former; but after this the southern portions

become narrowed into a sharp peak, extending a little beyond

the Pillars of Hercules, and giving to the country something

the figure of a trapezium. Its appearance, both by the accounts of other writers, and also the description given to ourselves by Cnæus Piso, who was governor of this province, is

that of a panther's skin, being dotted over with habitations

surrounded by parched and desert land: these habitations

the Egyptians call Auases.<note anchored="yes">Or Oases, according to the common spelling.</note> This continent offers besides

several other peculiarities, which may be said to divide it

into three distinct portions. Most of the coast next us is very

fertile, more especially about the Cyrenaic and the parts about

Maurusians extending to the Atlantic.</note> The

whole land, from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules, is fertile. Nevertheless it abounds in wild beasts no less than

the interior; and it does not seem improbable that the cause

why the name of Nomades,<note anchored="yes">Numidæ.</note> or Wanderers, was bestowed on

certain of these people originated in their not being able

anciently to devote themselves to husbandry on account of

the wild beasts. At the present day, when they are well

skilled in hunting, and are besides assisted by the Romans in

their rage for the spectacle of fights with beasts, they are both

masters of the beasts and of husbandry. This finishes what

we have to say on the continents.

<p>It now remains for us to speak of the climata.<note anchored="yes">The climata are zones parallel to the equator. The ancients generally reckoned seven climata, which in the time of Hipparchus terminated at 48° 30′ 35″, where the longest day consisted of sixteen hours.

the poles. It is a great pity that Strabo has not noted all of them.</note> Of

these too we shall give but a general description, commencing

with those lines which we have denominated elementary,

namely, those which determine the greatest length and breadth

of the [habitable earth], but especially its breadth.
</p><p>To enter fully into this subject is the duty of astronomers.

This has been done by Hipparchus, who has noted down (as

he says) the differences of the heavenly appearances for every

degree of that quarter of the globe in which our habitable

earth is situated, namely, from the equator to the north pole.
</p><p>What is beyond our habitable earth it is not however the

business of the geographer to consider. Nor yet even in regard to the various parts of the habitable earth must too minute and numerous differences be noticed, since to the man

of the world they are perplexing; it will suffice to give the

most striking and simple of the statements of Hipparchus.

Assuming, as he does himself after the assertion of Eratos-

thenes, that the circumference of the earth is 252,000 stadia,

the differences of the [celestial] phenomena will not be great

for each [degree] within the limits between which the habitable

earth is contained. Supposing we cut the grand circle of the

earth into 360 divisions, each of these divisions will consist

of 700 stadia. This is the calculation adopted by [Hipparchus] to fix the distances, which [as we said] should be taken

under the before-mentioned meridian of Meroe. He commences at the regions situated under the equator, and stopping

from time to time at every 700 stadia along the whole length

of the meridian above mentioned, proceeds to describe the

celestial phenomena as they appear from each. But the

equator is not the place for us to start from. For even if

there be there a habitable region, as some suppose, it forms a

habitable earth to itself, a narrow slip enclosed by the regions

uninhabitable on account of the heat; and can be no part of

our habitable earth. Now the geographer should attend

to none but our own habitable earth, which is confined

by certain boundaries; on the south by the parallel which

passes over the Cinnamon Country;<note anchored="yes">According to Strabo, 12° 34′ 17″.</note> on the north by that

which passes over Ierna.<note anchored="yes">According to Strabo, 52° 25′ 42″.</note> But keeping in mind the scheme

of our geography, we have no occasion to mark all the

lestial phenomena. We must however commence, as Hipparchus does, with the southern regions.

<p>He tells us that the people who dwell under the parallel

of the Cinnamon Country, which he places at 3000 stadia

south of Meroe,<note anchored="yes">Now Gherri, on the banks of the Nile.</note> and 8800 [north] of the equator, live nearly

at equal distances between the equator and the summer tropic

which passes by Syene; for Syene is 5000 stadia [north] of

Meroe. They are the first<note anchored="yes">i. e. they are the most southern of those for whom, &amp;c.</note> for whom the whole [constellation]

of the Lesser Bear is comprised within the Artic Circle, and

to whom it is always visible. For the bright and most southern

star, at the tip of the tail, is here contained within the Arctic

Circle, and appears to touch the horizon.
</p><p>The Arabian Gulf lies eastward parallel to the said meridian. Its egress<note anchored="yes">Bab-el-mandeb, The Gate of Tears.</note> into the Exterior Ocean is [in the same

latitude as] the Cinnamon Country, the place where anciently

they used to hunt the elephants. The parallel of the Cinnamon Country on the one side<note anchored="yes">The east.</note> passes a little south of Tapro-

side, north and south. In those which are north of Syene

the north. The former are called amphiscii, the latter heteroscii. There is also another method of determining what

places are under the tropic, which we spoke of in our observations on the zones. The soil is sandy, arid, and produces

nothing but silphium, while more to the south the land is

well irrigated and fertile.

<p>The countries beyond this which border upon the

regions uninhabitable on account of their cold, have no interest to the geographer. He who desires to learn about them,

and the celestial phenomena which Hipparchus has described, but which we pass over as being too much in detail

for our present undertaking, must seek for them in that author.

The statements of Posidonius concerning the periscii, the amphiscii, and the heteroscii are likewise too detailed. Still we

must touch on these points sufficiently to explain his view,

and to point out how far such matters are serviceable in geography, and how far not. The terms made use of refer to

the shadows cast from the sun. The sun appears to the senses

to describe a circle parallel to that of the earth.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Ko/sm,</foreign> the universe.</note> Of those

people for whom each revolution of the earth produces a day

and a night, the sun being carried first over, then under,

the earth, some are denominated amphiscii, others heteroscii. The amphiscii are the inhabitants of countries in

which when a gnomon is placed perpendicularly on a plane

surface, the shadow which it casts at mid-day, falls first to

one side then to the other, as the sun illumines first this side,

then that. This however only occurs in places situated between the tropics. The heteroscii are those amongst whom

the shadow always falls to the north, as with us; or to the



<pb n="204"/>



south, as amongst those who inhabit the other temperate zone.

This occurs in all those regions where the arctic circle is less

than the tropic. Where however it becomes the same as or

greater than the tropic, this shows the commencement of the

periscii, who extend thence to the pole. In regions where

the sun remains above the horizon during an entire revolution

of the earth, the shadow must evidently have turned in a complete circle round the gnomon. On this account he named

them periscii. However they have nought to do with geography, inasmuch as the regions are not habitable on account

of the cold, as we stated in our review of Pytheas. Nor is

there any use in determining the size of this uninhabitable

region, [it is enough to have established] that those countries,

having the tropic for their arctic circle, are situated beneath

the circle which is described by the pole of the zodiac<note anchored="yes">The pole of the ecliptic.</note> in the

diurnal] revolution of the earth, and that the distance between the equator and the tropic equals four-sixtieths of the

great circle [of the earth].

<p>HAVING thus given a general view of Geography, it will

now be proper to describe each separate country in detail, as

we engaged to do. We fancy that the method which we have

adopted in the division of our subject, up to this point, has

been correct; and we now re-commence with Europe and the

various countries into which it is divided, on the same principles as formerly, and induced by the same reasons.

<p>The first division of this continent towards the west is

Iberia, as we before stated. The greater part of this country

is but little fitted for habitation; consisting chiefly of mountains, woods, and plains covered with a light meagre soil, the

irrigation of which is likewise uncertain The part next the

north, which borders on the ocean, is extremely cold, and besides its rugged character, has no communication or intercourse with other [countries], and thus to dwell there is attended with peculiar hardship. Such is the character of this

portion; on the other hand, almost the whole of the south is

fertile, especially what is beyond the Pillars [of Hercules].

This however will be shown more in detail, but we must first

describe the figure and extent [of the country].

from Iberia. The breadth both of Keltica and Iberia is irregular, the narrowest part in both of them from the Mediterranean to the [Atlantic] Ocean being near the Pyrenees,

particularly on either side of that chain; this gives rise to

gulfs both on the side of the Ocean, and also of the Mediterranean; the largest of these are denominated the Keltic or Galatic Gulfs,<note anchored="yes">The Gulfs of Lyons and Gascony.</note> and they render the [Keltic] Isthmus narrower

<p>It is quite possible that these things are so, and we ought

not to disbelieve them. Not so however with regard to the

other common and vulgar reports; for Posidonius tells us the

common people say that in the countries next the ocean the

sun appears larger as he sets, and makes a noise resembling

the sound of hot metal in cold water, as though the sea were

hissing as the sun was submerged in its depths. The statement [of Artemidorus] is also false, that night follows immediately on the setting of the sun: it does not follow immediately, although certainly the interval is short, as in other great

seas. For when he sets behind mountains the agency of the

false light continues the day for a long period; over the sea

the twilight is shorter, still darkness does not immediately

supervene. The same thing may be remarked in large plains.

The image of the sun is enlarged on the seas at its rising as

well as at its setting, because at these times a larger mass of



<pb n="208"/>



exhalations rises from the humid element; and the eye looking

through these exhalations, sees images refracted into larger

forms, as observed through tubes. The same thing happens

when the setting sun or moon is seen through a dry and thin

cloud, when those bodies likewise appear reddish.<note anchored="yes">We extract the following notice on this passage from Humboldt (Cosmos, vol. iii. 54, Bohn's edition). <q direct="unspecified">This passage has recently been

tells us that, having himself passed thirty days at Gades,<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note>

during which time he carefully observed the setting of the

sun, he is convinced of the falsity of Artemidorus's account.

This latter writer tells us, that at the time of its setting the

sun appears a hundred times larger than its ordinary size, and

that night immediately succeeds. If we attend to his account,

we cannot believe that he himself remarked this phenomenon

at the Sacred Promontory,<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> for he tells us that no one can

approach during the night; therefore they cannot approach at

sunset, since night immediately supervenes thereupon. Neither did he observe it from any other part of the coast washed

by the ocean, for Gades is upon the ocean, and both Posidonius and many others testify that there such is not the case.

there does not appear to be any distinction between them.

These people are esteemed to be the most intelligent of all

the Iberians; they have an alphabet, and possess ancient

writings, poems, and metrical laws six thousand years old, as

they say. The other Iberians are likewise furnished with an

<p>TURDETANIA lies above the coast on this side the Guadiana,<note anchored="yes">Anas.</note> and is intersected by the river Guadalquiver.<note anchored="yes">Bætis.</note> It is

bounded on the west and north by the river Guadiana; on the

east by certain of the Carpetani and the Oretani; on the south

by those of the Bastetani who inhabit the narrow slip of coast

between Calpe and Gadeira, and by the sea beyond as far as the

Guadiana. The Bastetani whom I have mentioned, together

with the people on the other side the Guadiana, and many of

the places adjacent, belong to Turdetania. The size of this

country in its length and breadth does not exceed two thousand

stadia, still it contains a vast number of towns; two hundred, it

is said. Those best known are situated on the rivers, estuaries,

and sea; but the two which have acquired the greatest name and

importance are, Corduba, founded by Marcellus,<note anchored="yes">Cordova, situated on the Guadalquiver in Andalusia, We do not

know whether it were founded by the Marcellus who was prætor in

Thither Iberia, and created consul in the year of Rome 601, or Marcellus who joined Pompey's party against Cæsar. This city served for

the winter quarters of the Romans, who during summer made war on the

inhabitants of the western and northern parts of Spain. It was the native place of the two Senecas and Lucan, and the chief emporium of Iberia. We may form some idea of the amount of its population from the number of those who perished when taken by Cæsar, as narrated by

Hirtius, Spanish War, § 34. But the period in which Cordova's glory

was at its zenith was during the empire of the Moors, in the eighth, ninth,

and tenth centuries, when it numbered 300,000 inhabitants.</note> and the city

of the Gaditanians.<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> The latter for its naval importance, and

these places are far from Corduba. Munda is in some sort

is distant from Carteia <date value="1400">1400</date><note anchored="yes">We should probably read 430.</note> stadia, and it was here that

Cnæus fled after his defeat, and sailing thence landed on a

His brother Sextus, having escaped from Corduba, after carrying on the war for a short time in Spain, caused a revolt

in Sicily.

The eye is also delighted with groves and gardens, which in

this district are met with in the highest perfection. As far

as Ispalis, which is a distance of not less than 500 stadia, the

river is navigable for ships<note anchored="yes">Strabo uses <foreign lang="greek">o\lka/sin a)ciolo/gois,</foreign> but the English hulk would not bear the same import in this place as the Greek.</note> of considerable size; but for the

cities higher up, as far as Ilipas, smaller vessels are employed,

and thence to Corduba river-boats. These are now constructed of planks joined together, but they were formerly

made out of a single trunk. Above this to Castlon the river is

no longer navigable. A chain of mountains, rich in metal,

runs parallel to the Guadalquiver,<note anchored="yes">Betis.</note> approaching the river sometimes more, sometimes less, towards the north.
</p><p>There is much silver found in the parts about Ilipas and

Sisapo, both in that which is called the old town and the new.

There are copper and gold about the Cotinæ.<note anchored="yes">Cotillas, or perhaps Constantina near Almaden.</note> These mountains are on the left as you sail up the river; on the right

there is a vast and elevated plain, fertile, full of large trees, and

containing excellent pasturage. The Guadiana<note anchored="yes">Anas.</note> is likewise

navigable, but not for vessels equally large, nor yet so far up.

It is also bordered by mountains containing metal, and extends as far as the Tagus. Districts which contain metals must,

of necessity, be rugged and poor,<note anchored="yes">Experience does not seem to warrant this conclusion.</note> as indeed are those adjoining Carpetania, and still more those next the Kelti-

berians. The same is the case with Bæturia, the plains of

which, bordering on the Guadiana, are arid.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Turdetania, on the other hand, is marvellously fertile,

and abounds in every species of produce. The value of its

productions is doubled by means of exportation, the surplus products finding a ready sale amongst the numerous

ship-owners. This results from its rivers and estuaries, which,

as we have said, resemble rivers, and by which you may sail

from the sea to the inland towns, not only in small, but even

in large-sized skiffs. For the whole country above the

coast, and situated between the Sacred Promontory<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> and the

Pillars, consists of an extended plain. Here in many places

are hollows running inland from the sea, which resemble

moderately-sized ravines or the beds of rivers, and extend



<pb n="215"/>



for many stadia. These are filled by the approach of the sea

at high tide, and may be navigated as easily, or even more

so than rivers. They are navigated much the same as rivers

the sea, meeting with no obstacle, enters like the flow of a river

at flood-tide. The sea comes in here with greater force than

in the other places; for being forced from the wide ocean into the narrow strait,<note anchored="yes">Of Gibraltar.</note> formed by the coast of Maurusia and

Iberia, it experiences recoils, and thus is borne full into the

retiring parts of the land. Some of these shallows are left

dry as the tide ebbs, while others are never destitute of water;

others again contain islands, of this kind are the estuaries

between the Sacred Promontory<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> and the Pillars, where the

tide comes in with more violence than at other places. Such

a tide is of considerable advantage to sailors, since it makes

the estuaries both fuller and more spacious, frequently swelling them to a breadth of eight<note anchored="yes">The text here is evidently corrupt, but it is not easy to determine to

what extent the overflow reached at the time Strabo wrote.</note> stadia, so that the whole land, so

to speak, is rendered navigable, thus giving wonderful facility

both for the export and import of merchandise. Nevertheless

there is some inconvenience. For in the navigation of the

rivers, the sailors run considerable danger both in ascending and descending, owing to the violence with which the

flood-tide encounters the current of the stream as it flows

down. The ebb-tides are likewise the cause of much damage

in these estuaries, for resulting as they do from the same

cause as the flood-tides, they are frequently so rapid as to

leave the vessel on dry land; and herds in passing over to the

islands that are in these estuaries are sometimes drowned [in

the passage] and sometimes surprised in the islands, and endeavouring to cross back again to the continent, are unable,

and perish in the attempt. They say that certain of the

cattle, having narrowly observed what takes place, wait till

the sea has retired, and then cross over to the main-land.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The men [of the country], being well acquainted with

the nature of these places, and that the estuaries would very

well answer the same purpose as rivers, founded cities and

other settlements along them the same as along rivers. Of

this number are Asta, Nebrissa,<note anchored="yes">Lebrixa.</note> Onoba,<note anchored="yes">Gibraleon.</note> Ossonoba, Mænoba,

besides many others. The canals which have been cut in

various directions are also found useful in the traffic which is

carried on between place and place, both amongst the people

themselves and with foreigners. The conflux of water at the

flood-tides is also valuable, as rendering navigable the isthmuses

which separate the different pieces of water, thus making it

possible to ferry over from the rivers into the estuaries, and

from the estuaries into the rivers. Their trade is wholly carried

on with Italy and Rome. The navigation is excellent as far

as the Pillars, (excepting perhaps some little difficulties at the

Strait,) and equally so on the Mediterranean, where the voyages

are very calm, especially to those who keep the high seas. This

is a great advantage to merchant-vessels. The winds on the

high seas blow regularly; and peace reigns there now, the

pirates having been put down, so that in every respect the

voyage is facile. Posidonius tells us he observed the singular

phenomenon in his journey from Iberia,<note anchored="yes">Spain.</note> that in this sea, as

far as the Gulf of Sardinia, the south-east<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">oi( Eu/(poi.</foreign></note> winds blow periodically. And on this account he strove in vain for three

abundance of cattle, and a great variety of game: while, on

the other hand, of destructive animals there are scarcely any,

with the exception of certain little hares which burrow in the

ground, and are called by some leberides.<note anchored="yes">These were evidently rabbits.</note> These creatures

destroy both seeds and trees by gnawing their roots. They

might be given them, as they were quite driven out of their

country by these animals, being no longer able to stand against

their vast multitudes.<note anchored="yes">According to Pliny, (lib. viii. c. 55,) this deputation was sent to

Augustus to demand of him a military force, apparently for the purpose

of assisting the inhabitants in destroying the rabbits. The same writer

has brought together a variety of instances in which cities have been

abandoned or destroyed through similar causes. Vide lib. viii. c. 29. The

inhabitants of Abdera in Thrace were forced to quit their city on account

of the rats and frogs, and settled on the frontiers of Macedonia. (Justin.

lib. xv. c. 2.)</note> It is possible that people should be

obliged to have recourse to such an expedient for help in

waging war in so great an extremity, which however but seldom happens, and is a plague produced by some pestilential

state of the atmosphere, which at other times has produced

serpents and rats in like abundance; but for the ordinary increase of these little hares, many ways of hunting have been

devised, amongst others by wild cats from Africa,<note anchored="yes">Ferrets.</note> trained for the purpose. Having muzzled these, they turn them into the

holes, when they either drag out the animals they find there

with their claws, or compel them to fly to the surface of the

earth, where they are taken by people standing by for that

purpose. The large amount of the exports from Turdetania

is evinced by the size and number of their ships. Merchant-

every variety of shell-fish, remarkable both for their number

and size, are found along the whole of the exterior sea, but

here in particular. It is probable that the flow and ebb tides,

which are particularly strong here, contribute both to their

quantity and size, on count of the great number of pools and

standing waters which they form.<note anchored="yes">We have here followed Gosselin's suggestion of <foreign lang="greek">limnasi/an</foreign> instead

Shoals of rich fat thunny are driven hither from the sea-coast

beyond. They feed on the fruit of a species of stunted oak,

which grows at the bottom of the sea, and produces very large

acorns. The same oaks grow in large numbers throughout

the land of Iberia, their roots are of the same size as those of

the full-grown oak, although the tree itself never attains the

height of a low shrub. So great is the quantity of fruit which

it produces, that at the season when they are ripe, the whole

coast on either side of the Pillars is covered with acorns

which have been thrown up by the tides: the quantity however



<pb n="219"/>



is always less on this side the Pillars [than on the other]. Polybius states that these acorns are ejected [by the sea] as far

as [the shores of] Latium, unless, he adds, Sardo<note anchored="yes">Sardinia.</note> and the

neighbouring districts also produce them. The thunny-fish

become gradually thinner, owing to the failure of their food,

as they approach the Pillars from the outer sea. This fish,

in fact, may be regarded as a kind of sea-hog, being fond of

the acorn, and growing marvellously fat upon it; and whenever acorns are abundant, thunny-fish are abundant likewise.

<p>Of the various riches of the aforenamed country,<note anchored="yes">Turdetania.</note> not

the least is its wealth in metals: this every one will particularly esteem and admire. Of metals, in fact, the whole country

of the Iberians is full, although it is not equally fertile and

flourishing throughout, especially in those parts where the

metals most abound. It is seldom that any place is blessed

with both these advantages, and likewise seldom that the different kinds of metals abound in one small territory. Turdetania, however, and the surrounding districts surpass so

entirely in this respect, that however you may wish, words

cannot convey their excellence. Gold, silver, copper, and

iron, equal in amount and of similar quality, not having been

hitherto discovered in any other part of the world.<note anchored="yes">The mineral riches of Spain are lauded in equal terms by Herodotus, Aristotle, Pliny, and many other writers. We can only remark, that at the present day the mineral wealth of that country scarcely justifies such descriptions.</note> Gold is

not only dug from the mines, but likewise collected; sand

containing gold being washed down by the rivers and torrents.

It is frequently met with in arid districts, but here the gold

is not visible to the sight, whereas in those which are overflowed the grains of gold are seen glittering. On this account

they cause water to flow over the arid places in order to make

the grains shine; they also dig pits, and make use of other

contrivances for washing the sand, and separating the gold

from it; so that at the present day more gold is procured by

washing than by digging it from the mines. The Galatæ

affirm that the mines along the Kemmenus mountains<note anchored="yes">The Cevennes.</note> and

their side of the Pyrenees are superior; but most people prefer

those on this side. They say that sometimes amongst the

have been proposed seem to clear up the difficulties which it presents.</note> and on this account gold is most easily

melted by straw, the flame of which is soft, and bearing a similarity [to the gold], causes it easily to dissolve: whereas coal,

besides wasting a great deal, melts it too much by reason of

its vehemence, and carries it off [in vapour]. In the beds of

the rivers the sand is either collected and washed in boats

close by, or else a pit is dug to which the earth is carried and

there washed. The furnaces for silver are constructed lofty,

in order that the vapour, which is dense and pestilent, may be

raised and carried off. Certain of the copper mines are called

gold mines, which would seem to show that formerly gold was

dug from them.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius, in praising the amount and excellence of the

metals, cannot refrain from his accustomed rhetoric, and becomes quite enthusiastic in exaggeration. He tells us we

are not to disbelieve the fable, that formerly the forests having been set on fire, the earth, which was loaded with silver

and gold, melted, and threw up these metals to the surface,

forasmuch as every mountain and wooded hill seemed to be

heaped up with money by a lavish fortune. Altogether (he

remarks) any one seeing these places, could only describe them

as the inexhaustible treasuries of nature, or the unfailing ex-

chequer of some potentate; for not only, he tells us, is this land

rich itself, but riches abound beneath it. So that amongst

these people the subterraneous regions should not be regarded

as the realms of Pluto, but of Plutus. Such is the flourished

style in which he speaks on this subject, that you would fancy



<pb n="221"/>



his turgid language had been dug from a mine itself. Dis-

coursing on the diligence of the miners, he applies to them the

remark [of Demetrius] of Phalaris, who, speaking of the silver mines of Attica, said that the men there dug with as

much energy as if they thought they could grub up Plutus

himself. He compares with these the activity and diligence

of the Turdetani, who are in the habit of cutting tortuous and

deep tunnels, and draining the streams which they frequently

encounter by means of Egyptian screws.<note anchored="yes">Archimedes' Screw. It was called the Egyptian screw because in-

vented by Archimedes when in Egypt, and also because it was much

employed by the Egyptians in raising water from the Nile for the irrigation of their lands.</note> As for the rest,<note anchored="yes">We read <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ loipo\n,</foreign> according to Kramer's suggestion.</note>

they are quite different from the Attic miners, whose mining

(he remarks) may be justly compared to that enigma,<note anchored="yes">The following is the enigma alluded to. We have extracted it from

Mackenzie's Translation of the Life of Homer, attributed to Herodotus of

I have taken up I have not kept, and what I have got I have

since a fourth part of the ore which they extract from the

copper mines is [pure] copper, while from the silver mines

one person has taken as much as a Eubœan talent. He says

that tin is not found upon the surface, as authors commonly

relate, but that it is dug up; and that it is produced both in

places among the barbarians who dwell beyond the Lusitanians

and in the islands Cassiterides; and that from the Britannic Islands it is carried to Marseilles. Amongst the Artabri,<note anchored="yes">These people inhabited the province of Gallicia in Spain.</note> who are

the last of the Lusitanians towards the north and west, he tells

us that the earth is powdered with silver, tin, and white gold,

that is, mixed with silver, the earth having been brought down

by the rivers: this the women scrape up with spades, and wash

in sieves, woven after the fashion of baskets. Such is the



<pb n="222"/>



substance of what [Posidonius] tells us concerning the mines

[of Iberia].

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Polybius, speaking of the silver mines of New Carthage,<note anchored="yes">Carthagena.</note> tells us that they are extremely large, distant from

the city about 20 stadia, and occupy a circuit of 400 stadia,

that there are 40,000 men regularly engaged in them, and

that they yield daily to the Roman people [a revenue of]

25,000 drachmæ. The rest of the process I pass over, as it

is too long, but as for the silver ore collected, he tells us that

it is broken up, and sifted through sieves over water; that

what remains is to be again broken, and the water having

been strained off, it is to be sifted and broken a third time.

The dregs which remain after the fifth time are to be melted,

and the lead being poured off, the silver is obtained pure.

These silver mines still exist; however they are no longer the

property of the state, neither these nor those elsewhere, but

are possessed by private individuals. The gold mines, on the

contrary, nearly all belong to the state. Both at Castlon<note anchored="yes">Caslona.</note>

and other places there are singular lead mines worked. They

contain a small proportion of silver, but not sufficient to pay

for the expense of refining.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Not far from Castlon is the mountain in which they report that the [river] Guadalquiver<note anchored="yes">Bætis.</note> takes its rise. They call it

silver mountain on account of the silver mines which it contains.<note anchored="yes">The Sierra Cazorla.</note> Polybius asserts that both the Guadiana<note anchored="yes">Anas.</note> and this river

have their sources in Keltiberia, notwithstanding they are

separated from each other by a distance of 900 stadia;<note anchored="yes">These 900 stadia are equal to from 25 to 26 leagues, which is exactly

the distance from the sources of the Guadalquiver near to Cazorla to the

lagoons named Ojos de Guadiana, adjacent to Villa-Harta.</note> [this we

are to attribute to] the Keltiberians having increased in power,

and having consequently conferred their name on the surrounding country. It appears the ancients knew the Guadalquiver

under the name of the Tartessus, and Gades<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> with the neighbouring islands under that of Erythia; and it is thought that

we should understand in this sense the words of Stesichorus<note anchored="yes">A Greek poet born at Himera in Sicily, and who flourished about

most opposite to the renowned Erythia, in a rocky cave near

to the abundant springs of the silver-bedded river Tartessus.</q>

They say that on the piece of land enclosed between the two

outlets of this river there formerly stood a city named, like

the river, Tartessus, and that the district was called Tartessis,

which the Turduli now inhabit. Eratosthenes likewise tells

us that the [country] near to Calpe<note anchored="yes">The rock of Gibraltar.</note> was called Tartessis, and

also Erythia the Fortunate Island. This Artemidorus contradicts, and says that it is as false as his other statements,

that the Sacred Promontory<note anchored="yes">Cape St. Vincent.</note> is distant from Gades<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> five

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Our poet [Homer] being very explicit, and possessing

great experience, gives one cause to believe that he was not

unfamiliar with these localities. Of this any one may be

convinced who will examine carefully what has been written

on these points, both the incorrect [comments], and likewise

those which are better and more truthful. One amongst these

incorrect ideas is, that he considered [Tartessis] to be the

farthest country towards the west, where, as he himself expresses it,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>The radiant sun in ocean sank,
</l><l>Drawing night after him o'er all the earth.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>The bright light of the sun fell into the ocean, drawing dark night

over the fruitful earth. </quote><bibl>Iliad viii. 485.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad viii. 485.</bibl></cit>



Now, since it is evident that night is ominous, and near to

Hades, and Hades to Tartarus, it seems probable that [Homer],

having heard of Tartessus, took thence the name of Tartarus

to distinguish the farthest of the places beneath the earth, also

embellishing it with fable in virtue of the poetic licence. In

the same way, knowing that the Cimmerians dwelt in northern

and dismal territories near to the Bosphorus, he located them



<pb n="224"/>



in the vicinity of Hades; perhaps also on account of the common hatred of the Ionians against this people. For they say

that in the time of Homer, or a little before, the Cimmerians

made an incursion as far as Æolia and Ionia. Always drawing his fables from certain real facts, his Planetæ<note anchored="yes">Wandering rocks.</note> are modelled

on the Cyaneæ. He describes them as dangerous rocks, as

they tell us the Cyaneæan rocks are, [and] on which account [in

fact] they are called Symplegades.<note anchored="yes">Entwining or conflicting rocks. Euripides, Medea, verse 2, gives

them the title of Symplegades.</note> He adds to this [the

account of] Jason's navigating through the midst of them.

The Straits of the Pillars<note anchored="yes">Gibraltar.</note> and Sicily,<note anchored="yes">The Strait of Messina.</note> likewise, suggested to

him the fable of the Planetæ. Thus, even according to the

worst comments, from the fiction of Tartarus any one might

gather that Homer was acquainted with the regions about

Tartessus.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of these facts, notwithstanding, there are better proofs.

For instance, the expeditions of Hercules and the Phoenicians

to this country were evidence to him of the wealth and luxury

of the people. They fell so entirely under the dominion of

the Phoenicians, that at the present day almost the whole of

the cities of Turdetania and the neighbouring places are inhabited by them. It also seems to me that the expedition of

Ulysses hither, as it took place and was recorded, was the

foundation both of his Odyssey and Iliad, which he framed

upon facts collected into a poem, and embellished as usual

with poetical mythology. It is not only in Italy, Sicily, and a

few other places that vestiges of these [events] occur; even in

Iberia a city is shown named Ulyssea,<note anchored="yes">Ulisipo or Lisbon.</note> also a temple of

Minerva, and a myriad other traces both of the wandering

of Ulysses and also of other survivors of the Trojan war, which

was equally fatal to the vanquished and those who took Troy.

These latter in fact gained a Cadmean victory,<note anchored="yes">A proverbial expression by which the Greeks described a victory

equally prejudicial to the victors and the vanquished.</note> for their

homes were destroyed, and the portion of booty which fell

to each was exceedingly minute. Consequently not only those

who had survived the perils [of their country], but the Greeks

as well, betook themselves to piracy, the former because they



<pb n="225"/>



had been pillaged of every thing; the latter, on account of the

shame which each one anticipated to himself:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>The shame
</l><l>That must attend us, after absence long
</l><l>Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But still it would be disgraceful to remain here so long, and to return

home without fitting booty. </quote><bibl>Iliad ii. 298.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad ii. 298.</bibl></cit>



In the same way is related the wandering of Æneas, of Antenor, and of the Heneti; likewise of Diomedes, of Menelaus,

of Ulysses,<note anchored="yes">We should probably here read Menestheus.</note> and of many others. Hence the poet, knowing of

similar expeditions to the extremities of Iberia, and having

heard of its wealth and other excellencies, (which the Phœnicians had made known,) feigned this to be the region of the

Blessed, and the Plain of Elysium, where Proteus informs

Menelaus that he is to depart to:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>But far hence the gods
</l><l>Will send thee to Elysium, and the earth's
</l><l>Extremest bounds; there Rhadamanthus dwells,
</l><l>The golden-haired, and there the human kind
</l><l>Enjoy the easiest life; no snow is there,
</l><l>No biting winter, and no drenching shower,
</l><l>But zephyr always gently from the sea
</l><l>Breathes on them to refresh the happy race.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But the immortals will send you to the Elysian plain, and the boundaries of the earth, where is auburn-haired Rhadamanthus; there of a truth

is the most easy life for men. There is nor snow nor long winter, nor

ever a shower, but ever does the ocean send forth the gently blowing

breezes of the west wind to refresh men. </quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 563.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey iv. 563.</bibl></cit>



Now the purity of the air, and the gentle breathing of the

zephyr, are both applicable to this country, as well as the

softness of the climate, its position in the west, and its

place at the extremities of the earth, where, as we have said,

he feigned that Hades was. By coupling Rhadamanthus

with it, he signifies that the place was near to Minos, of whom

he says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>There saw I Minos, offspring famed of Jove;
</l><l>His golden sceptre in his hand, he sat
</l><l>Judge of the dead.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>There then I beheld Minos, the illustrious son of Jove, having a golden

sceptre, giving laws to the dead. </quote><bibl>Odyssey xi. 567. Bohn's edition.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Odyssey xi. 567. Bohn's edition.</bibl></cit>



Similar to these are the fables related by later poets; such, for

instance, as the expeditions after the oxen of Geryon, and the



<pb n="226"/>



golden apples of the Hesperides, the Islands of the Blessed<note anchored="yes">The Canary Islands.</note>

they speak of, which we know are still pointed out to us not

far distant from the extremities of Maurusia, and opposite

to Gades.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>I repeat that the Phœnicians were the discoverers [of

these countries], for they possessed the better part of Iberia

and Libya before the time of Homer, and continued masters

of those places until their empire was overthrown by the

Romans. This also is an evidence of the wealth of Iberia:

in the expedition of the Carthaginians under Barcas,<note anchored="yes">Hamilcar, the father of Hannibal.</note> they

found, according to historians, that the people of Turdetania

used silver goblets<note anchored="yes">We have preferred, in common with the French translation, and the

manuscript cited by Xylander, to read <foreign lang="greek">fia/lais,</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">fa/tnais,</foreign> thinking it probable that Strabo referred in the first instance to the drinking

vessels, and afterwards to the wine barrels, as being made of silver.</note> and casks. One might guess too that it

was on account of this great opulence that the men of the

country, and their chiefs in particular, were styled long-lived.

Wherefore Anacreon thus sings,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Neither would I desire the horn of Amalthea, nor to reign over Tartessus one hundred and fifty years.</q></quote>



Herodotus too has preserved the name of the king, whom he

calls Arganthonius.<note anchored="yes">Herodotus, who wrote about a century after the time of Anacreon, expressly tells us that Arganthonius reigned during eighty years, and lived

one hundred and twenty (l. i. c. 163). Cicero, Valerius Maximus, and

Pliny report the same, apparently on the testimony of Herodotus.

Lucian, Phlegon, and Appian however state the life of Arganthonius at

one hundred and fifty years; and what is remarkable, the two former,

Lucian and Phlegon, cite as their authority Anacreon and Herodotus.

Pliny, citing Anacreon, has taken the <emph rend="ital">reign</emph> of one hundred and fifty years,

mentioned by the poet, as a <emph rend="ital">life</emph> of that duration. The passage of Strabo

is evidently changed from its original form.</note> The passage of Anacreon must therefore either be understood [of this king], or some other like

Brutus, surnamed the Gallician, made use of this city as a

military station, when fighting against the Lusitanians, whom

he subdued. On the sides of the river he fortified Olysipo, in

order that the passage up the river and the carriage of necessaries might be preserved unimpeded. These therefore are

the finest cities near the Tagus. The river contains much

fish, and is full of oysters. It takes its rise amongst the Keltiberians, and flows through the [country of the] Vettones,

<p>The country which we are describing is fertile, and irrigated by rivers both large and small, all of which flow from

the eastern parts parallel with the Tagus: most of them are

navigable and full of gold dust. After the Tagus, the most

noted rivers are the Mondego<note anchored="yes">Munda.</note> and the Vouga,<note anchored="yes">Vacua.</note> which are

navigable but for a short distance. After these is the Douro,<note anchored="yes">Durius.</note>

which flows from afar by Numantia,<note anchored="yes">A city situated near Soria in Old Castile.</note> and many other colonies

of the Keltiberians and Vaccæi; it is capable of being navigated in large vessels for a distance of nearly 800 stadia.

Besides these there are other rivers, after which is the [river]

of Lethe, which some call the Limæa,<note anchored="yes">Now the Lima.</note> others the Belio,<note anchored="yes">Xylander and many of the commentators propose to read <foreign lang="greek">)Obliouiw=na,</foreign> or Oblivion, in place of <foreign lang="greek">Beliw=na.</foreign> The conjecture seems extremely

this country] well deserving of commendation is, that the

the entire of the water raised by the high tides of the sea,

without either being overfilled, or overflowing the plains. This

was the limit of Brutus's expedition. Beyond there are many

other rivers parallel to those I have named.

<p>The Artabri are the last of the people [on this coast].

passed their lives in pillage and continual warfare, both between themselves and their neighbours, whom they used to

cross the Tagus [to plunder]. To this the Romans at length

put a stop by subduing them, and changing many of their

cities into villages, besides colonizing some of them better.

The mountaineers, as was natural, were the first to commence this lawless mode of life: for living but scantily, and

possessing little, they coveted the goods of others, who being

obliged to repulse them, of necessity relinquished their proper

employments, and instead of pursuing agriculture took up

arms. Thus it happened that their country, being neglected,

became barren notwithstanding its natural advantages, and

inhabited by bandits.

They report that some of those who dwell near to the river

Douro<note anchored="yes">Durius.</note> imitate the Lacedæmonians in anointing their bodies

with oil, using hot air-baths made of heated stones, bathing

in cold water, and taking but one tidy and frugal meal

a day. The Lusitanians are frequent in the performance of

sacrifice; they examine the entrails, but without cutting them

out of the body; they also examine the veins of the side, and

practise augury by the touch. They likewise divine by the

entrails of captive enemies, whom they first cover with a military cloak, and when stricken under the entrails by the

period. They also use beer; wine is very scarce, and what is

made they speedily consume in feasting with their relatives. In

place of oil they use butter. Their meals they take sitting,

on seats put up round the walls, and they take place on these

according to their age and rank. The supper is carried round,

and whilst drinking they dance to the sound of the flute and

account of their being at peace and the intermixture of

Romans. Wherever these [influences] are not so much experienced people are harsher and more savage. It is probable

that this ruggedness of character is increased by the barrenness of the mountains and some of the places which they

inhabit. At the present day, as I have remarked, all warfare

is put an end to, Augustus Cæsar having subdued the Cantabrians<note anchored="yes">Inhabitants of Biscay.</note> and the neighbouring nations, amongst whom the

<p>WHAT remains [to be described] of Iberia, is the seacoast of the Mediterranean from the Pillars to the Pyrenees,

and the whole of the inland country which lies above. The

breadth of this is irregular, its length a little above 4000

stadia. It has been remarked that the sea-coast<note anchored="yes">From the Pillars to the Sacred Promontory, or Cape St. Vincent.</note> is above

2000 stadia, and they say that from Mount Calpe,<note anchored="yes">The rock of Gibraltar.</note> which is

near the Pillars, to New Carthage,<note anchored="yes">Carthagena.</note> there are 2200 stadia.

This coast is inhabited by the Bastetani, also called the Bastuli, and in part by the Oretani. Thence<note anchored="yes">Viz. from Carthagena.</note> to the Ebro the

distance is nearly as great. This [region] is inhabited by

the Edetani. On this side the Ebro to the Pyrenees and the

<p>Commencing our particular description from Calpe,

there is [first] the mountain-chain of Bastetania and the

Oretani. This is covered with thick woods and gigantic trees,

and separates the sea-coast from the interior. In many places

it also contains gold and other mines. The first city along

the coast is Malaca,<note anchored="yes">Malaga.</note> which is about as far distant from

Calpe as Calpe is from Gades.<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> It is a market for the

nomade tribes from the opposite coast, and there are great

stores of salt-fish there. Some suppose it to be the same as

Mænaca, which tradition reports to be the farthest west of

the cities of the Phocæi; but this is not the case, for Mænaca,

which was situated at a greater distance from Calpe, is in ruins,

and preserves traces of having been a Grecian city, whereas

Malaca is nearer, and Phoenician in its configuration. Next

descriptive of the wanderings of Ulysses, should have located

the majority of the scenes which he narrates without the Pillars, in the Atlantic. For historical events of a similar char-

circumstances which he feigned did not make his fiction incredible; nor [should any one be surprised] if certain persons,

putting faith in the historical accuracy and extensive knowledge of the poet, should have attempted to explain the poem

of Homer on scientific principles; a proceeding undertaken

by Crates of Mallos,<note anchored="yes">A celebrated stoic philosopher and grammarian contemporary with

there have been those who have treated the undertaking of

Homer so contemptuously, as not only to deny any such knowledge to the poet, as though he were a ditcher or reaper, but

have stigmatized as fools those who commented on his writings.

And not one either of the grammarians, or of those skilled in

correct much that they have said, and also to set right other

<p>The settlement of the Grecians amongst these barbarous

nations may be regarded as the result of the division of these

latter into small tribes and sovereignties, having on account

of their moroseness no union amongst themselves, and therefore powerless against attacks from without. This moroseness is remarkably prevalent amongst the Iberians, who are

besides crafty in their manner, devoid of sincerity, insidious,

and predatory in their mode of life; they are bold in little

adventures, but never undertake any thing of magnitude,

inasmuch as they have never formed any extended power or

confederacy. If they had had but the will to assist each other,

neither could the Carthaginians by making an incursion have

so easily deprived them of the greater part of their country,

the republic; he was assassinated by one of his officers.</note> nor any others who desired power.

On this account the Romans, having carried the war into

Iberia, lost much time by reason of the number of different

sovereignties, having to conquer first one, then another; in

fact, it occupied nearly two centuries, or even longer, before

they had subdued the whole.—I return to my description.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Abdera<note anchored="yes">Adra.</note> is New Carthage,<note anchored="yes">Carthagena.</note> founded by Asdrubal,

who succeeded Bareas, the father of Hannibal. It is by far

the most powerful city of this country, being impregnable,

and furnished with a noble wall, harbours, and a lake, besides

the silver mines already mentioned. The places in the vicinity

have an abundance of salted fish, and it is besides the great

emporium of the sea merchandise for the interior, and likewise for the merchandise from the interior for exportation.

About midway along the coast between this city and the

Ebro, we meet with the outlet of the river Xucar,<note anchored="yes">Sucro.</note> and a city

bearing the same name.<note anchored="yes">That is, the ancient name, Sucro.</note> It rises in a mountain belonging to

other side of the Xucar, going towards the outlet of the

Ebro, is Saguntum, founded by the Zacynthians. The de-

struction of this city by Hannibal, contrary to his treaties with

the Romans, kindled the second Punic war. Near to it are

the cities of Cherronesus,<note anchored="yes">Peniscola.</note> Oleastrum, and Cartalia, and the

colony of Dertossa,<note anchored="yes">Tortosa.</note> on the very passage of the Ebro. The

and Serguntia. The Guadalquiver<note anchored="yes">Bætis.</note> rises in Orospeda, and after

passing through Oretania, enters Bætica. The Berones inhabit

the districts north of the Keltiberians, and are neighbours of

the Conish Cantabrians. They likewise had their origin in

the Keltic expedition. Their city is Varia,<note anchored="yes">Probably the small village of Varea, about half a league from Logrono; D'Anville supposes it to be Logrono itself.</note> situated near to

the passage of the Ebro. They are adjacent to the Bardyitæ,

<p>Of the four divisions into which the Keltiberians are

showed their valour in the war of twenty years, waged by

the Keltiberians against the Romans; for many armies of the

Romans, together with their generals, were destroyed; and in

the end the Numantians, besieged within their city, endured

the famine with constancy, till, reduced to a very small number, they were compelled to surrender the place. The Lusones

are also situated to the east, and likewise border on the sources

of the Tagus. Segeda and Pallantia<note anchored="yes">Palencia.</note> are cities of the Aru-

aci. Numantia is distant from Cæsar Augusta,<note anchored="yes">Saragossa.</note> situated as

we have said upon the Ebro, about 800 stadia. Near to Segobriga and Bilbilis,<note anchored="yes">Baubola.</note> likewise cities of the Keltiberians, was

fought the battle between Metellus and Sertorius. Polybius,

describing the people and countries of the Vaccæi and Keltiberians, enumerates Segesama<note anchored="yes">Sasamo, west of Briviesca.</note> and Intercatia amongst their

other cities. Posidonius tells us that Marcus Marcellus exacted of Keltiberia a tribute of 600 talents, which proves that

the Keltiberians were a numerous and wealthy people, notwithstanding the little fertility of their country. Polybius

narrates that Tiberius Gracchus destroyed 300 cities of the

Keltiberians. This Posidonius ridicules, and asserts that to

flatter Gracchus, Polybius described as cities the towers such

as are exhibited in the triumphal processions.<note anchored="yes">Allusion is here made to the custom of the Roman generals, who

caused to be carried at their triumphs, representations in painting or

sculpture, not only of the kings or generals of the enemy, who had been

slain, but likewise of the forts, cities, mountains, lakes, rivers, and even

seas, conquered from the enemy. This usage explains the words of Cicero,

incredible; for both generals and historians easily fall into

this species of deception, by exaggerating their doings. Those

who assert that Iberia contained more than a thousand cities,

seem to me to have been carried away in a similar manner,

and to have denominated as cities what were merely large villages; since, from its very nature, this country is incapable of

maintaining so many cities, on account of its sterility, wildness,

and its out-of-the-way position. Nor, with the exception of

those who dwell along the shores of the Mediterranean, is any

such statement confirmed by the mode of life or actions of

the inhabitants. The inhabitants of the villages, who constitute the majority of the Iberians, are quite uncivilized.

Even the cities cannot very easily refine the manners [of

their inhabitants], as the neighbouring woods are full of

robbers, waiting only an opportunity to inflict injury on the

citizens.

<p>All the Iberians, so to speak, were peltastæ, furnished

with light arms for the purposes of robbery, and, as we described the Lusitanians, using the javelin, the sling, and the

sword. They have some cavalry interspersed amongst the

foot-soldiers, the horses are trained to traverse the mountains,

and to sink down on their knees at the word of command, in

case of necessity. Iberia produces abundance of antelopes

and wild horses. In many places the lakes are stocked. They

have fowl, swans, and birds of similar kind, and vast numbers of bustards. Beavers are found in the rivers, but the

castor does not possess the same virtue as that from the

Euxine,<note anchored="yes">At the present day the best castor comes from Russia, but the greater

part of that found in shops is the produce of Canada. It is denominated

a stimulant and antispasmodic. Formerly it was much used in spasmodic

diseases, as hysteria and epilepsy. It is now considered almost inert, and

is seldom employed. After this description, it is scarcely necessary to

warn the reader against the vulgar error of confusing castor with castor

oil, which is extracted from the seeds of the Ricinus communis or castor oil

plant, a shrub growing in the West Indies.</note> the drug from that place having peculiar properties of its own, as is the case in many other instances.

Thus Posidonius tells us that the Cyprian copper alone produces the cadmian stone, copperas-water, and oxide of copper.

He likewise informs us of the singular fact, that in Iberia the

crows are not black; and that the horses of Keltiberia which

are spotted, lose that colour when they pass into Ulterior

Iberia. He compares them to the Parthian horses, for indeed

they are superior to all other breeds, both in fleetness and

their ease in speedy travelling.

<p>Iberia produces a large quantity of roots used in dyeing. In olives, vines, figs, and every kind of similar fruit-

impulse, and living most corruptly. They do not attend to

ease or luxury, unless any one considers it can add to the

happiness of their lives to wash themselves and their wives in

stale urine kept in tanks, and to rinse their teeth with it, which

they say is the custom both with the Cantabrians and their

neighbours.<note anchored="yes">Apuleius, Catullus, and Diodorus Siculus all speak of this singular

custom.</note> This practice, as well as that of sleeping on the

ground, is common both among the Iberians and Kelts. Some

say that the Gallicians are atheists, but that the Keltiberians,

and their neighbours to the north, [sacrifice] to a nameless

god, every full moon, at night, before their doors, the whole

family passing the night in dancing and festival. The Vet-

tones, the first time they came to a Roman camp, and saw

certain of the officers walking up and down the roads for the

mere pleasure of walking, supposed that they were mad, and

offered to show them the way to their tents. For they

thought, when not fighting, one should remain quietly seated

at ease.<note anchored="yes">A note in the French edition says, <q direct="unspecified">This surprise of the Vettones is

nothing extraordinary. Amongst all barbarous nations, savages especially,

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>What Artemidorus relates concerning the adornment

of certain of their women, must likewise be attributed to their

barbarous customs. He says that they wear iron collars

having crows fixed to them which bend over the head, and fall

forward considerably over the forehead. When they wish they

draw their veil over these crows, so as to shade the whole

face: this they consider an ornament. Others wear a tympanium<note anchored="yes">Head-dress shaped like a drum.</note> surrounding the occiput, and fitting tight to the head

as far as the ears, turning over [and increasing] little by

little in height and breadth. Others again make bald the

front of the head, in order to display the forehead to

greater advantage. Some twist their flowing hair round a

small style, a foot high, and afterwards cover it with a black

veil. Of singularities like these many have been observed

and recorded as to all the Iberian nations in common, but



<pb n="247"/>



particularly those towards the north not only concerning

their bravery, but likewise their cruelty and brutal madness.

For in the war against the Cantabrians, mothers have slain

their children sooner than suffer them to be captured; and a

young boy, having obtained a sword, slew, at the command of

his father, both his parents and brothers, who had been made

prisoners and were bound, and a woman those who had been

taken together with her. A man being invited by a party of

drunken [soldiers] to their feast, threw himself into a fire.

These feelings are common both to the Keltic, Thracian, and

Scythian nations, as well as the valour not only of their men,

but likewise of their women. These till the ground,<note anchored="yes">At the present day in Bilboa, the capital of Biscay, the women work

far more than the men; they load and unload vessels, and carry on their

heads burdens which require two men to place there.</note> and

after parturition, having put their husbands instead of themselves to bed, they wait upon them. Frequently in their

employment they wash and swathe their infants, sitting down

by some stream. Posidonius tells us that in Liguria, his host

Charmoleon, a man who came from Marseilles, related to him,

that having hired some men and women to dig his land, one

of the women was seized with the pains of labour, and going

to a little distance from where they were at work, she brought

forth, and returned immediately to her work, for fear she

might lose her pay. He observed that she was evidently

working in considerable pain, but was not aware of the

cause till towards evening, when he ascertained it, and sent

her away, having given her her wages. She then carried her

infant to a small spring, and having washed it, wrapped it up

in as good swaddling clothes as she could get, and made the

best of her way home.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Another practice, not restricted to the Iberians alone,

is for two to mount on one horse, so that in the event of a

conflict, one may be there to fight on foot. Neither are they

the only sufferers in being tormented with vast swarms of

mice, from which pestilential diseases have frequently ensued.

This occurred to the Romans in Cantabria, so that they caused

it to be proclaimed, that whoever would catch the mice should

receive rewards according to the number taken, and [even with

this] they were scarcely preserved, as they were suffering

besides from want of corn and other necessaries, it being

difficult to get supplies of corn from Aquitaine on account of



<pb n="248"/>



the rugged nature of the country. It is a proof of the ferocity of the Cantabrians, that a number of them having been

taken prisoners and fixed to the cross, they chanted songs of

triumph. Instances such as these are proofs of the ferocity

of their manners. There are others which, although not showing them to be polished, are certainly not brutish. For example, amongst the Cantabrians, the men give dowries to

their wives, and the daughters are left heirs, but they procure wives for their brothers. These things indicate a degree of power in the woman, although they are no proof of

advanced civilization.<note anchored="yes">We must remark that so far from the dowry given by men to their wives

being an evidence of civilization, it is a custom common amongst barbarous

people, and indicative of nothing so much as the despotic power of the

man over the wife. These dowries were generally a sum of money from

the husband to the father of his intended, on the payment of which he

acquired the same power over her as over a slave. Aristotle, speaking of

the ancient Greeks, tells us expressly that they bought their wives, (Polit.

ii. c. 8,) and observing that amongst barbarous nations women were always

regarded in the same light as slaves, he cites the example of the Cyclopes,

who exercised, according to Homer, sovereign authority over their families

(Odyss. 1. ix. 114). This custom was so well established amongst the

Greeks at the time of the poet, that he does not hesitate to introduce it

amongst the gods (Odyss. viii. 318). It was not unknown among the

Jews, and Strabo, in his fifteenth book, tells us that the Indians bought

their wives.</note> It is also a custom with the Iberians

to furnish themselves with a poison, which kills without pain,

and which they procure from a herb resembling parsley. This

they hold in readiness in case of misfortune, and to devote

themselves for those whose cause they have joined, thus dying

for their sake.<note anchored="yes">Cæsar and Athenæus attribute this custom to the Gauls, and Valerius

Maximus to the Keltiberians. Those men who attached themselves to

the interests of any prince or famous personage, and who espoused all his

quarrels, even devoting themselves to death on his account, are named by

Athenæus <foreign lang="greek">silodou=o|oi,</foreign> and by Cæsar <emph rend="ital">soldurii.</emph> Speaking of 600 soldiers

devoted in this manner to a Gaulish prince, named Adcantuannus, Cæsar

(1. iii. c. 22) says, <q direct="unspecified">Sibi mortem consciscant; neque adhuc hominum

memoriâ repertus est quisquam, qui, eo interfecto cujus se amicitiæ

devovisset, mori recusaret.</q> Plutarch tells us that Sertorius had in his

suite many thousand Iberians devoted to him. The following epitaph of

these men, who, after the death of Sertorius, sacrificed themselves, being

unwilling to survive him, was extracted by Swinburne from the Annals of

Catalonia.

<p>Some, as I have said, state that this country is separated

into four divisions; others, into five. It is not easy to state

any thing precisely on these points, both on account of the

changes which the places have undergone, and by reason of their

obscurity. In well-known and notable countries both the

migrations are known, and the divisions of the land, and the

changes of their names, and every thing else of the same

kind. Such matters being the common topics with everybody, and especially with the Greeks, who are more talkative

than any other people. But in barbarous and out-of-the-way

countries, and such as are cut up into small divisions, and

lie scattered, the remembrance of such occurrences is not

nearly so certain, nor yet so full. If these countries are far

removed from the Greeks [our] ignorance is increased. For

although the Roman historians imitate the Greeks, they fall

far short of them. What they relate is taken from the Greeks,

very little being the result of their own ardour in acquiring

information. So that whenever any thing has been omitted

by the former there is not much supplied by the latter. Add

to this, that the names most celebrated are generally Grecian.

Formerly the name of Iberia was given to the whole country

between the Rhone and the isthmus formed by the two

Galatic gulfs; whereas now they make the Pyrenees its boundary, and call it indifferently Iberia or Hispania; others

have restricted Iberia to the country on this side the Ebro.<note anchored="yes">The country between the Ebro and the Pyrenees.</note>

Still earlier it bore the name of the Igletes,<note anchored="yes">These Igletes are the same which Stephen of Byzantium names

Gletes, and by an error of the copyist Tletes. Herodotus places them

between the Cynetæ, and the Tartessians, and Theopompus in the neigh-

bourhood of the Tartessians. The position between the Ebro and the

Pyrenees, which Asclepiades the Myrlean thus gives them, supports the

opinion of those who reckon that Rosas was founded by the Rhodians,

and that the people of Marseilles did not settle there till afterwards; it is

more than probable that the Igletes were nothing more than Ignetes or

Gnetes of the Isle of Rhodes.</note> who inhabited

The Romans call the whole indifferently Iberia and Hispania,

<p>At the present time some of the provinces having been

which formerly were styled Lusitanians, but are now called

Gallicians. The northern mountains, together with the Asturian and Cantabrian, border on these. The river Melsus<note anchored="yes">Casaubon supposes that this is the river Ptolemy names Merus.

Lopez, Geograf. de Estrabon, lib. iii. p. 232, thinks it the Narcea.</note>

third oversees the midland district, and governs the cities inhabited by the togati, whom we have before alluded to as

inclined to peace, and who have adopted the refined manners

and mode of life of the Italians, together with the toga. These

art they have been proficient in since the time that the Phœnicians possessed the islands. It is said that these<note anchored="yes">Viz. the Phœnicians.</note> were the

first who introduced amongst the men [of the Baleares] the

custom of wearing tunics with wide borders. They were accustomed to go into battle naked, having a shield covered

with goat-skin in their hand, and a javelin hardened by fire

at the point, very rarely with an iron tip, and wearing round

the head three slings of black rush,<note anchored="yes">Immediately after the word <foreign lang="greek">melagkrai=\nas,</foreign> which we have translated

black rush, the text of our geographer runs on as follows: <q direct="unspecified">resembling

with a mere schœnus.</q> It is evident that this passage is the scholium of

sling they use for hitting at far distances, the short one for

near marks, and the middle one for those between. From

childhood they were so thoroughly practised in the use of

slings, that bread was never distributed to the children till they

had won it by the sling.<note anchored="yes"><q direct="unspecified">Cibum puer a matre non accipit, nisi quem, ipsa monstrante, percussit.</q> Florus, lib. iii. c. 8. The same thing is stated by Lycophron,

he was approaching the islands, spread pelts over the decks

as a shelter from the slings. He introduced [into the country

3000 Roman colonists from Spain.

<p>In addition to the fruitfulness of the land, noxious

animals are rarely to be met with. Even the rabbits, they

say, were not indigenous, but that a male and female having

been introduced by some one from the opposite continent,

from thence the whole stock sprung, which formerly was so

great a nuisance that even houses and trees were overturned,

[being undermined] by their warrens, and the inhabitants



<pb n="253"/>



were compelled, as we have related, to resort for refuge to the

Romans. However, at the present day the facility with

which these animals are taken, prevents them from doing injury, consequently those who possess land cultivate it with

advantage. These [islands] are on this side of what are

called the Pillars of Hercules.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Near to them are two small islands, one of which is

called the Island of Juno: some call these the Pillars. Beyond the Pillars is Gades,<note anchored="yes">Cadiz.</note> concerning which all that we have

hitherto remarked is, that it is distant from Calpe<note anchored="yes">The rock of Gibraltar.</note> about 750

stadia, and is situated near to the outlet of the Guadalquiver.<note anchored="yes">This mouth of the Guadalquiver, opposite Cadiz, no longer exists.</note>

Notwithstanding there is much can be said about it. For its inhabitants equip the greatest number of ships, and the largest

in size, both for our sea,<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> and the exterior [ocean], although

the island they inhabit is by no means large, nor yet do they

possess much of the mainland, nor are masters of other islands.

They dwell for the most part on the sea, only a few staying at

home or passing their time in Rome. Still, in amount of

population, their city does not seem to be surpassed by any

with the exception of Rome. I have heard that in a census

taken within our own times, there were enumerated five hundred citizens of Gades of the equestrian order, a number

equalled by none of the Italian cities excepting that of the

Patavini.<note anchored="yes">Padua.</note> However, notwithstanding their vast number, its

inhabitants possess an island, in length<note anchored="yes"><q direct="unspecified">The length of the island of Leon, at the extremity of which the city

of Cadiz is situated, is about 9500 toises, which are equivalent to 100

Olympic stadia.</q><emph rend="ital">Gosselin.</emph></note> not much above 100

stadia, and in some places only one stadium in breadth.

Originally the city in which they dwelt was extremely small,

but Balbus<note anchored="yes">L. Cornelius Balbus was a native of Cadiz, and descended from an

illustrious family in that town. His original name probably bore some

resemblance in sound to the Latin Balbus. Cadiz being one of the

federate cities, supported the Romans in their war against Sertorius in

Spain, and Balbus thus had an opportunity for distinguishing himself.

He served under the Roman generals Q. Mettellus Pius, C. Memmius,

and Pompey, and was present at the battles of Turia and Sucro. He

distinguished himself so much throughout the war, that Pompey conferred the Roman citizenship upon him, his brother, and his brother's sons

and this act of Pompey was ratified by the law of the consuls, Cn. Cornelius Lentulus and L. Gellius, B. C. <date value="-72">72</date>. It was probably in honour of

these consuls that Balbus took the Gentile name of the one, and the

prænomen of the other. It was for this Balbus that Cicero made the defence which has come down to us. The reason which induced Strabo to

notice, as something remarkable, that Balbus had received the honours of

a triumph, we learn from Pliny, who, noticing the victories which he had

gained over the Garamantes and other nations of Africa, tells us he was

the only person of foreign extraction who had ever received the honour of

a triumph. <q direct="unspecified">Omnia armis Romanis superata et a Cornelio Balbo

triumphata, uni huic omnium externo curru et Quiritium jure donato.</q>

Plin. ib. v. c. 5. Solinus likewise says of him, (cap. xxix. p. 54,)

<q direct="unspecified">Primus sane de externis, utpote Gadibus genitus accessit ad gloriana

nominis triumphalis.</q></note> the Gaditanian, who received the honours of a



<pb n="254"/>



triumph, added another to it which they call the New

Town. These two form the city of Didyme,<note anchored="yes">This word signifies <q direct="unspecified">The Twins.</q></note> which is not

above twenty stadia in circumference. In it, however,

they are not pressed for room, because few live at home, the

majority passing their lives on the sea, some too dwelling on

the opposite continent, and particularly on a little island adjacent on account of its excellence. They have such a liking

for this place as almost to have made it a rival city to Didyme. However, few in comparison inhabit either this or

the sea-port which Balbus constructed for them on the opposite continent. Their city is situated in the western parts

of the island. Near to it is the temple of Saturn, which

terminates [Gades to the west], and is opposite the smaller

island. The temple of Hercules is on the other side, to the

east, where the island approaches nearest to the mainland,

being only separated therefrom by a strait of a stadium [in

breadth].<note anchored="yes">Gosselin says, the temple of Saturn appears to have stood on the

site of the present church of S. Sebastian, and that of Hercules at the

other extremity of the island on the site of St. Peter's.</note> They say that this temple is twelve miles from

the city, thus making the number of miles and the number of

[Hercules'] labours equal: but this is too great, being almost

equal to the length of the island. Now the length of the

island runs from west to east.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Pherecydes appears to have given to Gades the name of

Erythia, the locality of the myths concerning Geryon: others

suppose it to have been the island situated near to this city,

and separated from it by a strait of merely one stadium.

This they do on account of the excellence of its pasturage.



<pb n="255"/>



For the milk of the cattle which feed there does not yield any

whey, and they are obliged to mix it with large quantities of

water when they make cheese on account of its richness.

After fifty days the beasts [pasturing there] would be choked

unless they were let blood. The pasturage of the country is

dry, but it fattens wonderfully: and it is thought that from

this the myth concerning the oxen of Geryon took its rise.

The whole sea-shore however is possessed in common.<note anchored="yes">Groskurd supposes that we should here read, <q direct="unspecified">[certain citizens of

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Concerning the foundation of Gades, the Gaditanians

report that a certain oracle commanded the Tyrians to found

a colony by the Pillars of Hercules. Those who were sent

out for the purpose of exploring, when they had arrived at

the strait by Calpe, imagined that the capes which form the

strait were the boundaries of the habitable earth, as well as of

the expedition of Hercules, and consequently they were what

the oracle termed the Pillars. They landed on the inside of

the straits, at a place where the city of the Exitani now stands.

Here they offered sacrifices, which however not being favourable, they returned. After a time others were sent, who advanced about <date value="1500">1500</date><note anchored="yes">Gosselin shows that we ought to read 500 stadia in this place.</note> stadia beyond the strait, to an island

consecrated to Hercules, and lying opposite to Onoba, a city of

Iberia: considering that here were the Pillars, they sacrificed

to the god, but the sacrifices being again unfavourable, they

returned home. In the third voyage they reached Gades,

and founded the temple in the eastern part of the island, and

the city in the west. On this account some consider that

the capes in the strait are the Pillars, others suppose Gades,

while others again believe that they lie still farther,

beyond Gades. There are also some who think that the

Pillars are Calpe,<note anchored="yes">The rock of Gibraltar.</note> and the mountain of Libya which is

opposite, named Abilyx,<note anchored="yes">The Ape-mountain near Ceuta.</note> and situated, according to Eratosthenes, amongst the Metagonians, a wandering race. Others

fancy that they are two small islands near to the former, one of which is named the Island of Juno. Artemidorus

speaks both of the Island of Juno and the temple there, but

makes no mention either of mount Abilyx, or the nation of



<pb n="256"/>



the Metagonians.<note anchored="yes">The text is corrupt, but it is needless to go through all the emendations proposed.</note> Some have transported hither the Planctæ

and the Symplgades, supposing them to be the Pillars, which

Pindar calls the Gates of Gades, when he says that they were

the farthest limits at which Hercules arrived.<note anchored="yes">This passage of Pindar has not come down to us.</note> Dicæarchus,

Eratosthenes, and Polybius, with most of the Grecians, represent the Pillars as being close to the strait, while the Iberians

and Libyans place them at Gades, alleging that there is nothing at all resembling pillars close by the strait. Others

pretend that they are the pillars of brass eight cubits high in

the temple of Hercules at Gades, on which is inscribed the

cost of erecting that edifice; and that the sailors coming there

on the completion of their voyage and sacrificing to Hercules,

rendered the place so famous that it came to be regarded as

the termination of the land and sea. Posidonius thinks this

view the most probable of all, and looks upon the oracle and

the several expeditions as a Phoenician invention.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">y/e=sma Foinikiko/n,</foreign> a proverbial mode of speaking, having its origin

in the bad faith of the Phœnicians [<emph rend="ital">fides Punica</emph>]</note> As for

the expeditions, what matters it whether any one should vehemently deny or credit the account, as neither the one nor the

other would be inconsistent with reason: but the assertion

that neither the little islands, nor yet the mountains, bear

much resemblance to pillars, and that we should seek for

pillars, strictly so called, [set up] either as the termination of the habitable earth, or of the expedition of Hercules, has at all events some reason in it; it being an ancient usage to set up such boundary marks. As for instance

the small column which the inhabitants of Rhegium<note anchored="yes">Regio.</note> erected by

the Strait of Sicily, which is indeed a little tower; and the

tower called after Pelorus, which is situated opposite to this

small column; also the structures called altars<note anchored="yes">Strabo, in his 17th book, gives a different locality to these altars.</note> of the Philæni,

about midway in the land between the Syrtes; likewise it is

recorded, that a certain pillar was formerly erected on the

Isthmus of Corinth, which the Ionians who took possession of

Attica and Megaris when they were driven out of the Peloponnesus, and those who settled in the Peloponnesus, set up

in common, and inscribed on the side next Megaris,



<pb n="257"/>



<quote><lg>

<l>This is no longer Peloponnesus, but Ionia,</l></lg></quote>



and on the opposite,



<quote><lg>

<l>This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia.</l></lg></quote>



Alexander too erected altars as boundaries of his Indian campaign in those parts of the Indies he arrived at, which were

situated farthest towards the east, in imitation of Hercules and

Bacchus.<note anchored="yes">These were twelve altars, of fifty cubits each, erected to the twelve

gods. <emph rend="ital">Vide</emph> Diodorus Siculus, 1. xvii. c. 95.</note> That this custom existed, then, cannot be doubted.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is probable that the places themselves took the same

name [as the monuments], especially after time had destroyed

the boundary marks which had been placed there. For instance, at the present day the altars of the Philæni no longer

exist, but the place itself bears that designation. Similarly

they say that in India neither the pillars of Hercules or Bacchus are to be seen, nevertheless certain localities being described and pointed out to the Macedonians, they believed that

those places were the pillars in which they discovered any

trace either of the adventures of Bacchus or Hercules. In

the instance before us, it is not improbable that they who first

[visited these regions], set up boundary marks fashioned by

the hand of man, such as altars, towers, and pillars, in the most

remarkable situations, to indicate the farthest distance they had

reached, (and straits, the surrounding mountains, and little

islands, are indubitably the most remarkable situations for

pointing out the termination or commencement of places,) and

that after these human monuments had decayed, their names

descended to the places [where they had stood]; whether that

were the little islands or the capes forming the strait. This

latter point it would not be easy now to determine; the name

would suit either place, as they both bear some resemblance

to pillars; I say bear some resemblance, because they are placed

in such situations as might well indicate boundaries. Now

this strait is styled a mouth, as well as many others, but the

mouth is at the beginning to those sailing into the strait, and

to those who are quitting it at the end. The little islands at

the mouth having a contour easy to describe, and being remarkable, one might not improperly compare to pillars. In

like manner the mountains overlooking the strait are promi-



<pb n="258"/>



nent, resembling columns or pillars. So too Pindar might very

justly have said, <q direct="unspecified">The Gaditanian Gates,</q> if he had in mind

the pillars at the mouth; for these mouths are very similar to

gates. On the other hand, Gades is not in a position to indicate an extremity, but is situated about the middle of a long

coast forming a kind of gulf. The supposition that the pillars of the temple of Hercules in Gades are intended, appears

to me still less probable. It seems most likely that the name

was originally conferred not by merchants, but generals, its

celebrity afterwards became universal, as was the case with

the Indian pillars. Besides, the inscription recorded refutes

this idea, since it contains no religious dedication, but a mere

list of expenses; whereas the pillars of Hercules should have

been a record of the hero's wonderful deeds, not of Phoenician

expenditure.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Polybius relates that there is a spring within the temple

of Hercules at Gades, having a descent of a few steps to fresh

water, which is affected in a manner the reverse of the sea-

tides, subsiding at the flow of the tide, and springing at the

ebb. He assigns as the cause of this phenomenon, that air

rises from the interior to the surface of the earth; when this

surface is covered by the waves, at the rising of the sea, the

air is deprived of its ordinary vents, and returns to the interior, stopping up the passages of the spring, and causing a

want of water, but when the surface is again laid bare, the

air having a direct exit liberates the channels which feed

the spring, so that it gushes freely. Artemidorus rejects

this explanation, and substitutes one of his own, recording at

the same time the opinion of the historian Silanus; but neither one or other of their views seems to me worth relating,

since both he and Silanus were ignorant in regard to these

matters. Posidonius asserts that the entire account is false,

and adds that there are two wells in the temple of Hercules,

and a third in the city. That the smaller of the two in the

temple of Hercules, if drawn from frequently, will become for

a time exhausted, but that on ceasing to draw from it, it fills

again: while in regard to the larger, it may be drawn from

during the whole day; that it is true it becomes lower, like

all other wells, but that it fills again during the night when

drawing ceases. [He adds] that the ebb tide frequently happening to occur during the period of its re-filling, gave rise



<pb n="259"/>



to the groundless belief of the inhabitants as to its being

affected in an opposite manner [to the tides of the ocean].

However it is not only related by him that it is a commonly

believed fact, but we have received it from tradition as much

referred to amongst paradoxes.<note anchored="yes">The text is <foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s pao|ado/cois,</foreign> which Gosselin renders, <q direct="unspecified">Les ouvrages qui traitent des choses merveilleuses.</q></note> We have likewise heard

that there are wells both within the city and also in the gardens without, but that on account of the inferiority of this

water, tanks are generally constructed throughout the city for

the supply of water: whether likewise any of these reservoirs

give any signs of being affected in an opposite manner to the

tides, we know not. If such be the case, the causes thereof

should be received as amongst phenomena hard to be explained. It is likely that Polybius may have assigned the

proper reason; but it is also likely that certain of the channels of the springs being damped outside become relaxed, and

so let the water run out into the surrounding land, instead of

forcing it along its ancient passage to the spring; and there

will of course be moisture when the tide overflows.<note anchored="yes">Strabo's argument is here so weak, that one can hardly believe it

can have ever been seriously made use of.</note> But if,

as Athenodorus asserts, the ebb and flow resemble the inspiration and expiration of the breath, it is possible that some

of the currents of water which naturally have an efflux on to

the surface of the earth, through various channels, the mouths

of which we denominate springs and fountains, are by other

channels drawn towards the depths of the sea, and raise it, so

as to produce a flood-tide; when the expiration is sufficient,

they leave off the course in which they are then flowing, and

again revert to their former direction, when that again takes a

change.<note anchored="yes">This method of explaining the ebb and flow of the sea, by comparing

it to the respiration of animals, is not so extraordinary, when we remember that it was the opinion of many philosophers that the universe was

itself an animal. Pomponius Mela, (De Situ Orbis, lib. iii. c. 1,) speaking

of the tides, says, <q direct="unspecified">Neque adhuc satis cognitum est, anhelitune suo id

mundus efficiat, retractamque cum spiritu regerat undam undique, si, ut

doctioribus placet, unum (<emph rend="ital">lege</emph> universum) animal est; an sint depressi

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>I cannot tell how it is that Posidonius, who describes the

Phœnicians as sagacious in other things, should here attribute



<pb n="260"/>



to them folly rather than shrewdness. The sun completes his

revolution in the space of a day and night, being a portion of

the time beneath the earth, and a portion of the time shining

upon it. Now he asserts that the motion of the sea corresponds

with the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and experiences

a diurnal, monthly, and annual change, in strict accordance

with the changes of the moon. For [he continues] when the

moon is elevated one sign of the zodiac<note anchored="yes">Thirty degrees.</note> above the horizon,

the sea begins sensibly to swell and cover the shores, until

she has attained her meridian; but when that satellite begins

to decline, the sea again retires by degrees, until the moon

wants merely one sign of the zodiac from setting; it then remains stationary until the moon has set, and also descended

one sign of the zodiac below the horizon, when it again rises

until she has attained her meridian below the earth; it then

retires again until the moon is within one sign of the zodiac of

her rising above the horizon, when it remains stationary until

the moon has risen one sign of the zodiac above the earth,

and then begins to rise as before. Such he describes to be the

diurnal revolution. In respect to the monthly revolution, [he

says] that the spring-tides occur at the time of the new moon,

when they decrease until the first quarter; they then increase

until full moon, when they again decrease until the last quarter, after which they increase till the new moon; [he adds]

that these increases ought to be understood both of their duration and speed. In regard to the annual revolution, he says

that he learned from the statements of the Gaditanians, that

both the ebb and flow tides were at their extremes at the

summer solstice: and that hence he conjectured that they decreased until the [autumnal] equinox; then increased till the

winter solstice; then decreased again until the vernal equinox;

and [finally] increased until the summer solstice. But since

these revolutions occur twice in the four-and-twenty hours,

the sea rising twice and receding twice, and that regularly

every day and night, how is it that the filling and failing of

the well do not frequently occur during the ebb and flow of the

tide? or if it be allowed that this does often occur, why does

it not do so in the same proportion? and if it does so in the

same proportion, how comes it that the Gaditanians are not



<pb n="261"/>



competent to observe what is of daily occurrence, while they

are nevertheless competent to the observing of revolutions

which occur but once in the year. That Posidonius himself

credited these reports is evident from his own conjecture respecting the decrease and increase [of the sea] from solstice to

solstice. However, it is not likely, being an observant people,

that they should be ignorant of what actually occurred, whilst

giving credit to imaginary phenomena.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius tells us that Seleucus, a native of the country

next the Erythræan Sea,<note anchored="yes">The Persian Gulf.</note> states that the regularity and irregularity of the ebb and flow of the sea follow the different

positions of the moon in the zodiac; that when she is in the

equinoctial signs the tides are regular, but that when she is

in the signs next the tropics, the tides are irregular both in

their height and force; and that for the remaining signs the

irregularity is greater or less, according as they are more or

less removed from the signs before mentioned. Posidonius

adds, that during the summer solstice and whilst the moon

was full, he himself passed many days in the temple of Hercules at Gades, but could not observe any thing of these annual

irregularities. However, about the new moon of the same

month he observed at Ilipa<note anchored="yes">Alcolea.</note> a great change in the reflux of

the water of the Guadalquiver, as compared with previous

flood-tides, in which the water did not rise half as high as the

banks, and that then the water poured in so copiously, that

the soldiers there dipped their supply without difficulty, although Ilipa is about 700 stadia from the sea. He says, that

the plains next the sea were covered by the tides to a distance

of 30<note anchored="yes">Some MSS. read 50 stadia.</note> stadia, and to such a depth as to form islands, while

the basement of the temple in the enclosure dedicated to

Hercules, and the top of the mole in front of the harbour of

Gades, were not covered higher than 10 cubits, as observed

by actual soundings; but if any one should add the double of

that for the occasional risings of the tide which occur, [neither] thus would he be able to estimate the violence with

which the full force of the high tide rushes over the plains.

Posidonius informs us that this violence [of the tide] is common to all the coasts of Spain on the Atlantic,<note anchored="yes">This is the sense of the text, <foreign lang="greek">pa=san th\n ku/klw| tao|wkeani=tin.</foreign></note> but what he



<pb n="262"/>



relates concerning the Ebro is unusual and peculiar to itself,

for he says that it sometimes overflows after continued north

winds, although there may have been neither rains nor snows.

The cause of this [he supposes] to be the lake through which

the Ebro flows, its waters being driven by the winds into the

current of the river.<note anchored="yes">We are not aware that the Ebro passes through any lake.</note>

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The same writer mentions a tree at Gades, which had

boughs reaching to the ground; its sword-shaped leaves often

measuring a cubit long, and four fingers broad. Also that

about Carthagena there was a tree whose thorns produced a

bark from which most beautiful stuffs were woven. As for the

tree [he saw] at Gades, we ourselves have observed a similar in

Egypt, so far as the inclination of the boughs is concerned, but

with a differently shaped leaf, and producing no fruit, which

according to him the other did. In Cappadocia there are stuffs

made from thorns, but it is not a tree which produces the

thorn from which the bark is taken, but a low plant; he also

tells us of a tree at Gades, from which if a branch be broken

off a milk will flow, and if the root be cut a red fluid runs.

Thus much for Gades.

thus resembling the Furies we see in tragic representations.<note anchored="yes">This is probably a description of the appearance of the Druids. Tacitus, (Ann. lib. xiv. 30,) speaking of the consternation into which the Druids

a wandering life. Of the metals they have tin and lead;

which with skins they barter with the merchants for earthenware, salt, and brazen vessels. Formerly the Phœnicians

ship-master, that they also might find the market, the shipmaster of jealousy purposely ran his vessel upon a shoal,

leading on those who followed him into the same destructive

disaster; he himself escaped by means of a fragment of the

ship, and received from the state the value of the cargo he

had lost. The Romans nevertheless by frequent efforts discovered the passage, and as soon as Publius Crassus, passing

over to them, perceived that the metals were dug out at a

little depth, and that the men were peaceably disposed, he

declared it to those who already wished to traffic in this sea for

profit, although the passage was longer than that to Britain.<note anchored="yes">Viz. that the Cassiterides are farther removed from the coasts of

more particularly. Some divide it into the three nations of

the Aquitani, Belge, and Kelte.<note anchored="yes">Gaul is properly divided into the four grand divisions of the Narbonnaise, Aquitaine, Keltica, and Belgica. Strabo has principally copied

Cæsar, who appears only to have divided Gaul into Aquitaine, Keltica, and

Belgica. Cæsar however only speaks of the provinces he had conquered,

and makes no mention of the Narbonnaise, which had submitted to the

Romans before his time. Strabo seems to have thought that the Narbonnaise formed part of Keltica.</note> Of these the Aquitani differ

completely from the other nations, not only in their language

but in their figure, which resembles more that of the Iberians

than the Galatæ. The others are Galatæ in countenance,

make a slight difference in their speech; neither is their

polity and mode of life exactly the same. These writers give

the name of Aquitani and Keltæ to the dwellers near the

Pyrenees, which are bounded by the Cevennes. For it has

the Rhine. The Cevennes lie at right angles to the Pyrenees, and traverse the plains for about 2000 stadia, terminating

in the middle near Lugdunum.<note anchored="yes">Lyons.</note> They call those people Aquitani who inhabit the northern portions of the Pyrenees, and

the Cevennes extending as far as the ocean, and bounded by

the river Garonne; and Keltæ, those who dwell on the other

side of the Garonne, towards the sea of Marseilles and Narbonne, and touching a portion of the Alpine chain. This is

the division adopted by divus Cæsar in his Commentaries.<note anchored="yes">The whole of this passage, says Gosselin, is full of mistakes, and it

would seem that Strabo quoted from an inexact copy of Cæsar. To understand his meaning, we must remember that he supposed the Pyrenees extended from north to south, instead of from east to west; and since he

adds that these mountains divide the Cevennes at right angles, he must

have supposed that this second chain extended from cast to west, instead

of from north to south. He likewise fancied that the Garonne, the

Loire, and the Seine ran from north to south like the Rhine. Starting from such premises, it was impossible he could avoid confusion;

thus we find him describing the Aquitani as north of the Cevennes,

when in fact they dwelt north of the Pyrenees, between those mountains and the Garonne, and west of the southern portions of the Cevennes.

Where he says that the Kelts dwelt on the other side or east of the Garonne, and towards the sea of Narbonne and Marseilles, it is clear that

he prolonged Keltica into the Narbonnaise, since this last province extended along the Mediterranean from the frontiers of Spain to the Alps.

Cæsar had stated that the Gauls (the Kelts of Strabo)

<emph rend="ital">ipsorum lingua Keltæ,</emph>

<emph rend="ital">nostri Galli,</emph> dwelt between the Garonne, the Seine, the Marne, and the

Rhine. Finally, Strabo appears to have assigned the greater part of Gaul

to the Belgæ in making them extend from the ocean, and the mouth of

the Rhine, to the Alps. This considerably embarrassed Xylander, but

as we have seen that Strabo transported a portion of the Kelts into the

Narbonnaise, it is easy to imagine that, in order to make these people

border on the Belgæ, he was forced to extend them as far as the Alps,

near the sources of the Rhine. Cæsar located the Belgæ between the

Seine, the ocean, and the Rhine.</note>

But Augustus Cæsar, when dividing the country into four

parts, united the Keltæ to the Narbonnaise; the Aquitani

he preserved the same as Julius Cæsar, but added thereto

fourteen other nations of those who dwelt between the Garonne and the river Loire,<note anchored="yes">Liger.</note> and dividing the rest into two

parts, the one extending to the upper districts of the Rhine

he made dependent upon Lugdunum, the other [he assigned]



<pb n="266"/>



to the Belgæ. However, it is the duty of the Geographer to

describe the physical divisions of each country, and those which

result from diversity of nations, when they seem worthy of

notice; as to the limits which princes, induced by a policy

which circumstances dictate, have variously imposed, it will

be sufficient for him to notice them summarily, leaving others

to furnish particular details.

<p>The whole of this country is irrigated by rivers descending from the Alps, the Cevennes, and the Pyrenees, some of

which discharge themselves into the ocean, others into the

Mediterranean. The districts through which they flow are

mostly plains interspersed with hills, and having navigable

streams. The course of these rivers is so happily disposed in relation to each other, that you may traffic from

one sea to the other,<note anchored="yes">From the ocean to the Mediterranean, and vice versa.</note> carrying the merchandise only a

small distance, and that easily, across the plains; but for the

most part by the rivers, ascending some, and descending

others. The Rhone is pre-eminent in this respect, both because it communicates with many other rivers, and also because it flows into the Mediterranean, which, as we have said,

is superior to the ocean,<note anchored="yes">Alluding to the superiority of the climate on the shores of the Mediterranean.</note> and likewise passes through the

richest provinces of Gaul. The whole of the Narbonnaise

produces the same fruits as Italy. As we advance towards the

north, and the mountains of the Cevennes, the plantations of the

olive and fig disappear, but the others remain. Likewise the

vine, as you proceed northward, does not easily mature its

fruit. The entire of the remaining country produces in

abundance corn, millet, acorns, and mast of all kinds. No

part of it lies waste except that which is taken up in marshes

and woods, and even this is inhabited. The cause of this,

however, is rather a dense population than the industry of

the inhabitants. For the women there are both very prolific

and excellent nurses, while the men devote themselves rather

to war than husbandry. However, their arms being now laid

aside, they are compelled to engage in agriculture. These

remarks apply generally to the whole of Transalpine Keltica.

We must now describe particularly each of the four divisions,



<pb n="267"/>



which hitherto we have only mentioned in a summary manner. And, first, of the Narbonnaise.

<p>The configuration of this country resembles a parallelogram, the western side of which is traced by the Pyrenees,

the north by the Cevennes; as for the other two sides, the

south is bounded by the sea between the Pyrenees and Marseilles, and the east partly by the Alps,<note anchored="yes">We shall see in the course of this book, that under the name of Alps

Strabo includes the different mountain-chains separated from the range

of Alps properly so called. This accounts for his extending those mountains on the west as far as Marseilles, and on the east beyond Istria.</note> and partly by a line

drawn perpendicularly from these mountains to the foot of the

Cevennes, which extend towards the Rhone, and form a right

angle with the aforesaid perpendicular drawn from the Alps.

To the southern side of this parallelogram we must add the

sea-coast inhabited by the Massilienses<note anchored="yes">The Marseillese.</note> and Salyes,<note anchored="yes">The Salyes inhabited Provence.</note> as far as

the country of the Ligurians, the confines of Italy, and the river

Var. This river, as we have said before,<note anchored="yes">As Strabo has made no previous mention of this river, the words <q direct="unspecified">as

we have said before</q> are evidently interpolated.</note> is the boundary of the

Narbonnaise and Italy. It is but small in summer, but in winter

swells to a breadth of seven stadia. From thence the coast

extends to the temple of the Pyrenæan Venus,<note anchored="yes">This temple was built on Cape Creus, which on that account received

the name of Aphrodisium. Many geographers confound this temple with

the <emph rend="ital">portus Veneris,</emph> the modern Vendres, which is at a short distance

boundary between this province and Iberia. Some, however, assert that the spot where the Trophies of Pompey stand

differs also in computing the succeeding numbers.</note> from thence to

Antipolis and the river Var, 73; making in the total 277

miles. Some set down the distance from the temple of Venus

to the Var at 2600 stadia; while others increase this number

distances. As for the other road, which traverses the [coun-

<p>Marseilles, founded by the Phocæans,<note anchored="yes">About 600 years before the Christian era.</note> is built in a stony

region. Its harbour lies beneath a rock, which is shaped

like a theatre, and looks towards the south. It is well surrounded with walls, as well as the whole city, which is of

considerable size. Within the citadel are placed the Ephesium and the temple of the Delphian Apollo. This latter

temple is common to all the Ionians; the Ephesium is the

temple consecrated to Diana of Ephesus. They say that

when the Phocæans were about to quit their country, an oracle

commanded them to take from Diana of Ephesus a conductor

for their voyage. On arriving at Ephesus they therefore inquired how they might be able to obtain from the goddess

what was enjoined them. The goddess appeared in a dream

to Aristarcha, one of the most honourable women of the city,

and commanded her to accompany the Phocæans, and to take

with her a plan of the temple and statues.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)Afi/do|uma/ ti tw=n i(eo|w=n.</foreign> Gosselin gives a note on these words, and translates them in his text as follows, <q direct="unspecified">one of the statues consecrated in her temple.</q></note> These things

built a temple, and evinced their great respect for Aristarcha

by making her priestess. All the colonies [sent out from

Marseilles] hold this goddess in peculiar reverence, preserving

both the shape of the image [of the goddess], and also every

rite observed in the metropolis.

<p>The Massilians live under a well-regulated aristocracy.

They have a council composed of 600 persons called timuchi,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">timou=xos,</foreign> literally, one having honour and esteem.</note> who enjoy this dignity for life. Fifteen of these preside

over the council, and have the management of current

affairs; these fifteen are in their turn presided over by three

of their number, in whom rests the principal authority; and

these again by one. No one can become a timuchus who has

not children, and who has not been a citizen for three generations.<note anchored="yes">We have seen no reason to depart from a literal rendering of the

Greek in this passage, its meaning, <q direct="unspecified">whose ancestors have not been

citizens,</q> &amp;c., being self-evident.</note> Their laws, which are the same as those of the

Ionians, they expound in public. Their country abounds in

olives and vines, but on account of its ruggedness the wheat

is poor. Consequently they trust more to the resources of

the sea than of the land, and avail themselves in preference of

their excellent position for commerce. Nevertheless they

have been enabled by the power of perseverance to take in

some of the surrounding plains, and also to found cities: of

this number are the cities they founded in Iberia as a rampart against the Iberians, in which they introduced the worship of Diana of Ephesus, as practised in their father-land, with

the Grecian mode of sacrifice. In this number too are Rhoa<note anchored="yes">This name has evidently been corrupted, but it seems difficult to determine what stood originally in the text; most probably it was Rhodanusia.</note>

[and] Agatha,<note anchored="yes">Agde.</note> [built for defence] against the barbarians

They<note anchored="yes">The people of Marseilles.</note> possess likewise dry docks and armouries. Formerly

they had an abundance of vessels, arms, and machines, both

for the purposes of navigation and for besieging towns; by

means of which they defended themselves against the bar-

barians, and likewise obtained the alliance of the Romans, to

whom they rendered many important services; the Romans

in their turn assisting in their aggrandizement. Sextius, who

defeated the Salyes, founded, not far from Marseilles, a city<note anchored="yes">Aquæ Sextiæ, now Aix.</note>

which was named after him and the hot waters, some of

which they say have lost their heat.<note anchored="yes">Solinus tells us that in his day the waters had lost their virtue, and

that their fame had declined. <q direct="unspecified">Quarum calor, olim acrior, exhalatus

per tempora evaporavit; nec jam par est fame priori.</q><emph rend="ital">Solin.</emph> cap. 8.

The victory of Sextius, mentioned by Strabo, is said to have been gained

in the year of Rome 629.</note> Here he established a

Roman garrison, and drove from the sea-coast which leads

from Marseilles to Italy the barbarians, whom the Massilians

were not able to keep back entirely. However, all he accomplished by this was to compel the barbarians to keep at a distance of twelve stadia from those parts of the coast which

possessed good harbours, and at a distance of eight stadia

where it was rugged. The land which they thus abandoned,

he presented to the Massilians. In their city are laid up

heaps of booty taken in naval engagements against those who

disputed the sea unjustly. Formerly they enjoyed singular

good fortune, as well in other matters as also in their amity

with the Romans. Of this [amity] we find numerous signs,

amongst others the statue of Diana which the Romans dedicated on the Aventine mount, of the same figure as that of the

Massilians. Their prosperity has in a great measure decayed

since the war of Pompey against Cæsar, in which they sided

with the vanquished party. Nevertheless some traces of their

ancient industry may still be seen amongst the inhabitants,

especially the making of engines of war and ship-building.

Still as the surrounding barbarians, now that they are under the dominion of the Romans, become daily more civilized, and leave the occupation of war for the business

of towns and agriculture, there is no longer the same

attention paid by the inhabitants of Marseilles to these

objects. The aspect of the city at the present day is a

proof of this. For all those who profess to be men of taste,

turn to the study of elocution and philosophy. Thus this city

for some little time back has become a school for the barbarians, and has communicated to the Galatæ such a taste for



<pb n="271"/>



Greek literature, that they even draw contracts on the

Grecian model. While at the present day it so entices the

noblest of the Romans, that those desirous of studying resort

thither in preference to Athens. These the Galatæ observing, and being at leisure on account of the peace, readily

devote themselves to similar pursuits, and that not merely

individuals, but the public generally; professors of the arts

and sciences, and likewise of medicine, being employed not

only by private persons, but by towns for common instruction. Of the wisdom of the Massilians and the simplicity of

their life, the following will not be thought an insignificant

proof. The largest dowry amongst them consists of one hundred gold pieces, with five for dress, and five more for golden

ornaments. More than this is not lawful. Cæsar and his

successors treated with moderation the offences of which they

were guilty during the war, in consideration of their former

friendship; and have preserved to the state the right of

governing according to its ancient laws. So that neither

Marseilles nor the cities dependent on it are under submission to the governors sent [into the Narbonnaise]. So much

for Marseilles.

<p>The mountains of the Salyes incline gently from west

to north in proportion as they retire from the sea. The coast

runs west, and extending a short distance, about 100 stadia,

from Marseilles, it begins to assume the character of a gulf at

a considerable promontory near to certain stone quarries, and

extending to the Aphrodisium, the headland which terminates

the Pyrenees,<note anchored="yes">The Cape de Creus, a promontory on which was the temple of the Pyrenæan Venus.</note> forms the Galatic Gulf,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Lyons.</note> which is also called the

is properly designated the Galatic Gulf, into which the Rhone

discharges itself; the smaller is on the coast of Narbonne, and

extends as far as the Pyrenees. Narbonne is situated above the

of that river being changed. The lake of Narbonne, mentioned by Strabo,

is not the present lake of Narbonne, but the lake of Rubine.</note> It is the

principal commercial city on this coast. On the Rhone is

Arelate,<note anchored="yes">Arles.</note> a city and emporium of considerable traffic. The

distance between these two cities is nearly equal to that which

separates them from the aforesaid promontories, namely,

Narbonne from the Aphrodisium, and Arelate from the cape

of Marseilles. There are other rivers besides which flow on

either side of Narbonne, some from the Cevennes, others

from the Pyrenees. Along these rivers are situated cities

having but little commerce, and that in small vessels. The

rivers which proceed from the Pyrenees, are the Tet<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">(Pski/nwn.</foreign></note> and the

temple of Venus. On the other side of Narbonne the following rivers descend from the Cevennes into the sea. The

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of one marvel of this sea-coast, namely the <q direct="unspecified">dug mullets,</q> we have already spoken; we will now mention another,

even more surprising. Between Marseilles and the outlets of

the Rhone there is a circular plain, about 100 stadia distant



<pb n="273"/>



from the sea, and about 100 stadia in diameter. It has

received the name of the Stony Plain, from the circumstance of its being covered with stones the size of the fist,

from beneath which an abundant herbage springs up for

the pasturage of cattle. In the midst of it are water, salt-

springs, and salt. The whole both of this district and that

above it is exposed to the wind, but in this plain the black

north,<note anchored="yes">The French <emph rend="ital">bise.</emph></note> a violent and horrible wind, rages especially: for they

say that sometimes the stones are swept and rolled along, and

men hurled from their carriages and stripped both of their

arms and garments by the force of the tempest. Aristotle

tells us that these stones being cast up by the earthquakes

designated <emph rend="ital">brastai,</emph><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">bo|a/stai seismoi/,</foreign> earthquakes attended with a violent fermentation.</note> and falling on the surface of the earth, roll

into the hollow places of the districts; but Posidonius, that

the place was formerly a lake, which being congealed during

a violent agitation, became divided into numerous stones,

like river pebbles or the stones by the sea-shore, which

they resemble both as to smoothness, size, and appearance.

Such are the causes assigned by these two [writers]; however,

neither of their opinions is credible,<note anchored="yes">The text has, "both of their opinions are credible,' (<foreign lang="greek">piqano\s me\n ou(n o( pao| a)mfoi=n lo/gos,</foreign>) but this is discountenanced by the whole sentence.</note> for these stones could

neither have thus accumulated of themselves, nor yet have

been formed by congealed moisture, but necessarily from the

fragments of large stones shattered by frequent convulsions.

Æschylus having, however, learnt of the difficulty of accounting for it, or having been so informed by another, has explained it away as a myth. He makes Prometheus utter the

following, whilst directing Hercules the road from the Caucasus to the Hesperides:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">There you will come to the undaunted army of the Ligurians, where,

resistless though you be, sure am I you will not worst them in battle; for

it is fated that there your darts shall fail you; nor will you be able to

but Jupiter, beholding your distress, will compassionate you, and overshadowing the earth with a cloud, he will cause it to hail round stones,

which you hurling against the Ligurian army, will soon put them to

flight!</q><note anchored="yes">From the <q direct="unspecified">Prometheus Loosed,</q> which is now lost.</note></quote>


</p><p>Posidonius asks, would it not have been better to have



<pb n="274"/>



rained down these stones upon the Ligurians themselves, and

thus have destroyed them all, than to make Hercules in need

of so many stones? As for the number, they were necessary

against so vast a multitude; so that in this respect the writer

of the myth seems to me deserving of more credit than he

who would refute it. Further, the poet, in describing it as

fated, secures himself against such fault-finding. For if you

dispute Providence and Destiny, you can find many similar

things both in human affairs and nature, that you would

suppose might be much better performed in this or that

way; as for instance, that Egypt should have plenty of rain

of its own, without being irrigated from the land of Ethiopia. That it would have been much better if Paris had suffered shipwreck on his voyage to Sparta, instead of expiating

his offences after having carried off Helen, and having been

the cause of so great destruction both amongst the Greeks

and Barbarians. Euripides attributes this to Jupiter:

<p>As to the mouths of the Rhone, Polybius asserts that

there are but two, and blames Timæus<note anchored="yes">The historian, son of Andromachus.</note> for saying five. Artemidorus says that there are three. Afterwards Marius,

observing that the mouth was becoming stopped up and difficult of entrance on account of the deposits of mud, caused a

new channel to be dug, which received the greater part of the

river into it.<note anchored="yes">The mouths of the Rhone, like those of other impetuous rivers, are

subject to considerable changes, and vary from one age to another. Ptolemy agrees with Polybius in stating that there are but two mouths to the

even when quite close. On this account the people of Marseilles, who wished by all means to inhabit the country, set up

towers as beacons; they have even erected a temple to Diana

of Ephesus on a piece of the land, which the mouths of the

rivers have formed into an island. Above the outlets of the

Rhone is a salt-lake which they call Stomalimnè.<note anchored="yes">Now l'étang de Berre or de Martigues.</note> It abounds

lake from the river. Such then is the disposition and extent

of the coast from the Pyrenees to Marseilles.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The [coast] which extends from this [last city] to the

river Var, and the Ligurians who dwell near it, contains the

Massilian cities of Tauroentium,<note anchored="yes">Taurenti.</note> Olbia,<note anchored="yes">Eoube.</note> Antipolis,<note anchored="yes">Antibes.</note> Nicæa,<note anchored="yes">Nice.</note>

and the sea-port of Augustus Cæsar, called Forum Julium.<note anchored="yes">Fréjus.</note>

which is situated between Olbia and Antipolis, and distant

from Marseilles about 600 stadia. The Var is between Antipolis and Nicæa; distant from the one about 20 stadia, from

the other about 60; so that according to the boundary now

marked Nicæa belongs to Italy, although it is a city of the people of Marseilles, for they built these cities [as a defence]

against the barbarians who dwelt higher up the country, in

order to maintain the sea free, as the barbarians possessed the

land. For this [region] is mountainous and fortified by nature,

leaving however a considerable extent of plain country near

Marseilles; but as you proceed towards the east the country is

so hemmed in by the mountains, as scarcely to leave a sufficient

road for passage by the sea-shore. The former districts are

inhabited by the Salyes,<note anchored="yes">Inhabitants of Provence.</note> the latter by the Ligurians, who

border on Italy, of whom we shall speak afterwards. It should

here be mentioned, that although Antipolis is situated in

the Narbonnaise, and Nicæa in Italy, this latter is dependent on Marseilles, and forms part of that province; while



<pb n="276"/>



Antipolis is ranked amongst the Italian cities, and freed from

the government of the Marseillese by a judgment given against

them.

<p>Lying off this narrow pass along the coast, as you commence your journey from Marseilles, are the Stœchades islands.<note anchored="yes">Les Isles d' Hières, a row of islands off Marseilles.</note>

Three of' these are considerable, and two small. They are

cultivated by the people of Marseilles. Anciently they contained a garrison, placed here to defend them from the attacks

come [the islands of] Planasia<note anchored="yes">Isle St. Honorat.</note> and Lero,<note anchored="yes">Isle Ste. Marguerite.</note> both of them in-

habited. In Lero, which lies opposite to Antipolis, is a

temple erected to the hero Lero. There are other small

islands not worth mentioning, some of them before Marseilles,

others before the rest of the coast which I have been describing.

As to the harbours, those of the seaport [of Forum-Julium]<note anchored="yes">Fréjus.</note>

and Marseilles are considerable, the others are but middling.

Of this latter class is the port Oxybius,<note anchored="yes">Between the river d' Argents and Antibes.</note> so named from the

this coast.

<p>The country above this is bounded principally by the

surrounding mountains and rivers. Of these the Rhone is

the most remarkable, being both the largest, and capable of

being navigated farther than any of the others, and also receiving into it a greater number of tributaries; of these we

must speak in order. Commencing at Marseilles, and proceeding to the country between the Alps and the Rhone, to

the river Durance, dwell the Salyes for a space of 500 stadia.

the Durance and the Isère there are other rivers which flow

from the Alps into the Rhone; two of these, after having

flowed round the city of the Cavari, discharge themselves by

a common outlet into the Rhone. The Sulgas,<note anchored="yes">The Sorgue.</note> which is the

third, mixes with the Rhone near the city of Vindalum,<note anchored="yes">Vedene.</note>

where Cnæus Ænobarbus in a decisive engagement routed

many myriads of the Kelts. Between these are the cities of

Avenio,<note anchored="yes">Avignon.</note> Arausio,<note anchored="yes">Orange.</note> and Aëria,<note anchored="yes">Le mont Ventoux.</note> which latter, remarks Artemidorus, is rightly named aërial, being situated in a very lofty

position. The whole of this country consists of plains abounding in pasturage, excepting on the route from Aëria to Avenio,

where there are narrow defiles and woods to traverse. It was

at the point where the river Isère and the Rhone unite near

the Cevennes, that Quintus Fabius Maximus Æmilianus,<note anchored="yes">Casaubon remarks that Æmilianus is a name more than this Roman

general actually possessed.</note> with

scarcely 30,000 men, cut to pieces 200,000 Kelts.<note anchored="yes">Livy states that 120,000 Kelts were slain, and Pliny, 130,000.</note> Here he

erected a white stone as a trophy, and two temples, one to

Mars, and the other to Hercules. From the Isère to Vienne,

the metropolis of the Allobroges, situated on the Rhone, the

distance is 320 stadia. Lugdunum<note anchored="yes">Lyons.</note> is a little above Vienne

at the confluence of the Saone<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)/Ao|ao|.</foreign></note> and the Rhone. The distance

by land [from this latter city] to Lugdunum, passing through

the country of the Allobroges, is about 200 stadia, and rather

more by water. Formerly the Allobroges engaged in war,

their armies consisting of many myriads; they now occupy

themselves in cultivating the plains and valleys of the Alps.

They dwell generally in villages, the most notable of them inhabiting Vienne, which was merely a village, although

called the metropolis of their nation; they have now improved

and embellished it as a city; it is situated on the Rhone. So

full and rapid is the descent of this river from the Alps, that

the flow of its waters through Lake Leman may be distinguished for many stadia. Having descended into the plains

of the countries of the Allobroges, and Segusii, it falls into

the Saone, near to Lugdunum, a city of the Segusii.<note anchored="yes">The Allobroges and Segusii were separated by the Rhone; the former

same mistake as Strabo.</note> still however

preserving its own name, and consisting of the two, mingles

with the Rhone. The Rhone in like manner preserves its

name, and flows on to Vienne. At their rise these three

rivers flow towards the north, then in a westerly direction,

afterwards uniting into one they take another turn and flow

towards the south, and having received other rivers, they

flow in this direction to the sea. Such is the country situated between the Alps and the Rhone.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The main part of the country on the other side of the

Rhone is inhabited by the Volcæ, surnamed Arecomisci. Their

naval station is Narbonne, which may justly be called the

emporium of all Gaul, as it far surpasses every other in the

multitude of those who resort<note anchored="yes">We have here followed the proposed correction of Ziegler.</note> to it. The Volcæ border on

tile Rhone, the Salyes and Cavari being opposite to them on

tile other side of the river. However, the name of the Cavari

has so obtained, that all the barbarians inhabiting near now

go by that designation; nay, even those who are no longer

barbarians, but follow the Roman customs, both in their

speech and mode of life, and some of those even who have

adopted the Roman polity. Between the Arecomisci and the

Pyrenees there are some other small and insignificant nations.

Nemausus<note anchored="yes">Nîmes.</note> is the metropolis of the Arecomisci; though far

inferior to Narbonne both as to its commerce, and the number

of foreigners attracted thither, it surpasses that city in the

number of its citizens; for it has under its dominion four and

twenty different villages all well inhabited, and by the same

people, who pay tribute; it likewise enjoys the rights of the

Latin towns, so that in Nemausus you meet with Roman

citizens who have obtained the honours of the ædile and quæstorship, wherefore this nation is not subject to the orders

issued by the prætors from Rome. The city is situated on



<pb n="279"/>



the road from Iberia to Italy; this road is very good in

the summer, but muddy and overflowed by the rivers during

winter and spring. Some of these streams are crossed

in ferry-boats, and others by means of bridges constructed

either of wood or stone. The inundations which destroy the

roads are caused by the winter torrents, which sometimes

pour down from the Alps even in summer-time after the

melting of the snows. To perform the route before mentioned,

the shortest way is, as we have said, across the territory of the

Vocontii direct to the Alps; the other, along the coast of

Marseilles and Liguria, is longer, although it offers an easier

passage into Italy, as the mountains are lower. Nemausus

is about 100 stadia distant from the Rhone, situated opposite

to the small town of Tarascon, and about 720 stadia from

Narbonne. The Tectosages,<note anchored="yes">This name is written diversely, Tectosages, Tectosagæ, and Tectosagi.

It appears to be composed of the two Latin words, <q direct="unspecified">tectus,</q> covered, and

<q direct="unspecified">sagum,</q> a species of cassock.</note> and certain others whom we

shall mention afterwards, border on the range of the Cevennes,

and inhabit its southern side as far as the promontory of

the Volcæ. Respecting all the others we will speak hereafter.

<p>But the Tectosages dwell near to the Pyrenees, bordering for a small space the northern side of the Cevennes;<note anchored="yes">Viz. between Lodève and Toulouse; we must remember that Strabo

supposed the chain of the Cevennes to run west and east.</note> the

land they inhabit is rich in gold. It appears that formerly

they were so powerful and numerous, that dissensions having

arisen amongst them, they drove a vast multitude of their

number from their homes; and that these men associating

with others of different nations took possession of Phrygia, next

to Cappadocia, and the Paphlagonians. Of this those who

are now called the Tectosages afford us proof, for [Phrygia contains] three nations, one of them dwelling near to the city of

Ancyra,<note anchored="yes">Angora.</note> being called the Tectosages; the remaining two, the

Trocmi and Tolistobogii.<note anchored="yes">These three nations inhabited Galatia, of which Ancyra was the capital.</note> The resemblance these nations bear

to the Tectosages is evidence of their having immigrated from

Keltica, though we are unable to say from which district they

came, as there does not appear to be any people at the present

time bearing the name of Trocmi or Tolistobogii, who in-



<pb n="280"/>



habit either beyond the Alps, the Alps themselves, or on this

side the Alps. It would seem that continual emigration has

drained them completely from their native country, a circumstance which has occurred to many other nations, as some

say that the Brennus, who led an expedition to Delphi,<note anchored="yes">279 years before the Christian era.</note> was a

leader of the Prausi; but we are unable to say where the Prausi

formerly inhabited. It is said that the Tectosages took part in

the expedition to Delphi, and that the treasures found in the city

of Toulouse by the Roman general Cæpio formed a portion of

the booty gained there, which was afterwards increased by

offerings which the citizens made from their own property, and

consecrated in order to conciliate the god.<note anchored="yes">Justin tells us that the Tectosages on returning to Toulouse from the

expedition, were attacked with a pestilential malady, from which they

could find no relief until they complied with the advice of their augurs,

and cast the ill-gotten wealth into a lake. Justin, lib. xxxii. c. 3.</note> And that it was

for daring to touch these that Cæpio terminated so miserably

his existence, being driven from his country as a plunderer of

the temples of the gods, and leaving behind him his daughters,

who, as Timagenes informs us, having been wickedly violated,

perished miserably. However, the account given by Posidonius is the more credible. He tells us that the wealth found

in Toulouse amounted to somewhere about 15,000 talents, a part

of which was hidden in the chapels, and the remainder in the

sacred lakes, and that it was not coined [money], but gold and

silver in bullion. But at this time the temple of Delphi was

emptied of these treasures, having been pillaged by the

Phocæans at the period of the Sacred war and supposing any

to have been left, it would have been distributed amongst

many. Nor is it probable that the Tectosages returned home,

since they came off miserably after leaving Delphi, and owing

to their dissensions were scattered here and there throughout

the country; there is much more likelihood in the statement

made by Posidonius and many others, that the country

abounding in gold, and the inhabitants being superstitious,

and not living expensively, they hid their treasures in many

different places, the lakes in particular affording them a hiding-

place for depositing their gold and silver bullion. When the

Romans obtained possession of the country they put up these

lakes to public sale, and many of the purchasers found therein



<pb n="281"/>



solid masses of silver. In Toulouse there was a sacred temple,

held in great reverence by the inhabitants of the surrounding

country, and on this account loaded with riches, inasmuch as

there were many who offered gifts, and no one dared to touch

them.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Toulouse is situated upon the narrowest part of the

isthmus which separates the ocean from the sea of Narbonne;

the breadth of the [isthmus], according to Posidonius, being

less than 3000 stadia. The perfect similarity maintained

throughout this country both in respect to its rivers, and to

the exterior and interior sea,<note anchored="yes">The Atlantic and Mediterranean.</note> appears to us worthy of especial

notice, as we have said before. This, on reflection, will prove to

be one main cause of the excellence of this country, since the

inhabitants are enabled mutually to communicate, and to procure from each other the necessaries of life; this is peculiarly

the case at the present time, when on account of their leisure

from war they are devoting themselves to agriculture and the

pursuits of social life. In this we are persuaded that we behold the work of Providence; such a disposition of these regions not resulting from chance, but from the thought of some

[intelligence]. The Rhone, for instance, is navigable to a

considerable distance for vessels of heavy burden, which it is

capable of transmitting through various districts of the country by means of other rivers which fall into it, and are likewise fitted for the navigation of large vessels. To the Rhone

succeeds the Saone,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)/Ao|ao|.</foreign></note> and into this latter river falls the Doubs;

thence the merchandise is carried by land to the river Seine;

whence it is transported to the ocean and the [countries of

the] Lexovii and Caleti,<note anchored="yes">The Lexovii inhabited the southern banks of the Seine, Lizieux was

anciently their capital. The Caleti occupied the opposite side of the

Seine, and the sea-coast as far as Tréport.</note> the distance thence to Britain being

less than a day's journey. The navigation of the Rhone being

difficult on account of the rapidity of its current, the merchants

prefer to transport in waggons certain of their wares, which

are destined for the Arverni,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Auvergne.</note> and the river Loire,<note anchored="yes">The ancient Liger.</note> notwith-

standing the vicinity of the Rhone in some places, but the

road being level and the distance not far, (about 800 stadia,)

they do not make use of water carriage on account of the

facility of the transport by land, from thence the merchandise is

easily conveyed by the Loire. This river flows from the Cevennes into the ocean. From Narbonne the voyage to the

Aude<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)/Atac.</foreign></note> is short, but the journey by land to the river Garonne

longer, being as much as 700 or 800 stadia. The Garonne likewise flows into the ocean. Such is what we have to say concerning the inhabitants of the Narbonnaise, who were formerly named Kelts. In my opinion the celebrity of the

Kelts induced the Grecians to confer that name on the whole

of the Galatæ; the vicinity of the Massilians may also have

had something to do with it.<note anchored="yes">The whole of Gaul bore the name of Keltica long before the Romans

had penetrated into that country. After their conquest of the southern

provinces, they distinguished them from the rest of Keltica by conferring

on them the name of Gallia Narbonensis. Aristotle gave the name of

Kelts to the inhabitants of the country near Narbonne. Polybius tells us

that the Pyrenees separated the Iberians from the Kelts; while Diodorus

Siculus fixed the position of the Kelts between the Alps and the Pyrenees.</note>

<p>WE must now speak of the Aquitani and the fourteen

Galatic nations pertaining to them, situated between the Garonne and the Loire, some of which extend to the river Rhone

and the plains of the Narbonnaise. Generally speaking, the

Aquitani may be said to differ from the Galatic race, both as

to form of body and language, resembling more nearly the

Iberians. They are bounded by the Garonne, and dwell between this river and the Pyrenees. There are above twenty

nations which bear the name of Aquitani, small and obscure,

the major part of them dwelling by the ocean, and the remainder in the interior and by the extremities of the Cevennes,

as far as the Tectosages. This district, however, being too

small, they added to it the territory between the Garonne

and the Loire. These rivers are nearly parallel with the

Pyrenees, and form with them two parallelograms, bounded on

the remaining sides by the ocean and the mountains of the

Cevennes.<note anchored="yes"><q direct="unspecified">Strabo,</q> says Gosselin, <q direct="unspecified">always argues on the hypothesis that the

Pyrenees run from south to north; that the Garonne and the Loire

the north, bending considerably east.</q></note> Both of these rivers are navigable for a distance

of about 2000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">The Garonne becomes navigable at Cazères near to Rieux, in the

ancient Comté de Comminges. From this point to its mouth, following

the sinuosities of the river, there are about 68 leagues of 20 to a degree,

or 2030 Olympic stadia. The Loire is navigable as far as St. Rambert,

about three leagues from St. Etienne-en-Forez, that is to say, double the

distance assigned by Strabo. 2000 stadia measured from the mouth of

the Loire would extend merely as far as Orleans.</note> The Garonne, after being augmented

by three other rivers,<note anchored="yes">Probably the Arriége, the Tarn, and the Dordogne.</note> discharges itself into the [ocean] between the [country] of the Bituriges, surnamed the Vivisci,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)Ioskw=n</foreign> MSS.</note>

and that of the Santoni;<note anchored="yes">The present Saintes was the capital of this nation.</note> both of them Gallic nations.
</p><p>The Bituriges are the only foreign people who dwell among

the Aquitani without forming a part of them. Their emporium is Burdegala,<note anchored="yes">Bordeaux.</note> situated on a creek formed by the outlets of the river. The Loire discharges itself between the

Pictones and the Namnetæ.<note anchored="yes">Poictiers was the capital of the Pictones or Pictavi, and Nantes of the

[says he,] when interrogated by Scipio<note anchored="yes">Scipio Æmilianus.</note> at their meeting, had

nothing to tell about Britain worth mentioning, nor yet had

the people of the Narbonnaise, nor those of Corbilon; notwithstanding these were the two principal cities of the district,

Pytheas alone dared to forge so many lies [concerning that

island].</q> Mediolanium<note anchored="yes">Saintes.</note> is the capital of the Santoni. The

part of Aquitaine next the ocean is for the most part sandy

and meagre, producing millet, but barren of all other fruits.

Here is the gulf which, with that on the coast of Narbonne,

forms the isthmus. Both these gulfs<note anchored="yes">The Gulfs of Gascony and Lyons.</note> go by the name of the

Galatic gulf. The former gulf belongs to the Tarbelli.<note anchored="yes">The Tarbelli occupied the sea-coast from the Pyrenees to the Lake of

being found in diggings scarcely beneath the surface of the

earth, the remainder consisting of dust and lumps, which likewise require but little working. In the interior and mountainous parts [of Aquitaine] the soil is superior; for instance,

in the district near the Pyrenees belonging to the Convenæ,<note anchored="yes">The Canton of Comminges.</note>

which name signifies people assembled from different countries

to dwell in one place. Here is the city of Lugdunum,<note anchored="yes">St. Bertrand.</note> and

the hot springs of the Onesii,<note anchored="yes">Xylander thinks that these Onesii may be identical with the Monesi

<p>The nations between the Garonne and the Loire annexed to the Aquitani, are the Elui,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Vivarais.</note> who commence at the

with the Santoni, and Pictones,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Saintonge and Poitou.</note> the former dwelling by the

Garonne, as we have stated, and the latter by the Loire. The

Ruteni and the Gabales<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Rouergue and Gévaudan.</note> are in the vicinity of the Narbonnaise.

The Petrocorii and Bituriges-Cubi possess excellent ironworks, the Cadurci linen-factories, and the Ruteni silver-

mines: the Gabales likewise possess silver-mines. On

certain amongst the Aquitani the Romans have conferred the

rights of Latin cities; such for instance as the Auscii, and the

Convenæ.

A great proof of the former power of the Arverni, is the fact

of the frequent wars which they sustained against the Romans,



<pb n="285"/>



sometimes with armies of 200,000 men, and sometimes with

double that number, which was the amount of their force

when they fought against divus Cæsar under the command of

Vercingetorix.<note anchored="yes">Cæsar himself (lib. vii. c. 76) states the number at 248,000 men.</note> Before this they had brought 200,000 men

Isère and the Rhone, at the point where the mountains of the

Cevennes approach the latter river. That with Domitius was

fought lower down at the confluence of the Sulgas<note anchored="yes">The Sorgue.</note> and the

Narbonne and the borders of Marseilles, and exercised authority over the nations as far as the Pyrenees, the ocean, and

the Rhine. Luerius,<note anchored="yes">In Athenæus, (lib. iv. p. 152,) this name is written Luernius.</note> the father of Bituitus who fought against

commerce, and the Roman prefects here coin both gold and

silver money. Before this city, at the confluence of the

rivers, is situated the temple dedicated by all the Galatæ in

common to Cæsar Augustus. The altar is splendid, and has

one for each, and also another great altar.<note anchored="yes">Kramer says that <foreign lang="greek">a)/llos</foreign> is manifestly corrupt.—I have ventured to

passage to have been originally between the Rhone and the Loire.</note> The other nations

who extend to the Rhine, are bounded in part by the Doubs,

and in part by the Saone. These two rivers, as said before,

descend from the Alps, and, falling into one stream, flow into

the Rhone. There is likewise another river which has its

sources in the Alps, and is named the Seine.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Shkoa/nos.</foreign></note> It flows

parallel with the Rhine, through a nation bearing the same

by the Saone. It is from them that the Romans procure

the finest salted-pork. Between the Doubs and Saone dwells

the other side of the Saone dwell the Sequani, who have for

long been at enmity with the Romans and Ædui, having

frequently allied themselves with the Germans in their incursions into Italy. It was then that they proved their strength,

for united to them the Germans were powerful, but when

separated, weak. As for the Ædui, their alliance with the

Romans naturally rendered them the enemies of the Sequani,<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Lit.</emph> <q direct="unspecified">As for the Ædui on these accounts indeed.</q></note>

but the enmity was increased by their contests concerning the

river which divides them, each nation claiming the Saone exclusively for themselves, and likewise the tolls on vessels

passing. However, at the present time, the whole of it is under

the dominion of the Romans.

<p>The first of all the nations dwelling on the Rhine are

the Helvetii, amongst whom are the sources of that river in

Mount Adula,<note anchored="yes">The sources of the Rhine take their rise in Mount St. Gothard and

Mount Bernardin, while the Adda rises in the glaciers of the Valteline.

Adula, however, may have been the name of the Rhætian Alps.</note> which forms part of the Alps. From this

mountain, but in an opposite direction, likewise proceeds the

Adda, which flows towards Cisalpine Gaul, and fills lake

Larius,<note anchored="yes">The Lake of Como.</note> near to which stands [the city of] Como; thence it

says that the length of this river is 6000 stadia, but such is

not the case, for taken in a straight line it does not much

exceed half that length, and 1000 stadia is quite sufficient to

allow for its sinuosities. In fact this river is so rapid that it

is difficult to throw bridges across it, although after its descent

from the mountains it is borne the remainder of the way

through level plains; now how could it maintain its rapidity

and vehemence, if in addition to this level channel, we suppose

it also to have long and frequent tortuosities? Asinius like-

who say that it has more.<note anchored="yes">Ptolemy says it has three. It appears that the ancient mouths of this

river were not the same as the present.</note> This river and the Seine embrace

within their tortuosities a certain extent of country, which

however is not considerable. They both flow from south to

north. Britain lies opposite to them; but nearest to the

Rhine, from which you may see Kent, which is the most easterly

part of the island. The Seine is a little further. It was here

that divus Cæsar established a dock-yard when he sailed to

Britain. The navigable portion of the Seine, commencing

from the point where they receive the merchandise from the

<head>GAUL. THE BELGÆ.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>AFTER the nations mentioned come those of the Belgæ,

who dwell next the ocean. Of their number are the Veneti,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Vannes and the surrounding country.</note>

who fought a naval battle with Cæsar. They had prepared

to resist his passage into Britain, being possessed of the commerce [of that island] themselves. But Cæsar easily gained

the victory, not however by means of his beaks, (for their



<pb n="291"/>



ships were constructed of solid wood,)<note anchored="yes">Neque enim his nostrae rostro nocere poterant; tanta erat in his

firmitudo. Cæsar, lib. iii. c. 13.</note> but whenever their

ships were borne near to his by the wind, the Romans rent the

sails by means of scythes fixed on long handles:<note anchored="yes">Vide Cæsar, lib. iii. c. 14.</note> for the sails

[of their ships] are made of leather to resist the violence of

the winds, and managed by chains instead of cables. They

construct their vessels with broad bottoms and high poops and

prows, on account of the tides. They are built of the wood

of the oak, of which there is abundance. On this account, instead of fitting the planks close together, they leave interstices

between them; these they fill with sea-weed to prevent tile

wood from drying up in dock for want of moisture; for

the sea-weed is damp by nature, but the oak dry and arid.

In my opinion these Veneti were the founders of the Veneti

in the Adriatic, for almost all the other Keltic nations in Italy

have passed over from the country beyond the Alps, as for

instance, the Boii<note anchored="yes">The Boii, who passed into Italy, established themselves near to

Bologna.</note> and Senones.<note anchored="yes">The Senones, or inhabitants of Sens, are thought to have founded

Sienna in Italy.</note> They are said to be

Paphlagonians merely on account of a similarity of name.

However, I do not maintain my opinion positively; for in

these matters probability is quite sufficient. The Osismii are

the people whom Pytheas calls Ostimii; they dwell on a

promontory which projects considerably into the ocean, but

not so far as Pytheas and those who follow him assert.<note anchored="yes">The promontory of Calbium, the present Cape Saint-Mahé, is here

alluded to.</note> As

for the nations between the Seine and the Loire, some are

contiguous to the Sequani, others to the Arverni.

<p>The entire race which now goes by the name of Gallic,

or Galatic,<note anchored="yes">Gosselin observes, <q direct="unspecified">These people called themselves by the name of

Kelts; the Greeks styled them Galatæ, and the Latins Galli or Gaus.</q></note> is warlike, passionate, and always ready for fighting, but otherwise simple and not malicious. If irritated,

they rush in crowds to the conflict, openly and without any

circumspection; and thus are easily vanquished by those who

employ stratagem. For any one may exasperate them when,

where, and under whatever pretext he pleases; he will al-



<pb n="292"/>



ways find them ready for danger, with nothing to support

them except their violence and daring. Nevertheless they

may be easily persuaded to devote themselves to any thing

useful, and have thus engaged both in science and letters.

Their power consists both in the size of their bodies and also

in their numbers. Their frankness and simplicity lead then

easily to assemble in masses, each one feeling indignant at

what appears injustice to his neighbour. At the present

time indeed they are all at peace, being in subjection and living under the command of the Romans, who have subdued

them; but we have described their customs as we understand

they existed in former times, and as they still exist amongst

the Germans. These two nations, both by nature and in

their form of government, are similar and related to each

other. Their countries border on each other, being separated by the river Rhine, and are for the most part similar.

Germany, however, is more to the north, if we compare together the southern and northern parts of the two countries

respectively. Thus it is that they can so easily change their

abode. They march in crowds in one collected army, or rather

remove with all their families, whenever they are ejected by

a more powerful force. They were subdued by the Romans

much more easily than the Iberians; for they began to wage

war with these latter first, and ceased last, having in the

mean time conquered the whole of the nations situated between the Rhine and the mountains of the Pyrenees. For

these fighting in crowds and vast numbers, were overthrown

in crowds, whereas the Iberians kept themselves in reserve,

and broke up the war into a series of petty engagements,

showing themselves in different bands, sometimes here, sometimes there, like banditti. All the Gauls are warriors by

nature, but they fight better on horseback than on foot, and

the flower of the Roman cavalry is drawn from their number.

The most valiant of them dwell towards the north and next

the ocean.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of these they say that the Belgæ are the bravest. They

are divided into fifteen nations, and dwell near the ocean between the Rhine and the Loire, and have therefore sustained

themselves single-handed against the incursions of the Germans, the Cimbri,<note anchored="yes">The Cimbri inhabited Denmark and the adjacent regions.</note> and the Teutons. The bravest of the



<pb n="293"/>



Belgæ are the Bellovaci,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of the Beauvoisis.</note> and after them the Suessiones. The

amount of their population may be estimated by the fact that

formerly there were said to be 300,000 Belgæ capable of

bearing arms.<note anchored="yes">Vide Cæsar, lib. ii. c. 4.</note> The numbers of the Helvetii, the Arverni,

and their allies, have already been mentioned. All this is a

proof both of the amount of the population [of Gaul], and, as

before remarked, of the fecundity of their women, and the

ease with which they rear their children. The Gauls wear

the sagum, let their hair grow, and wear short breeches. Instead of tunics they wear a slashed garment with sleeves descending a little below the hips.<note anchored="yes">This slashed garment is the smock frock of the English peasant

and the blouse of the continent.</note> The wool [of their sheep

is coarse, but long; from it they weave the thick saga called

laines. However, in the northern parts the Romans rear

flocks of sheep which they cover with skins, and which produce very fine wool. The equipment [of the Gauls] is in

keeping with the size of their bodies; they have a long sword

hanging at their right side, a long shield, and lances in proportion, together with a madaris somewhat resembling a javelin; some of them also use bows and slings; they have also a

piece of wood resembling a pilum, which they hurl not out of

a thong, but from their hand, and to a farther distance than

an arrow. They principally make use of it in shooting

birds. To the present day most of them lie on the ground,

and take their meals seated on straw. They subsist principally on milk and all kinds of flesh, especially that of swine,

which they eat both fresh and salted. Their swine live in

the fields, and surpass in height, strength, and swiftness. To

persons unaccustomed to approach them they are almost as

dangerous as wolves. The people dwell in great houses

arched, constructed of planks and wicker, and covered with a

heavy thatched roof. They have sheep and swine in such abundance, that they supply saga and salted pork in plenty, not only

to Rome but to most parts of Italy. Their governments were

for the most part aristocratic; formerly they chose a governor

every year, and a military leader was likewise elected by the

multitude.<note anchored="yes">Conf. Cæsar, lib. vi. c. 13. Plebs pene servorum habetur loco, quæ

per se nihil audet, et nulli adhibetur consilio.</note> At the present day they are mostly under sub-



<pb n="294"/>



jection to the Romans. They have a peculiar custom in their

assemblies. If any one makes an uproar or interrupts the

person speaking, an attendant advances with a drawn sword,

and commands him with menace to be silent; if he persists,

the attendant does the same thing a second and third time;

and finally, [if he will not obey,] cuts off from his sagum so

large a piece as to render the remainder useless. The labours

of the two sexes are distributed in a manner the reverse of

what they are with us, but this is a common thing with

numerous other barbarians.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Amongst [the Gauls] there are generally three divisions

of' men especially reverenced, the Bards, the Vates, and the

Druids. The Bards composed and chanted hymns; the

Vates occupied themselves with the sacrifices and the study

of nature; while the Druids joined to the study of nature

that of moral philosophy. The belief in the justice [of the

Druids] is so great that the decision both of public and private

disputes is referred to them; and they have before now, by

their decision, prevented armies from engaging when drawn

up in battle-array against each other. All cases of murder

are particularly referred to them. When there is plenty of

these they imagine there will likewise be a plentiful harvest.

Both these and the others<note anchored="yes">By the others are probably meant the Bards and Vates.</note> assert that the soul is indestructi-

ble, and likewise the world, but that sometimes fire and sometimes water have prevailed in making great changes.<note anchored="yes">These opinions are also to be found in the Pythagorean philosophy.</note>

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To their simplicity and vehemence, the Gauls join much

folly, arrogance, and love of ornament. They wear golden

collars round their necks, and bracelets on their arms and

wrists, and those who are of any dignity have garments

dyed and worked with gold. This lightness of character

makes them intolerable when they conquer, and throws them

into consternation when worsted. In addition to their folly,

they have a barbarous and absurd custom, common however

with many nations of the north, of suspending the heads of

their enemies from their horses' necks on their return from

tattle, and when they have arrived nailing them as a spectacle to their gates. Posidonius says he witnessed this in

many different places, and was at first shocked, but became

familiar with it in time on account of its frequency. The



<pb n="295"/>



beads of any illustrious persons they embalm with cedar, exhibit them to strangers, and would not sell them for their

weight in gold.<note anchored="yes">These particulars are taken from Posidonius. See also Diodorus

Siculus, lib. v. c. 29.</note> However, the Romans put a stop to these

customs, as well as to their modes of sacrifice and divination,

which were quite opposite to those sanctioned by our laws.

They would strike a man devoted as an offering in his back

with a sword, and divine from his convulsive throes. Without the Druids they never sacrifice. It is said they have

other modes of sacrificing their human victims; that they

pierce some of them with arrows, and crucify others in their

temples; and that they prepare a colossus of hay and wood,

into which they put cattle, beasts of all kinds, and men, and

then set fire to it.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They say that in the ocean, not far from the coast, there

is a small island lying opposite to the outlet of the river

Loire, inhabited by Samnite women who are Bacchantes, and

conciliate and appease that god by mysteries and sacrifices.

No man is permitted to land on the island; and when the

women desire to have intercourse with the other sex, they

cross the sea, and afterwards return again. They have a

custom of once a year unroofing the whole of the temple, and

roofing it again the same day before sun-set, each one

bringing some of the materials. If any one lets her burden

fall, she is torn in pieces by the others, and her limbs carried

round the temple with wild shouts, which they never cease

until their rage is exhausted. [They say] it always happens

that some one drops her burden, and is thus sacrificed.
</p><p>But what Artenmidorus tells us concerning the crows, partakes still more of fiction. He narrates that on the coast,

washed by the ocean, there is a harbour named the Port of

Two Crows, and that here two crows may be seen with their

right wings white. Those who have any dispute come here,

and each one having placed a plank for himself on a lofty

eminence, sprinkles crumbs thereupon; the birds fly to these,

eat up the one and scatter the other, and he whose crumbs

are scattered gains the cause. This narration has decidedly

too much the air of fiction. What he narrates concerning

Ceres and Proserpine is more credible. He says that there

is an island near Britain in which they perform sacrifices to



<pb n="296"/>



these goddesses after the same fashion that they do in Samo-

thrace. The following is also credible, that a tree grows in

Keltica similar to a fig, which produces a fruit resembling a

Corinthian capital, and which, being cut, exudes a poisonous juice which they use for poisoning their arrows. It

is well known that all the Kelts are fond of disputes; and

that amongst them pederasty is not considered shameful.

Ephorus extends the size of Keltica too far, including within

it most of what we now designate as Iberia, as far as Gades,

He states that the people are great admirers of the Greeks,

and relates many particulars concerning them not applicable

to their present state. This is one:—That they take great

care not to become fat or big-bellied, and that if any young

man exceeds the measure of a certain girdle, he is punished.<note anchored="yes">A similar custom existed amongst the Spartans; the young people

were obliged to present themselves from time to time before the Ephori,

and if of the bulk thought proper for a Spartan, they were praised, if on

the contrary they appeared too fat, they were punished. Athen. 1. xii. p.

550. Ælian, V. H. I. xiv. c. 7. At Rome likewise it was the duty of the

censor to see that the equites did not become too fat; if they did, they

were punished with the loss of their horse. Aulus Gellius, Noct. Att. l.

<head>BRITAIN.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>BRITAIN is triangular in form; its longest side lies

parallel to Keltica, in length neither exceeding nor falling

short of it; for each of then extends as much as 4300 or

4400 stadia: the side of Keltica extending from the mouths of

the Rhine to the northern extremities of the Pyrenees towards Aquitaine; and that of Britain, which commences at

Kent, its most eastern point, opposite the mouths of the

Rhine, extending to the western extremity of the island,

which lies over against Aquitaine and the Pyrenees. This is

the shortest line from the Pyrenees to the Rhine; the longest

is said to be 5000 stadia; but it is likely that there is some



<pb n="297"/>



convergency of the river towards the mountain from a strictly

parallel position, there being an inclination of either toward

the other at the extremities next the ocean.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are four passages commonly used from the continent to the island, namely, from the mouths of the rivers

Rhine, Seine, Loire, and Garonne; but to such as set sail

from the parts about the Rhine, the passage is not exactly

from its mouths, but from the Morini,<note anchored="yes">The coasts occupied by the Morini extended from la Canche to the

and he found the corn in the fields. The greatest portion of

the island is level and woody, although many tracts are hilly.

It produces corn, cattle, gold, silver, and iron, which things

are brought thence, and also skins, and slaves, and dogs

sagacious in hunting; the Kelts use these, as well as their

native dogs, for the purposes of war. The men are taller

than the Kelts, with hair less yellow; they are slighter in their

persons. As an instance of their height, we ourselves saw at

Rome some youths who were taller than the tallest there

by as much as half a foot, but their legs were bowed,

and in other respects they were not symmetrical in conformation. Their manners are in part like those of the

Kelts, though in part more simple and barbarous; insomuch

that some of them, though possessing plenty of milk, have not

skill enough to make cheese, and are totally unacquainted

with horticulture and other matters of husbandry. There

are several states amongst them. In their wars they make

use of chariots for the most part, as do some of the Kelts.

Forests are their cities; for having enclosed an ample space



<pb n="298"/>



with felled trees, they make themselves huts therein, and lodge

their cattle, though not for any long continuance. Their atmosphere is more subject to rain than to snow; even in their

clear days the mist continues for a considerable time, inso-

much that throughout the whole day the sun is only visible

for three or four hours about noon; and this must be the case

also amongst the Morini, and the Menapii, and among all the

neighbouring people.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Divus Cæsar twice passed over to the island, but quickly

returned, having effected nothing of consequence, nor proceeded far into the country, as well on account of some commotions in Keltica, both among his own soldiers and among

the barbarians, as because of the loss of many of his ships at

the time of the full moon, when both the ebb and flow of

the tides were greatly increased.<note anchored="yes">The fleet consisted of 1000 vessels, according to Cotta. (Athen. 1. vi.

c. 21.) The great loss spoken of by Strabo occurred before the first return of Cæsar into Gaul. (Cæsar, 1. iv. c. 28.) As to his second return, it

was occasioned, to use his own words, <q direct="unspecified">propter repentinos Galliæ

motus.</q> L. v. c. 22.</note> Nevertheless he gained

two or three victories over the Britons, although he had

transported thither only two legions of his army, and brought

away hostages and slaves and much other booty. At the

present time, however, some of the princes there have, by

their embassies and solicitations, obtained the friendship of

Augustus Cæsar, dedicated their offerings in the Capitol, and

brought the whole island into intimate union with the

Romans. They pay but moderate duties both on the imports

and exports from Keltica; which are ivory bracelets and

necklaces, amber, vessels of glass, and small wares; so that

the island scarcely needs a garrison, for at the least it would

require one legion and some cavalry to enforce tribute from

them; and the total expenditure for the army would be equal

to the revenue collected; for if a tribute were levied, of necessity the imposts must be diminished, and at the same time

some danger would be incurred if force were to be employed.

marry their six sisters, and Juno addresses herself to Jupiter as <q direct="unspecified">Et sorer

neighbouring places, is proved by what he has asserted of well-

known countries. For if, as we have shown, his description

was corn and honey they would make drink of these. That

having no bright sun, they would thresh their corn, and store

it in vast granaries, threshing-floors being useless on account

whole of Italy; observing in our description such arrangement as the nature of the country shall point out.
</p><p>The Alps do not commence at Monœci Portus,<note anchored="yes">Port Monaco.</note> as some have

their rise about Genoa, a mercantile city of the Ligurians,

nines take their rise near Genoa, and the Alps near Sabatorum Vada. The distance between Genoa and the Sabatorum Vada is about 260 stadia. About 370 stadia farther

on is the little city of Albingaunum,<note anchored="yes">Albinga.</note> inhabited by Ligurians

who are called Ingauni. From thence to the Monœci Portus is

480 stadia. In the interval between is the very considerable

city of Albium Intemelium,<note anchored="yes">Vintimille.</note> inhabited by the Intemelii. These

<p>Now since the Ligurians were divided into Ingauri

and Intemelii, it was natural that their maritime colonies

should be distinguished, one by the name of Albium Intemelium, Alpine as it were, and the other by the more concise

form Albingaunum.<note anchored="yes">Casaubon observes that the Roman writers separated the name

Albium Ingaunum, in the same manner as Albium Intemelium.</note> To these two tribes of Ligurians already

mentioned, Polybius adds those of the Oxybii and Deciates.<note anchored="yes">These two tribes inhabited the country round Fréjus and Antibes as

far as the Var.</note>

The whole coast from Monœci Portus to Tyrrhenia is

continuous, and without harbours excepting some small

roads and anchorages. Above it rise the rugged precipices of

the Alpine range, leaving but a narrow passage along the

sea. This district, but particularly the mountains, is inhabited

by Ligurians, principally subsisting on the produce of their

herds, and milk, and a drink made of barley. There is plenty

of wood here for the construction of ships; the trees grow to

a vast size, some of them having been found eight feet in

diameter. Much of the wood is veined, and not inferior to

cedar-wood for cabinet work. This wood, together with the

produce of their cattle, hides, and honey, they transport to

the mart of Genoa, receiving in exchange for them the oil

and wine of Italy; for the little [wine] which their country

produces is harsh and tastes of pitch. Here are bred the

horses and mules known as ginni, and here too are wrought

the Ligurian tunics and saga. In their country likewise there

is plenty of lingurium, called by some electrum.<note anchored="yes">Or amber.</note> They use

but few cavalry in war; their infantry are good, and excellent

slingers. Some have thought that their brazen shields prove

these people to be of Grecian origin.

dedicated to Hercules Monœcus.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Mo/noikos,</foreign> an epithet of Hercules signifying <q direct="unspecified">sole inhabitant.</q> According to Servius, either because after he had driven out the Ligurians

he remained the sole inhabitant of the country; or because it was not

it probable that the Massilian voyages along the coast extended as far as here. Monœci Portus is distant from Antipolis rather more than 200 stadia. The Salyes occupy the

region from thence to Marseilles, or a little farther; they

inhabit the Alps which lie above that city, and a portion of

the sea-coast, where they intermingle with the Greeks. The

They are divided

into ten cantons, and are capable of raising troops not only of

infantry, but of cavalry also. These people were the first of

the Transalpine Kelts whom the Romans subdued after maintaining a lengthened war against them and the Ligurians.

They closed [against the Romans] all the roads into Iberia

along the sea-coast, and carried on a system of pillage both

by sea and land. Their strength so increased that large

armies were scarcely able to force a passage. And after a

war of eighty years, the Romans were hardly able to obtain

a breadth of twelve stadia for the purpose of making a public

road. After this, however, the Romans subdued the whole of

them, and established among them a regular form of government, and imposed a tribute.<note anchored="yes">We have adopted the reading of the older editions, which is also that

Vocontii inhabit the northern portion of the mountains.

The Vocontii extend as far as the Allobriges, and occupy

vast valleys in the depths of the mountains, not inferior to

those inhabited by the Allobriges. Both the Allobriges and

Ligurians are subject to the pretors sent into the Narbonnaise,

<p>After the Vocontii, are the Iconii, the Tricorii, and the

Medulli; who inhabit the loftiest ridges of the mountains,

for they say that some of them have an almost perpendicular

ascent of 100 stadia, and a similar descent to the frontiers

of Italy. In these high-lands there is a great lake; there

are also two springs not far distant from each other; one

of these gives rise to the Durance, which flows like a

torrent into the Rhone, and to the Durias,<note anchored="yes">There are two rivers of this name which descend from the Alps and

much lower down, rises the Po itself, large and rapid,

which as it advances becomes still vaster, and at the same

time more gentle. As it reaches the plains it increases in

breadth, being augmented by numerous [other rivers], and

thus it becomes less impetuous in its course, and its current

is weakened. Having become the largest river in Europe,

with the exception of the Danube,<note anchored="yes">The Ister of the classics.</note> it discharges itself into the

near to Como. Lying above Como, which is situated at the

towards the east,<note anchored="yes">The Rhæti are the Grisons; the Vennones, the people of the Va

Telline.</note> and on the other the Lepontii, the Tridentini, the Stoni,<note anchored="yes">The Lepontii inhabited the Haut Valais, and the valley of Leventina; the Tridentini occupied Trente; the Stoni, Sténéco.</note> and numerous other small nations, poor and

addicted to robbery, who in former times possessed Italy.

At the present time some of them have been destroyed, and

the others at length civilized, so that the passes over the

mountains through their territories, which were formerly few

and difficult, now run in every direction, secure from any

danger of these people, and as accessible as art can make them.

For Augustus Cæsar not only destroyed the robbers, but improved the character of the roads as far as practicable, although

he could not every where overcome nature, on account of the

rocks and immense precipices; some of which tower above

the road, while others yawn beneath; so that departing ever

so little [from the path], the traveller is in inevitable danger

of falling down bottomless chasms. In some places the road

is so narrow as to make both the foot traveller and his beasts

of burden, who are unaccustomed to it, dizzy; but the animals

of the district will carry their burdens quite securely. These

things however are beyond remedy, as well as the violent

descent of vast masses of congealed snow from above, capable

of overwhelming a whole company at a time, and sweeping

them into the chasms beneath. Numerous masses lie one upon

the other, one hill of congealed snow being formed upon another, so that the uppermost mass is easily detached at any time

from that below it, before being perfectly melted by the sun.

<p>A great part of the country of the Salassi lies in a deep

valley, formed by a chain of mountains which encloses the

overhanging ridges. The route of those who are desirous of

passing from Italy over these mountains, lies through the

aforesaid valley. Beyond this the road separates into two.

The one which passes through the mountain peaks, known as

the Pennine Alps, cannot be traversed by carriages; the

other, which runs through the country of the Centrones, lies

more to the west.<note anchored="yes">These two routes still exist. The former passes by the Great Saint

Bernard, or the Pennine Alps; the latter traverses the Little Saint Bernard, and descends into La Tarentaise, formerly occupied by the Centrones.</note> The country of the Salassi contains gold

mines, of which formerly, in the days of their power, they

were masters, as well as of the passes. The river Doria

Baltea<note anchored="yes">Anciently Durias.</note> afforded them great facility in obtaining the metal by

[supplying them with water] for washing the gold, and they

have emptied the main bed by the numerous trenches cut for

drawing the water to different places. This operation, though

advantageous in gold hunting, was injurious to the agriculturists below, as it deprived them of the irrigation of a river,

which, by the height of its position, was capable of watering

their plains. This gave rise to frequent wars between the

two nations; when the Romans gained the dominion, the

Salassi lost both their gold works and their country, but as

they still possessed the mountains, they continued to sell

water to the public contractors of the gold mines; with whom

there were continual disputes on account of the avarice of the

contractors, and thus the Roman generals sent into the country were ever able to find a pretext for commencing war.

And, until very recently, the Salassi at one time waging war

against the Romans, and at another making peace, took occasion to inflict numerous damages upon those who crossed over

their mountains, by their system of plundering; and even

exacted from Decimus Brutus, on his flight from Mutina,<note anchored="yes">Modena.</note> a

drachm per man. Messala, likewise, having taken up his

winter quarters in their vicinity, was obliged to pay them,

both for his fire-wood, and for the elm-wood for making javelins for the exercise of his troops. In one instance they

plundered the treasures of Cæsar,<note anchored="yes">It does not appear that Julius Cæsar is here intended, for he mentions

nothing of it in his Commentaries. It seems more probable that Strabo used

the expression of Cæsar in its wider sense of Emperor, and alludes to

Augustus, of whom he speaks immediately after.</note> and rolled down huge

masses of rock upon the soldiers under pretence of making

roads, or building bridges over the rivers. Afterwards

Augustus completely overthrew them, and carried them to

Eporedia,<note anchored="yes">Ivrea.</note> a Roman colony which had been planted as a

bulwark against the Salassi, although the inhabitants were

able to do but little against them until the nation was destroyed; their numbers amounted to 36,000 persons, besides 8000

men capable of bearing arms. Terentius Varro, the general

who defeated them, sold them all by public auction, as enemies

taken in war. Three thousand Romans sent out by Augustus

founded the city of Augusta,<note anchored="yes">Aouste.</note> on the spot where Varro had

encamped, and now the whole surrounding country, even to

the summits of the mountains, is at peace.

<p>Beyond, both the eastern parts of the mountains, and

those likewise inclining to the south, are possessed by the

Rhæti and Vindelici, who adjoin the Helvetii and Boii, and

press upon their plains. The Rhæti extend as far as Italy

above Verona and Como. The Rhætian wine, which is

esteemed not inferior to the finest wines of Italy, is produced

[from vines which grow] at the foot of the mountains. These

people extend also as far as the districts through which the

Rhine flows. The Lepontii and Camuni are of their nation.

The Vindelici and Norici possess, for the most part, the

opposite side of the mountains together with the Breuni and

Genauni, who form part of the Illyrians.<note anchored="yes">The limits of these barbarous nations were continually varying according to their success in war, in general, however, the Rhæti possessed

the country of the Grisons, the Tyrol, and the district about Trent.

The Lepontii possessed the Val Leventina. The Camuni the Val

Camonica. The Vindelici occupied a portion of Bavaria and Suabia;

on their west were the Helvetii or Swiss, and on the north the Boii, from

whom they were separated by the Danube; these last people have left

their name to Bohemia. The Norici possessed Styria, Carinthia, a part of

Austria and Bavaria to the south of the Danube. The Breuni have given

their name to the Val Braunia north of the Lago Maggiore; and the

Genauni appear to have inhabited the Val Agno, between Lake Maggiore

and the Lake of Como, although Strabo seems to place these people on

the northern side of the Alps, towards the confines of Illyria.</note> All these people

were continually making incursions both into the neighbouring parts of Italy, and into [the countries] of the Helvetii,

Rhæti. Both the Estiones and Brigantii belong to the

Vindelici; their cities are Brigantium, Campodunum, and

Damasia, which may be looked upon as the Acropolis of the

Licattii. It is narrated, as an instance of the extreme brutality

of these robbers towards the people of Italy, that when they

have taken any village or city, they not only put to death all

the men capable of bearing arms, but likewise all the male

children, and do not even stop here, but murder every pregnant woman who, their diviners say, will bring forth a male

<p>After these come certain of the Norici, and the Carni,

who inhabit the country about the Adriatic Gulf and Aquileia. The Taurisci belong to the Norici. Tiberius and his

the whole region of the Alps there are hilly districts capable

of excellent cultivation, and well situated valleys; but the

greater part, especially the summits of the mountains inhabited

by the robbers, are barren and unfruitful, both on account of

the frost and the ruggedness of the land. On account of the

want of food and other necessaries the mountaineers have

sometimes been obliged to spare the inhabitants of the plains,

that they might have some people to supply them; for these

they have given them in exchange, resin, pitch, torches,

wax, cheese, and honey, of which they have plenty. In the

Mount Apennine<note anchored="yes">The Carnic, or Julian Alps, is intended.</note> which lies above the Carni there is a lake

which runs out into the Isar, which river, after receiving

From this lake there is also another river, the Atesinus, which

flows into the Danube.<note anchored="yes">There is, remarks Gosselin, a palpable mistake in this passage. We

<p>Polybius tells us that in his time the gold mines were

so rich about Aquileia, but particularly in the countries of

the Taurisci Norici, that if you dug but two feet below the

surface you found gold, and that the diggings [generally] were

not deeper than fifteen feet. In some instances the gold was

found pure in lumps about the size of a bean or lupin, and

which diminished in the fire only about one eighth; and in

others, though requiring more fusion, was still very profitable.

<p>SUMMARY.</p>

<p>The Fifth Book contains a description of Italy from the roots of the Alps to the Strait of Sicily, the Gulf of Taranto, and the region about Posidonium;

likewise of Venetia, Liguria, Agro Piceno, Tuscany, Rome, Campania,

Lucania, Apulia, and the islands lying in the sea between Genoa and

Sicily.</p></argument>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>AT the foot of the Alps commences the region now known

as Italy. The ancients by Italy merely understood Œnotria,

which reached from the Strait of Sicily to the Gulf of Taranto,

and the region about Posidonium,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Salerno.</note> but the name has extended

even to the foot of the Alps; comprehending on one side that

portion of Liguria situated by the sea, from the confines of

Tyrrhenia to the Var; and on the other, that portion of Istria

which extends as far as Pola. It seems probable that the

first inhabitants were named Italians, and, being successful,

they communicated their name to the neighbouring tribes,

and this propagation [of name] continued until the Romans

obtained dominion. Afterwards, when the Romans conferred

on the Italians the privileges of equal citizenship, and thought

fit to extend the same honour to the Cisalpine Galatæ and

Heneti,<note anchored="yes">Venetians.</note> they comprised the whole under the general denomination of Italians and Romans; they likewise founded amongst

them numerous colonies, some earlier, some later, of which it

would be difficult to say which are the most considerable.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is not easy to describe the whole of Italy under any

one geometrical figure; although some say that it is a promontory of triangular form, extending towards the south and

winter rising, with its apex towards the Strait of Sicily, and



<pb n="314"/>



its base formed by the Alps. . . . . . [No one can allow this

definition either for the base or one of the sides,] although it

is correct for the other side which terminates at the Strait,

and is washed by the Tyrrhenian Sea. But a triangle, properly so called, is a rectilinear figure, whereas in this instance

both the base and the sides are curved. So that, if I agree, I

must add that the base and the sides are of a curved figure,

and it must be conceded to me that the eastern side deviates,

as well; otherwise they have not been sufficiently exact in

describing as one side that which extends from the head of

the Adriatic to the Strait [of Sicily]. For we designate as a

side a line without any angle; now a line without any angle

is one which does not incline to either side, or but very little;

whereas the line from Ariminum<note anchored="yes">Rimini.</note> to the Iapygian promontory,<note anchored="yes">Capo di Leuca.</note> and that from the Strait [of Sicily] to the same promontory, incline very considerably. The same I consider to

be the case with regard to the lines drawn from the head of

the Adriatic and Iapygia, for meeting about the neighbourhood of Ariminum and Ravenna, they form an angle, or if not

an angle, at least a strongly defined curve. Consequently, if the

coast from the head [of the Adriatic] to Iapygia be considered as one side, it cannot be described as a right line;

neither can the remainder of the line from hence to the Strait

[of Sicily], though it may be considered another side, be said

to form a right line. Thus the figure [of Italy] may be said

to be rather quadrilateral than trilateral, and can never without impropriety be called a triangle. It is better to confess

that you cannot define exactly ungeometrical figures.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>[Italy], however, may be described in the following manner. The roots of the Alps are curved, and in the form of a

gulf, the head turned towards Italy; the middle of the gulf

in the country of the Salassi, and its extremities turned, the

one towards Ocra and the head of the Adriatic, the other

towards the coast of Liguria as far as Genoa, a mercantile

city of the Ligurians, where the Apennines fall in with the

Alps. Immediately under [the Alps] there is a considerable

plain, of about an equal extent of 2100 stadia both in breadth

and length; its southern side is closed by the coast of the

Heneti<note anchored="yes">Venetians.</note> and the Apennines, which extend to Ariminum and



<pb n="315"/>



Ancona; for these mountains, commencing at Liguria, enter

Tyrrhenia, leaving but a narrow sea-coast; they afterwards

retire by degrees into the interior, and having reached the

territory of Pisa, turn towards the east in the direction of

the Adriatic as far as the country about Ariminum and

Ancona, where they approach the sea-coast of the Heneti at

right angles. Cisalpine Keltica is enclosed within these

limits, and the length of the coast joined to that of the mountains is 6300 stadia; its breadth rather less than 2000. The

remainder of Italy is long and narrow, and terminates in two

promontories, one<note anchored="yes">The peninsula occupied by the people named Brettii, or Bruttii.</note> extending to the Strait of Sicily, the other<note anchored="yes">The peninsula now designated Terra di Lecce, and called by the

ancients sometimes Iapygia, at others Messapia, Calabria, and Salentina.

The isthmus of this peninsula was supposed to be formed by a line drawn

from Brindisi to Taranto.</note> to Iapygia. It is embraced on one side by the Adriatic,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Venice.</note> on

the other by the Tyrrhenian Sea.<note anchored="yes">The Sea of Tuscany.</note> The form and size of the

Adriatic resembles that portion of Italy bounded by the

Apennines and the two seas, and extending as far as Iapygia

and the isthmus which separates the Gulf of Taranto from

that of Posidonium.<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Salerno.</note> The greatest breadth of both is about

<date value="1300">1300</date> stadia, and the length not much less than 6000. The

remainder of the country is possessed by the Bruttii, and certain of the Leucani. Polybius tells us, that traversing the

sea-coast on foot from Iapygia<note anchored="yes">Capo di Leuca.</note> to the Strait [of Sicily] there

are 3000 stadia, the coast being washed by the Sea of Sicily;

but that going by water it is 500 stadia less. The Apennines, after approaching the country about Ariminum and

Ancona, and determining the breadth of Italy at this point

from sea to sea, change their direction and divide the whole

country throughout its length. As far as the Peucetii and

Leucani they do not recede much from the Adriatic, but on

arriving at the Leucani they decline considerably towards

the other sea,<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> and traversing the remainder of the distance

through the Leucani and Bruttii, terminate at Leucopetra,<note anchored="yes">Capo dell' Armi.</note>

in Reggio. Such is a general description of the whole of

present Italy. We will now endeavour to undertake a description of its various parts. And, first, of those situated

below the Alps.



<pb n="316"/>



<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This is a superb plain variegated with fruitful hills.

The Po divides it almost through its midst, one side being

denominated Cispadana, and the other Transpadana. Cispadana comprehends that part next the Apennines and Liguria,

and Transpadana the remainder. The former [division] is

inhabited by Ligurian and Keltic nations, the former inhabiting the mountains and the latter the plains; and the latter

[division] by Kelts and Heneti. These Kelts are of the

same race as the Transalpine Kelts. Concerning the Heneti

there are two traditions, some saying that they are a colony

of those Kelts of the same name who dwell by the ocean.<note anchored="yes">Of Vannes.</note>

Others say that they are descended from the Veneti of Paphlagonia, who took refuge here with Antenor after the Trojan

war; and they give as a proof of this the attention these people bestow on rearing horses; which, though now entirely

abandoned, was formerly in great esteem among them, resulting from the ancient rage for breeding mules, which Homer

thus mentions:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>From the Eneti for forest mules renowned.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>From the Heneti, whence is the race of wild mules. </quote><bibl>Iliad ii. 857.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad ii. 857.</bibl></cit>



It was here that Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, kept his stud

of race-horses. And, in consequence, the Henetian horses were

much esteemed in Greece, and their breed in great repute for

a long period.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The whole of this country<note anchored="yes">Transpadana.</note> is full of rivers and marshes,

especially the district of the Heneti, which likewise experiences the tides of the sea. This is almost the only part of

our sea<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> which is influenced in the same manner as the ocean,

and, like it, has ebb and flood tides. In consequence most of

the plain is covered with lagoons.<note anchored="yes">The whole of the coast from Ravenna to Aquileia at the bottom of the

Gulf of Venice is still covered with marshes and lagoons, as it was in the

time of Strabo. The largest of these lagoons are at the mouths of the

Po, the others at the mouths of the torrents which descend from the Alps.</note> The inhabitants have dug

canals and dikes, after the manner of Lower Egypt, so that

part of the country is drained and cultivated, and the rest is

navigable. Some of their cities stand in the midst of water

like islands, others are only partially surrounded. Such as

lie above the marshes in the interior are situated on rivers

navigable for a surprising distance, the Po in particular,



<pb n="317"/>



which is both a large river, and also continually swelled by

the rains and snows. As it expands into numerous outlets,

its mouth is not easily perceptible and is difficult to enter.

But experience surmounts even the greatest difficulties.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Formerly, as we have said, the district next this river

was chiefly inhabited by Kelts. The principal nations of

these Kelts were the Boii, the Insubri, and the Senones and

Gæsatæ, who in one of their incursions took possession of

Rome. The Romans afterwards entirely extirpated these

latter, and expelled the Boii from their country, who then

migrated to the land about the Danube, where they dwelt

with the Taurisci, and warred against the Dacians until the

whole nation was destroyed; and they left to the surrounding tribes this sheep-pasturing district of Illyria. The Insubri

still exist; their metropolis is Mediolanum,<note anchored="yes">Milan.</note> which formerly

was a village, (for they all dwelt in villages,) but is now a

considerable city, beyond the Po, and almost touching the

Alps. Near to it is Verona, a large city, and the smaller

towns Brescia, Mantua, Reggio, and Como. This latter was

but a very indifferent colony, having been seriously impaired

by the Rhæti who dwelt higher up, but it was repeopled by

Pompey Strabo, father of Pompey the Great. Afterwards

Caius Scipio<note anchored="yes">Apparently a mistake for Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus; we

are unacquainted with any Caius Scipio.</note> transferred thither 3000 men, and finally divus

Cæsar peopled it with 5000 men, the most distinguished of

whom were 500 Greeks. He conferred on these the privileges

of citizens, and enrolled them amongst the inhabitants. They

not only took up their abode here, but left their name to the

colony itself; for all the inhabitants taking the name of

<foreign lang="greek">Neokwmi=tai,</foreign> this was translated [into Latin], and the place

called Novum-Comum. Near to this place is Lake Larius,<note anchored="yes">The Lake of Como.</note>

which is filled by the river Adda, and afterwards flows out

into the Po. The sources of this river, as well as those of

the Rhine, rise in Mount Adulas.<note anchored="yes">The source of the Adda is at the foot of Mount Braulio; the three

sources of the Rhine issue from Mounts St. Bernardin, St. Barnabé, and

Crispalt, at a considerable distance from the source of the Adda.</note>

district, and which at the time of the late census<note anchored="yes">This appears to have been the last census of the three taken under

the reign of Augustus. The first occurred in the year of Rome 726, twenty-eight years before the Christian era; the number of citizens then amounted

to 4,064,000, or, according to Eusebius, 4,011,017. The second was in the

year of Rome 746, eight years before the Christian era; the number of

citizens was then found to be 4,163,000. The third census was in the

year of Rome 767, in the fourteenth year of the Christian era; the number of citizens at this time was 4,037,000, according to the monument of

Ancyra, but according to Eusebius, 9,070,000.</note> was said to

contain 500 equites. Anciently it could muster an army of

120,000 men. The population and skill of this city is

evinced by the vast amount of manufactured goods it sends

to the Roman market, especially clothing of all kinds. It communicates with the sea by a river navigable from a large harbour [at its mouth], the river runs across the marshes for a distance of 250 stadia. This harbour,<note anchored="yes">Chioggia.</note> as well as the river,<note anchored="yes">The Bacchiglione.</note> is

named Medoacus. Situated in the marshes is the great [city of]

Ravenna, built entirely on piles,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">culopagh\s o(/lh.</foreign> We have followed the rendering of the French

translators; however, Guarini, Buonaccivoli, Xylander, Siebenkees, and

Bréquigny, all understand Strabo to mean that the city was built entirely

of wood.</note> and traversed by canals,

which you cross by bridges or ferry-boats. At the full tides

it is washed by a considerable quantity of sea-water, as well

as by the river, and thus the sewage is carried off, and the

air purified; in fact, the district is considered so salubrious

that the [Roman] governors have selected it as a spot to bring

up and exercise the gladiators in. It is a remarkable peculiarity of this place, that, though situated in the midst of a

marsh, the air is perfectly innocuous; the same is the case with

respect to Alexandria in Egypt, where the malignity of the

lake during summer is entirely removed by the rising of the

river which covers over the mud. Another remarkable peculiarity is that of its vines, which, though growing in the

marshes, make very quickly and yield a large amount of fruit,

but perish in four or five years. Altinum<note anchored="yes">Altino.</note> stands likewise

in the marshes, its situation being very similar to that of

Ravenna. Between them is Butrium,<note anchored="yes">Butrio.</note> a small city of Ravenna,

and Spina,<note anchored="yes">Spinazino.</note> which is now a village, but was anciently a celebrated Grecian city. In fact, the treasures of the Spinitæ

are shown at Delphi, and it is, besides, reported in history that



<pb n="319"/>



they had dominion over the sea. They say that it formerly

stood on the sea; now, however, the district is inland about 90

stadia from the sea. Ravenna is reported to have been

founded by Thessalians, who not being able to sustain the

violence of the Tyrrheni, welcomed into their city some of the

Ombrici, who still possess it, while they themselves returned

home. These cities for the most part are surrounded, and, as

it were, washed by the marshes.

<p>Opitergium,<note anchored="yes">Oderzo.</note> Concordia, Atria,<note anchored="yes">Adria.</note> Vicetia,<note anchored="yes">Vicenza.</note> as well as

some smaller cities, are less annoyed by the marshes: they

communicate by small navigable canals with the sea. They

say that Atria was formerly a famous city, from which the

Adriatic Gulf, with a slight variation, received its name.

Aquileia, which is the nearest to the head [of the gulf], was

founded by the Romans,<note anchored="yes">About the year 186 before the Christian era.</note> to keep in check the barbarians

dwelling higher up. You may navigate transport ships to

it up the river Natisone for more than sixty stadia. This

is the trading city with the nations of Illyrians who dwell

round the Danube. Some deal in marine merchandise,

and carry in waggons wine in wooden casks and oil, and

others exchange slaves, cattle, and hides. Aquileia is without the limits of the Heneti, their country being bounded

by a river which flows from the mountains of the Alps,

and is navigable for a distance of <date value="1200">1200</date> stadia, as far as the

city of Noreia,<note anchored="yes">Friesach in Steiermark.</note> near to where Cnæus Carbo was defeated

in his attack upon the Kimbrians.<note anchored="yes">113 years before the Christian era.</note> This place contains fine

stations for gold washing and iron-works. At the very

head of the Adriatic is the Timavum,<note anchored="yes">Giovanni del Carso.</note> a temple consecrated to Diomede, worthy of notice. For it contains a harbour and a fine grove, with seven springs of fresh water,

which fall into the sea in a broad, deep river.<note anchored="yes">The present Timavo.</note> Polybius,

however, says that, with the exception of one, they are all salt

springs, and that it is on this account the place is called by

the inhabitants—<emph rend="ital">the source and mother of the sea.</emph> Posidonius, on the other hand, tells us that the river Timavo, after

flowing from the mountains, precipitates itself into a chasm,



<pb n="320"/>



and after flowing under ground about 130 stadia, discharges

itself into the sea.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>That Diomedes did hold sovereignty over the country

around this sea,<note anchored="yes">The Adriatic.</note> is proved both by the Diomedean islands,<note anchored="yes">The three islands of Tremiti, namely Domenico, Nicola, and Caprara,

opposite Monte Gargano.</note> and the traditions concerning the Daunii and Argos-Hippium.<note anchored="yes">Arpino.</note>

Of these we shall narrate as much as may be serviceable to

history, and shall leave alone the numerous falsehoods and

myths; such, for instance, as those concerning Phaethon and

the Heliades<note anchored="yes">Phaethusa, Lampetie, and Lampethusa. See Virg. cel. vi. 62; Æn.

x. 190; Ovid Met. ii.</note> changed into alders near the [river] Eridanus, which exists no where, although said to be near the Po;<note anchored="yes">Either this passage has undergone alteration, or else Strabo is the

only writer who informs us that certain mythological traditions distinguished the Eridanus from the Po, placing the former of these rivers in the

vicinity of the latter. The père Bardetti thinks the Greeks originally

confounded the Eretenus, a tributary of the Po, with the name Eridanus.</note> of the islands Electrides, opposite the mouths of the Po, and

the Meleagrides,<note anchored="yes">Probably Guinea-hens.</note> found in them; none of which things exist

in these localities.<note anchored="yes">Strabo seems here to doubt that the Electrides islands ever existed,

but the French translators, in a very judicious note, have explained that

the geographical features of the country about the mouths of the Po had

undergone very considerable changes on account of the immense alluvial

deposit brought down from the mountains by that river, and suggest that

these islands had been united to the main-land long before Strabo's time,

for which reason he would not be able to verify the ancient traditions.

Even at the present day the Cavalier Negrelli is employing his celebrated

engineering science in making the communication between the Po and

the Adriatic navigable, and so rendering the countries bordering on the

Ticino, Adda, Mincio, Trebbia, Panono, and the adjacent lakes ac-

cessible to steam-boats from the Adriatic.</note> However, some have narrated that honours

are paid to Diomedes amongst the Heneti, and that they

sacrifice to him a white horse; two groves are likewise pointed

out, one [sacred] to the Argian Juno, and the other to the

Ætolian Diana. They have too, as we might expect, fictions

concerning these groves; for instance, that the wild beasts in

them grow tame, that the deer herd with wolves, and they

suffer men to approach and stroke them; and that when

pursued by dogs, as soon as they have reached these groves,



<pb n="321"/>



the dogs no longer pursue them. They say, too, that a certain

person, well known for the facility with which he offered himself as a pledge for others, being bantered on this subject by

some hunters who came up with him having a wolf in leash,

they said in jest, that if he would become pledge for the wolf

and pay for the damage he might do, they would loose the bonds.

To this the man consented, and they let loose the wolf, who

gave chase to a herd of horses unbranded, and drove them

into the stable of the person who had become pledge for him.

The man accepted the gift, branded the horses with [the

representation of] a wolf, and named them <emph rend="ital">Lucophori.</emph> They

were distinguished rather for their swiftness than gracefulness.

His heirs kept the same brand and the same name for this

race of horses, and made it a rule never to part with a single

mare, in order that they might remain sole possessors of the

race, which became famous. At the present day, however, as

we have before remarked, this [rage for] horse-breeding has

entirely ceased.
</p><p>After the Timavum<note anchored="yes">The Timavum, or temple consecrated to Diomede.</note> comes the sea-coast of Istria as far as

Pola, which appertains to Italy. Between [the two] is the

fortress of Tergeste, distant from Aquileia 180 stadia. Pola

is situated in a gulf forming a kind of port, and containing

some small islands,<note anchored="yes">The Isola di Brioni, Conversara, and S. Nicolo. Pliny calls them

Insulæ Pullarie.</note> fruitful, and with good harbours. This city

was anciently founded by the Colchians sent after Medea,

who not being able to fulfil their mission, condemned themselves to exile. As Callimachus says,

the Carni, the Cenomani, the Medoaci, and the Symbri.<note anchored="yes">This name is probably corrupt; Coray proposes to read Insubri.</note> These

Boii, the Ligurians, the Senones, and Gæsatæ; but after the

depopulation of the Boii, and the destruction of the Gæsatæ

alone remained. The nation of the Ombrici<note anchored="yes">The Umbrians, or Umbri, of Roman History.</note> and certain of

the Tyrrheni are also mixed amongst the Romans. These

two nations, before the aggrandizement of the Romans, had

some disputes with each other concerning precedence. Having

only the river Tiber between, it was easy to commence war

upon each other; and if the one sent out an expedition against

any nation, it was the ambition of the other to enter the same

country with an equal force. Thus, the Tyrrheni, having

organized a successful expedition against the barbarians

[dwelling in the countries] about the Po, but having speedily

lost again through their luxury [all they had acquired], the

Ombrici made war upon those who had driven them out.

Disputes arose between the Tyrrheni and Ombrici concerning the right of possessing these places, and both nations

founded many colonies; those, however, of the Ombrici were

most numerous, as they were nearest to the spot. When the

Romans gained the dominion, they sent out colonies to

different parts, but preserved those which had been formerly

planted by their predecessors. And although now they are

all Romans, they are not the less distinguished, some by the

names of Ombri and Tyrrheni, others by those of Heneti,

Ligurians, and Insubri.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Both in Cispadana and around the Po there are some

fine cities. Placentia<note anchored="yes">Piacenza</note> and Cremona, situated about the middle of the country, are close to each other. Between these

Ariminum, like Ravenna, is an ancient colony of the Ombri.

From Placentia to Ariminum there are <date value="1300">1300</date> stadia. About

this grand route was formed by C. Flaminius Nepos, censor in the year

of Rome 534, and 220 years before the Christian era (the same who

three years afterwards was slain at the battle of Thrasymenus). Livy,

whose authority is certainly of great weight, speaking of the grand road

made by C. Flaminius Nepos, consul in the year of Rome 567, states expressly that it led from Bologna to Arezzo. Hist. lib. xxxix. § 2.</note>

<p>The fertility of this country is proved by its population,

the size of its cities, and its wealth, in all of which the

Romans of this country surpass the rest of Italy. The cultivated land produces fruits in abundance and of every kind,

and the woods contain such abundance of mast, that Rome is

principally supplied from the swine fed there. Being well

supplied with water, millet grows there in perfection. This

affords the greatest security against famine, inasmuch as millet resists any inclemency of the atmosphere, and never fails,

even when there is scarcity of other kinds of grain. Their

pitch-works are amazing, and their casks give evidence of the

abundance of wine: these are made of wood, and are larger

than houses, and the great supply of pitch allows them to be

sold cheap. The soft wool and by far the best is produced

in the country round Mutina<note anchored="yes">Modena.</note> and the river Panaro;<note anchored="yes">The Scultanua of antiquity.</note> while

the coarse wool, which forms the main article of clothing

amongst the slaves in Italy, is produced in Liguria and the

country of the Symbri. There is a middling kind grown

about Patavium,<note anchored="yes">Padua.</note> of which the finer carpets, gausapi,<note anchored="yes">A kind of cassock with long hair.</note> and

<p>IN the second place, we shall treat of that portion of Liguria situated in the Apennines, between the Keltica<note anchored="yes">Gallia Cispadana.</note> already

described and Tyrrhenia. There is nothing worth mentioning about it, except that the people dwell in villages, ploughing

and digging the intractable land, or rather, as Posidonius expresses it, hewing the rocks.
</p><p>The third division contains the Tyrrhenians, who dwell

next the former, and inhabit the plains extending to the

Tiber, which river, as far as its outlet, washes the side towards

the east, the opposite side being washed by the Tyrrhenian

and Sardinian sea. The Tiber flows from the Apennines, and

is swelled by many rivers; it flows partly through Tyrrhenia,

dividing it in the first instance from Ombrica,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">)Ombikh\,</foreign> now Ombria.</note> afterwards

from the Sabini and the Latini, who are situated next Rome

as far as the sea-coast; so that these countries are bounded

in their breadth by the river [Tiber] and the Tyrrhenians,

and in their length by each other. They extend upwards

towards the Apennines which approach the Adriatic. The

first<note anchored="yes">Or nearest to the Adriatic.</note> are the Ombrici, after these the Sabini, and finally the

inhabitants of Latium. They all commence from the river.

The country of the Latini extends on one side along the seacoast from Ostia to the city of Sinuessa, on the other it

is bounded by the land of the Sabini, (Ostia is the port of

Rome, through which the Tiber passes in its course,) it



<pb n="326"/>



extends in length as far as Campania and the Samnitic moun-

tains. The country of the Sabini lies between the Latini

and the Ombrici, it likewise extends to the Samnitic mountains, but approaches nearer to the Apennines inhabited by

the Vestini, the Peligni, and the Marsi. The Ombrici lie

between the country of the Sabini and Tyrrhenia, but extend

beyond the mountains as far as Ariminum,<note anchored="yes">Rimini.</note> and Ravenna.

The Tyrrheni, commencing from their own sea and the Tiber,

extend to the circular chain of mountains which stretches

from Liguria to the Adriatic. We will now enter into a

detailed account, commencing with these.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Tyrrheni have now received from the Romans the

surname of Etrusci and Tusci. The Greeks thus named them

from Tyrrhenus the son of Atys, as they say, who sent hither

a colony from Lydia. Atys, who was one of the descendants

of Hercules and Omphale, and had two sons, in a time of

famine and scarcity determined by lot that Lydus should remain in the country, but that Tyrrhenus, with the greater

part of the people, should depart. Arriving here, he named

the country after himself, Tyrrhenia, and founded twelve

cities, having appointed as their governor Tarcon, from

whom the city of Tarquinia [received its name], and who, on

account of the sagacity which he had displayed from childhood, was feigned to have been born with hoary hair. Placed

originally under one authority, they became flourishing; but

it seems that in after-times, their confederation being broken

up and each city separated, they yielded to the violence of

the neighbouring tribes. Otherwise they would never have

abandoned a fertile country for a life of piracy on the sea.

roving from one ocean to another; since, when united they

were able not only to repel those who assailed them, but to

act on the offensive, and undertake long campaigns. After

the foundation of Rome, Demaratus arrived here, bringing

with him people from Corinth.<note anchored="yes">Larcher calculates that it was about the year of Rome 91, or 663

years before the Christian era, that Demaratus, flying from the tyranny of

Cypselus at Corinth, established himself in Tyrrhenia.</note> He was received at Tarquinia, where he had a son, named Lucumo, by a woman of

that country.<note anchored="yes">Strabo here mentions only one son of Demaratus, to whom he gives

the name of Lucumo; in this latter statement he is supported by Dionysius Halicarnassus. Livy also mentions a young citizen of Clusium

named Lucumo. But there is reason to believe that these three writers

were deceived by the writers whom they followed. It seems to be incontestable that Lucumo was the designation of the chief of each of the

twelve cities of Etruria.</note> Lucumo becoming the friend of Ancus Mar-

cius, king of the Romans, succeeded him on the throne, and

assumed the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. Both he

and his father did much for the embellishment of Tyrrhenia,

the one by means of the numerous artists who had followed

him from their native country; the other having the resources

of Rome.<note anchored="yes">Dionysius Halicarnassus relates that after a brisk war the cities of

Etruria submitted to Tarquinius Priscus, and that the Romans permitted

him to accept this foreign royalty, and still hold the throne of Rome.

No historian that we are aware of, with the exception of Strabo, mentions the benefits received by Etruria from that prince.</note> It is said that the triumphal costume of the consuls, as well as that of the other magistrates, was introduced

from the Tarquinii, with the fasces, axes, trumpets, sacrifices,

divination, and music employed by the Romans in their

public ceremonies. His son, the second Tarquin, named Su-

perbus, who was driven from his throne, was the last king [of

Rome]. Porsena, king of Clusium,<note anchored="yes">Chiusi.</note> a city of Tyrrhenia,

endeavoured to replace him on the throne by force of arms,

but not being able he made peace<note anchored="yes">B. C. <date value="-508">508</date>.</note> with the Romans, and

departed in a friendly way, with honour and loaded with gifts.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such are the facts concerning the celebrity of the Tyrrheni, to which may be added the exploits of the Cæretani,<note anchored="yes">The people of Cerveteri.</note>

who defeated the Galatæ after they had taken Rome. Having

attacked them as they were departing through the country of

the Sabini, they took from them, much against their will, the

ransom which the Romans had willingly paid to them; besides

this, they took under their protection those who fled to them

out of Rome, the sacred fire and the priestesses of Vesta.<note anchored="yes">This is also related by Livy and Valerius Maximus.</note>

The Romans, influenced by those who then misgoverned the

city, seem not to have been properly mindful of this service;

for although they conferred on them the rights of citizenship,

they did not enrol them amongst the citizens; and further,

they inscribed upon the same roll with the Cæretani, others

who did not enjoy as great privileges as they did. However,



<pb n="328"/>



amongst the Greeks this city was highly esteemed both for

its bravery and rectitude of conduct; for they refrained from

piracy, with favourable opportunities for engaging in it, and

dedicated at Delphi the treasure, as it was called, of the

Agylllæi; for their country was formerly named Agylla, though

now Cærea. It is said to have been founded by Pelasgi from

Thessaly. The Lydians, who had taken the name of Tyrrheni, having engaged in war against the Agyllæi, one of them,

approaching the wall, inquired the name of the city; when

one of the Thessalians from the wall, instead of answering the

question, saluted him with <foreign lang="greek">xai=re.</foreign><note anchored="yes">A Grecian form of salutation, equivalent to our <q direct="unspecified">good-morning.</q></note> The Tyrrheni received this

as an omen, and having taken the city they changed its name.

This city, once so flourishing and celebrated, only preserves

the traces [of its former greatness]; the neighbouring hot

springs, named Cæretana,<note anchored="yes">Cræri, according to Holstenius, the Bagni di Sasso, Cluvi con-

the people attracted thither for the sake of their health.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Almost every one is agreed that the Pelasgi were an ancient

race spread throughout the whole of Greece, but especially in

the country of the Æolians near to Thessaly. Ephorus,

however, says that he considers they were originally Arcadians, who had taken up a warlike mode of life; and having

persuaded many others to the same course, imparted their own

name to the whole, and became famous both among the Greeks,

and in every other country where they chanced to come.

Homer informs us that there were colonies of them in Crete,

for he makes Ulysses say to Penelope—

And that portion of Thessaly between the outlets of the
Peneius<note anchored="yes">The Salambria, Costum.</note> and the Thermopylæ, as far as the mountains of

Pindus, is named Pelasgic Argos, the district having formerly

belonged to the Pelasgi. The poet himself also gives to Do-

donæman Jupiter, the epithet of Pelasgian:—

Many have likewise asserted that the nations of the Epirus

are Pelasgic, because the dominions of the Pelasgi extended

so far. And, as many of the heroes have been named Pelasgi,

later writers have applied the same name to the nations over

which they were the chiefs. Thus Lesbos<note anchored="yes">Metelino.</note> has been called

Pelasgic, and Homer has called the people bordering on the

Cilices in the Troad Pelasgic:—

Ephorus, when he supposes that they were a tribe of Arcadians, follows Hesiod,

who says,

Likewise Æschylus in his Suppliants, or Danaids, makes their

race to be of Argos near Mycenæ. Ephorus likewise says that

Peloponnesus was named Pelasgia; and Euripides, in the

are quarries of marble, both white and marked with green, so

numerous and large, as to furnish tablets and columns of one

block; and most of the material for the fine works, both in

Rome and the other cities, is furnished from hence. The

transport of the marble is easy, as the quarries lie near to the

sea, and from the sea they are conveyed by the Tiber. Tyrrhenia likewise supplies most of the straightest and longest

planks for building, as they are brought direct from the

mountains to the river. Between Luna and Pisa flows the

Macra,<note anchored="yes">Other writers mention a river Macra, but none of them, as it appears,

Pisatæ of the Peloponnesus, who went under Nestor to the

expedition against Troy, but in their voyage home wandered

out of their course, some to Metapontium,<note anchored="yes">Near the mouth of the river Basiento.</note> others to the Pisatis;

they were, however, all called Pylians. The city lies between

the two rivers Arno<note anchored="yes">The ancient Arnus.</note> and Æsar,<note anchored="yes">Corresponding to the present Serchio, which discharges itself into the

sea, and not into the Arno. The time when this change of direction took

place is not recorded, but traces of the ancient name and course of the

river remain in the Osari, which, after flowing a short distance through a

marshy district, falls into the sea between the Serchio and Arno.</note> at their point of confluence;

the former of which, though very full, descends from Arretium<note anchored="yes">Arezzo.</note>

down from the Apennines. Where they fall into one current,

the shock between them is so great as to raise the water to

that height, that people standing on either bank are not able

to see each other; so that necessarily the voyage up from

the sea is difficult. This voyage is about 20 stadia. There

is a tradition, that when these rivers first descended from the

mountains they were impeded by the inhabitants of the district, lest falling together they should inundate the country;

however, they promised not to inundate it, and they have kept

their word. This city appears to have been formerly flourishing, and at the present day it still maintains its name, on

account of its fertility, its marble-quarries, and its wood for

building ships, which formerly they employed to preserve

themselves from danger by sea; for they were more warlike

than the Tyrrheni, and were constantly irritated by the Ligurians, troublesome neighbours, who dwelt on the coast. At

the present day the wood is mostly employed for building

houses in Rome, and in the country villas [of the Romans],

which resemble in their gorgeousness Persian palaces.

<p>The country of the Volaterrani<note anchored="yes">Volterra.</note> is washed by the sea.

Their city is situated in a deep hollow on the top of a high

hill. The wall of the city is built round its summit, which is

flat and precipitous on every side. From its base, the ascent

upward is fifteen stadia, steep and difficult. Here certain

of the Tyrrhenians and of those proscribed by Sulla,<note anchored="yes">Eighty-one years B. C.</note> took

their stand, and having organized four bands, sustained a

siege for two years, and at last secured articles of truce before surrendering the place. Poplonium is situated on a lofty

promontory, which projects into the sea, and forms a cher-

sonesus. It likewise sustained a siege about the same time. This

little place is now deserted, with the exception of the temples

and a few houses; the sea-port, which is situated at the root

of the mountain, is better inhabited, having both a small harbour and ship-sheds. This appears to me the only one of the

ancient Tyrrhenian cities situated on the sea; the reason

being that this territory affords no harbours. The founders

[of the cities] therefore either avoided the sea altogether, or

threw up fortifications in order that they might not become

the ready prey of those who might sail against them. On the

place to any of the three mentioned islands. We ourselves observed them from the height of Poplonium, in which place

we saw certain mines which had been abandoned, we also saw

the craftsmen who work the iron brought from Æthalia; for

they cannot reduce it into bars in the furnaces on the island,

and it is therefore transferred direct from the mines to the

continent. There is another remarkable circumstance, that

the exhausted mines of the island in course of time are again refilled similarly to what they say takes place at the <emph rend="ital">platamones</emph><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Platamw=nas</foreign> is here adopted is preference to any attempt at translation.

in India, mentioned by Clitarchus. Eratosthenes was therefore incorrect in saying that from the mainland you could

neither see Cyrnus nor Sardinia; and so was Artemidorus in

his assertion, that both these places lay in the high sea at a

distance of <date value="1200">1200</date> stadia. For whatever others might, I certainly could never have seen them at such a distance, however

carefully I had looked, particularly Cyrnus. Æthalia has a

<p>Cyrnus is called by the Romans Corsica; it is poorly inhabited, being both rugged and in many parts entirely inaccessible, so that the mountaineers, who live by plunder, are

more savage than wild beasts. Whenever any Roman general

invades the country, and, penetrating into the wilds, seizes a

vast number of slaves, it is a marvel to behold in Rome how

savage and bestial they appear. For they either scorn to live,

or if they do live, aggravate their purchasers by their apathy and

insensibility, causing them to regret the purchase-money, however small.<note anchored="yes">The testimony of Diodorus is just to the contrary. The Corsican slaves

appear better fitted than any others for performing useful services; their

Phœnicians of Carthage became masters of the island, and,

assisted by the inhabitants, carried on war against the Romans;

but after the subversion of the Carthaginians, the Romans

became masters of the whole. There are four nations of mountaineers, the Parati, Sossinati, Balari, and the Aconites. These

people dwell in caverns. Although they have some arable

land, they neglect its cultivation, preferring rather to plunder

what they find cultivated by others, whether on the island or

on the continent, where they make descents, especially upon

the Pisatæ. The prefects sent [into Sardinia] sometimes resist

them, but at other times leave them alone, since it would cost

too dear to maintain an army always on foot in an unhealthy

place: they have, however, recourse to the arts of stratagem,

and taking advantage of the custom of the barbarians, who

always hold a great festival for several days after returning

from a plundering expedition, they then fall upon them, and

capture many. There are rams here which, instead of wool,

have hair resembling that of a goat; they are called musmones,

and the inhabitants make corselets of their hides. They likewise arm themselves with a pelta and a small sword.

which armies can proceed from [Cisalpine] Keltica into Tyrrhenia; this is the one followed by Hannibal. There are two;

the other leads towards Ariminum across Ombrica, and is

preferable as the mountains are considerably lower; however, as this was carefully guarded, Hannibal was compelled to take the more difficult, which he succeeded in

forcing after having vanquished Flaminius in a decisive engagement. There are likewise in Tyrrhenia numerous hot

springs, which on account of their proximity to Rome, are

not less frequented than those of Baiæ, which are the most

famous of all.

they made the Esino the boundary; afterwards the river Rubicon:

the Esino being between Ancona and Sena, and the Rubicon

between Ariminum and Ravenna, both of them falling into the

Adriatic. At the present day, however, since Italy comprehends the whole country as far as the Alps, we need take no

further notice of these limits. All allow that Ombrica<note anchored="yes">Umbria.</note> extends

as far as Ravenna, as the inhabitants are Ombrici. From

Ravenna to Ariminum they say is about 300 stadia. Going

from Ariminum to Rome by the Via Flaminia, the whole

journey lies through Ombrica as far as the city of Ocricli<note anchored="yes">Otricoli.</note>

and the Tiber, a distance of <date value="1350">1350</date> stadia. This, consequently,

is the length [of Ombrica]; its breadth varies. The cities of

considerable magnitude situated on this side the Apennines

borders on Tyrrhenia in like manner. The parts of Latium

which border on these districts and the Apennines are very

rugged. These two nations<note anchored="yes">Sabinaand Latium.</note> commence from the Tiber and

Tyrrhenia, and extend as far as the Apennines which advance

obliquely towards the Adriatic: Ombrica extends, as we have

<p>THE Sabini occupy a narrow country, its length from the

Tiber and the small city of Nomentum<note anchored="yes">Probably Lamentana Vecchia.</note> to the Vestini being

1000 stadia. They have but few cities, and these have suffered severely in their continual wars [with the Romans]. Such

are Amiternum<note anchored="yes">Groskurd considers this to be Amatrice.</note> and Reate,<note anchored="yes">Rieti.</note> which is near to the village of

Interocrea<note anchored="yes">Interdoco, between Rieti and Aquila.</note> and the cold waters at Cotyliæ, which are taken by

patients, both as drink and as baths, for the cure of various

maladies. The rocks of Foruli,<note anchored="yes">Civita Tommassa, or rather Forcella.</note> likewise, belong to the Sabini; fitted rather for rebellion than peaceable habitation.

Cures is now a small village, although formerly a famous city:

whence came Titus Tatius and Numa Pompilius, kings of

Rome. From this place is derived the name of Quirites, which

the orators give to the Romans when they address the

people. Trebula,<note anchored="yes">Monte Leone della Sabina.</note> Eretum,<note anchored="yes">Chaupy considers this to be Rimane.</note> and other similar places, must

be looked upon rather as villages than cities. The whole land

[of Sabina] is singularly fertile in olive-trees and vines, it

produces also many acorns, and besides has excellent cattle:

the mules bred at Reate<note anchored="yes">Rieti.</note> are much celebrated. In one

word, the whole of Italy is rich both in cattle and vegetable

productions; although certain articles may be finer in some

districts than in others. The race of the Sabini is extremely

ancient, they are Autochthones. The Picentini and Samnitæ

descend from them, as do the Leucani from these latter, and

the Bruttii again from these. A proof of their antiquity may

be found in the bravery and valour which they have maintained till the present time. Fabius,<note anchored="yes">He flourished about 216 years before the Christian era.</note> the historian, says that

the Romans first knew what wealth was when they became

masters of this nation. The Via Salaria, which however does

not extend far, runs through their country: the Via Nomentana, which commences likewise at the Porta Collina, falls

in with the Via Salaria near to Eretum, a village of Sabina

lying above the Tiber.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Beyond Sabina is Latium, wherein the city of Rome is

situated. It comprises many places which formed no part of

ancient Latium. For the Æqui, the Volsci, the Hernici, the

aborigines around Rome, the Rutuli who possessed ancient

Ardea, and many other nations, some larger, some smaller,

formed so many separate states around Rome, when that city

was first built. Some of these nations, who dwelt in villages,

were governed by their own laws, and subjected to no common tribe. They say<note anchored="yes">Gosselin calls our attention to the difference between Strabo's relation of these occurrences, and the events as commonly recounted by the

Greek and Latin authors.</note> that Æneas, with his father Anchises

and his child Ascanius, arrived at Laurentum,<note anchored="yes">Near the spot now called Patemo.</note> near to Ostia

and the bank of the Tiber, where he built a city about 24

stadia above the sea. That Latinus, the king of the aborigines who then dwelt on the site where Rome now stands,

employed his forces to aid Æneas against the neighbouring

Rutuli who inhabited Ardea, (now from Ardea to Rome is a

distance of 160 stadia,) and having gained a victory, he built

near to the spot a city, to which he gave the name of his

daughter Lavinia. However, in a second battle, commenced

by the Rutuli, Latinus fell, and Æneas, being conqueror, suc-



<pb n="340"/>



ceeded this prince on the throne, and conferred on his subjects

the name of Latini. After the death both of himself and his

father, Ascanius founded Alba,<note anchored="yes">Cluvier placed the ancient Alba on the east shore of Lake Albano,

about Palazzuolo. Holstenius thinks that it was on the southern shore

in the locality of Villa-Domitiana. The Abbe de Chaupy places it

farther to the east of Monte Albano.</note> on Mount Albanus,<note anchored="yes">Albano.</note> situated

about the same distance from Rome as Ardea. Here the

Romans and Latini conjointly offer sacrifice to Jupiter. The

magistracy all assemble, and during the period of the solemnity the government of the city is intrusted to some distinguished youth. The facts related of Amulius and his

brother Numitor, some of which are fictitious, while others

approach nearer the truth, occurred four hundred years later.

These two brothers, who were descended from Ascanius, succeeded conjointly to the government of Alba, which extended

as far as the Tiber. However, Amulius the younger, having

expelled the elder, governed [alone]. Numitor had a son and

a daughter; the former Amulius treacherously murdered in

the chase; the latter, that she might remain childless, he made

a priestess of Vesta, thus imposing virginity upon her. This

[daughter] they name Rhea Silvia. Afterwards he discovered

that she was pregnant, and when she had given birth to

twins, he, out of respect to his brother, placed her in confinement, instead of putting her to death, and exposed the boys

by the Tiber according to a national usage. According to

the mythology, Mars was the father of these children, and

when they were exposed they were discovered and suckled

by a she-wolf. Faustulus, one of the swine-herds of the place,

took and reared them up, and named one Romulus, the other

Remus. (We must understand that Faustulus, who took them

up and nourished them, was an influential man, and a subject

of Amulius.) Having arrived at man's estate, they waged

war upon Amulius and his sons; and having slain them,

restored the government to Numitor. They then returned

home and founded Rome, in a locality selected rather through

necessity than choice, as the site was neither fortified by

nature, nor sufficiently large for a city of importance. In

addition to this, the neighbourhood supplied no inhabitants;

for those who dwelt around, even though touching the very

walls of the newly founded city, kept to themselves, and



<pb n="341"/>



would have nothing at all to do with the Albani. Collatia,

Antemnæ, Fidenæ, Labicum,<note anchored="yes">The sites of these places are much disputed.</note> and similar places are here

alluded to, which then were small cities, but are now villages

possessed by private individuals; they are distant from Rome

30 or 40<note anchored="yes">Kramer considers this 40 an interpolation.</note> stadia, or rather more. Between the fifth and sixth

mile-stone which marks the distance from Rome there is a

place named Festi; this they say was at that time the limit

of the Roman territory, and at the present day, both here and

in numerous other places which they consider to have been

boundaries, the priests offer the sacrifice denominated Ambarvia.<note anchored="yes">Usually Ambarvalia, sacrifices performed by the Fratres Arvales,

who formed" a college or company of twelve in number, and were so called, according to Varro, from offering public sacrifices for the fertility of the

fields. That they were of extreme antiquity is proved by the legend

which refers their institution to Romulus; of whom it is said, that when

his nurse, Acca Laurentia, lost one of her twelve sons, he allowed himself

to be adopted by her in his place, and called himself and the remaining

eleven-Fratres Arvales. (Gell. vi. 7.) We also find a college called

the Sodales Titii, and as the latter were confessedly of Sabine origin, and

instituted for the purpose of keeping up the Sabine religious rites, (Tac.

Ann. i. 53,) there is some reason for the supposition of Niebuhr, that

these colleges corresponded one to the other—the Fratres Arvales being

connected with the Latin, and the Sodales Titii with the Sabine element of

the Roman state; just as there were two colleges of the Luperci, the

Fabii and the Quinctilii, the former of whom seem to have belonged to

the Sabines.

<p>The office of the Fratres Arvales was for life, and was not taken away

even from an exile or captive. They wore, as a badge of office, a chaplet

of ears of corn fastened on their heads with a white band. The number

given on inscriptions varies, but it is never more than nine; though, according to the legend and general belief, it amounted to twelve. One of

their annual duties was to celebrate a three days' festival in honour of

Dea Dia, supposed to be Ceres . . . . Of this the master of the college,

appointed annually, gave public notice from the temple of Concord on the

Capitol. On the first and last of these days, the college met at the house

of their president, to make offerings to the Dea Dia; on the second day

they assembled in the grove of the same goddess, about five miles south

of Rome, and there offered sacrifices for the fertility of the earth. An

account of the different ceremonies of this festival is preserved in an

inscription, which was written in the first year of the emperor Heliogabalus, (A. D. <date value="218">218</date>,) who was elected a member of the college under the

name of M. Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix. The same inscription contains a hymn, which appears to have been sung at the festival from the

most ancient times.
</p><p>Besides this festival of the Dea Dia, the Fratres Arvales were required

on various occasions under the emperors to make vows and offer up

thanksgivings, an enumeration of which is given in Forcellini. Strabo

indeed informs us that, in the reign of Tiberius, these priests performed

sacrifices called the <emph rend="ital">Ambarvalia</emph> at various places on the borders of the

Ager Romanus, or original territory of Rome; and amongst others, at

Festi. There is no boldness in supposing that this was a custom handed

down from time immemorial; and, moreover, that it was a duty of this

priesthood to invoke a blessing upon the whole territory of Rome. It is

proved by inscriptions that this college existed till the reign of the emperor Gordian, or A. D. <date value="325">325</date>, and it is probable that it was not abolished

till A. D. <date value="400">400</date>, together with the other colleges of the pagan priesthoods.
</p><p>The private Ambarvalia were certainly of a different nature to those

mentioned by Strabo, and were so called from the victim <emph rend="ital">hostia Amber-</emph>

<emph rend="ital">valis</emph> that was slain on the occasion, being led three times round the

corn-fields, before the sickle was put to the corn. This victim was accompanied by a crowd of merry-makers, (<emph rend="ital">chorus et socii,</emph>) the reapers and

farm-servants, dancing and singing, as they marched along, the praises of

Ceres, and praying for her favour and presence while they offered her the

libations of milk, honey, and wine. (Virg. <emph rend="ital">Georg.</emph> i. 338.) This ceremony was also called a <emph rend="ital">lustratio,</emph> (Virg. <emph rend="ital">Ecl.</emph> v. 83,) or purification; and for a beautiful description of the holiday, and the prayers and vows made

on the occasion, the reader is referred to Tibullus (ii. 1). It is perhaps

worth while to remark that Polybius (iv. 21, § 9) uses language almost

applicable to the Roman Ambarvalia in speaking of the Mantincians,

who, he says, (specifying the occasion,) made a purification, and carried

victims round the city and all the country.
</p><p>There is, however, a still greater resemblance to the rites we have been

describing, in the ceremonies of the Rogation or gang-week of the Latin

church. These consisted of processions through the fields, accompained

with prayers (<emph rend="ital">rogationes</emph>) for a blessing on the fruits of the, earth, and

were continued during three days in Whitsun-week. The custom was

abolished at the Reformation in consequence of its abuses, and the poram-

bulation of the parish boundaries substituted in its place. <emph rend="ital">Vid Hoomer,</emph>

Eccl. Pol. v. 61, 2; Wheatley,, Com. Pray. v 20. Bohn's standard Library edition.)</p></note> They say that, at the time of the foundation [of the



<pb n="342"/>



city], a dispute arose in which Remus lost his life. The city

being built, Romulus assembled men from every quarter, and

instituted for an asylum a grove between the citadel and the

Capitol, to which whoever fled from the neighbouring states,

he proclaimed as Roman citizens. Not having wives for these

men, he appointed a horse-race in honour of Neptune, which

is celebrated to this day. Numbers [of spectators] having

assembled, particularly of the Sabini, he commanded that

each of those who were in want of a wife, should carry off

one of the assembled maidens. Titus Tatius, king of the

Quirites, took up arms to avenge the insult, but made peace

with Romulus on condition that their kingdoms should be

united, and that they should divide the sovereignty between



<pb n="343"/>



them. Tatius, however, was treacherously assassinated in

Lavinium, upon which Romulus, with the consent of the

Quirites, reigned alone. After him Numa Pompilius, formerly

a subject of Tatius, assumed the government, by the general

desire of the people. Such is the most authentic account of

the foundation of Rome.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>However, there also exists another more ancient and

mythical account, to the effect that Rome was an Arcadian

colony planted by Evander. He entertained Hercules when

driving the oxen of Geryon, and being informed by his

mother Nicostrata, (who was skilled in the art of prophecy,)

that when Hercules should have completed his labours it was

fore-ordained that he should be enrolled amongst the gods;

he informed him of the matter, consecrated to him a grove,

and offered sacrifice to him after the Grecian mode; a sacrifice which is continued in honour of Hercules to this day.

The Roman historian Cœlius is of opinion that this is a proof

that Rome is a Grecian colony, the sacrifice to Hercules after

the Grecian mode having been brought over from their fatherland. The Romans also worship the mother of Evander

under the name of Carmentis,<note anchored="yes">The Camenæ, says Dr. Smith, were prophetic nymphs, and belonged to

the religion of ancient Italy, although later traditions represent them as

having been introduced into Italy from Arcadia. Two of the Camenæ

were Antevorta and Postvorta; the third was Carmenta or Carmentis,

a prophetic and healing divinity, who had a temple at the foot of the

Capitoline hill, and altars near the Porta Carmentalis. The traditions

which assigned a Greek origin to her worship at Rome, state that her

original name was Nicostrata, and that she was called Carmentis from her

prophetic powers. (Serv. <emph rend="ital">ad Æn.</emph> viii. 51, 336; Dionys. i. 15, 32.)

According to these traditions, she was the mother of Evander, the Arcadian, by Hermes; and after having endeavoured to persuade her son to

kill Hermes, she fled with him to Italy, where she gave oracles to the

people and to Hercules. She was put to death by her son at the age of

110 years, and then obtained divine honours. Dionys. i. 31, &amp;c.</note> considering her one of the

nymphs.

<p>Thus then the Latini originally were few in number,

and for the most part under no subjection to the Romans;

but afterwards, being struck by the valour of Romulus and

the kings who succeeded him, they all submitted. But the

Æqui,<note anchored="yes">This name is written in Strabo sometimes <foreign lang="greek">Ai)/koi,</foreign> sometimes <foreign lang="greek">Ai)/kouoi;</foreign>

the Latin writers also named them differently, Æqui, Æcani, Æquicoli, &amp;c.</note> the Volsci, the Hernici; and before them the Rutuli,

the aborigines, the Rhæci, together with certain of the



<pb n="344"/>



Argyrusci and the Preferni,<note anchored="yes">Privernates of Pliny; the chief city is now called Piperno.</note> being subdued, the whole of

their different countries were included under the name of

Latium. To the Volsci pertained the pomentine plain,

bordering on the territory of the Latini, and the city of

Apiola, levelled to the ground<note anchored="yes">604 years B. C.</note> by Tarquinius Priscus. The

Æqui principally were neighbours to the Quirites, whose

cities Tarquinius Priscus likewise devastated. His son took

Suessa,<note anchored="yes">Suessa surnamed Pometia, to distinguish it from Suessa Aurunca, is

near to Lanuvium, Alba, and to Rome itself; neither were

Aricia,<note anchored="yes">La Riccia.</note> the Tellenæ, and Antium<note anchored="yes">Capo d' Anzo.</note> at any great distance.

The Albani were at first friendly with the Romans, speaking

as they did the same language, and being likewise of the

Latin stock; and though they were under separate governments, this did not prevent them from marrying together,

nor from performing in common the sacred ceremonies at

Alba, and other civil rites. In after-time, however, war

having sprung up, Alba was entirely destroyed with the exception of the temple, and the Albani were declared citizens

of Rome. Of the other surrounding cities, those which

resisted were either destroyed or enfeebled, while others,

which were friendly to the Romans, flourished. At the present day the coast from Ostia to the city of Sinuessa<note anchored="yes">Monte Dragone.</note> is

denominated the Latin coast; formerly the country thus

designated extended only so far as Circæum.<note anchored="yes">Monte Circello.</note> The interior

also [of Latium] was formerly small; but it afterwards extended to Campania, the Samnitæ, the Peligni,<note anchored="yes">According to Cluvier, Strabo was mistaken in making Latium extend

to the country of the Peligni, as these latter were always separated from

Latium by the Marsi.</note> and other

nations dwelling around the Apennines.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The whole [of Latium] is fertile, and abounding in

every production, with the exception of a few districts along

the coast, which are marshy and unhealthy; such as the

country of Ardea, the lands between Antium and Lanuvium

as far as Pometia, and certain of the districts of Setia,<note anchored="yes">Sezza.</note>

Terracina, and Circæum. Some parts may also be too moun-



<pb n="345"/>



tainous and rocky; but even these are not absolutely idle

and useless, since they furnish abundant pasturage, wood,

and the peculiar productions of the marsh and rock; while

Cæcubum, which is entirely marshy, nourishes a vine, the

dendritis,<note anchored="yes">The vine to which the term arbustive or hautain is applied, which

the French translators explain as a vine trained from the foot of a tree.</note> which produces the most excellent wine. Of the

maritime cities of Latium, one is Ostia. This city has no port,

owing to the accumulation of the alluvial deposit Brought

down by the Tiber, which is swelled by numerous rivers;

vessels therefore bring to anchor further out, but not without

danger; however, gain overcomes every thing, for there is

an abundance of lighters in readiness to freight and unfreight the larger ships, before they approach the mouth of

the river, and thus enable them to perform their voyage

speedily. Being lightened of a part of their cargo, they enter

the river and sail up to Rome, a distance of about 190 stadia.

Such is the city of Ostia, founded by Ancus Martius. Next

in order comes Antium, which city is likewise destitute of

any port; it is situated on rocks, and about 260 stadia distant

from Ostia. At the present day it is devoted to the leisure

and recreation of statesmen from their political duties, whenever they can find time, and is in consequence covered with

sumptuous mansions suited to such rusticating. The inhabitants of Antium had formerly a marine, and even after

they were under subjection to the Romans, took part with the

Tyrrhenian pirates. Of this, first, Alexander sent to complain; after him Demetrius, having taken many of these

pirates, sent them to the Romans, saying that he would surrender them their persons on account of their affinity to the

Greeks, and remarking at the same time, that it seemed to

him a great impropriety, that those who held sway over the

whole of Italy should send out pirates, and that they who had

consecrated in their forum a temple to the honour of the

Dioscuri,<note anchored="yes">Castor and Pollux.</note> whom all denominated the Saviours, should likewise send to commit acts of piracy on Greece, which was the

father-land of those divinities. Hereupon the Romans put a

stop to this occupation [piracy]. Between these two cities

is Lavinium, which contains a temple of Venus common to all

the Latini, the care of which is intrusted to the priests of



<pb n="346"/>



Ardea. After this is Laurentum;<note anchored="yes">Near Paterno.</note> and above these lies Ardea,

a colony of the Rutuli, 70 stadia from the sea; near to it

is another temple of Venus, where all the Latini hold a public

festival. These regions have been ravaged by the Samnitæ,

and only the traces of the cities left; but even these are reverenced on account of the arrival of Æneas here, and of the

religious rites which they say were bequeathed from those

times.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>At 290 stadia from Antium is Mount Circæum, insulated by the sea and marshes. They say that it contains

numerous roots, but this perhaps is only to harmonize with

the myth relating to Circe. It has a small city, together with

a temple to Circe and an altar to Minerva; they likewise say

that a cup is shown which belonged to Ulysses. Between

[Antium and Circæum] is the river Stura,<note anchored="yes">Storas, the Astura of Pliny.</note> which has a

station for ships: the rest of the coast is exposed to the southwest wind,<note anchored="yes">Libs.</note> with the exception of this small harbour of Circæum.<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Hodie,</emph> the Porto di Paula, connected with the Lake of S.

the region next to this was formerly inhabited by the Ausonians, who likewise possessed Campania: next after these the

Osci, who also held part of Campania; now, however, as we

have remarked, the whole, as far as Sinuessa, belongs to the

Latini. A peculiar fate has attended the Osci and Ausonians;

for although the Osci have ceased to exist as a distinct tribe,

their dialect is extant among the Romans, dramatic and

burlesque pieces composed in it being still represented at

certain games which were instituted in ancient times. And

as for the Ausonians, although they never have dwelt by the sea

of Sicily,<note anchored="yes">This does not appear to be in accordance with the statement of

Dionysius Halicarnassus and Pliny, that the Ausonians anciently possessed the whole coast, from the Strait of Messina to the entrance of the

Adriatic.</note> it is named the Ausonian Sea. At 100 stadia

from Circæum is Tarracina, formerly named Trachina,<note anchored="yes">Or mountainous.</note> on

account of its ruggedness; before it is a great marsh, formed by

two rivers, the larger of which is called the Aufidus.<note anchored="yes">We should doubtless here read the Ufens, the modern Ufente.</note> This is

the first place where the Via Appia approaches the sea. This

road is paved from Rome to Brundusium,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Broente/sion,</foreign> now Brindes.</note> and has great

traffic. Of the maritime cities, these alone are situated on

it; Tarracina, beyond it Formiæ,<note anchored="yes">Mola di Gaeta.</note> Minturnæ,<note anchored="yes">The ruins of this town are extant on either bank of the Garigliano,

the ancient Liris.</note> Sinuessa,<note anchored="yes">Rocca di Monte Dragone.</note> and

towards its extremity Tarentum and Brundusium. Near to

Tarracina, advancing in the direction of Rome, a canal runs

by the side of the Via Appia, which is supplied at intervals

by water from the marshes and rivers. Travellers generally

sail up it by night, embarking in the evening, and landing in

the morning to travel the rest of their journey by the way;

however, during the day the passage boat is towed by mules.<note anchored="yes">Compare Horace, Satir. l. i. sat. 5.</note>

Beyond is Formiæ, founded by the Lacedæmonians, and

formerly called Hormiæ, on account of its excellent port. Between these [two cities],<note anchored="yes">Tarracina and Formiæ.</note> is a gulf which they have named

Caiata,<note anchored="yes">Gaëta.</note> in fact all gulfs are called by the Lacedæmonians

Caietæ: some, however, say that the gulf received this appellation from [Caieta], the nurse of Æneas. From Tarracina

to the promontory of Caiata is a length of 100 stadia. Here<note anchored="yes">At Sperlunga.</note>

are opened vast caverns, which contain large and sumptuous

mansions. From hence to Formiæ is a distance of 40 stadia.

Between this city and Sinuessa, at a distance of about 80

stadia from each, is Minturnæ. The river Liris,<note anchored="yes">The Garigliano.</note> formerly

named the Clanis, flows through it. It descends from the

Apennines, passes through the country of the Vescini,<note anchored="yes">Vestini, MSS.</note> and

by the village of Fregellæ, (formerly a famous city,) and so

into a sacred grove situated below the city, and held in great

veneration by the people of Minturnæ. There are two islands,

named Pandataria and Pontia,<note anchored="yes">Ponza.</note> lying in the high sea, and

clearly discernible from the caverns. Although small, they

are well inhabited, are not at any great distance from each

other, and at 250 stadia from the mainland. Cæcubum is

situated on the gulf of Caiata, and next to it Fundi, a city

on the Via Appia. All these places produce excellent wines;

but those of Cæcubum, Fundi, and Setia<note anchored="yes">Sezza. The French translators think this should be Vescia.</note> are most in repute,

and so are the Falernian, Alban,<note anchored="yes">Albano.</note> and Statanian wines. Sinuessa

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the interior, the first city above Ostia is Rome; it is

the only city built on the Tiber. It has been remarked above,

that its position was fixed, not by choice, but necessity; to

this must be added, that those who afterwards enlarged it,

were not at liberty to select a better site, being prevented by

what was already built. The first [kings] fortified the

Capitol, the Palatium, and the Collis Quirinalis, which was so

easy of access, that when Titus Tatius came to avenge the

rape of the [Sabine] virgins, he took it on the first assault.

Ancus Marcius, who added Mount Cælius and the Aventine

Mount with the intermediate plain, separated as these places

were both from each other and from what had been formerly

fortified, was compelled to do this of necessity; since he did

not consider it proper to leave outside his walls, heights so

well protected by nature, to whomsoever might have a mind

to fortify themselves upon them, while at the same time he

was not capable of enclosing the whole as far as Mount Quirinus. Servius perceived this defect, and added the Esquiline

and Viminal hills. As these were both of easy access from

without, a deep trench was dug outside them and the earth

thrown up on the inside, thus forming a terrace of 6 stadia

in length along the inner side of the trench. This terrace he

surmounted with a wall flanked with towers, and extending

from the Colline<note anchored="yes">Called also the Quirinal, and often Salara, according to Ovid.</note> to the Esquiline gate. Midway along the

terrace is a third gate, named after the Viminal hill. Such is

the Roman rampart, which seems to stand in need of other

ramparts itself. But it seems to me that the first [founders]

were of opinion, both in regard to themselves and their successors, that Romans had to depend not on fortifications, but

on arms and their individual valour, both for safety and

for wealth, and that walls were not a defence to men, but men

were a defence to walls. At the period of its commencement,

when the large and fertile districts surrounding the city belonged to others, and while it lay easily open to assault, there

was nothing in its position which could be looked upon as

favourable; but when by valour and labour these districts

became its own, there succeeded a tide of prosperity surpass-



<pb n="349"/>



ing the advantages of every other place. Thus, notwithstanding the prodigious increase of the city, there has been

plenty of food, and also of wood and stone for ceaseless building, rendered necessary by the falling down of houses, and

on account of conflagrations, and of the sales, which seem never

to cease. These sales are a kind of voluntary falling down of

houses, each owner knocking down and rebuilding one part or

another, according to his individual taste. For these purposes

the numerous quarries, the forests, and the rivers which convey the materials, offer wonderful facilities. Of these rivers,

the first is the Teverone,<note anchored="yes">Anio.</note> which flows from Alba, a city of

the Latins near to the country of the Marsi, and from thence

through the plain below this [city], till it unites with the

Tiber. After this come the Nera<note anchored="yes">The Nar.</note> and the Timia,<note anchored="yes">The Teneas of Strabo.</note> which

passing through Ombrica fall into the Tiber, and the Chiana,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o\ Kla/nis,</foreign> there were other rivers called Clanis as well as this.</note>

which flows through Tyrrhenia and the territory of Clusiumn.<note anchored="yes">Chiusi.</note>

Augustus Cæsar endeavoured to avert from the city damages

of the kind alluded to, and instituted a company of freedmen,

who should be ready to lend their assistance in cases of con-

flagration;<note anchored="yes">Suetonius likewise mentions this fact. Dion Cassius informs us that

Augustus, in the year of Rome 732, and twenty-two years before our

era, commanded that the curule ædiles should promptly endeavour to

arrest the progress of conflagrations, and for this purpose placed at their

disposal 600 guards. Fifteen years afterwards he established a company

of seven freedmen, presided over by one of the equestrian order, to see

what means could be taken in order to prevent these numerous fires.

Augustus, however, was not the first to take precautions of this nature,

as we may learn from Livy, 1. ix. § 46; 1. xxxix. § 14; Tacit. Annal. 1. xv. § 43, and various other authorities.</note> whilst, as a preventive against the falling of houses,

he decreed that all new buildings should not be carried so

high as formerly, and that those erected along the public

ways should not exceed seventy feet in height.<note anchored="yes">Subsequent emperors reduced this standard still lower. See what

Tacitus says of Nero in regard to this point, Annal. l. xv. § 43. Trajan

forbade that any house should be constructed above 60 feet in height.

Sextus Aurelius Victor, Epit. § 27.</note> But these

improvements must have ceased only for the facilities afforded

by the quarries, the forests, and the ease of transport.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These advantages accrued to the city from the nature of

the country; but the foresight of the Romans added others



<pb n="350"/>



besides. The Grecian cities are thought to have flourished

mainly on account of the felicitous choice made by their founders, in regard to the beauty and strength of their sites, their

proximity to some port, and the fineness of the country. But

the Roman prudence was more particularly employed on

matters which had received but little attention from the

Greeks, such as paving their roads, constructing aqueducts,

and sewers, to convey the sewage of the city into the Tiber.

In fact, they have paved the roads, cut through hills, and

filled up valleys, so that the merchandise may be conveyed by

carriage from the ports. The sewers, arched over with hewn

stones, are large enough in some parts for waggons loaded

with hay to pass through; while so plentiful is the supply

of water from the aqueducts, that rivers may be said to flow

through the city and the sewers, and almost every house

is furnished with water-pipes and copious fountains. To

effect which Marcus Agrippa directed his special attention;

he likewise bestowed upon the city numerous ornaments. We

may remark, that the ancients, occupied with greater and more

necessary concerns, paid but little attention to the beautifying of Rome. But their successors, and especially those of

our own day, without neglecting these things, have at the

same time embellished the city with numerous and splendid

objects. Pompey, divus Cæsar, and Augustus, with his children, friends, wife, and sister, have surpassed all others in their

zeal and munificence in these decorations. The greater number of these may be seen in the Campus Martius, which to the

beauties of nature adds those of art. The size of the plain is marvellous, permitting chariot-races and other feats of horsemanship without impediment, and multitudes to exercise themselves

at ball,<note anchored="yes">There were five modes of playing at ball; 1. Throwing it up and

catching it; 2. Foot-ball; 3. A throwing of the ball from one to another

in a large party of players; 4. A dashing of the ball to the ground

with force enough to rebound, when it was struck down again with the

palm of the hand, and a reckoning was kept of the number of times the

feat was repeated; and 5. A ball thrown among the players, who all endeavoured to obtain possession of it; this was a game of which we have

<pb n="351"/>



the summits of the hills beyond the Tiber, extending from its

banks with panoramic effect, present a spectacle which the

eye abandons with regret. Near to this plain is another surrounded with columns, sacred groves, three theatres, an

amphitheatre, and superb temples in close contiguity to each

other; and so magnificent, that it would seem idle to describe

the rest of the city after it. For this cause the Romans, esteeming it as the most sacred place, have there erected funeral monuments to the most illustrious persons of either sex. The most

remarkable of these is that designated as the Mausoleum,<note anchored="yes">The tomb of Augustus.</note>

which consists of a mound of earth raised upon a high founda-

tion of white marble, situated near the river, and covered to

the top with ever-green shrubs. Upon the summit is a bronze

statue of Augustus Cæsar, and beneath the mound are the

ashes<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">qh=kai,</foreign> urns, Greek.</note> of himself, his relatives, and friends. Behind is a large

grove containing charming promenades. In the centre of the

plain,<note anchored="yes">The Campus Martius.</note> is the spot where this prince was reduced to ashes; it

is surrounded with a double enclosure, one of marble, the

other of iron, and planted within with poplars. If from hence

you proceed to visit the ancient forum, which is equally filled

with basilicas, porticos, and temples, you will there behold the

Capitol, the Palatium, with the noble works which adorn them,

and the piazza of Livia, each successive place causing you

speedily to forget what you have before seen. Such is Rome.

<p>Of the other cities of Latium, some are distinguished by

a variety of remarkable objects, others by the celebrated roads

which intersect Latium, being situated either upon, or near

to, or between these roads, the most celebrated of which are

the Via Appia, the Via Latina, and the Via Valeria. The

former of these bounds the maritime portion of Latium, as

far as Sinuessa, the latter extends along Sabina as far as the

Marsi, whilst between these is the Via Latina, which falls in

with the Via Appia near to Casilinum,<note anchored="yes">The modern Gavua.</note> a city distant from

Capua<note anchored="yes">S. Maria di Capoa.</note> 19 stadia. The Via Latina commences from the

Via Appia, branching from it towards the left, near to Rome.

It passes over the Tusculan mountain, between the city of

Tusculum<note anchored="yes">Tascolo.</note> and Mount Albanus; it then descends to the little

city of Algidum,<note anchored="yes">L'Ostera deil' Aglio.</note> and the Pictæ tavern; afterwards the Via

Lavicana joins it, which commences, like the Via Prænestina,

from the Esquiline gate. This road, as well as the Esquiline

plain, the Via Lavicana leaves on the left; it then proceeds a

distance of 120 stadia, or more, when it approaches Lavicum, an ancient city now in ruins, situated on an eminence;

this and Tusculum it leaves on the right, and terminates near

to Pictæ in the Via Latina. This place is 210 stadia distant

from Rome. Proceeding thence along the Via Latina there

are noble residences, and the cities Ferentinum,<note anchored="yes">Ferentino, near to Vitorchiano.</note> Frusino,<note anchored="yes">Frusinone.</note>

by its name that it belongs to the nation of the Sidicini.

These people are Osci, a surviving nation of the Campani, so

that this city, which is the largest of those situated upon the Via

thence the river flows through a highly fertile plain along by

the Tiburtine stone-quarries, those of the Gabii, and those

denominated the red-stone quarries. As both the carriage

from the quarries and the conveyance by river are easy,

most of the Roman edifices are built of materials from hence.

In this plain flow the cold waters called Albula, they spring

from numerous fountains, and are taken both as a beverage and

as baths,<note anchored="yes">The waters from the sulphur-lake; named the Solfatara di Tivoli.</note> for the cure of various diseases. Of the same kind

and oracle of Fortune. Both this and the preceding city are

situated on the same chain of mountains, and are distant from

each other 100 stadia. Præneste is 200 stadia from Rome,

Tibura less than that distance. They are said to be both

of Grecian foundation, Præneste being formerly named Polystephanus. They are both fortified, but Præneste is the

stronger place of the two, having for its citadel a lofty mountain, which overhangs the town, and is divided at the back

from the adjoining mountain range by a neck of land. This

mountain is two stadia higher than the neck in direct altitude.

In addition to these [natural] defences, the city is furnished

on all sides with subterraneous passages, which extend to the

plains, and some of which serve to convey water, while others

form secret ways; it was in one of these that Marius<note anchored="yes">The younger Marius being entirely defeated by Sulla in the decisive

battle fought near Sacriportus, B. C. <date value="-82">82</date>, Marius threw himself into Præneste, where he had deposited the treasures of the Capitoline temple.

(Pliny H. N. 1. xxxiii. s. 5.) Sulla left Lucretius Opella to prosecute

the siege while he hastened on to Rome. Various efforts were made to

relieve Præneste, but they all failed; and after Sulla's great victory at

the Colline gate of Rome, in which Pontius Telesinus was defeated and

slain, Marius despaired of holding out any longer, and in company with

the brother of Telesinus attempted to escape by a subterraneous passage,

which led from the town into the open country; but finding that their

flight was discovered, they put all end to one another's lives. According

to other accounts, Marius killed himself, or was killed by his slave at his

own request. Marius perished in the year of his consulship. Smith,

when he was besieged. Other cities are in most instances

benefited by a strong position, but to the people of Præneste

it has proved a bane, owing to the civil wars of the Romans.

For hither the revolutionary movers take refuge, and when

at last they surrender, in addition to the injury sustained by

the city during the war, the country is confiscated, and the

guilt thus imputed to the guiltless. The river Verestis<note anchored="yes">The Abbé Chaupy is inclined to think that this was a name given to

Rome.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But within-side the chain of mountains, [where these

cities are situated,] there is another ridge, leaving a valley between it and Mount Algidus; it is lofty, and extends as far as

Mount Albanus.<note anchored="yes">Monte Cavo.</note> It is on this ridge that Tusculum is situated,

a city which is not wanting in adornment, being entirely surrounded by ornamental plantations and edifices, particularly

that part of it which looks towards Rome. For on this side

Tusculum presents a fertile hill, well irrigated, and with

numerous gentle slopes embellished with majestic palaces.

Contiguous are the undulating slopes of Mount Albanus,

which are equally fertile and ornamented. Beyond are plains

which extend some of them to Rome and its environs, others

to the sea; these latter are unhealthy, but the others are

salubrious and well cultivated. Next after Albanum is the

city Aricia, on the Appian Way. It is 160 stadia from

Rome. This place is situated in a hollow, and has a strong

citadel.<note anchored="yes">We have translated literally <foreign lang="greek">e)/xei d' o(/rumnh\n a)/kran,</foreign> but it is

possible that Strabo may have meant that the citadel was built on a

height above the town; if so the citadel would occupy the site of la Riccia.</note> Beyond it on one side of the way is Lanuvium,<note anchored="yes">Civita Lavinia, or, Città della Vigna.</note> a Roman city on the right of the Via Appia, and from which

both the sea and Antium may be viewed. On the other side

is the Artemisium,<note anchored="yes">Or Grove of Diana.</note> which is called Nemus,<note anchored="yes">Nemus Ariciæ.</note> on the left side of the way, leading from Aricia to the temple.<note anchored="yes">The text here appears to be mutilated.</note> They say

lake of considerable size. The temple and water are sur-

rounded by abrupt and lofty precipices, so that they seem to

be situated in a deep and hollow ravine. The springs by

which the lake is filled are visible. One of these is denominated Egeria, after the name of a certain divinity; however,

their course on leaving the lake is subterraneous, but they

may be observed at some distance, when they rise to the

surface of the ground.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Near to these localities is Mount Albanus,<note anchored="yes">Monte Cavo.</note> which is

much higher than either the Artemisium or the heights surrounding it, although these are sufficiently lofty and precipitous. It has likewise a lake,<note anchored="yes">The Lago d'Albano.</note> much larger than that of the

Artemisium. Further forward than these are the cities on

the Via Latina, we have already mentioned. Alba<note anchored="yes">Alba Fucensis is here intended: <emph rend="ital">hod.</emph> Albi.</note> is

the most inland of all the Latin cities; it borders on

the Marsi, and is situated on a high hill near to Lake

Fucinus. This [lake] is vast as a sea, and is of great

service to the Marsi and all the surrounding nations. They

say, that at times its waters rise to the height of the mountains which surround it, and at others subside so much, that

the places which had been covered with water reappear and

may be cultivated; however, the sub-

sidings of the waters

occur irregularly and without previous warning, and are followed by their rising again; the springs fail altogether and

gush out again after a time; as they say is the case with

the Amenanus,<note anchored="yes">The Judicello.</note> which flows through Catana,<note anchored="yes">Catania, in Sicily.</note> for after remaining dry for a number of years, it again flows. It is

reported that the Marcian<note anchored="yes">See Pliny in reference to the Aqua Marcia, Hist. Nat. l. xxxi. § 24,

preference to any other, has its source in [Lake] Fucinus.

taken their name, it being called in their language Picus, and is

regarded as sacred to Mars. They inhabit the plains extending

from the mountains to the sea; the length of their country

considerably exceeds its breadth; the soil is every where

Its breadth, from the mountains to the sea varies in different

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next in order after Latium is Campania, which extends

along the [Tyrrhenian] Sea; above it is Samnium, in the

interior, extending as far as the Frentani and Daunii; and

beyond are the Daunii, and the other nations as far as the

Strait of Sicily. We shall in the first place speak of Campania. From Sinuessa<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Monte Dragone.</note> to Misenum<note anchored="yes">Punta di Miseno.</note> the coast forms a vast

gulf; beyond this is another gulf still larger, which they

name the Crater.<note anchored="yes">The bay of Naples.</note> It is enclosed by the two promontories of

Misenum and the Athenæum.<note anchored="yes">Punta della Campanella.</note> It is along the shores of these

[two gulfs] that the whole of Campania is situated. This

plain is fertile above all others, and entirely surrounded by

fruitful hills and the mountains of the Samnites and Osci.

Antiochus says that this country was formerly inhabited by

the Opici, and that these were called Ausones. Polybius

appears to consider these as two people, for he says that the

Opici and Ausones inhabit the country around the Crater.<note anchored="yes">This passage is not found in the works of Polybius, as handed down to us.</note>

Others, however, state that it was originally inhabited by

Opici and Ausones, but was afterwards seized on by a nation

of the Osci, who were driven out by the Cumæi, and these

again by the Tyrrheni. Thus the possession of the plain was

much disputed on account of its great fertility. [They add

that the Tyrrheni] built there twelve cities, and named the

metropolis Capua. But luxury having made them effeminate,

in the same way that they had formerly been driven from the

banks of the Po, they were now forced to abandon this

country to the Samnites; who in their turn fell before the

Romans. One proof of the fertility of this country is, that it

produces the finest corn. I allude to the grain from which a

groat is made superior to all kinds of rice, and to almost all other

farinacious food. They say that some of the plains are cropped all the year round; twice with rye, the third time with



<pb n="361"/>



panic, and occasionally a fourth time with vegetables. It is

likewise from hence that the Romans procure their finest

wines, the Falernian, the Statanian, and the Calenian. That

of Surrentum<note anchored="yes">Sorrento.</note> is now esteemed equal to these, it having been

lately discovered that it can be kept to ripen. In addition to

this, the whole country round Venafrum, bordering on the

plains, is rich in olives.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The maritime cities [of Campania], after Sinuessa, are

Liternum,<note anchored="yes">Torre di Patria.</note> where is the sepulchral monument of the first of

the two Scipios, surnamed Africanus; it was here that he

passed the last days of his life, having abandoned public

affairs in disgust at the intrigues of certain opponents. A

river of the same name<note anchored="yes">Liternus.</note> flows by this city. In like manner

the Vulturnus bears the same name as the city<note anchored="yes">Vulturnum.</note> founded

on it, which comes next in order: this river flows through

Venafrum<note anchored="yes">Venafro.</note> and the midst of Campania. After these

[cities] comes Cumæ,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Ku/mh.</foreign> The Greeks gave a singular form to this name of the ancient

seat of the Sibyl. Her chamber, which was hewn out of the solid rock,

to have been founded by the Chalcidenses. At first this

city was highly prosperous, as well as the Phlegræan<note anchored="yes">We may observe that Strabo seems not to have restricted the

which mythology has made the scene of the adventures of the

remain numerous traces of the Grecian taste, their temples,

called from <foreign lang="greek">ta\ ku/mata,</foreign> the waves, the sea-coast near it being

rocky and exposed. These people have excellent fisheries.

On the shores of this gulf there is a scrubby forest, extending

over numerous acres of parched and sandy land. This they

<p>Near to Cumæ is the promontory of Misenum,<note anchored="yes">Punta di Miseno.</note> and

between them is the Acherusian Lake,<note anchored="yes">Lago di Fusaro.</note> which is a muddy estuary of the sea. Having doubled Misenum, you come to

a harbour at the very foot of the promontory. After this the

shore runs inland, forming a deeply indented bay, on which

are Baïæ and the hot springs, much used, both as a fashionable watering-place, and for the cure of diseases. Contiguous

to Baïæ is the Lucrine Lake,<note anchored="yes">Lago Lucrino. This lake has almost disappeared, owing to a subterraneous eruption, which in <date value="1538">1538</date> displaced the water and raised the hill

called Monte Nuovo.</note> and within this the Lake Avernus,<note anchored="yes">Lago d'Averno.</note> which converts into a peninsula the land stretching from

the maritime district, situated between it and Cumæ, as far

as Cape Misenum, for there is only an isthmus of a few stadia,

across which a subterraneous road is cut [from the head of

the gulf of Avernus] to Cumæ and the sea [shore] on which

it stands. Former writers, mingling fable with history, have

applied to Avernus the expressions of Homer in his Invocation of Departed Spirits,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">nhkui=a,</foreign> the title of the 11th book of the Odyssey.</note> and relate that here formerly was

an oracle of the dead,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">nekuomantei=on,</foreign> another title of the same (11th) book.</note> and that it was to this place that

Ulysses came. However, this gulf of Avernus is deep even

near the shore, with an excellent entrance, and is both as

to its size and nature a harbour; but it is not used, on account of the Lucrine Gulf which lies before it, and is both large

and somewhat shallow. The Avernus is surrounded with

steep hills which encompass the whole of it, with the excep-

tion of the entrance. These hills, now so beautifully culti-

vated were formerly covered with wild forests, gigantic and

impenetrable, which overshadowed the gulf, imparting a feeling

of superstitious awe. The inhabitants affirm that birds, flying

believed, in fact, that this place was a Plutonium, around

which the Kimmerians used to dwell, and those who sailed

into the place made sacrifice and propitiatory offerings to the

infernal deities, as they were instructed by the priests who

ministered at the place. There is here a spring of water near

to the sea fit for drinking, from which, however, every one

abstained, as they supposed it to be water from the Styx:

[they thought likewise] that the oracle of the dead was

situated some where here; and the hot springs near to the

Acherusian Lake indicated the proximity of Pyriphlegethon.

Ephorus, peopling this place with Kimmerii, tells us that they

dwell in under-ground habitations, named by them Argillæ, and

that these communicate with one another by means of certain

subterranean passages; and that they conduct strangers

through them to the oracle, which is built far below the surface of the earth. They live on the mines together with the profits accruing from the oracle, and grants made to them by the

king [of the country]. It was a traditional custom for the servants of the oracle never to behold the sun, and only to quit their

caverns at night. It was on this account that the poet said,

At last, however, these men were exterminated by one of the

kings, the oracle having deceived him; but [adds Ephorus]

place. Such were the myths related by our ancestors. But

now that the wood surrounding the Avernus has been cut

down by Agrippa, the lands built upon, and a subterranean

passage cut from Avernus to Cumæ, all these appear fables.

Perhaps<note anchored="yes">The text here appears to have been corrupted.</note> Cocceius, who made this subterranean passage,<note anchored="yes">We agree with Kramer in considering as an interpolation the words,

<p>The Lucrine gulf extends in breadth as far as Baïæ; it

is separated from the sea by a bank eight stadia in length,

and the breadth of a carriage-way; this they say was constructed by Hercules when he drove away the oxen of Geryon.

But as the wave covered its surface in stormy weather, rendering it difficult to pass on foot, Agrippa has repaired it.

Small vessels can put into it, but it is useless as a harbour.<note anchored="yes">Dion Cassius tells us, on the contrary, that owing to the exertions of

It contains abundant oyster-beds. Some take this to be the

Acherusian Lake, while Artemidorus confounds it with Avernus. They say that Baïæ took its name from Baius one of

the companions of Ulysses, and Misenum from Misenus.

Beyond is the strand and city of Dicæarchia. Formerly it

was nothing but a naval station of the Cumæi. It was built

on an eminence. But at the time of the war with Hannibal, the

Romans established a colony there, and changed its name into

Puteoli,<note anchored="yes">Pozzuoli.</note> [an appellation derived] from its wells; or, according to others, from the stench of its waters, the whole district

from hence to Baïæ and Cumæ being full of sulphur, fire, and

hot-springs. Some too are of opinion that it was on this account [that the country about] Cumæ was named Phlegra,

and that the fables of the giants struck down by thunderbolts

owe their origin to these eruptions of fire and water. This

by command of an oracle. In course of time the inhabitants,

having disagreed amongst themselves, admitted certain Campanians; thus being forced to regard in the light of friends

those most inimical to them, since their friends were hostile.

This is proved by the names of their demarchi, the earlier of

which are Grecian, but the latter a mixture of Campanian

with the Grecian names. Many traces of Grecian institution

are still preserved, the gymnasia, the ephebeia,<note anchored="yes">Places of exercise for youth.</note> the fratriæ,<note anchored="yes">Societies.</note> and the Grecian names of people who are Roman citizens.

At the present time they celebrate, every fifth year, public

games for music and gymnastic exercises during many days,

inferior in quality to those at Baïæ, but much less frequented,

for another city has arisen there, not less than Dicæarchia,

one palace after another having been built. Naples still preserves the Grecian mode of life, owing to those who retire

hither from Rome for the sake of repose, after a life of labour

from childhood, and to those whose age or weakness demands

relaxation. Besides these, Romans who find attractions in

the city near to Cremona. It is built on the river Sarno, by

which merchandise is received and exported. Above these

places is Mount Vesuvius, which is covered with very beautiful

fields, excepting its summit, a great part of which is level,

but wholly sterile. It appears ash-coloured to the eye,

cavernous hollows appear formed of blackened stones, looking

as if they had been subjected to the action of fire. From

this we may infer that the place was formerly in a burning

state with live craters, which however became extinguished

on the failing of the fuel. Perhaps this [volcano] may have

been the cause of the fertility of the surrounding country,

the same as occurs in Catana, where they say that that portion which has been covered with ashes thrown up by the

fires of Ætna is most excellent for the vine. The land about

Vesuvius contains fat, and a soil which has been subjected to

fire, and is very strong and productive of fruit: when this

fat superabounds, it is apt, like all sulphurous substances,

to take fire, but being dried up by evaporation, extinguished,

and pulverized, it becomes a productive earth. Adjoining

temple of Minerva, founded by Ulysses. From hence to the

island of Capreas the passage is short; after doubling the

promontory you encounter various desert and rocky little

islands, which are called the Sirenusæ.<note anchored="yes">The Sirenusæ were three small rocks detached from the land, and

celebrated as the islands of the Sirens; they are now called Galli. See

Holsten. Adnot. p. 248; Romanelli, torn. iii. p. 619. Virgil, Æn. v. 864,

It had been decreed that the Sirens should live only till some one hearing

their song should pass on unmoved, and Orpheus, who accompanied the

Argonauts, having surpassed the Sirens, and led on the ship, they cast

themselves into the sea, and were metamorphosed into these rocks.</note> On the side towards

Surrentum there is shown a temple with the ancient offerings

of those who held this place in veneration. Here is the end

of the bay named Crater,<note anchored="yes">The bay of Naples.</note> which is bounded by the two promontories of Misenum<note anchored="yes">Punta di Miseno.</note> and the Athenæum, both looking

towards the south. The whole is adorned by the cities we

have described, by villas, and plantations, so close together

that to the eye they appear but one city.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In front of Misenum lies the island of Prochyta,<note anchored="yes">Procida.</note> which

has been rent from the Pithecussæ.<note anchored="yes">Ischia.</note> Pithecussæ was peopled

by a colony of Eretrians and Chalcidians, which was very

prosperous on account of the fertility of the soil and the productive gold-mines; however, they abandoned the island on

account of civil dissensions, and were ultimately driven out

by earthquakes, and eruptions of fire, sea, and hot waters.

It was on account of these eruptions, to which the island is

subject, that the colonists sent by Hiero,<note anchored="yes">It appears that Hiero the First is here alluded to; he ascended the

throne 478 years before the Christian era.</note> the king of Syracuse,

abandoned the island, together with the town which they

had built, when it was taken possession of by the Neapolitans.

This explains the myth concerning Typhon, who, they say,

lies beneath the island, and when he turns himself, causes

flames and water to rush forth, and sometimes even small

islands to rise in the sea, containing springs of hot water.

Pindar throws more credibility into the myth, by making it

conformable to the actual phenomena, for the whole strait

from Cumæ to Sicily is subigneous, and below the sea has

certain galleries which form a communication between [the

volcanos<note anchored="yes">The volcanos of Sicily, Lipari, Pithecussæ, <emph rend="ital">or</emph> Ischia, and Mount

shows that Ætna is on this account of the nature described

by all, and also the Lipari Islands, with the regions around

Dicæarchia, Neapolis, Baïæ, and the Pithecussæ. And mindful hereof, [Pindar] says that Typhon lies under the whole of

this space.

Timæus,<note anchored="yes">This writer flourished about 264 years before the Christian era.</note> who remarks that many paradoxical accounts were

related by the ancients concerning the Pithecussæ, states,

nevertheless, that a little before his time, Mount Epomeus,<note anchored="yes"><emph rend="ital">Epopeus mons,</emph> now sometimes called Epomeo, but more commonly

Monte San Nicolo.</note> in

the middle of the island, being shaken by an earthquake,

vomited forth fire; and that the land between it and the coast

was driven out into the sea. That the powdered soil, after

being whirled on high, was poured down again upon the

island in a whirlwind. That the sea retired from it to a distance of three stadia, but after remaining so for a short time it

returned, and inundated the island, thus extinguishing the fire.

And that the inhabitants of the continent fled at the noise,

from the sea-coast, into the interior of Campania. It seems

that the hot-springs<note anchored="yes">The waters at the source Olmitello, in the southern part of the island,

are the most efficacious for this disease.</note> here are a remedy for those afflicted with

gravel. Capreæ<note anchored="yes">Capri.</note> anciently possessed two small cities, afterwards but one. The Neapolitans possessed this island, but

Cæsar Augustus, giving him in exchange Capreæ. This

far as Ardea, and afterwards devastating Campania itself,

greatly extended their power. The Campanians, being otherwise accustomed to a despotic government, yielded ready

obedience to their commands. At the present day they have

been almost entirely exterminated by the various Roman

generals, and last of all by Sulla, who was absolute master of

the republic. He, after having by numerous battles extinguished the Italian revolt, observing that the Samnites, almost

without exception, remained in one body, and with one sole

intention, so that they had even marched upon Rome itself,

gave them battle under the walls, and as he had issued orders

to make no prisoners, many of them were cut to pieces on the

field, while the remainder, said to be about three or four

thousand men, who threw down their arms, were led off to

the <emph rend="ital">Villa Publica</emph> in the Campus Martius, and there shut in;

three days after soldiers were sent in who massacred the

whole; and when [Sulla] drew up his conscription list, he

did not rest satisfied until he had destroyed, or driven from

Italy, every one who bore a Samnite name. To those who reproached him for this animosity, he replied that he had learned

by experience that not a single Roman could rest in peace so

long as any of the Samnites survived. Thus their cities have

now dwindled into villages, some indeed being entirely deserted, as Boianum,<note anchored="yes">Bojano.</note> Æsernia,<note anchored="yes">Isernia.</note> Panna, Telesia<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Telesia are to be seen about a mile from the modern

<p>The following is the tradition concerning the [origin

of the] Samnites. The Sabines having been engaged for

a long period in war with the Ombrici, made a vow, common

with some of the Grecian nations, that they would consecrate

to the gods the productions of the year.<note anchored="yes">Casaubon conjectures that in place of the <foreign lang="greek">tw=| e)/tei tou/tw|,</foreign> we should

read <foreign lang="greek">tw=| e)/ari tou/tw,</foreign> or, the productions of the <emph rend="ital">spring:</emph> and it certainly

would seem that Strabo is here describing what the Latins called a <emph rend="ital">ver</emph>

<emph rend="ital">sacrum.</emph> An ancient historian, speaking of the occurrence mentioned by

Strabo, says, <q direct="unspecified">Quondam Sabini fernntur vovisse, si res communis melioribus locis constitisset, se <emph rend="ital">ver sacrum</emph> facturos.</q> Sisenn. Hist. lib. iv. ap. Non. Marcell. De doctor. indag. ed. <date value="1683">1683</date>, fol. 2531. Festus, Sext. P.

Fest. De verb. sign. F. ed. <date value="1699">1699</date>, p. 478, seems to have mentioned the same

thing.</note> They were victorious,

and accordingly of the productions,<note anchored="yes">The animals and fruits are intended.</note> the one kind were sacrificed, the other consecrated. However, in a time of scarcity,

some one remarked, that they ought likewise to have

consecrated the children. This then they did, and the children born at that period were called the sons of Mars.<note anchored="yes">Devoted to Mars.</note> When

these had grown up to manhood, they were sent forth, a bull

leading the way, to found a colony. The bull lay down to

rest in a place belonging to the Opici; a people dwelling in

villages. These they drove out, and established themselves

in the place. The bull, according to the direction of the diviners, they sacrificed to Mars, who had given him to then

as a leader. It seems to have been in allusion to this that

their parents called them by the diminutive form of Sabelli.<note anchored="yes">Or little Sabines.</note>

The name of Samnites, or, as the Greeks call them, Saunites,

originated in another cause. It is also said that certain Lacedæmonians came to dwell amongst them, and that this is the

reason of their affection for the Greeks, and that certain of

them are called Pitanatæ.<note anchored="yes">From Pitane, a place in Laconia.</note> The whole of this, however,

appears to be a mere fabrication of the Tarentini, interested

in flattering and conciliating to themselves a neighbouring

people, so powerful as to be able, on a time, to bring into the

field a force of eighty thousand foot-soldiers, and eight thousand cavalry. There is said to be a law amongst the Samnites, excellent in itself, and calculated to excite to virtue.

It is not lawful for fathers to give away their daughters to

whomsoever they may please; but every year ten of the most

virtuous young women, and ten of the most virtuous young

men, are selected; of these the most excellent young man

is married to the most excellent young woman, the second

to the second, and so on in order. Should he who re-



<pb n="373"/>



ceives this reward, afterwards change and become wicked, he

is dishonoured, and the wife who had been given is taken away

from him. Beyond are the Hirpini, who are also Samnites:

their name they take from the wolf, which conducted their

colony; a wolf being called by the Samnites <emph rend="ital">hirpos:</emph> these

people border on the Leucani in the interior. So much for

the Samnites.

<p>The fertility of their country has been productive to

the Campanians of as much evil as good. Their luxury ran

to such a height, that they would invite to supper, in order to

exhibit pairs of fighting gladiators, the exact number of pairs

being regulated according to the distinction of the guests.

When, on their voluntary submission to Hannibal, they received his soldiers into winter quarters,<note anchored="yes">B. C. <date value="-216">216</date>.</note> the pleasures [of the

and expelled the Chones and Œnotri, and driven the Leucani into this region, while the Greeks possessed the seacoast on both sides as far as the straits, the Greeks and the

Barbarians maintained a lengthened contest. The tyrants of

Sicily, and afterwards the Carthaginians, at one time making

war against the Romans, for the acquisition of Sicily, and at

another, for Italy itself, utterly wasted all these regions. The

Greeks, however, succeeded in depriving the ancient inhabitants of a great portion of the midland country, beginning

even as early as the Trojan war; they increased in power,

versal geography, to speak both of things as they now are,

and of some of those that have been, and especially when they

are important. Of the Leucani, who border upon the Tuscan

Sea, mention has already been made; those who possess

the midland regions dwell above the Gulf of Tarentum,

but these, as well as the Bruttii, and the Samnites themselves, the progenitors of both, have been so maltreated

[by the Romans], that it is difficult to determine the boundaries of each people. The reason of this is, that there no

longer remains separately any of the institutions common to

these nations; and their peculiarities of language, of military

and civil costume, and such particulars, have passed away;

besides, even their places of abode, considered separately and

apart, possess nothing worthy of observation.

neighbours, the Samnites. Petilia<note anchored="yes">It has been well observed by Cramer in his Ancient Italy, that Strabo

confused this Petilia of the Leucani with another better known of the

Bruttii, the foundation of which was attributed to Philoctetes. It is

observed by Antonini that Strabo contradicts himself, by ascribing to

Philoctetes the origin of a town in Leucania, for he states a few lines

further on that that hero occupied a part of the coast near Crotona, which

was in the territory of the Bruttii. Strabo's account, however, of the

existence of a Leucanian Petilia is confirmed by many inscriptions of

early date. The ruins of the town remain on the Monte della Stella.

metropolis of the Leucani, and is still well peopled. It owes

its foundation to Philoctetes, who was compelled to quit Melibœa on account of civil dissensions. Its position is so strong,

that the Samnites were formerly obliged to construct forts

around it for the defence of their territory. The ancient

Crimissa, situated near these places, was also founded by Philoc-

tetes. Apollodorus, in his description of the ships [of the

Greeks], narrates concerning Philoctetes, that, according to

certain writers, this prince having disembarked in the district

of Crotona, settled on the promontory of Crimissa, and built

the city of Chone<note anchored="yes">According to some judicious antiquaries, the site of Chone is located

<p>The Bruttii occupy the remainder of the coast as far as

the Strait of Sicily, extending about <date value="1350">1350</date> stadia. Antiochus,

in his treatise on Italy, says that this district, which he intended to describe, was called Italy, but that previously it had

been called Œnotria. The boundary which he assigns to it

on the Tyrrhenian Sea, is the river Lao,<note anchored="yes">Laos, now Lao.</note> and on the Sea of

Sicily Metapontium, the former of which we have given as

the boundary of the Bruttii. He describes Tarentum, which

is next to Metapontium,<note anchored="yes">Torre di Mare.</note> as beyond Italy, calling it Iapygian.

He also relates that, at a more ancient period, those who dwelt

on this side the isthmus, which lies next the Strait of Sicily,

were the only people who were called Œnotrians and Italians.

The isthmus is 160 stadia across between the two gulfs, namely,

that of Hipponium,<note anchored="yes">Golfo di S. Eufemia.</note> which Antiochus called Napitinus, and



<pb n="380"/>



that of Scylletium.<note anchored="yes">Golfo di Squillace. Scylletium was once a Greek city of note, communicating its name to the gulf. Servius observes that the Athenians

who founded the colony were returning from Africa. There was a Greek

inscription found in <date value="1791">1791</date> relative to the <foreign lang="greek">Lampadhdo|omi/a,</foreign> which seems to

confirm the tradition of the Athenian origin of Scylletium. It was the

birth-place of Cassiodorus.</note> The circumnavigation of the peninsula,

which is comprised between this isthmus and the strait, is 2000

stadia. He says that afterwards the names of Italy and of the

Œnotrians were extended as far as Metapontium and the

Siritis; the Chones, a people of Œnotrian descent, and highly

civilized, inhabited these districts, and called their country

Chone. However, this author has written in a very loose and

old-fashioned manner, without giving any definite boundaries

to the Leucani and Bruttii. Now Leucania is situated on the

Tyrrhenian and Sicilian Seas, extending on one coast from the

Silaro<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Silao|is.</foreign> The Silaro, which divides Lucania from Campania, takes

its rise in the Apennines, in a district which formerly belonged to the

Hirpini; and after receiving the Tanager, now Negro, and the Calor,

now Calore, falls into the Gulf of Salerno. Silius Italicus (viii. 582)

states that this river possessed the property of incrusting twigs with a

calcareous deposit:

between the ancient and modern computation of distance. To rectify

this oversight, he makes choice of Torre del piano del Casale, nearly two

miles north of Torre Loppa, as the locality of this ancient site. The silver

coins of Temesa are scarce. They have the Greek epigraph, TEM.</note> of the Bruttii,

elevated cliff nearly surrounded by the sea. But connected

with the main-land by a low isthmus easily accessible on either

side, which Anaxilaus, the tyrant of Rhegium, fortified against

the Tyrrheni, and formed a commodious haven, and thus prevented the pirates from passing through the strait. Next to

the Scyllæan promontory was that of Cænys, distant from

Medma 250 stadia. It is the last headland, and forms the

narrowest part of the Strait [of Sicily], being opposite to Cape

Pelorus on the Sicilian side, which is one of the three points

which give to that island the form of a triangle. Its aspect

is towards the rising of the sun in summer, whilst that of

Cænys looks towards the west. Indeed they both seem to

have diverged from the general line of coast in order to stand

out opposite each other.<note anchored="yes">According to Pliny, these two promontories were separated by an

interval of twelve stadia, or a mile and a half, which accords with the

statement of Polybius. Thucydides, however, allows about two miles

and a half, which he considers to be the utmost possible distance. Topographers are divided as to the exact point of the Italian coast which

answers to Cape Cænys. The Calabrian geographers say the Punta del

Pezzo, called also Coda del Volpe, in which opinion Cluverius and D'Anville coincide, but Holstenius contends for the Torre del Cavallo, which

the French translators seem to favour. In fact, that may be the narrowest

point, still it does not answer so well to Strabo's description of the figure

p 265). In the Itinerary of Antoninus it is simply termed Columna, but

In the inscription relative to the Via Aquilia, it is called Statua. The

<p>Rhegium<note anchored="yes">Now Reggio, one of the most celebrated and flourishing cities of

Magna Grecia, founded about 696 years B. C. Cato affirms that it was

once in the possession of the Aurunci. The connexion which subsisted

between Rhegium and the Chalcidian colonies in Sicily, induced its inhabitants to take part with the Athenians in their first hostilities against

the Syracusans and Locrians. In the great Sicilian expedition, the Rhegians observed a strict neutrality. While the Athenian fleet was moored

in their roads, they refused to admit the army within their walls, which

therefore encamped near the temple of Diana outside the town. Rhegium subsequently pursued a similar policy, and suffered severely under

tyrants, but the Roman senate at length freed the unfortunate citizens.</note> was founded by certain Chalcidenses, who, as

they say, were decimated as an offering to Apollo in a time

of scarcity, by order of an oracle, and afterwards removed

hither from Delphi, taking with them certain others from home.

As Antiochus says, the Zanclæans sent for the Chalcidenses,

and appointed Antimnestus chief over them. Certain fugitives of the Messenians of Peloponnesus accompanied this

colony, who had been compelled to fly by those who refused

to give satisfaction to the Lacedæmonians for the violation<note anchored="yes">Strabo here alludes to the crime which was perpetrated in the reign

of Teleclus, about 811 years before the Christian era. The division of

to give satisfaction, lasted about 150 years. See book vi. cap. iii. § .3.</note>

of the virgins at Limnæ, whom they had abused when attending the religious festival, and had slain those who assisted

them. However when the fugitives had removed to Macistus,

they sent to the oracle complaining against Apollo and Diana

for suffering these things to happen notwithstanding they so

greatly honoured them, and inquiring how the devoted might

be saved. Apollo commanded to send them with the Chalcidenses to Rhegium, and to be grateful, therefore, to his sister

Diana for that they were not lost but saved, as they should not

be destroyed with their country, which would be annihilated

shortly after by the Spartans.<note anchored="yes">It Was taken by the Lacedæmonians about B. C. <date value="-668">668</date>.</note> They acted in accordance with

that this convulsion had taken place. But now these mouths

being opened, through which the fire is drawn up, and the

ardent masses and water poured out, they say that the land in

the neighbourhood of the Strait of Sicily rarely suffers from

the effects of earthquakes; but formerly all the passages to the

surface being blocked up, the fire which was smouldering beneath the earth, together with the vapour, occasioned terrible

earthquakes, and the regions, being disturbed by the force of

the pent-up winds, sometimes gave way, and being rent received the sea, which flowed in from either side; and thus

were formed both this strait and the sea which surrounds the

other islands in the neighbourhood. For Prochyta<note anchored="yes">Procida.</note> and the

Pithecussæ as well as Capreæ, Leucosia, the Sirenes, and

the Œnotrides, are but so many detached fragments from the

continent, but other islands have risen from the bottom of the

sea, a circumstance which frequently occurs in many places;

for it is more reasonable to think that the islands in the midst

of the sea have been raised up from the bottom, and that those

which lie off headlands and are separated merely by a strait

were broken off from them. Still it is beside our purpose to

investigate thoroughly whether the name were given to the

city for these causes, or whether it were named by the

Samnites from the Latin word regium, which signifies

royal, on account of its importance,<note anchored="yes">It appears from the more ancient coins of Rhegium, that the original

name was RECION. In these the epigraph is REC. RECI. RECINOS, in

of Magna Grecia displayed the same energy, the ambitious views of this

forces on the Elleporus, now Callipari, they succumbed, and Rhegium,

French translation proposes to read 100 instead of 50 stadia. Topographers are not agreed in fixing the situation of the celebrated Leucopetra.

D'Anville places it at Capo Pittaro, Grimaldi at the Punta della Saetta,

and Cluverius, Holstenius, and Cellarius at the Capo dell' Armi. This latter

opinion seems more compatible with the statement of Pliny, and is also

more generally accredited.</note>

Further on is Heraclæum.<note anchored="yes">The Herculeum Promontorium is known in modern geography as

Capo Spartivento.</note> It is the last promontory, and

looks towards the south; for presently on doubling it the

course takes a south-western direction as far as the promon-

tory of Iapygia,<note anchored="yes">The Promontorium Iapygium, or Sallentinum, as it was sometimes

called, formed a remarkable feature in the figure of Italy, while the art

of navigation was in its infancy. It was a conspicuous land-mark to

mariners bound from the ports of Greece to Sicily. The fleets of Athens,

after having circumnavigated the Peloponnesus, usually made for Corcyra,

whence they steered straight across to the promontory, and then coasted

along the south of Italy. It seems from Thucydides (vi. 44) that there

was a haven here which afforded a shelter to vessels in tempestuous

weather.</note> then it runs towards the north more and

more, and towards the west along the Ionian gulf. After the

Herculeum Promontorium is the head-land of Locris, which

is called Zephyrium,<note anchored="yes">Now Capo di Bruzzano.</note> possessing a haven exposed to the west

winds, whence is derived its name. Then is the state of the

Locri Epizephyrii, a colony of Locrians transported by Evanthes from the Crissæan gulf, shortly after the foundation of

Crotona and Syracuse.<note anchored="yes">The one 710, the other 734 years B. C.</note> Ephorus was not correct in stating



<pb n="389"/>



that they were a colony of the Locri Opuntii.<note anchored="yes">The opinion of Ephorus seems to be supported by many other writers,

and is generally preferred by modern critics.</note> They remained

at first during three or four years at Cape Zephyrium; afterwards they removed their city, with the assistance of certain

Syracusans who dwelt amongst them. There is also a fountain called Locria in the place where the Locri first took up

their abode. From Rhegium to the Locri there are 600 stadia.

The city is built on a height, which they call Esopis.<note anchored="yes">Monte Esope.</note>

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Locri are believed to have been the first who committed their laws to writing, but after they had enjoyed the

advantage of these good laws for a very considerable time,

Dionysius [the younger], having been expelled<note anchored="yes">This wicked prince, having been expelled from Syracuse, had found

refuge among the Locrians from the storm which threatened his existence,

but, depraved as he was degraded, he repaid the kindness of the people,

who treated him as their kinsman because his mother Doris had been

the daughter of one of their principal citizens, with the basest treachery

and ingratitude. He introduced into their city a number of miscreants

and having overpowered the inhabitants, gave loose to all the vicious propenalties of his nature.</note> from Syracuse,

found means to abuse them in a most abominable manner, for

he, entering into a private chamber where certain young brides

had been adorned for their nuptials, violated them; he also

gathered the most beautiful virgins to his revels, and having

liberated doves with uncut wings, commanded the young

women to chase them round the apartment in a state of perfect

nudity, while on some he bound sandals of unequal height,

one being high and the other low, in order to make their

appearance in the pursuit the more unseemly. However he

paid dearly for this, for having returned to Sicily to resume

his government, the Locri overpowered the guard he had left

in their city, freed themselves, and obtained possession of his

wife and children; there were two of his daughters, and his

second son who had already attained the age of manhood; the

eldest, however, called Apollocrates, accompanied his father

in the expedition. And although Dionysius himself entreated

them earnestly, as did also the Tarentines, to deliver the

prisoners for whatever ransom they should name, they remained inexorable, and endured a siege and the wasting of

their country, that they might vent their rage on his daughters. After having exposed them to the most shameful out-



<pb n="390"/>



rages, they strangled them, burnt their bodies, pounded their

bones, and cast them into the sea.<note anchored="yes">Horrid as is the vengeance which the Locri took on these unfortunate

victims of a husband's and a father's crimes, it serves to confirm the

accounts of the iniquity and barbarity of a prince, whose mean and imbecile conduct at other times sanctions the notion that his intellect was

disordered.</note> Ephorus in speaking of

the written law of the Locri, which Zaleucus had most

judiciously selected from the Cretan, Lacedæmonian, and

Areopagite codes, says that Zaleucus was the first to establish

this principle, that whereas formerly lawgivers had left it to

the judges to award the punishments for the several offences,

he established a certain penalty in his laws, thinking that the

minds of the judges would not be led to attach the same penalties for the same transgressions, which course he considered

expedient. He praises him also for having simplified the

law of contracts. [He says also] that the Thurians, being

desirous to improve [the code of Zaleucus] more than the

Locri had done, became more celebrated, but were less judicious.<note anchored="yes">We could almost wish to read this passage—<q direct="unspecified">rendered them more

plausible, but impaired their utility.</q></note> For that state is not regulated by the best government, where they guard against all manner of deceit by their

laws, but that wherein they abide by laws simply framed.

Plato also has observed that where there are many laws,

there there will be law-suits and evil lives, in the same way

as, where there are many physicians, there it is likely there is

much sickness.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is a certain singular circumstance, respecting

grasshoppers, worthy of note. The river Alece<note anchored="yes">The ancient Halex.</note> divides

Rhegium from Locris, flowing through a deep ravine; those

which are in the territory of the Locrians sing, but those on

the other side are silent; and it is thought probable that this

is caused by the region being woody, and their membranes

being softened by dew do not produce sound; but those on the

Locrian side being sunned, are dry and horny, so that the

sound is easily produced by them. The statue of Eunomus

the harper having a grasshopper seated on his harp is shown

at Locri. Timæus says, that this Eunomus was once contending at the Pythian games and disputed with Aristo of Rhegium for the prize, and that Aristo declared that the people



<pb n="391"/>



of Delphi ought to take part with him, because his ancestors

were consecrated to the god, and sent out to found the colony;

but Eunomus said that they could have no claim to contend

for melody with any one, because that among them even the

grasshoppers, who are the most gifted of all creatures, were

mute. Nevertheless Aristo was applauded, and had hopes of

obtaining the victory, but Eunomus was declared victorious,

and dedicated the said statue in his country, because that at

the contest one of the chords of his harp having broken, a

grasshopper taking his stand on it supplied the sound. Above

these towns the Bruttii possess the interior, and there is the

city Mamertium,<note anchored="yes">Although Strabo ascribes Mamertium to the Bruttii, it is more probable that it was a colony of Campanian mercenaries, deriving their name

from Mamers, the Oscan Mars, who served under Agathocles, and other

princes of Sicily. The Mamertini were employed by the Romans against

Pyrrhus, whom they attacked in the woods and defiles about Rhegium.

Barrio (lib. ii. c. 10) and Maraf. (lib. iii. c. 25, f. 222) have identified

the site of this ancient town with Martorano, but it seems too distant

from Locri and Rhegium to accord with Strabo's description. Cluverius,

D'Anville, and Romanelli place it at Oppido, a bishop's see above Reggio,

and Gerace, where old coins are said to have been discovered. Cramer

(vol. ii. p. 439) thinks that the Melæ mentioned by Thucydides may have

been identical with Mamertium. Several remains of antiquity exist on

the site called Mela, in the vicinity of Oppido.</note> and the forest which they call Sila, which

produces the best or Bruttian pitch.<note anchored="yes">The pix Bruttia is noticed by Pliny, Columella, Dioscorides, and

other authorities mentioned by Bochart, Canaan, p. 595. Bochart looks

upon the Bruttii as a people known to the Phoenicians at a very remote

period.</note> It yields fine trees, and

Nieto.<note anchored="yes">Neæthus. This river was said to derive its name from the circumstance of the captive Trojan women having there set fire to the Grecian

had wandered from the fleet which had besieged Troy, having

arrived in this place, disembarked to take a survey of the

country, and that the Trojan women who accompanied them

in the fleet, having observed the absence of the men, and

being wearied with a toilsome voyage, set fire to the fleet, so

that they were compelled to abide, when they saw, in addition

 [to the loss of their ships], that the soil was very fertile.

Many others arriving soon after, and being desirous to live

near their fellow-countrymen, founded several settlements.

Most of them derived their names from the Trojans, and the

river Nieto received its appellation from the destruction<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Ne/aiqos,</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">nh=as</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ai)qei=n,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">to burn the ships.</q></note> [of

to view the place, and having seen Sybaris already built on a

neighbouring river of the same name, thought it better, and

returned to the god to ask if he might be permitted to settle

in that, instead of the other; but that the oracle answered, applying to him an epithet noticing his defective stature, (for

the saying arose that the last wrestler of Crotona was the first

a place which had something to show, in the number of wrestlers which it produced, as a proof of its salubrity and the robust frame of body which it was capable of rearing. Thus it

strayed considerably out of the path, when finding a great log

with wedges in it, he thrust both his hands and feet into the

the Samnites.<note anchored="yes">The Greek words might either mean that Metapontium was destroyed

or that the sacrifices were abolished. From the succeeding sentence it

would be most natural to suppose that Strabo meant to say the city was

overthrown.</note> Antiochus says that certain Achæans, who

had been sent for by the Achæans of Sybaris, settled in this

place when it had been desolated; he adds that these were

sent for on account of the hatred of the Achæans to the Tarentini, who had originally migrated from Laconia, in order

to prevent their seizing upon the place which lay adjacent to

them. Of the two cities, viz. Metapontium which was situated

the nearer, [and Siris the further,<note anchored="yes">These words are not in the Greek text, but seem to have been accidentally omitted by the transcriber.</note>] from Tarentum, the new

comers preferred to occupy Metapontium. This choice was

suggested by the Sybarites, because, if they should make good

their settlement there, they would also possess Siris, but if

they were to turn to Siris, Metapontium would be annexed

to the territory of the Tarentines which was conterminous.

But after being engaged in war with the Tarentini and the

Œnotrians, who dwelt beyond them, they came to an agreement, securing to them a portion of land, which should constitute the boundary between Italy, as it then existed, and

Iapygia. This, too, is the locality which tradition assigns to

the adventures of Metapontus and the captive Melanippe, and

her son Bœotus. But Antiochus is of opinion that the city

Metapontium was originally called Metabum, and that its

name was altered at a subsequent period; and that Melanippe

was not entertained here but at Dius, and thinks that the

heroum of Metabus as well as the testimony of the poet Asius,

who says that



<quote><lg>

<l>The beautiful Melanippe, in the halls of Dius, bare Bœotus,</l></lg></quote>



afford sufficient proof that Melanippe was led to Dius and not

to Metabum. Ephorus says that Daulius, the tyrant of Crissa<note anchored="yes">A city of Phocis, now Krisso.</note>

near Delphi, was the founder of Metapontium. There is,

however, another tradition, that Leucippus was sent by the

Achæans to help to found the colony, and having asked permission of the Tarentini to have the place for a day and a

night, would not give it up, replying by day to those who



<pb n="400"/>



asked it of him, that he had asked and obtained it till the following night, and when asked by night, he said that he held

it till the coming day.

Pachynus to the east. We however consider that of necessity

all climata are set out in the manner of a parallelogram, but

that districts portrayed as triangles, and especially such triangles as are scalene,<note anchored="yes">i. e. wherein all three sides are unequal.</note> and whereof no one side lies parallel

to a side of the parallelogram, cannot in any way be assimilated to climata on account of their obliquity. However, we

must allow, that in treating of Sicily, Pelorias, which lies to

the south of Italy, may well be called the most northern of

the three angles, so that we say that the line which joins it<note anchored="yes">i. e. Pelorias.</note>

preceded him were so terrified by the piratical customs of

the Tyrrheni, and the ferocity of the savages of the neighbourhood, that they did not even venture to resort thither for

the purposes of commerce. Theocles the Athenian, however,

having been driven to Sicily by storms, observed both the

weakness of the inhabitants and the excellence of the soil.

On his return home, he was unable to persuade the Athenians

to make any attempt, but he collected a numerous band of

Chalcidians in Eubœa, with some Ionians and Dorians, whereof

the most part were Megarenses, and sailed. The Chalcidians

founded Naxos, and the Dorians Megara, which was at first

called Hybla. These cities no longer exist, but the name of

Hybla survives on account of the Hyblæan honey.

where the Arethusa rises and flows into the sea. Some such

proofs as these are given in .upport of the fact. A certain

chalice having fallen into the river at Olympia was cast up

by the springs of Arethusa; the fountain too is troubled by

the sacrifices of oxen at Olympia. And Pindar, following

such reports, thus sings,

Timæus<note anchored="yes">Conf. Antig. Caryst. Hist. Min. cap. 155.</note> the historian advances these accounts in like manner with Pindar. Undoubtedly if before reaching the sea

the Alpheus were to fall into some chasm,<note anchored="yes">According to Strabo himself, book viii. chap. 3, § 12, the Alpheus

flows through a subterraneous course before it comes to Olympia; the

objection therefore which he here takes, rests only on the circumstance

of the river pursuing a visible course all the way to the sea, from the

point where the chalice had fallen into it.</note> there would be a

probability that it continued its course from thence to Sicily,

preserving its potable water unmixed with the sea; but since

the mouth of the river manifestly falls into the sea, and there

does not appear any opening in the bed of the sea there, which

would be capable of imbibing the waters of the river, (although

even if there were they could not remain perfectly fresh, still

it might be possible to retain much of the character of fresh

water, if they were presently to be swallowed down into a

passage running below the earth which forms the bed of the

sea,) it is altogether impossible; and this the water of Arethusa clearly proves, being perfectly fit for beverage; but



<pb n="410"/>



that the flow of the river should remain compact through so

long a course, not mixing with the sea until it should fall

into the fancied channel, is entirely visionary; for we can

scarcely credit it of the Rhone, the body of the waters of which

remains compact during its passage through the lake, and

preserves a visible course, but in that instance both the distance is short and the lake is not agitated by waves like the

sea, but in this case of the Alpheus,<note anchored="yes">A river of Elis.</note> where there are great

storms and the waters are tossed with violence, the supposition is by no means worthy of attention. The fable of the

chalice being carried over is likewise a mere fabrication, for

it is not calculated for transfer, nor is it by any means probable it should be washed away so far, nor yet by such diffi-

cult passages. Many rivers, however, and in many parts of

the world, flow beneath the earth, but none for so great a

distance.—Still, although there may be no impossibility in

this circumstance, yet the above-mentioned accounts are altogether impossible, and almost as absurd as the fable related

of the Inachus: this river, as Sophocles<note anchored="yes">The play from which this is quoted is not extant.</note> feigns,

Those who would have the river Inopus to be a branch of

the Nile flowing to Delos, exaggerate this kind of marvel to

the utmost. Zoïlus the rhetorician, in his Eulogium of the

people of Tenedos, says that the river Alpheus flows from

Tenedos: yet this is the man who blames Homer for fabulous

writing. Ibycus also says that the Asopus, a river of Sicyon,<note anchored="yes">In the Peloponnesus.</note>

flows from Phrygia. Hecatæus is more rational, who says

that the Inachus of the Amphilochi, which flows from Mount

Lacmus, from whence also the Æas<note anchored="yes">The Lao or the Pollina.</note> descends, was distinct

from the river of like name in Argolis, and was so named after

possession both of the hills and the most part of the plains,

have given them over to horse-breeders, herdsmen, and shepherds, by whom the island has frequently been brought into

great perils. First of all the shepherds, taking to pillage here

and there in different places, and afterwards assembling in

numbers and forcibly taking settlements; for instance, as

those under the command of Eunus<note anchored="yes">About <date value="-134">134</date> B. C.</note> seized upon Enna.<note anchored="yes">Castro-Ioanni.</note> And

quite recently, during the time that we were at Rome, a certain Selurus, called the son of Ætna, was sent up to that city.

He had been the captain of a band of robbers, and had for a

long time infested the country round Ætna, committing frequent depredations. We saw him torn to pieces by wild beasts

in the forum after a contest of gladiators: he had been set

upon a platform fashioned to represent Mount Ætna, which

being suddenly unfastened and falling, he was precipitated

amongst certain cages of wild beasts, which had also been

slightly constructed under the platform for the occasion.

<p>The fertility of the country is so generally extolled by

every one, as nothing inferior to Italy, that there is a question as to what we should say of it. Indeed, for wheat,

honey, saffron, and some other commodities, it even surpasses

that country. In addition to this, its proximity renders the

island like a part of Italy itself, so that it supplies the Roman

market with produce both commodiously and without trouble.

Indeed they call it the granary of Rome, for all the produce

of the island is carried thither, except a few things required

for home consumption. It consists not only of the fruits of

the earth, but of cattle, skins, wool, and the like. Posidonius

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Near to Centoripa is the town we have a little before

mentioned, Ætna, which serves as a place for travellers about

to ascend Mount Ætna, to halt and refresh themselves for the

expedition. For here commences the region in which is situated the summit of the mountain. The districts above are barren

and covered with ashes, which are surmounted by the snows in

winter: all below it however is filled with woods and plantations of all kinds. It seems that the summits of the mountain

take many changes by the ravages of the fire, which sometimes

is brought together into one crater, and at another is divided;

at one time again it heaves forth streams of lava, and at another flames and thick smoke: at other times again ejecting

red-hot masses of fire-stone. In such violent commotions as

these the subterraneous passages must necessarily undergo a

corresponding change, and at times the orifices on the surface

around be considerably increased. Some who have very recently ascended the mountain, reported<note anchored="yes">The French translators infer from this passage that Strabo had never

visited Sicily.</note> to us, that they found

at the top an even plain of about 20 stadia in circumference,

enclosed by an overhanging ridge of ashes about the height of

a wall, so that those who are desirous of proceeding further

are obliged to leap down into the plain. They noticed in the

midst of it a mound; it was ash-coloured, as was likewise the

plain in appearance. Above the mound a column of cloud

reared itself in a perpendicular line to the height of 200 stadia,

and remained motionless (there being no air stirring at the

time); it resembled smoke. Two of the party resolutely attempted to proceed further across this plain, but, finding the

sand very hot and sinking very deep in it, they turned back,

without however being able to make any more particular observations, as to what we have described, than those who beheld from a greater distance. They were, however, of opinion,

from the observations they were able to make, that much exaggeration pervades the accounts we have of the volcano, and

especially the tale about Empedocles, that he leaped into the

crater, and left as a vestige of his folly one of the brazen

sandals which he wore, it being found outside at a short distance from the lip of the crater, with the appearance of having

been cast up by the violence of the flame; for neither is the

place approachable nor even visible, nor yet was it likely that

any thing could be cast in thither, on account of the contrary

current of the vapours and other matters cast up from the

lower parts of the mountain, and also on account of the overpowering excess of heat, which would most likely meet any

one long before approaching the mouth of the crater; and if

eventually any thing should be cast down, it would be totally

decomposed before it were cast up again, what manner of

form so ever it might have had at first. And again, although

it is not unreasonable to suppose that the force of the vapour

and fire is occasionally slackened for want of a continual supply

of fuel, still we are not to conclude that it is ever possible for

a man to approach it in the presence of so great an opposing

power. Ætna more especially commands the shore along the

Strait and Catana, but it also overlooks the sea that washes

Tyrrhenia and the Lipari Islands. By night a glowing light

appears on its summit, but in the day-time it is enveloped with

smoke and thick darkness.

craters. [Thermessa] is, as it were, situated between this

and Sicily; it is now designated as Hiera, or sacred to

Vulcan; it is entirely rocky, and desert, and volcanic. In

it are three craters, and the flames which issue from the

largest are accompanied with burning masses of lava, which

have already obstructed a considerable portion of the strait

[between Thermessa and the island Lipari]; repeated observations have led to the belief that the flames of the volcanos,

both in this island and at Mount Ætna, are stimulated by the

winds<note anchored="yes">See Humboldt, Cosm. i. 242.</note> as they rise; and when the winds are lulled, the flames

also subside; nor is this without reason, for if the winds are

both originally produced and kept up by the vapours arising

from the sea, those who witness these phenomena will not be

surprised, if the fire should be excited in some such way, by

the like aliment and circumstances. Polybius tells us that one

of the three craters of the island has partly fallen down, while

the larger of the two that remain has a lip, the circumference

of which is five stadia, and the diameter nearly 50 feet,<note anchored="yes">This is 30 feet in the epitome.</note> and

its elevation about a stadium from the level of the sea, which

may be seen at the base in calm weather; but if we are to

credit this, we may as well attend to what has been reported

concerning Empedocles. [Polybius] also says, that <q direct="unspecified">when

the south wind is to blow, a thick cloud lies stretched round

the island, so that one cannot see even as far as Sicily in the

distance; but when there is to be a north wind, the clear

flames ascend to a great height above the said crater, and great

rumblings are heard; while for the west wind effects are produced about half way between these two. The other craters

are similarly affected, but their exhalations are not so violent.

Indeed, it is possible to foretell what wind will blow three

days beforehand, from the degree of intensity of the rumbling,

and also from the part whence the exhalations, flames, and

smoky blazes issue. It is said indeed that some of the inhabitants of the Lipari Islands, at times when there has been

so great a calm that no ship could sail out of port, have pre-

dieted what wind would blow, and have not been mistaken.</q>

<p>We have noticed the islands of Lipari and Thermessa.

As for Strongyle,<note anchored="yes">Stromboli.</note> it takes its name from its form.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">stroggu/los</foreign> means <q direct="unspecified">round.</q> M. Dolomieu, p. 113, says that the

island of Stromboli, seen from a distance, appears like a cone; when,

however, it is more particularly examined, it looks like a mountain

terminated by two peaks of different heights, and the sides appear disturbed and torn by craters opened in various parts, and streams of lava

which have flowed down. It might be about 12 miles in circumference.</note> Like

the other two, it is subigneous, but is deficient in the force

of the flames which are emitted, while their brightness is

greater. It is here they say that Æolus resided.<note anchored="yes">Most of the ancient authors agree in considering Lipari as the residence of &amp; Æolus. See Cluver. Sic. Ant. lib. ii. cap. 14.</note> The

fourth is Didyma; this island also is named from its

form.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">di/dumos,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">double.</q> Cluverius identifies this with the island now

called Salini. M. Dolomieu says that Didyma is situated to the west of

Lipari; it is nearly circular, and contains three mountains placed so as

to form a triangle. Two of the mountains are connected at their bases,

the third is separated from them by a valley which runs right across the

island, so that while sailing at some distance in the sea on the south side

it has the appearance of two islands, from which circumstance it took its

ancient name of Didyma: its present name, Salini, is derived from salt

works there.</note> Of the others, [the fifth and sixth] are Ericus-

Bianca, to the east of Lipari, but M. le commandeur Dolomieu, Voyage

pittoresqne de Naples et de Sicile, tom. iv. part ii. chap. 14, considers

that it corresponded with the present Panaria, which is about eight

times the circumference of Lisca-Bianca. He says the neighbouring

islets are but the detached portions of a vast crater now submerged;

the denomination, Formocoli or the Little Ants, is aptly illustrative of

their minuteness and numbers. The most important are Datolo, Lisca-

Nera, Lisca-Bianca, and Basiluzzo. M. Gossellin very justly remarks

that it is quite possible the volcanos, which continually burn in the

islands of Æolus, may have formed some new one, and gives some good

reasons for identifying Didyma with Panaria.</note> it is the farthest in the sea and

barren. It is called Euonymus because it lies the most to the left

when you sail from the island of Lipari to Sicily,<note anchored="yes">Rich. Pocock, Descr. de I' Or., &amp;c. vers. Fr. part iii. chap. 24, tom.

vi. p. 327, considers that Strabo meant to say that Euonymus lies most

to the left hand as you sail from Sicily to the island of Lipari, and proposes Ustica, the westernmost of the Lipari Islands, as its modern representative.</note> and many

times flames of fire have been seen to rise to the surface, and

play upon the sea round the islands: these flames rush with

violence from the cavities at the bottom of the sea,<note anchored="yes">See Humboldt, Cosmos ii. 557.</note> and force

for themselves a passage to the open air. Posidonius says,

that at a time so recent as to be almost within his recollection, about the summer solstice and at break of day, between

Hiera and Euonymus, the sea was observed to be suddenly

raised aloft, and to abide some time raised in a compact mass

and then to subside. Some ventured to approach that part in

their ships; they observed the fish dead and driven by the current, but being distressed by the heat and foul smell, were compelled to turn back. One of the boats which had approached

nearest lost some of her crew, and was scarcely able to reach

Lipari with the rest, and they had fits like an epileptic person, at one time fainting and giddy, and at another returning to their senses; and many days afterwards a mud or clay

was observed rising in the sea, and in many parts the flames

from thence to Sicily 19, while from Strongyle are 16.<note anchored="yes">From Ericodes, now Alicudi, to Phœnicodes, now Felicudi, the

distance given by the chorographer is the same as that set down by

Ptolemy, and by far too much for that which, according to our charts,

separates Felicudi from Salini, but tallies exactly with that to the island

Panaria, so that the evidence, both of the chorographer and Ptolemy,

seems to point to Panaria, not to Salini, as the ancient Didyma. Further, the 29 miles given in Strabo's text as the distance from Didyma

to Lipari, are reduced to 19 miles in the chart of Ptolemy, and even this

last distance would be much too great for the interval which separates

Salini from Lipari, but agrees with the distance from Lipari to Panaria,

and seems likewise to confirm the identity of Panaria and Didyma. The

19 miles, from Lipari to Sicily, agree with Ptolemy and our charts.

Ptolemy gives the equivalent of 44 miles as the distance between Sicily

and Strongyle, while our modern maps confirm his computation. M.

Gossellin observes that the 16 miles of the existing text of Strabo must

be a transcriber's error; but the construction of the text might very well

allow the distance to be from Didyma to Strongyle, which would be

nearly correct.</note> Melita<note anchored="yes">Malta.</note> lies before<note anchored="yes">Towards Africa and the south.</note> Pachynus; from thence come the little dogs called Maltese;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Melitwi=a.</foreign></note> so does also Gaudus,<note anchored="yes">All other classic authors, both Greek and Latin, give the name of

Daunii<note anchored="yes">A note in the French translation remarks, that Strabo would have

done well to add, <q direct="unspecified"><emph rend="ital">and also the Apuli properly so called.</emph></q> If we follow

Strabo's testimony solely, we may almost describe the bounds of the

Peucetii by four lines, viz. 1. From Tarentum to Brindisi. 2. Along the

sea-shore from Brindisi to Bari. 3. From Bari to Garagnone or Gorgoglione, the ancient Sylvium, if not even still nearer to Venosa. 4. From

Garagnone to Tarentum, constituting what is called in modern geography

Terra di Bari.–The following are the limits of the Dannii. 1. From Garagnone to Bari. 2. From Bari to Peschici or to Rodi. 3. Thence to

Lucera; and, 4 from Lucera to Garagnone. Thus they occupied a

great part of La Puglia, with a portion of the Terra di Bari. With regard to those who, according to Strabo, were properly Apuli, they extended from the neighbourhood of Lucera to Rodi or Peschici, thence to

the mouth of the river Fortore, thence to Civitate, (the ancient Teanum

Apulum,) which was included, and from Civitate to Lucera; this district

would answer to the northern portion of La Puglia, which the Fortore

separates from La Capitanata.</note> in the Greek language, but the inhabitants call

the whole region beyond the Calabri, Apulia. Some of

these people are called Pœdicli,<note anchored="yes">The name of Pœdiculi was given to the inhabitants of that portion

The course to it by sea runs in an easterly direction. The

Gulf of Tarentum is for the most part destitute of a port,

but here there is a spacious and commodious [harbour<note anchored="yes">Mare-piccolo.</note>],

closed in by a great bridge. It is 100 stadia<note anchored="yes">Or twelve miles and a half. This computation does not agree with

modern measurements, which reckon the circuit at sixteen miles. See

This port, at the head of its basin which recedes most inland,

forms, with the exterior sea, an isthmus which connects the

peninsula with the land. The city is situated upon this peninsula. The neck of land is so low that ships are easily

hauled over it from either side. The site of the city likewise

is extremely low; the ground, however, rises slightly towards

the citadel. The old wall of the city has an immense circuit,

but now the portion towards the isthmus is deserted, but that

standing near the mouth of the harbour, where the citadel is

situated, still subsists, and contains a considerable city. It

possesses a noble gymnasium and a spacious forum, in which

there is set up a brazen colossus of Jupiter, the largest that

ever was, with the exception of that of Rhodes. The citadel

is situated between the forum and the entrance of the harbour,

<p>Ephorus gives the following account of the foundation.

The Lacedæmonians waged war against the Messenians, who

had murdered their king, Teleclus,<note anchored="yes">About <date value="-745">745</date> B. C.</note> when he visited Messene

to offer sacrifice. They took an oath that they would not return home before they had destroyed Messene, or should be



<pb n="426"/>



all slain. They left only the youngest and oldest of the citi-

zens to keep their own country. After this, in the tenth

[year] of the war, the Lacedæmonian matrons assembled and

deputed certain women to remonstrate with the citizens, and

show them that they were carrying on the war with the Messenians on very disadvantageous terms, for they, abiding in

their own country, procreated children, while the Lacedæmonians, leaving their wives in a state like widowhood, remained

away in the war; and to expose the great peril there was of

the depopulation of their country. The Lacedæmonians,

being both desirous of observing their oath, and taking into

consideration the representations of their wives, sent a deputation of the most vigorous, and, at the same time, most juvenile

of the army, whom they considered, in a manner, not to have

participated in the oath, because they had been but children

when they accompanied their elders to the war, and charged

them all to company with all the maidens, reckoning that by

that means they would bear the more children; which having

been accordingly obeyed, the children who were born were

denominated Partheniæ. Messene was taken after a war of

nineteen years, as Tyrtæus says,



<quote><lg>

<l>The fathers of our fathers, armed for war,

</p><p>Thus then did they destroy Messenia, but returning home,

they neglected to honour the Partheniæ like other youths, and

treated them as though they had been born out of wedlock.

The Partheniæ, leaguing with the Helots, conspired against

the Lacedæmonians, and agreed to raise a Laconic felt hat<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">pi=los Lakwniko/s.</foreign></note> in

the market-place as a signal for the commencement of hostilities. Some of the Helots betrayed the plot, but the

government found it difficult to resist them by force, for they

were many, and all unanimous, and looked upon each other

as brothers; those in authority therefore commanded such as

were appointed to raise the signal, to depart out of the

market-place; when they therefore perceived that their plot



<pb n="427"/>



was disclosed they desisted, and the Lacedæmonians persuaded them, through the instrumentality of their fathers, to

leave the country and colonize: and advised them, if they

should get possession of a convenient place, to abide in it, but

if not, they promised that a fifth part of Messenia should be

divided amongst them on their return. So they departed and

found the Greeks carrying on hostilities against the barbarians, and taking part in the perils of the war, they obtained

possession of Tarentum, which they colonized.

<p>At one time, when the government of the Tarentines

had assumed a democratic form, they rose to great importance;

3000 horse, exclusive of a select body of 1000 cavalry called

legend runs, that when Hercules drove out the last of the

Tarentum to Brentesium is like a peninsula. The road by

land from Brentesium to Tarentum is but a day's journey for

a light person on foot, it constitutes the isthmus of the said

peninsula, which people in general call Messapia, lapygia,

Calabria, or Salentinum, without being at all particular; but

some, as we have said before, do make a distinction. Thus

saying that they did not abide there, but went thence to Bottiæa. At a later period, when the state was under the government of a monarch, it lost a large portion of its territories,

which was taken by the Lacedæmonians who came over under

Phalanthus; notwithstanding this the Brundusians received

him when he was expelled from Tarentum, and honoured him

with a splendid tomb at his death. They possess a district

of superior fertility to that of the Tarentines; for its soil is

light, still it is fruitful, and its honey and wools are amongst

the most esteemed; further, the harbour of Brentesium is superior to that of Tarentum, for many havens are protected by

the single entrance,<note anchored="yes">Great changes have taken place in this locality since Strabo's description was drawn.</note> and rendered perfectly smooth, many

in fashion the antlers of a stag, whence its name, for the

place, together with the city, is exceedingly like the head of

a stag, and in the Messapian language the stag's head is called

Brentesium; while the port of Tarentum is not entirely safe,

both on account of its lying very open, and of certain shallows near its head.

<p>Further, the course for passengers from Greece and

Asia is most direct to Brentesium, and in fact all who are

journeying to Rome disembark here. Hence there are two

ways to Rome; one, which is only walked by mules, through

the Peucetii, who are called Pœdicli, the Daunii, and the

Samnites, as far as Beneventum, on which road is the city

Livy records the defeat of the Roman forces at this place in two successive years. Hannibal removed the inhabitants and fired the town,

(Livy xxvii. 1,) but it was subsequently repaired, and is noticed by

Frontinus as Ardona. Ptolemy and Silius Italicus, viii. 568, mention it

as Herdonia—

The course up the river to the emporium is 90 [stadia]. Near

Canusium and Argyrippa, are situated at no great distance from

the sea, and in the midst of a plain; at one time they were

the most important cities of the Greeks of Italy, as is manifest

from the circumference of their walls, but now they have

fallen off. One of them was originally called Argos Hippium,

then Argyrippa, and then again Arpi. They are said to have

been both founded by Diomed, and both the plain of Diomed

and many other things are shown in these districts as evidence

of his having possessed them. Such were the ancient offerings

in the temple of Minerva, at Luceria.<note anchored="yes">Now Lucera.</note> That was an ancient

city of the Daunii, but now it is of no account. Again, in

the neighbouring sea there are two islands called the Diomedean islands, one of which is inhabited, but the other, they

say, is desert: in the latter it is fabled that Diomed disappeared from the earth, and that his companions were transformed into birds,<note anchored="yes">See book v. c. 1, § 9, p. 320. Ptolemy makes these five which is

the number of the isles of Tremiti at present, if we include in the group

three barren rocks, which scarce deserve the name of islands. One was

called Diomedea by Pliny, and Tremitus by Tacitus, who states that

Augustus appointed it as the prison of his grand-daughter Julia; the

second was called Teutria. The largest is at present called Isola San

and lead a sort of human life, both in respect of food, and

their readiness to approach men of gentle manners, and to

shun the evil and wanton. We have already noticed<note anchored="yes">Book v. c. i. § 9, p. 320.</note> what

is currently reported amongst the Heneti concerning this hero

Manfredonia, as the Garganum Promontorium. Lucan, v. 380, thus

describes its prominence,

All this coast produces everything in great abundance, it is

exceedingly well adapted for horses and sheep, and the wool

is finer than that of Tarentum, but less glossy. The district

is mild on account of the cup-like situation of the plains.

There are some who report that Diomed attempted to cut a

canal to the sea, but being sent for to return home, where he

died, left it incomplete, as well as other undertakings. This

is one account of him: another makes him abide here till the

end of his days; a third is the fable I have already noticed,

calculations, when he made this observation on the length of the Illyrian

among themselves in stating distances, as we often have occasion to remark. Wherever it is possible to discriminate we

set forth what appears to us to be correct, but where it is impossible to come to any safe conclusion we think it our duty

to publish their several assertions. However, when we have

no data furnished by them, it must not be wondered at, if we

should leave some points untouched in treating of such and

so vast a subject as we have undertaken. We would not

indeed omit any of the important particulars, but trifling circumstances, even when they are noted, are of little advantage,

and when taken no heed of, are not missed, nor does their

omission at all impair the whole work, or, if it does, at most

not much.

<p>So great indeed is Italy, and much as we have described

it; we will now advert to the chief of the many things that

have been described, which have conduced to raise the Romans

to so great a height of prosperity. One point is its insular

position, by which it is securely guarded, the seas forming a

natural protection around it with the exception of a very inconsiderable frontier, which too is fortified by almost impassable mountains. A second is, that there are but few

harbours, and those few capacious and admirably situated.

These are of great service both for enterprises against foreign

places, and also in case of invasions undertaken against the

country, and the reception of abundant merchandise. And a

third, that it is situated so as to possess many advantages of

atmosphere and temperature of climate, in which both animals

and plants, and in fact all things available for sustaining life,

may be accommodated with every variety both of mild and

severe temperature; its length stretches in a direction north

and south. Sicily, which is extensive, may be looked upon as

an addition to its length, for we cannot consider it in any other

light than as a part of it. The salubrity or severity of the

atmosphere of different countries, is estimated by the amount

of cold or heat, or the degrees of temperature between those

extremes; in this way we shall find that Italy, which is situated in the medium of both the extremes, and having so great

a length, largely participates in a salubrious atmosphere, and

that in many respects. This advantage is still secured to it

in another way, for the chain of the Apennines extending

through its whole length, and leaving on each side plains and

fruitful hills, there is no district which does not participate in

the advantages of the best productions both of hill and plain.

We must also enumerate the magnitude and number of its

rivers and lakes, and the springs of hot and cold waters supplied by nature in various localities for the restoration of

health; and in addition to these, its great wealth in mines of

all the metals, abundance of timber, and excellent food both

for man and for beasts of all kinds. Italy, likewise, being

situated in the very midst of the greatest nations, I allude to

Greece and the best provinces of Asia, is naturally in a posi-

tion to gain the ascendency, since she excels the circumjacent

countries both in the valour of her population and in extent

of territory, and by being in proximity to them seems to have

been ordained to bring them into subjection without difficulty.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>If, in addition to our description of Italy, a few words

should be summarily added about the Romans who have possessed themselves of it, and prepared it as a centre from

whence to enforce their universal dominion, we would offer

the following.—The Romans, after the foundation of their

state, discreetly existed as a kingdom for many years, till

Tarquin, the last [Roman king], abused his power, when they

expelled him, and established a mixed form of government,

being a modification both of the monarchical and aristocratical systems; they admitted both the Sabines<note anchored="yes">In the year <date value="-747">747</date> B. C.</note> and Latins<note anchored="yes">In the year <date value="-594">594</date> B. C.</note>

into their alliance, but as neither they nor the other neighbouring states continued to act with good faith towards them

at all times, they were under the necessity of aggrandizing

themselves by the dismemberment of their neighbours.<note anchored="yes">The Latins were first subjected in <date value="-499">499</date> B. C., but not totally subjugated; the Sabines were almost annihilated in the war which happened

about <date value="-450">450</date> B. C.</note> Having thus, by degrees, arrived at a state of considerable

importance, it chanced that they lost their city suddenly,

contrary to the expectation of all men, and again recovered

the same contrary to all expectation.<note anchored="yes">See Poly b. Hist. book i. chap. vi. § 1, edit. Schweigh, tom. i. p. 12.</note> This took place, according to Polybius, in the nineteenth year after the naval

clusion of the peace of Antalcidas.<note anchored="yes">Concluded <date value="-387">387</date> B. C.</note> Having escaped these

of the river Kisil-Irmak<note anchored="yes">The ancient Halys.</note> and the Taurus, took part in these

struggles with the Carthaginians: over these Antiochus<note anchored="yes">Antiochus ceded Asia Minor in the year B. C. <date value="-189">189</date>.</note> was

king, and Philip and Perseus,<note anchored="yes">Perseus was taken in the year B. C. <date value="-167">167</date>.</note> these therefore the Romans

found themselves obliged to subdue. The people likewise of

Danube<note anchored="yes">Ister.</note> and the Kisil-Irmak<note anchored="yes">The ancient Halys.</note> had been effected. The

Iberians, and Kelts, and all the rest who are subject to the

<p>SUMMARY.</p>

<p>In the Seventh Book Strabo describes the remaining portions of Europe.

That on the east is the country beyond the Rhine, as far as the Don<note anchored="yes">The ancient Tanais.</note> and the mouth of the Sea of Azof;<note anchored="yes">Palus Mæotis.</note> and on the south, that which the

Danube<note anchored="yes">The ancient Ister.</note> bounds, lying between the Adriatic and the left shores of the Euxine, as far as Greece and the Sea of Marmora,<note anchored="yes">The ancient Propontis.</note> including the whole of Macedonia.</p></argument>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>WE have described Spain and the Keltic nations, together with Italy and the islands adjacent, and must now

speak of the remaining portions of Europe, dividing it in the

best way we can. That which remains is, on the east, all

the country beyond the Rhine, as far as the Don and the

mouth of the Sea of Azof; and, on the south, that which

the Danube bounds, lying between the Adriatic and the left

shores of the Euxine, as far as Greece and the Sea of Marmora, for the Danube, which is the largest of the rivers of

Europe, divides the whole territory of which we have spoken,

into two portions. This river from its commencement flows

southwards, then, making a sudden turn, continues its course

from west to east, which [terminates] in the Euxine Sea.

It takes its rise in the western confines of Germany, not far

from the head of the Adriatic, being distant from it about

1000 stadia,<note anchored="yes">Strabo, in a subsequent passage, states that the distance from the

Danube to the city Trieste, at the head of the Adriatic, is about <date value="1200">1200</date>

stadia.</note> and falls into the Euxine near the mouths of

the Dniester<note anchored="yes">The ancient Tyras.</note> and the Dnieper,<note anchored="yes">The Borysthenes.</note> inclining a little towards the

north. Thus the countries beyond the Rhine and Keltica are

situated to the north of the Danube, and are occupied by the



<pb n="443"/>



Galatic and German tribes, as far as the territory of the

Bastarnæ,<note anchored="yes">The Bastarnæ were a people occupying portions of the modern Moldavia, Podolia, and the Ukraine.</note> the Tyregetæ,<note anchored="yes">The Tyregetæ, or the Getæ of the river Tyras, were a people dwelling on the Dniester, to the south of the Bastarnæ.</note> and the river Dnieper; so also is the country situated between the Dnieper, the Don, and the

mouth of the Sea of Azof, which on one side stretches back

as far as the [Northern] Ocean,<note anchored="yes">The ancient geographers supposed that the Northern Ocean extended

to the 56° of north latitude. Their notions of the existence of the Baltic

were vague. They therefore confounded it with the Northern Ocean,

thus making the continent of Europe to extend only to the 56° of north

latitude.</note> and on another is washed

by the Euxine. To the south of the Danube are situated the

people of Illyria and Thrace, and mixed with them certain

tribes of Kelts and other races, extending as far as Greece.
</p><p>We will first speak of those nations to the north of the

Danube, for their history is less involved than that of the

tribes situated on the other side of the river.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next after the Keltic nations come the Germans who

inhabit the country to the east beyond the Rhine; and these

differ but little from the Keltic race, except in their being

more fierce, of a larger stature, and more ruddy in countenance; but in every other respect, their figure, their customs

and manners of life, are such as we have related of the

Kelts.<note anchored="yes">See book iv. chap. iv. § 2, pp. 291, 292.</note> The Romans therefore, I think, have very appositely

applied to them the name <q direct="unspecified">Germani,</q> as signifying genuine;

for in the Latin language Germani signifies genuine.<note anchored="yes">Strabo's words are, <foreign lang="greek">gnh/sioi ga/o| oi\ Geo|manoi\ kata\ th\n (Pwmai/wn</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">dia/lekton.</foreign> It is possible he may be endeavouring to explain that the yep

in Germani is equivalent to the Latin verus, <q direct="unspecified">true,</q> the wahr of modern

German, and that Germani signifies the true men of the country, the undoubted autochthones of Galatia or Gaul.</note>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The first division of this country is the land extending

along the Rhine from its source to its embouchure. Indeed,

the valley of that river extends nearly as far as the whole

breadth of Germany on the west. Of the people who occupied this country, some have been transplanted by the Romans

into Keltica, the others have retired to the interior, as the

Marsi;<note anchored="yes">The Marsi were a people dwelling on the banks of the Ems, near

Munster.</note> there are but few remaining, and some portion of them



<pb n="444"/>



are Sicambri;<note anchored="yes">The Sicambri were located near the Menapii. See above, p. 289.</note> next to the inhabitants of this valley succeeds

the tribe dwelling between the Rhine and the river Elbe,<note anchored="yes">The Albis.</note>

which river flows towards the ocean in a direction nearly

parallel with the Rhine, and traversing a country of no less

extent. There are also between these other navigable rivers,

such as the Ems,<note anchored="yes">Amasias.</note> on which Drusus defeated the Bructeri<note anchored="yes">The name of this tribe is written variously by different authors.

They are supposed to have occupied the lands between the Rhine, the

Ems, and the Lippe, but their boundaries were very uncertain, on account of their continual wars.</note> in

a naval engagement; all likewise flowing from south to north,

and falling into the ocean; for the whole country rises towards the south, and forms a ridge of mountains near the

Alps, which extends eastward as though it were a continuation of the Alps;<note anchored="yes">This refers to the chain of mountains which, running from the north

of Switzerland, traverses Wurtemberg, Franconia, Bohemia, Moravia,

and joins Mount Krapak.</note> and some have even so described it, as

well on account of its position as because it produces the

same system of vegetation; nevertheless, the altitude of this

ridge in no part equals that of the Alps. Here is situated

the Hercynian Wood,<note anchored="yes">The Hercynian Wood, or Black Forest, was either one or a succession of continuous forests, extending from the banks of the Rhine to the

confines of Persia and Bactriana.</note> and the tribes of the Suevi,<note anchored="yes">The Suevi occupied a considerable portion of Germany, to the north

and east of Bohemia.</note> some of

whom inhabit the forest, as do likewise some of the Quadi.<note anchored="yes">Coldui manuscripts. Kramer agrees with Cluverius in this instance,

and we have followed Kramer's text.</note>

Among these latter people is situated Bujemum, the royal

city of Marobodus, whither he has assembled many strangers

and many of the Marcomanni, a kindred nation with his own.

This Marobodus, from a private station, raised himself to the

administration of affairs after his return from Rome. For

he went to that city while a youth, and was patronized by

Augustus. After he came home, he acquired the sovereignty

of his country, and added to the people I have enumerated,

the Luji,<note anchored="yes">The Lugii of Tacitus.</note> a powerful nation, and the Zumi,<note anchored="yes">Zeus thinks these were the Burri of Dio Cassius, lxviii. 8. See

and Mugilones and Sibini, besides the Semnones, another con-

siderable tribe of the Suevi. As I have previously stated, a

portion of the Suevi dwells within the Forest, while another

portion occupies the territory beyond, on the frontiers of the

Getæ; wherefore the nation of the Suevi is the most considerable, as it extends from the Rhine as far as the Elbe,

and even a part of them, as the Hermonduri and the Langobardi, inhabit the country beyond the Elbe; but at the present time these tribes, having been defeated, have retired entirely beyond the Elbe. All these nations easily change their

abode, on account of the scantiness of provisions, and because

they neither cultivate the lands nor accumulate wealth, but

dwell in miserable huts, and satisfy their wants from day to

day, the most part of their food being supplied by the herd,

as amongst the nomade races, and in imitation of them they

transfer their households in waggons, wandering with their

cattle to any place which may appear most advantageous.

There are many other smaller German tribes, as the Cherusci,

Chatti, Gamabrivi,<note anchored="yes">The Gambrivii of Tacitus, Germ. cap. 2.</note> Chattuarii, and next the ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi,<note anchored="yes">Cluverius considers these were the Chamavi.</note> Bructeri,<note anchored="yes">We have followed Kramer's text. MSS. read Bucteri.</note> Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci, Campsiani,<note anchored="yes">For Caulci, Campsiani, Cluverius would read Cathulci, Campsani.

A little further on Strabo calls the Campsiani Ampsani.</note> and many others.
</p><p>In the same direction with the Ems,<note anchored="yes">Amasias.</note> the Weser<note anchored="yes">Visurgis.</note> and the river Lippe<note anchored="yes">Lupias.</note> take their course, the latter, distant about 600

stadia from the Rhine, flows through the territory of the

Lesser Bructeri. And there is also the river Sala,<note anchored="yes">Salas.</note> between

which and the Rhine Drusus Germanicus died, whilst in the

midst of his victories. He not only subdued the greater part

of the German tribes, but also the islands on the coast he

passed along, one amongst which is Byrchanis,<note anchored="yes">Borcum. Pliny calls this island Burchana, and adds, that the Romans gave it the name of Fabaria, on account of the beans (in Latin

Faba) which grow there.</note> which he

took by siege.

<p>All these nations became known through their wars with

the Romans, at one time submitting, at another revolting and

quitting their habitations; and we should have become acquainted with a greater number of their tribes, if Augustus

had permitted his generals to pass the Elbe, in pursuit of those

who had fled thither; but he considered the war on hand

would be more easily brought to a conclusion, if he left the

people on the other side of the Elbe unmolested, and not by

attacking provoke them to make common cause with his

enemies.
</p><p>The Sicambri inhabiting the country next the Rhine were

the first to commence the war, under the conduct of their

leader, Melon; other nations afterwards followed their example, at one time being victorious, at another defeated, and

again recommencing hostilities, without regard to hostages or

the faith of treaties. Against these people mistrust was the

surest defence; for those who were trusted effected the most

mischief. For example, the Cherusci, and those who were

subject to them, amongst whom three Roman legions with

their general, Quintilius Varus, perished by ambush, in violation of the truce; nevertheless all have received punishment

for this perfidy, which furnished to Germanicus the Younger

the opportunity of a most brilliant triumph, he leading publicly as his captives the most illustrious persons, both men

and women, amongst whom were Segimuntus,<note anchored="yes">Segimundus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. cap. 57.</note> the son of

Segestes, the chief of the Cherusci, and his sister, named

Thusnelda, the wife of Armenius, who led on the Cherusci

when they treacherously attacked Quintilius Varus, and even

to this day continues the war; likewise his son Thumelicus,

a boy three years old, as also Sesithacus, the son of Segimerus,<note anchored="yes">Ægimerus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. i. cap. 71.</note> chief of the Cherusci, and his wife Rhamis, the daughter

of Ucromirus,<note anchored="yes">Acrumerus, according to the correction of Cluverius. He is Actumerus in Tacitus, Annal. lib. xi. 16, 17.</note> chief of the Chatti,<note anchored="yes">MSS.

</p><p>The Rhine is distant from the Elbe about 3000 stadia, if

<p>The Hercynian Forest<note anchored="yes">Schwartz Wald, or Black Forest.</note> is extremely dense, and overgrown with very large trees, covering an immense circuit of

the region well suited for habitation, of which we have spoken.

Near this forest are the sources of the Danube and the Rhine,

and the lake<note anchored="yes">The Lake Constance.</note> situated between these, together with the

marshes formed by the Rhine. The circuit of the lake is

more than 300<note anchored="yes">Strabo could hardly have intended 300, since the diameter of the

lake is given at 200. Velser conjectures that 500 or 600 would be the

proper reading. Its exact circumference is about 550 stadia.</note> stadia, and the distance across about 200.

In this lake is an island which served Tiberius as an arsenal,

in the naval war with the Vindelici. This lake is south of

the sources of the Danube and the Hercynian Forest, so that

in passing from Keltica<note anchored="yes">Gossellin considers that by Keltica we are to understand Cisalpine

Gaul, and the neighbourhood of Milan and Mantua.</note> to the forest, one has first to cross

the lake, then the Danube, and afterwards by a more passable

When Tiberius had proceeded but one day's journey from the

the desert of the Boii stretched along the shores of the Danube from the

called the Wiener-Wald, or Forest of Vienna. Doubtless it took its

<p>SOME of the accounts which we receive respecting the

tide;<note anchored="yes">See also book ii. chap. 3, § 6. Festus relates that the Ambrones

gustus the caldron held most sacred by them, supplicating his

friendship, and an amnesty for past offences; and having obtained their request, they returned home. Indeed, it would

have been ridiculous for them to have departed from their

country in a pet, on account of a natural and constant phenomenon, which recurs twice every day. It is likewise evidently a fiction, that there ever occurred an overwhelming

flood-tide, for the ocean, in the influences of this kind which

it experiences, receives a certain settled and periodical increase and decrease.<note anchored="yes">The French translation has happily paraphrased, not translated, this

passage as follows: <q direct="unspecified">For although it is true that the ocean has tides of

more or less height, still they occur periodically, and in an order constantly the same.</q></note> Neither is it true, as has been related,<note anchored="yes">Aristotle, Ethics, Eudem. lib. iii. cap. 1, Nicolas of Damascus, and

Ælian, Var. Histor. lib. xii. cap. 23, have attributed the like extravagant

proceedings to the Kelts or Gauls. Nicolas of Damascus, Reliq. pp.

272, 273, says that the Kelts resist the tides of the ocean with their

swords in their hands, till they perish in the waters, in order that they

may not seem to fear death by taking the precaution to fly.</note> that the Cimbri take arms against the flood-tides, or that the

Kelts, as an exercise of their intrepidity, suffer their houses

to be washed away by them, and afterwards rebuild them;

and that a greater number of them perish by water than by

war, as Ephorus relates. For the regular order the flood-tides

observe, and the notoriety of the extent of the country subject to inundation by them, could never have given occasion

for such absurd actions. For the tide flowing twice every

day, how could any one think for an instant that it was not

a natural and harmless phenomenon, and that it occurs not

only on their coasts, but on all others bordering on the ocean?

Is not this quite incredible? Neither is Clitarchus to be

trusted,<note anchored="yes">It is probable that Clitarchus obtained his information from the

Gauls. As for the sudden influx of the tide, there are several other examples of the kind, in which the troops surprised were not so successful

in getting off.</note> when he says that their cavalry, on seeing the sea

flowing in, rode off at full speed, and yet scarcely escaped by

flight from being overtaken by the flood; for we know, by

experience, that the tide does not come in with such impetuosity, but that the sea advances stealthily by slow degrees.

And we should think, besides, that a phenomenon of daily

occurrence, which would naturally strike the ear of such as



<pb n="450"/>



approached it, before even they could see it with their eyes,

could not by any means terrify them so as to put them to

flight, as if they had been surprised by some unexpected

catastrophe.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>For such fables as these, Posidonius justly blames these

writers, and not inaptly conjectures that the Cimbri, on account of their wandering life and habits of piracy, might

have made an expedition as far as the countries around the

Palus Mæotis, and that from them has been derived the name

of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, or what we should more correctly denominate the Cimbrian Bosphorus, for the Greeks

call the Cimbri Cimmerii.
</p><p>He likewise tells us that the Boii formerly inhabited the

Hercynian Forest, and that the Cimbri, having made an incursion into those parts, were repulsed by them, and driven

towards the Danube, and the country occupied by the Scordisci, a Galatic tribe, and from thence to the Tauristæ, or

Taurisci, a people likewise of Galatic origin, and farther to the

Helvetii, who were at that time a rich and peaceful people;

but, perceiving that the wealth of these freebooters far exceeded their own, the Helvetii, and more especially the Tigureni and the Toygeni, associated themselves with their expeditions. But both the Cimbri and their auxiliaries were

vanquished by the Romans, the one part when they crossed

the Alps and came down upon Italy, the others on the other

side of the Alps.

<p>It is reported that the Cimbri had a peculiar custom.

They were accompanied in their expeditions by their wives;

the camp, and, having crowned them, led them to a brazen

vessel containing about 20 amphoræ, and placed on a raised

platform, which one of the priestesses having ascended, and

holding the prisoner above the vessel, cut his throat; then,

from the manner in which the blood flowed into the vessel,

some drew certain divinations; while others, having opened

the corpse, and inspected the entrails, prophesied victory to

their army. In battle too they beat skins stretched on the

wicker sides of chariots, which produces a stunning noise.

<p>As we have before stated, the northernmost of the Germans inhabit a country bordering on the ocean; but we are

only acquainted with those situated between the mouths of

the Rhine and the Elbe, of which the Sicambri<note anchored="yes">The Sicambri, or Sugambri, dwelt to the south of the Lippe.</note> and Cimbri<note anchored="yes">The Cimbri occupied Jutland, the ancient Cimbrica Chersonesus.</note>

are the most generally known: those dwelling along the coast<note anchored="yes">The shores of the Baltic.</note>

beyond the Elbe are entirely unknown to us; for none of the

ancients with whom I am acquainted have prosecuted this

voyage towards the east as far as the mouths of the Caspian

Sea, neither have the Romans as yet sailed coastwise beyond

the Elbe, nor has any one travelling on foot penetrated farther

into this country. But it is evident, by the <emph rend="ital">climates</emph> and the

parallels of distances, that in following a longitudinal course

towards the east we must come to the countries near the

Dnieper, and the regions on the north side of the Euxine.

But as for any particulars as to Germany beyond the Elbe,

or of the countries which lie beyond it in order, whether we

should call them the Bastarnæ, as most geographers suppose,

or whether other nations intervene, such as the Jazyges,<note anchored="yes">Gossellin places the Jazyges in the southern districts of the Ukraine,

between the Dniester and the Sea of Azoff.</note> or

the Roxolani,<note anchored="yes">Gossellin considers that the name of Russia is derived from these

Roxolani.</note> or any others of the tribes dwelling in waggons,

it is not easy to give any account. Neither can we say whether these nations extend as far as the [Northern] Ocean,

along the whole distance, or whether [between them and the

Ocean] there are countries rendered unfit for habitation by

the cold or by any other cause; or whether men of a different

race are situated between the sea and the most eastern of the

Germans.

<p>As to the southern part of Germany beyond the Elbe,

the country which adjoins the bank of that river is now occupied by the Suevi. Next lies the country of the Getæ, at first

narrow, its southern side extends along the Danube, and the

opposite side along the mountains of the Hercynian Forest,

even including part of those mountains, it then becomes broader

towards the north, and extends as far as the Tyregetæ; however, we are unable to declare its boundaries with accuracy;

and it is on account of our ignorance of these places that

those who relate fables of the Riphæan mountains and the

Hyperboreans have received credit; as also that which Pytheas of Marseilles has forged concerning the countries bordering on the Northern Ocean, making use of his acquaintance with astronomy and mathematics to fabricate his false

narration: let us therefore pass over them; as also what Sophocles, speaking of Orithya in one of his tragedies, says,

that she, being snatched by the north wind, was carried

This is of no value to our present inquiry, but must be omitted, as Socrates has done in the Phædrus of Plato. We

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Greeks indeed considered the Getæ to be Thracians. They occupied either bank of the Danube, as also did

the Mysians, likewise a Thracian people, now called the Moesi,

from whom are descended the Mysians, settled between the

Lydians, the Phrygians, and the inhabitants of the Troad.

Even the Phrygians themselves are the same as the Briges, a

people of Thrace, as also are the Mygdones, the Bebryces,

the Mædobithyni, the Bithyni, the Thyni, and, as I consider,

also are the Mariandyni. All these people quitted Europe

entirely, the Mysians alone remaining. Posidonius appears

to me to have rightly conjectured that it is the Mysians of

Europe (or as I should say of Thrace) that Homer designates

when he says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>and his glorious eyes
</l><l>Averting, on the land look'd down remote
</l><l>Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold
</l><l>Close-fighting Mysian race. . . . <note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>But he himself turned back his shining eyes apart, looking towards

the land of the equestrian Thracians and the close-fighting Mysians.
</quote><bibl>Iliad xiii. 3.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad xiii. 3.</bibl></cit>



For if any one should understand them as the Mysians of

Asia, the expression of the poet would not be fitting. For

this would be, that having turned his eyes from the Trojans

towards the land of the Thracians, he beheld at the same time

the land of the Mysians, situated not far off from where he

was, but conterminous with the Troad, rather behind it and

on either side, but separated from Thrace by the breadth of

the Hellespont.<note anchored="yes">The Strait of the Dardanelles.</note> This would be to confound the continents,

and at the same time to disregard the form of the poet's expression. For <q direct="unspecified">to turn his eyes again,</q> is more especially to

turn them behind him; but he who extends his vision from

the Trojans to the people either behind them, or on either side

of them, stretches his sight to a greater distance, but not in

the least behind him. And this also is introduced as a proof

of this very thing, that Homer classes with these the Hippemolgi,<note anchored="yes">Milkers of mares.</note> the Galactophagi,<note anchored="yes">People who live on milk.</note> and the Abii,<note anchored="yes">Devoid of riches.</note> who are the Scythian

Hamaxœci<note anchored="yes">Dwelling in waggons.</note> and Sarmatians; for at this day, all these nations,

as well as the Bastarnæ, are mixed with the Thracians, more

especially with those beyond the Danube, and some even with



<pb n="454"/>



the Thracians on this side the Danube; also amongst these

are the Keltic tribes of the Boii, Scordisci, and Taurisci.

Some, indeed, call the Scordisci the Scordistæ, and give to the

Taurisci the names of Ligurisci<note anchored="yes">Perhaps Teurisci.</note> and Tauristæ.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Posidonius relates that the Mysians religiously abstain

from eating any thing that had life, and consequently, from

cattle; but that they lived in a quiet way on honey, milk, and

cheese; wherefore they are considered a religious people, and

called Capnobatæ.<note anchored="yes">A note in the French translation suggests that Capnobatæ has some

connexion with the practice of intoxication by inhaling smoke, and of

using the vapour of linseed, burned upon red-hot stones, as a bath. See

Herodot. book i. chap. 202; book iv. chap. 75.</note> He adds, that there are amongst the

Thracians some who live without wives, and who are known

by the name of Ctistæ. These are considered sacred and worthy

of honour, and live in great freedom. [He pretends] that the

poet comprehends the whole of these people when he says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>and where abide,
</l><l>On milk sustain'd, and blest with length of days,
</l><l>The Hippemolgi, justest of mankind.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>And the illustrious Hippemolgi, milk-nourished, simple in living and

most just men. </quote><bibl>Iliad xiii. 5.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad xiii. 5.</bibl></cit>



These he designates as <q direct="unspecified">without life,</q> more particularly on

account of their living without wives, considering their solitary state as but a half life; in the same way as he likewise

designates the house of Protesilaus <q direct="unspecified">imperfect,</q> on account

of the bereavement of his widow; in the same manner he applies to the Mysians the epithet of <q direct="unspecified">close-fighting,</q> on account

of their being invincible, like good warriors. [Finally, Posidonius pretends] that in the thirteenth<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">deka/tw|</foreign> text: but there is no doubt it should be the thirteenth.</note> book of the Iliad we

ought to substitute for <q direct="unspecified">the close-fighting Mysians,</q> [<q direct="unspecified">the

close-fighting Mœsi.</q>]

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Nevertheless it would perhaps be superfluous to change

the text [of Homer], which has stood the test of so many

years. For it appears more probable to suppose that the

people were anciently called Mysians, but that their name

is now altered. Further, any one would suppose that the

Abii<note anchored="yes">People without life.</note> were no more so named from being unmarried than

from their being houseless,<note anchored="yes">The Greek is <foreign lang="greek">a)nesti/ous,</foreign> literally <q direct="unspecified">without hearths.</q></note> or their dwelling in waggons.



<pb n="455"/>



In fact, as injustice is ordinarily committed in matters

relative to bonds for money and the acquisition of wealth,

it would be natural that the people living so frugally on

such small property should be called [by Homer] the justest of mankind: and the more so as the philosophers who

place justice next to moderation, aim at independence of

others and frugality as amongst the most desirable objects of

attainment; from which however some, having passed the

bounds of moderation, have wandered into a cynical mode of

life.<note anchored="yes">Strabo does not intend by the word <foreign lang="greek">kunismo\s</foreign> which he here uses, the

profession of a Cynic philosopher, which some of the Stoics affected in

consequence of their not thoroughly understanding the dogmas of Zeno,

the founder of their sect. It was to these ultra-Stoics that the name of

Stoaces [<foreign lang="greek">Sto/akes</foreign>] was given by way of ridicule. Athenæus, book xiii.

chap. 2, remarks that a like propensity to overdo the precept of the

teacher led the disciples of Aristippus, who recommended rational pleasures, to become mere libertines.</note> But [the words of the poet] sanction no such assertion

of the Thracians, and the Getæ in particular, that they live

without wives. But see what Menander says of these people,

not out of his own imagination, as it should seem, but deriving it from history.



<quote><q direct="unspecified">All the Thracians truly, and especially above all others we Getæ, (for

I myself glory in being descended from this race,) are not very chaste.</q></quote>



And a little after he gives examples of their rage for women.



<quote><q direct="unspecified">For there is no one among us who marries fewer than ten or eleven

wives, and some have twelve, or even more.<note anchored="yes">Heraclides of Pontus, page 215, gives them even as many as thirty

wives.</note> If any one loses his life who has only married four or five wives, he is lamented by us as unfortunate, and one deprived of the pleasures of Hymen.</q></quote>



Such a one would be accounted as unmarried amongst them.

These things are likewise confirmed by the evidence of other

historians. And it is not likely that the same people should

regard as an unhappy life that which is passed without the

enjoyment of many women, and at the same time regard as a

dignified and holy life that which is passed in celibacy without any women. But that those living without wives should

be considered holy, and termed Capnobatæ, is entirely opposed to our received opinions; for all agree in regarding

women as the authors of devotion to the gods, and it is they



<pb n="456"/>



who induce the men by their example to a more attentive

worship of the gods, and to the observance of feast-days and

supplications; for scarcely is there found a man living by

himself who pays any regard to such matters. And again attend to the words of the same poet when he speaks in one of

his characters, bringing in a man disgusted with the expenses<note anchored="yes">Kramer reads <foreign lang="greek">dapa/nais,</foreign> which we have rendered by <q direct="unspecified">expenses,</q>

but all manuscripts have <foreign lang="greek">a)pa/tais.</foreign> The French translation gives a note

with Koray's conjecture of <foreign lang="greek">dapa/nais,</foreign> which is supported by a very similar passage respecting Alcibiades, where Isocrates (P. I. page 354, ed.

Coray) says, <q direct="unspecified">He was so lavish in the sacrifices and other expenses for

the feast.</q> Both the French and German translations adopt the emendation.</note>

of the sacrifices of the women.



<quote><q direct="unspecified">The gods weary us indeed, but especially our married men, who are

always obliged to celebrate some feast.</q></quote>



And his Misogynes, complaining of the same things, exclaims,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">We sacrificed five times a day, while seven female slaves ranged in a

circle played on the cymbals, and others raised their suppliant cries.</q></quote>



It would therefore seem absurd to suppose that only those

among the Getæ who remained without wives were considered

pious, but that the care of worshipping the Supreme Being

is great among this nation is not to be doubted, after what

Posidonius has related, <q direct="unspecified">and they even abstain from animal

this philosopher some astronomical knowledge, in addition to

what he had learned from the Egyptians, amongst whom he

had travelled. He returned to his own country, and was

highly esteemed both by the chief rulers and the people, on

account of his predictions of astronomical phenomena, and

eventually persuaded the king to unite him in the government, as an organ of the will of the gods. At first he was

chosen a priest of the divinity most revered by the Getæ, but

afterwards was esteemed as a god, and having retired into a

district of caverns, inaccessible and unfrequented by other



<pb n="457"/>



men, he there passed his life, rarely communicating with any-

body except the king and his ministers. The king himself

assisted him to play his part, seeing that his subjects obeyed

him more readily than formerly, as promulgating his ordinances with the counsel of the gods. This custom even

continues to our time; for there is always found some one of

this character who assists the king in his counsels, and is

styled a god by the Getæ. The mountain likewise [where

Zamolxis retired] is held sacred, and is thus distinguished,

being named Cogæonus,<note anchored="yes">D'Anville imagines that this is the modern mountain Kaszon, and

the little river of the same name on the confines of Transylvania and

Moldavia.</note> as well as the river which flows by

it; and at the time when Byrebistus, against whom divus

Cæsar prepared an expedition, reigned over the Getæ, Decæneus held that honour: likewise the Pythagorean precept to

abstain from animal food, which was originally introduced by

Zamolxis, is still observed to a great extent.

<p>Any one may well entertain such questions as these

touching the localities mentioned by the poet [Homer], and

with regard to the Mysians and the illustrious Hippemolgi:

but what Apollodorus has advanced in his preface to the Catalogue of Ships in the Second Book [of the Iliad] is by no

means to be adopted. For he praises the opinions of Eratosthenes, who says that Homer and the rest of the ancients

were well versed in every thing that related to Greece, but

were in a state of considerable ignorance as to places at a

distance, in consequence of the impossibility of' their making

long journeys by land or voyages by sea. In support of this

he asserts,<note anchored="yes">See Strabo's former remarks on this identical subject, book i. chap.

ii. § 3, page 25.</note> that Homer designated Aulis as 'rocky,' as indeed it is; Eteonus as 'mountainous and woody,' Thisbe as

'abounding in doves,' Haliartus as ' grassy;' but that neither

Homer nor the others were familiar with localities far off; for

although there are forty rivers which discharge themselves

into the Black Sea,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ei)s to\n Po/nton.</foreign></note> he makes no mention whatever even of

the most considerable, as the Danube,<note anchored="yes">Ister.</note> the Don,<note anchored="yes">Tanaïs.</note> the Dnieper,<note anchored="yes">Borysthenes.</note> the Bog,<note anchored="yes">Hypanis.</note> the Phasz,<note anchored="yes">Phasis.</note> the Termeh,<note anchored="yes">Thermodon.</note> the Kisil-Irmak,<note anchored="yes">Halys.</note> nor does

he even allude to the Scythians, but makes up fables about

certain illustrious Hippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii. He

had become acquainted with the Paphlagonians of the interior

from the relations of such as had penetrated into those regions

on foot, but he was perfectly unacquainted with the sea-coasts

of the country; which indeed was likely enough, for that sea

was in his time closed to navigation, and known by the name

of Pontus Axenus [or the Inhospitable] on account of the severity of the storms to which it was subject, as well as of the

savage disposition of the nations who inhabited its shores, but

more especially of the Scythian hordes,<note anchored="yes">Gossellin observes, that these must have been the Scythians inhabiting the Taurica Chersonesus, now the Crimea. The people on the opposite or southern shore were less savage. The Ionians had made settlements amongst these as early as the sixth century B. C.</note> who made a practice

of sacrificing strangers, devouring their flesh, and using their

skulls for drinking-cups; although at a subsequent period,

when the Ionians had established cities along its shores, it

was called by the name of Pontus Euxinus [or the Hospitable]. He was likewise in ignorance as to the natural peculiarities of Egypt and Libya,<note anchored="yes">Africa.</note> as the risings of the Nile, and

the alluvial deposits, which he no where notices, nor yet the

isthmus [of Suez] which separates the Red Sea from the

Egyptian Sea;<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> nor yet does he relate any particulars of

Arabia, Ethiopia, or the Ocean, unless we should agree with

the philosopher Zeno in altering the Homeric line as follows,

confess that the poet transferred them to the ocean for the

sake of making his account the more romantic. Some allowance might be made for others, but no manner of excuse can

be put forward for Callimachus, who pretends to the character

to compare what we have advanced with the remarks of

Posidonius and the other critics. Now, in the first place,

they have universally proved the very contrary of the allegations which they had undertaken to maintain; for where they

undertook to show that amongst the ancients there was a

greater amount of ignorance as to places far from Greece

than there was among the moderns, they have proved the

very contrary, and that not only with regard to the countries

more remote, but even with respect to Greece itself; but, as

I have said before, let the other matters remain in abeyance

while we consider carefully the subject now before us. Thus

they say that it was through ignorance Homer and the ancients omitted to speak of the Scythians, and their cruelty to

strangers, whom they sacrificed, devoured their flesh, and afterwards made use of their skulls as drinking-cups, for which

barbarities the sea was termed the Axine,<note anchored="yes">Pontus Axenus.</note> or inhospitable;

but in place of these they imagined fables as to illustrious

Hippemolgi, Galactophagi, and Abii, the most just of mankind, who never existed any where in this world. But how

came it that they named the sea the Axenus, if they were so

ignorant of the barbarism of that region, or of those savages

who were the most barbarous on earth? But these undoubtedly are the Scythians! Or in the early times were not those

who dwelt beyond the Mysians, and Thracians, and Getæ,

Hippemolgi, (or milkers of mares,) Galactophagi, and Abii?

Nay rather, they exist at this very day, being called Hamaxoeci and Nomades, living on the herd, milk and cheese, and

especially on cheese made of mare's milk, and being ignorant

how to lay up treasure or deal in merchandise, except the simple barter of one commodity for another. How then can it

be said that the poet [Homer] knew nothing of the Scythians,

since he doubtless designates some of them by the names of

Hippemolgi and Galactophagi? And that the men of that



<pb n="462"/>



time called these people Hippemolgi even Hesiod is a witness

in the words which Eratosthenes has quoted:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">He went and saw the Ethiopians, the Ligurians,<note anchored="yes">This word is corrupt in the MSS.</note> and the Scythians,

milkers of mares.</q></quote>



And when we consider the amount of fraud connected with

trading speculations even amongst ourselves, what ground

have we to wonder that Homer should have designated as the

justest and most noble those who had but few commercial and

monetary transactions, and with the exception of their swords

and drinking-cups, possessed all things in common, and especially their wives and children, who were cared for by the

whole community according to the system of Plato. Æschylus

too seems to plead the poet's cause, when he says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">But the Scythians, governed by good laws, and feeding on cheese of

mares' milk.</q></quote>



And this is still the opinion entertained of them by the

Greeks; for we esteem them the most sincere, the least deceitful of any people, and much more frugal and self-relying

than ourselves. And yet the manner of life customary among

us has spread almost every where, and brought about a change

for the worse, effeminacy, luxury, and over-great refinement,

inducing extortion in ten thousand different ways; and doubtless much of this corruption has penetrated even into the

countries of the nomades, as well as those of the other barbarians; for having once learnt how to navigate the sea, they

have become depraved, committing piracy and murdering

strangers; and holding intercourse with many different nations, they have imitated both their extravagance and their

dishonest traffic, which may indeed appear to promote civility

of manners, but do doubtless corrupt the morals and lead to

dissimulation, in place of the genuine sincerity we have before noticed.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Those however who lived before our time, and more

especially those who lived near to the times of Homer, were

such as he describes them, and so they were esteemed to be

by the Greeks. Take for instance what Herodotus relates

concerning the king<note anchored="yes">He was called Idanthyrsus. See Herodotus, book iv. chap. 127.</note> of the Scythians, against whom Darius

waged war, and especially the answer he sent [to the messen-

kings of the Bosphorus, [Satyrus<note anchored="yes">Satyrus is supplied by Koray. See also chapter iv. of this book, § 4,

and book xi. chap. ii. § 7. Groskurd refers also to Diodorus, book xiv.

93, and says that Leuco was the son of Satyrus.</note> and] Leuco. The letters

of the Persians are full of the sincerity I have described; so

likewise are the memorials of the Egyptians, Babylonians,

and Indians. It was on this account that both Anacharsis

and Abaris, and certain others of the same class, gained so

great a reputation among the Greeks; for we may well believe they displayed their national characteristics of affability

of manner, simplicity, and love of justice. But what occasion

is there for me to speak of such as belonged to the times of

old? for Alexander [the Great], the son of Philip, in his

campaign against the Thracians beyond Mount Hæmus,<note anchored="yes">The mountains in the north of Thrace still bear the name of Emineh-

Dag, or Mount Emineh, at their eastern point; but the western portion

is called the Balkan.</note> is

said to have penetrated as far as this in an incursion into the

country of the Triballi, and observed that they occupied the

territory as far as the Danube and the island Peuce,<note anchored="yes">Piczina, at the embouchure of the Danube, between Babadag and

Ismail.</note> which

is in it, and that the Getæ possessed the country beyond that

river; however, he was unable to pass into the island for want

of a sufficient number of ships, and because Syrmus, the king

of the Triballi, who had taken refuge in that place, resisted

the undertaking: but Alexander crossed over into the country

of the Getæ and took their city, after which he returned home

in haste, carrying with him presents from those nations, and

also from Syrmus. Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, relates that

in this campaign the Kelts who dwell on the Adriatic<note anchored="yes">A note in the French translation says, these were the Carni and the

Iapodes, who having followed Sigovesus, in the reign of the elder Tar-

quin, had taken up their abode in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic;

to Alexander for the purpose of making a treaty of friendship

and mutual hospitality, and that the king received them in a

friendly way, and asked them, while drinking, what might be

the chief object of their dread, supposing that they would say

it was he; but that they replied, it was no man, only they felt

some alarm lest the heavens should on some occasion or other



<pb n="464"/>



fall on them, but that they valued the friendship of such a

man as him above every thing. These examples sufficiently

manifest the open sincerity of the barbarians, both of the one

who would not suffer Alexander to land on the island, but

nevertheless sent presents and concluded a treaty of friendship with him, and also of those who asserted that they feared

no man, but that they valued the friendship of great men

above every price.
</p><p>In like manner Dromichætes, who was king of the Getæ in

the times of the successors of Alexander, having taken captive Lysimachus, who had come to wage war against him,

showed him his poverty and that of his people, and likewise

their great frugality, bade him not to make war on such, but

rather seek them as friends; after which he received him as a

guest, made a treaty of friendship, and suffered him to depart.<note anchored="yes">Diodorus Siculus, in Excerpt. Peiresc. pag. 257; Memnon apud

treated Lysimachus.</note>

[*And Plato, in his Republic,<note anchored="yes">This is not in Plato's Republic, but in his fourth book of Laws.</note> considers that the neighbourhood of the sea ought to be shunned as being productive of

<p>Ephorus, in the fourth book of his History, which is

entitled <q direct="unspecified">Of Europe,</q> having gone over Europe as far as

the Scythians, concludes by saying that there is great difference in the manner of life both of the Sauromatæ and the

other Scythians, for while some of them are exceedingly morose, and are indeed cannibals, others abstain even from the

flesh of animals. Other historians, he observes, descant upon

their ferocity, knowing that the terrible and the wonderful

always excite attention; but they ought also to relate the

better features of these people, and point to them as a pattern; for his part, he declares he will speak of those who excel in the justness of their actions, as there are some of the

nomade Scythians who subsist on mares' milk, and excel all

men in their justice, these are mentioned by the poets: as Homer, where he says that Jupiter beheld the land



<cit><quote><lg>

and Hesiod, in his poem entitled <q direct="unspecified">Travels round the World,</q>

who says that Phineus was taken by the Harpies



<quote><lg>

<l>To the land of the Galactophagi, who have their dwellings in waggons.</l></lg></quote>



Ephorus then proceeds to state the causes of their justice,

because they are frugal in their mode of life, not hoarders of

wealth, and just towards each other; they possess everything

in common, both their women, their children, and the whole

of their kin; thus when they come into collision with other

nations, they are irresistible and unconquered, having no cause

for which they need endure slavery. He then cites Chœrilus,

who in his <q direct="unspecified">Passage of the Bridge of Boats,</q> which Darius<note anchored="yes">Kramer quotes Nækius in proof that we should here read Xerxes

instead of Darius; and Groskurd refers to another passage in Strabo,

had made, says,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">And the sheep-feeding Sacæ, a people of Scythian race, but they inhabited

Wheat-producing Asia: truly they were a colony of the nomades,

A righteous race.</q></quote>



And again Ephorus declares of Anacharsis, whom he designates as <q direct="unspecified">The Wise,</q> that he was sprung from that race;

and that he was reckoned as one of the Seven Sages, on account of his pre-eminent moderation and knowledge. He

asserts too that he was the inventor of the bellows, the double-

fluked anchor, and the potter's wheel.<note anchored="yes">Casaubon observes that Diodorus Siculus attributes the invention of

the potter's wheel to Talus, a nephew of Dædalus, and that Theophrastus

awards it to one Hyberbius of Corinth.</note> I merely state this,

although I know very well that Ephorus is not at all times

to be relied on, especially when speaking of Anacharsis; (for

how can the wheel be his invention, with which Homer, who

is anterior to him, was acquainted; [who says],



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>as when, before his wheel
</l><l>Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands," &amp;c.;<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Iliad xviii. 600.</bibl> Posidonius chose to regard this passage as an interpolation, and would not give the praise of the invention to any other than

Anacharsis.</note>)</l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad xviii. 600.</bibl></cit>


<pb n="466"/>



for I wish to show by these references, that there was a ge-

neral impression among both the ancients and moderns with

regard to the nomades, that some were very far removed from

the rest of mankind, that they subsisted on milk, and were

very frugal,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)bi/ous.</foreign></note> and the most just of men, and that all this was

not the mere invention of Homer.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is but just too that Apollodorus should give some

explanation respecting the Mysians mentioned in the Epic

poems of Homer, whether he takes them to be but people of

his feigning, when the poet says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Of the close-fighting Mysians and the illustrious Hippemolgi,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Iliad xiii. 5.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad xiii. 5.</bibl></cit>



or would he regard them as the Mysians of Asia? Now if

he should declare that he considers them to be those of Asia,

he will misinterpret the poet, as has been before observed;

but if he should say they were but an invention, as there

were no Mysians in Thrace, he will be guilty of a palpable

misstatement, for even in our own times Ælius Catus has removed from the opposite side of the Danube into Thrace fifty

thousand Getæ, who speak a language cognate with the Thracian. They still inhabit the very spot, and pass by the name

of Mœsi. Whether those of former times were so designated,

and had their name slightly varied in Asia, or, as is more

suitable to history and the poet's expression, those in Thrace

were at the first called Mysians,<note anchored="yes">See chap. iii. § 3, 4, of this book.</note> is not certain. But enough

of this; we must now return to our geography.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let us pass over the early history of the Getæ, and

occupy ourselves with their actual condition. Bœrebistas,

one of the Getæ, having taken the command of his tribe, reanimated the men who were disheartened by frequent wars,

and raised them to such a degree of training, sobriety, and a

habit of obedience to orders, that he established a powerful

dominion within a few years, and brought most of the neighbouring states into subjection to the Getæ. He at length became formidable even to the Romans, fearlessly crossing the

Danube, and laying waste Thrace as far as Macedonia and

Illyria; he also subdued the Kelts who live among the Thracians and Illyrians, and thoroughly annihilated the Boii who

were subject to Critasirus and the Taurisci. In order to



<pb n="467"/>



maintain the obedience of his subjects, he availed himself of

the assistance of Decseneus a sorcerer,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)/nda go/hta,</foreign> one who used a kind of howling incantation while repeating spells.</note> who had travelled

in Egypt, and who, by predictions he had learnt to draw from

certain natural signs, was enabled to assume the character of

an oracle, and was almost held in the veneration of a god, as

we have related when noticing Zamolxis.<note anchored="yes">See book vii. chap. iii. § 5, page 456.</note> As an instance of

their implicit obedience, we may relate that they were persuaded to root up their vines and live without wine. However, Bœrebistas was murdered in a sedition before the Romans sent an army against him. Those who succeeded to

his government divided it into several states. Lately, when

Augustus Cæsar sent an army against them, they were divided

into five states, at another time they were four, for such

divisions are but temporary in duration, and variable in their

extent.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There was, from ancient times, another division of

these people which still exists; thus, some they call Dacians

and others Getæ: the Getæ extend towards the Euxine and

the east, but the Dacians are situated on the opposite side

towards Germany and the sources of the Danube,<note anchored="yes">Gossellin observes that the Dacians did not extend to the sources of

the Danube, but to Bohemia, near the middle of the course of the Danube.</note> whom I

consider to have been called Daci from a very early period.

Whence also amongst the Attics the names of Getæ and Davi

were customary for slaves. This at least is more probable

than to consider them as taken from the Scythians who are

named Daæ,<note anchored="yes">Gossellin seems to think that these Daæ are identical with the inhabitants of Daghistan. Davus is not found as the name of a slave

amongst the Greeks till after the conquests of Alexander the Great.</note> for they live far beyond Hyrcania,<note anchored="yes">Hyrcania comprehended the Corcan and Daghistan.</note> and it is not likely that slaves would be brought all that way into Attica. It was usual with them to call their slaves after the

name of the nation from whence they were brought, as Lydus

and Syrus,<note anchored="yes">From Lydia and Syria.</note> or else by a name much in use in their own

country, as, for a Phrygian, Manes or Midas; for a Paphlagonian, Tibius. The nation which was raised to so much

power by Bœrebistas has since been completely reduced by

civil dissensions and contests with the Romans; however,

they are still able to set out 40,000 men armed for the

wars.

<p>The river Maros<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Ma/o|isos potamo/s,</foreign></note> flows through their country into the

Danube,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o( Danou/ios.</foreign></note> on which the Romans transported their military

stores; for thus they termed the upper part of that river from

its sources to the cataracts, which flows chiefly through the

country of the Dacians, but the part below that point which

flows through the country of the Getæ as far as the Black

Sea, they call the Ister.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o( )/Isto|os.</foreign> Stephen of Byzantium says that the Ister was called

<foreign lang="greek">Da/noubis,</foreign> and that in very ancient times it was called Matoas. According to Ptolemy the lower part of the Danube was called Ister from Axiopolis, now Rassovat; according to Agathemerus, from Vienna.</note> The Dacians speak the same language as the Getæ. The Getæ are best known among the

Greeks on account of the frequent wandering expeditions

they make on both sides of the Danube, and their being

mixed among the Thracians and Mysians. The like is the

case with regard to the nation of the Triballi, a Thracian

people; for they have received many refugees on occasions

when their more powerful neighbours have driven out the

weaker, for from time to time the Scythians of the opposite

side of the river, and the Bastarnæ, and the Sarmatians,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Sauo|oma/tai.</foreign></note> become victorious, and those who are driven out cross over and

some of them take up their residence either in the islands of

the river or in Thrace, while on the other side the inhabitants

are distressed by the Illyrians. At one time when the Getæ

and the Dacians had increased to the greatest numbers, they

were able to set on foot an army of two hundred thousand

men, but now they are reduced to about forty thousand men,

and are even likely to become subject to the Romans; still

they are not yet quite under their sway on account of their

trust in the Germans, who are enemies to the Romans.

and returned. At a subsequent period, when Lysimachus

was waging war against the Getæ and their king Dromichætes, he not only incurred the risk,<note anchored="yes">Peter the Great, at the beginning of the last century, incurred the

some above this, and others nearer the sea. The Danube has

seven mouths, the largest is called the Sacred Mouth,<note anchored="yes">Ammianus Marcellinus, book xxii. chap. 8, gives the names of these

mouths. He calls the Sacred Mouth by the name of the island Peuce.</note> the

the rest are passed while sailing along towards the Dniester;

the seventh mouth is distant from this first mouth about 300

stadia. These mouths form several islands. The first three

mouths next after the Sacred Mouth are but small, the remainder are much less than it, but greater than any of the

three. Ephorus states that the Danube has five mouths.

Indeed the whole of the northern regions with which we are

acquainted, from Germany to the Caspian, is an extended

plain. Whether any dwell still farther than the Roxolani is

unknown to us. However, the Roxolani fought against the

generals of Mithridates Eupator. Their leader was Tasius.

They came as allies of Palacus, the son of Scilurus, and were

considered good soldiers, but against the serried and well-

armed phalanx every barbarous and light-armed tribe is

ineffective. Thus they, although numbering fifty thousand

men, could not withstand the six thousand arrayed by Diophantus, the general of Mithridates, but were almost all cut

to pieces. They make use of helmets and breastplates made

of untanned ox-hide. They bear wicker shields; and as

weapons, lances, the bow, and the sword, such as most of the

other barbarians do. The woollen tents of the nomades are

fixed upon their chariots, in which they pass their lives.

Their herds are scattered round their tents, and they live on

the milk, the cheese, and the meat which they supply. They

shift their quarters ever in search of pasture, changing the

places they have exhausted for others full of grass. In the

winter they encamp in the marshes near the Palus Mæotis,<note anchored="yes">The Sea of Zabache.</note>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It was formerly governed by its own laws, but after it

was ravaged by barbarous nations, the inhabitants were

obliged to elect as their protector, Mithridates Eupator, who

was anxious to direct his forces against the barbarians who

lived above the isthmus, and occupied the country as far as

the Dnieper and the Adriatic, and thus to prepare himself

against war with the Romans. Mithridates, with these views,

readily despatched an expedition into the Chersonesus, and

carried on war at the same time against the Scythians, Scilurus, and the sons of Scilurus, namely, Palacus and his brothers,

whom Posidonius reckons to have been fifty, and Apollonides

eighty, in number. By the subjugation of these enemies he

became at once master of the Bosporus, which Pairisades, who

held the command of it, voluntarily surrendered. From that

time to the present the city of the Chersonitæ has been subject to the princes of the Bosporus.
</p><p>Ctenus is equally distant from the city of the Chersonitæ,

<p>After leaving the above-mentioned mountainous district,

is the city Theodosia, situated on a plain; the soil is fertile,

and there is a harbour capable of containing a hundred vessels. This formerly was the boundary of the territory of the

</p><p>Panticæpsum is a hill inhabited all round for a circuit of

20 stadia. To the east it has a harbour, and docks capable

of containing about thirty vessels; there is also an acropolis.

It was founded by the Milesians. Both this place and the

neighbouring settlements on each side of the mouth of the

Palus Mæotis were for a long period under the monarchical

dynasty of Leucon, and Satyrus, and Pairisades, till the latter

surrendered the sovereignty to Mithridates. They had the



<pb n="477"/>



name of tyrants, although most of them were moderate and

just in their government, from the time of Pairisades and

Leucon. Pairisades was accounted even a god. The last

sovereign, whose name was also Pairisades, being unable to

resist the barbarians, by whom great and unusual tributes

were exacted, surrendered the kingdom into the hands of

Mithridates. After him it became subject to the Romans.

The greater portion of it is situated in Europe, but a part of

it is also situated in Asia.

<p>The mouth of the [Palus] Mæotis is called the Kimmerian Bosporus. The entrance, which at the broadest part

the north opposite into the lake, and into the Kimmerian

and there again into several others, which form the mouths of the river.

which are distant from each other about 60 stadia. There

is also a city of the same name as the river; and next to

Panticapæum it is the largest mart belonging to the barbarians.

opposite to it is a village situated in Asia, called Achilleum.

Thence to the Don, and to the island at its mouths, is a voyage

in a direct line of 2200 stadia. The distance is somewhat

greater if the voyage is performed along the coast of Asia, but

taking the left-hand side, (in which direction the isthmus of the

Chersonese is fallen in with,) the distance is more than tripled.

This latter course is along the desert shore of Europe, but the



<pb n="478"/>



Asiatic side is not without inhabitants. The whole circum-

ference of the lake is 9000 stadia.
</p><p>The Great Chersonesus resembles Peloponnesus both in

figure and size. The kings of the Bosporus possess it, but

the whole country has been devastated by continual wars.

They formerly possessed a small tract only at the mouth of

the [Palus] Mæotis near Panticapæum, extending as far as

Theodosia. The largest part of the territory, as far as the

isthmus and the Gulf Carcinites, was in possession of the

Tauri, a Scythian nation. The whole of this country, comprehending also a portion on the other side of the isthmus as

far as the Dnieper, was called Little Scythia. In consequence of the number of people who passed from thence

across the Dniester and the Danube, and settled there, no

small part of that country also bore the name of Little

Scythia. The Thracians surrendered a part of it to superior

force, and a part was abandoned on account of the bad quality

of the ground, a large portion of which is marshy.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Except the mountainous tract of the Chersonesus on the

sea-coast, extending as far as Theodosia, all the rest consist of

plains, the soil of which is rich, and remarkably fertile in corn.

It yields thirty-fold, when turned up by the most ordinary

implements of husbandry. The tribute paid to Mithridates

by the inhabitants, including that from the neighbourhood of

Sindace in Asia, amounted to 180,000 medimni of corn, and

200 talents of silver. The Greeks in former times imported

from this country corn, and the cured fish of Palus Mæotis.

Leucon is said to have sent to the Athenians 2,100,000 medimni of corn from Theodosia.<note anchored="yes">The amount is enormous, if it refers to the quantity of corn shipped

in a single year. Neither manuscripts nor translations afford any various

reading. The abbreviator, however, instead of 2,100,000, (<foreign lang="greek">muria/das</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">medi/mnwn diakosi/as kai/ de/ka,</foreign> gives 150,000 (<foreign lang="greek">medi/mnous MUPIADASIE.</foreign>)

But instead of correcting Strabo by his abbreviator, it is more probable

that the text of the latter should be changed to 2,100,000, or even to

2,150,000 (<foreign lang="greek">MUPIADAS SIE.</foreign>). Brequigny, by an oversight, or because

he thought proper to change the <foreign lang="greek">MUPIADAS</foreign> of the text to <foreign lang="greek">XILIADAS,</foreign>

translates 210,000 medimni. However it may be, we know from Demosthenes, that this same prince of the Bosporus mentioned by Strabo,

sent annually to Athens 400,000 medimni of corn, a quantity far below

that mentioned in the text. To reconcile these authors, Mr. Wolf supposes that we ought to understand by 2,100,000 medimni of corn, the

shipment made in the year of the great famine, which occurred in the

105th Olympiad, (about <date value="-360">360</date> B. C.,) and of which Demosthenes speaks

in a manner to give us to understand, that the quantity sent that year

by Leucon greatly exceeded that of former years. A very probable conjecture. <emph rend="ital">F. T.</emph> The medimnus was about 1 1/2 bushel.</note>

The name of Georgi, or husbandmen, was appropriately

given to these people, to distinguish them from the nations

situated above them, who are nomades, and live upon the

flesh of horses and other animals, on cheese of mares' milk,

milk, and sour milk. The latter, prepared in a peculiar manner, is a delicacy.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o)/yhma.</foreign></note> Hence the poet designates all the nations

in that quarter as Galactophagi, milk-eaters.
</p><p>The nomades are more disposed to war than to robbery.

The occasion of their contests was to enforce the payment of

tribute. They permit those to have land who are willing to

cultivate it. In return for the use of the land, they are satisfied with receiving a settled and moderate tribute, not such

as will furnish superfluities, but the daily necessaries of life.

If this tribute is not paid, the nomades declare war. Hence

the poet calls these people both just, and miserable, (Abii,)<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)bi/ous.</foreign></note>

for if the tribute is regularly paid, they do not have recourse

to war. Payment is not made by those, who have confidence

in their ability to repel attacks with ease, and to prevent the

incursion of their enemies. This course was pursued, as

Hypsicrates relates, by Ansander, who fortified on the isthmus of the Chersonesus, at the Palus Mæotis, a space of 360

stadia, and erected towers at the distance of every 10 stadia.<note anchored="yes">I have adopted the reading suggested by the F. T., <foreign lang="greek">Pu/o|gous kaq'</foreign>

There is a promontory, distant about 15 stadia from the

wall of Chersonesus, which forms a large bay, which bends

towards the city. Above this bay is a sea-lake, where there

are salt pits. Here was the harbour Ctenus. The generals

of the king, in order to strengthen their means of resistance

in case of siege, stationed a garrison on the above-mentioned

promontory, which was further protected by a fortification.

The mouth of the Gulf was closed by an embankment which

extended to the city, and was easily traversed on foot. The

garrison and the city were thus united. The Scythians were

afterwards easily repulsed. They attacked that part of the

wall built across the isthmus which touches upon Ctenus, and

filled the ditch with straw. The kind of bridge thus formed

by day, was burnt at night by the king's generals, who continued their resistance and defeated the enemy. At present

the whole country is subject to whomsoever the Romans may

appoint as king of the Bosporus.

<p>It is a custom peculiar to all the Scythian and Sarmatian

tribes, to castrate their horses, in order to make them more

tractable, for although they are small, yet they are spirited,

and difficult to manage. Stags and wild boars are hunted in

the marshes, and wild asses and roes<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">doo|ka/des.</foreign></note> in the plains. It is a

peculiarity of this country, that no eagles are to be found in

it. Among the quadrupeds there is an animal called Colus,

in size between a deer and a ram; it is white, and swifter in

speed than either of those animals. It draws up water into

the head through the nostrils; from this store it can supply

itself for several days, and live without inconvenience in

places destitute of water.
</p><p>Such is the nature of the whole of the country beyond the

Danube, lying between the Rhine and the Don, and extending as far as the Pontic Sea and the Palus Mæotis.

</p><p>This part contains Greece, Macedonia, Epirus, and the

The asphaltus is dug out of a neighbouring hill; the parts

excavated are replaced by fresh earth, which after a time are

<p>On the coast of Illyria, along its whole extent, and in

the neighbouring islands, there are numerous excellent harbours, contrary to what occurs on the opposite Italian coast,

where there are none. As in Italy, however, the climate is

warm, and the soil productive of fruits; olives also and vines

grow readily, except in some few excessively rugged places.

Although Illyria possesses these advantages, it was formerly

neglected, through ignorance, perhaps, of its fertility; but it

was principally avoided on account of the savage manners of

the inhabitants, and their piratical habits.
</p><p>The region situated above the sea-coast is mountainous,

cold, and at times covered with snow. The northern part is

still colder, so that vines are rarely to be met with either in

the hills or in the plains lower down. These mountain-plains

the south as far as the Dalmatians and Ardiæi. They terminate towards the north at the Ister, and approach towards

the east close to the Scordisci, who live near the Macedonian

and Thracian mountains.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Autariatæ were the most populous and the bravest

tribe of the Illyrians. Formerly, there were continual disputes between them and the Ardiæi respecting the salt which

was spontaneously formed on the confines of their respective

territories, in the spring season, from water which flows

through a valley. The salt concreted five days after the

water was drawn and deposited in reservoirs. The right of

collecting salt was, by agreement, to be exercised alternately

by each party, but the compact was broken and war was the

consequence. After the Autariatæ had subdued the Triballi,

a people whose territory extended a journey of fifteen days,

from the Agrianæ to the Danube, they became masters of the

Thracians and Illyrians. The Autariatæ were first conquered

by the Scordisci, and afterwards by the Romans, who overpowered the Scordisci, for a long time a powerful nation.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This people inhabited the country on the banks of the

Danube, and were divided into two tribes, the Great and the

Little Scordisci.<note anchored="yes">The Agrianæ occupied the neighbourhood of Mount Pangæus on the

confines of Thrace and Macedonia. The Triballi, at the time alluded to

by Strabo, possessed nearly the whole of the country included between

the Adriatic and the Euxine. The Scordisci, who were at first confined

to the territory situated between the Drave and the Save, in their turn

took possession of all this country. It is not possible, in consequence of

the continual wars which existed amongst these people, to determine with

exactness the places which they successively occupied. G.</note> The former occupied the space between two

rivers, which empty themselves into the Danube, the Noarus,<note anchored="yes">Probably the Save. G.</note>

which runs beside Segestica, and the Margus, or, as some

call it, Bargus. The Little Scordisci lived beyond this river

close to the Triballi and Mysi.<note anchored="yes">Mædi.</note> The Scordisci possessed some

of the islands also. They increased so much in strength and

numbers as to advance even to the Illyrian, Pæonian, and

Capedunum.<note anchored="yes">Cities not identified.</note>

Coralli, and Bessi, and some tribes of Mædi and of Dantheletæ. All these nations are very much addicted to robbery.

The Bessi possess far the greatest part of Mount Hæmus,

and are called Robbers from their mode of life as free-booters.

Some of them live in huts and lead a life of hardship. They

extend close to Rhodope, the Pæeones, and to the Illyrian nations; to the Autariatæ also, and the Dardanians. Between

these and the Ardiæi are the Dasaretii, Hybrianes, and other

obscure nations, whose numbers the Scordisci were continually

reducing, until they had made the country a desert, full of

impassable forests, which extended several days' journey.

<p>OF the country situated between the Danube and the

mountains on each side of Pæonia, there remains to be described the Pontic coast, which reaches from the Sacred

mouth of the Danube to the mountainous district about Hæ-

mus, and to the mouth of the Pontus at Byzantium. As in

describing the Illyrian coast we had proceeded as far as the

Ceraunian mountains, which, although they stretch beyond

the mountainous district of Illyria, yet constitute a sort of

proper boundary, we determined by means of these mountains

the limits of the nations in the inland parts, considering, that

such separating lines would be better marks both for our present and future use; so here also the coast, although it may

fall beyond the mountainous line, will still end at a proper

kind of limit, the mouth of the Pontus, which will be useful

both for our present and our future descriptions.
</p><p>If we set out from the Sacred mouth of the Danube, having

on the right hand the continuous line of coast, we find at the

and the temple of the Chalcedonians, where is the narrowest

part of the mouth of the Euxine Sea. For proceeding onwards 10 stadia there is a promontory, which reduces the

<p>From the promontory, then, that reduces the strait to

Horn, close to the walls of Byzantium, is a bay, extending

westwards 60 stadia, and resembling a stag's horn, for it is

divided into a great many bays, like so many branches. The

Pelamides<note anchored="yes">In Italian, Pelamide, or Palamide, well known in the Mediterranean.

of their great number, and the force of the current, which

drives them together in a body; and also on account of the

narrowness of the bays, which is such that they are caught

even by the hand. These fish are bred in the marshes of the

Mæotis. When they have attained a little size and strength,

they rush through the mouth in shoals, and are carried along

the Asiatic coast as far as Trapezus and Pharnacia. It is

here that the fishery begins, but it is not carried on to any

considerable extent, because the fish are not of a proper size at

this place. When they get as far as Sinope, they are in better

season for the fishery, and for the purpose of salting. But

when they have reached and passed the Cyaneæ, a white rock

projects from the Chalcedonian shore, which alarms the fish,

so that they immediately turn away to the opposite coast.

There they are caught by the stream, and the nature of the

places being such as to divert the current of the sea in that

part towards Byzantium, and the Horn near it, the fish are

impelled thither in a body, and afford to the Byzantines, and

to the Roman people, a large revenue. The Chalcedonians,

however, although situated near, and on the opposite side,

have no share of this supply, because the Pelamides do not

approach their harbours.
</p><p>After the foundation of Chalcedon, Apollo is said to have

enjoined the founders of Byzantium, in answer to their in-

quiries, to build their city opposite to the Blind, applying this

name to the Chalcedonians, who, although they were the first

persons to arrive in these parts, had omitted to take possession

of the opposite side, which afforded such great resources of

wealth, and chose the barren coast.
</p><p>We have continued our description to Byzantium, because

this celebrated city,<note anchored="yes">The ancient Byzantium, there are grounds for believing, was marked

<p>THESE are the nations, bounded by the Danube and by the

Illyrian and Thracian mountains, which are worthy of record.

They occupy the whole coast of the Adriatic Sea, beginning

from the recess of the gulf, and the left side, as it is called,

of the Euxine Sea, from the river Danube to Byzantium.
</p><p>The southern parts of the above-mentioned mountainous

who founded Ellopia in Eubœa, and gave the name to the whole island.</note>

Thracians, Illyrians, and Epirotæ are settled even at present

on the sides of Greece. Formerly the territory they possessed

was more extensive, although even now the barbarians possess

a large part of the country, which, without dispute, is Greece.

Macedonia is occupied by Thracians, as well as some parts of

Thessaly; the country above Acarnania and Ætolia, by Thesproti, Cassopæi, Amphilochi, Molotti, and Athamanes, Epirotic tribes.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We have already spoken of the Pelasgi.<note anchored="yes">B. v. c. ii. § 4.</note> Some writers

conjecture that the Leleges and Carians are the same people;

others, that they were only joint settlers, and comrades in

the places about Ida near the rivers Pedasus and Satnioeis.
</p><p>The fact of the association of these people with the Carians

may be regarded as a proof of their being barbarians, and

Aristotle, in his Politics, shows that they were a wandering

nation, sometimes in company with the Carians, sometimes

alone, and that from ancient times; for, in speaking of the

polity of the Acarnanians, he says that the Curetes occupied

a part of the country, and the Leleges (and after them the

Teleboæ) the western side. On the subject of the Ætolian

polity, he calls the present Locri, Leleges, and observes that

they occupy Bœotia. He repeats the same remark on the

subject of the polity of the Opuntians and Megareans. In

speaking of the polity of the Leucadians, he mentions an aboriginal by name, Leleges, and a grandson by his daughter

of the name of Teleboas, and besides two and twenty of his

sons of the name of Teleboas, some of whom inhabited Lucas.

But we should chiefly rely upon Hesiod, who thus speaks

of them:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">For Locrus was the leader of the nation of the Leleges, whom Jupiter,

the son of Saturn, in his infinite wisdom, once gave as subjects to Deucalion, a people gathered from among the nations of the earth.</q></quote>



For it seems to me to be obscurely intimated by the etymology

of the name, Leleges, that they were a mixed people anciently

collected together, which had become extinct. And this

may be said of the Caucones, who exist no where at present,

yet were formerly settled in several places.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Although Greece was formerly composed of small nations, many in number, and obscure; nevertheless their valour, and their separate government by kings, prevented any

difficulty in defining their boundaries. As the greatest part

of the country, however, is at present uninhabited, and the

settlements, especially the cities, have been destroyed, it would

be of no service, even if it were possible, to ascertain the

names of cities and regions occupied by obscure and extinct

people. This destruction, which began a long time since, still

continues in many parts in consequence of rebellion. It has

been checked by the Romans, who accepted the supreme authority from the inhabitants and lodged soldiers in their houses.

I shall endeavour, as far as it is compatible with the design

the whole of Peloponnesus on the right hand.
</p><p>The country, from the commencement of the Macedonian

and Pæonian mountains, as far as the river Strymon,<note anchored="yes">Iemboli.</note> is inhabited by Macedonians, and Pæones, and some of the Thracian mountain tribes. But all the country on the other side

the Strymon, as far as the mouth of the Euxine Sea, and

Mount Hæmus,<note anchored="yes">Balkan applies to the whole mountainous range of Hæmus; Emineh

to the part bordering on the Black Sea.</note> belong to the Thracians, except the coast,

which is occupied by Greeks, some of whom are settled on

the Propontis,<note anchored="yes">Sea of Marmora.</note> others on the Hellespont and on the Gulf

Melas,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Saros.</note> and others on the Ægean Sea.
</p><p>The Ægean Sea waters two sides of Greece; first, the

eastern side, extending from the promontory Sunium<note anchored="yes">Cape Colonna.</note> to the

north as far as the Thermæan Gulf, and Thessalonica, a Mace-

donian city, which has, at present, the largest population in

these parts. Then the southern side, which is a part of

Macedonia, extending from Thessalonica to the Strymon.

Some writers assign the coast from the Strymon as far as

Nestus<note anchored="yes">Karasu, or Mesta.</note> to Macedonia. For Philip showed the greatest solicitude to obtain, and at length appropriated it to himself. He

raised a very large revenue from the mines, and from other

sources which the richness of the country afforded.
</p><p>From Sunium to the Peloponnesus are the Myrtoan, the

Cretan, and the Libyan Seas, together with the Gulfs, as far

as the Sicilian Sea, which consist of the Gulfs of Ambracia,

of Corinth, and of Crissa.

<p>Theopompus says, that there are fourteen Epirotic nations. Of these, the most celebrated are the Chaones and

Molotti, because the whole of Epirus was at one time subject, first to Chaones, afterwards to Molotti. Their power

was greatly strengthened by the family of their kings being

descended from the Æacidæ, and because the ancient and

famous oracle of Dodona<note anchored="yes">The site of Dodona is unknown.</note> was in their country. Chaones,

Thesproti, and next after these Cassopæi, (who are Thes-

Ceraunian mountains to the Ambracian Gulf.
</p><p>The voyage commencing from the Chaones eastward towards

the Gulfs of Ambracia and Corinth, and having the Ausonian

Sea on the right, and Epirus on the left, comprises <date value="1300">1300</date> stadia

to the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf. In this interval is Panormus,<note anchored="yes">Panormo.</note> a large port in the middle of the Ceraunian mountains. Next to this is Onchesmus,<note anchored="yes">Santi Quaranta.</note> another harbour, opposite

which is called Phalacrum. Next after Onchesmus are Posidium, and Buthrotum,<note anchored="yes">Butrinto.</note> (which is situated upon the mouth

of the lake Pelodes, in a spot of a peninsula form, and has a

islands at a little distance from Epirus, lying near Leucimme,<note anchored="yes">C. Bianco.</note>

the eastern promontory of Corcyra. There are also other

small islands, not worthy of notice, which are met with along

the coast.
</p><p>Next is the promontory Chimerium, and a harbour called

Glycys-Limen, [or Sweet Harbour,] where the river Acheron,

which receives several other rivers, empties itself and renders

fresh the water of the gulf. The Thyamus<note anchored="yes">The Thyamus, or Thyamis, is now called Glycys, and the Acheron,

Above this gulf is situated Cichyrus, formerly Ephyra, a city

of the Thesproti, and above the gulf at Buthrotum, Phœnice.<note anchored="yes">Sopoto.</note>

Near Cichyrus is Buchetium, a small city of the Cassopæi,

situated at a little distance from the sea; Elatria, Pandosia,

and Batiæ are in the inland parts. Their territory extends

as far as the gulf. Next after the harbour Glycys-Limen are

two others, Comarus,<note anchored="yes">Porto Fanari.</note> the nearest and smallest, forming an

isthmus of 60 stadia, near the Ambracian Gulf and Nicopolis,<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Nicopolis are to the north of Prevesa.</note>

founded by Augustus Cæsar; the other, the more distant and

which is a little more than four stadia in width. The circuit

of the gulf is 400 stadia, and the whole has good harbours.

On sailing into it, on the right hand are the Acarnanes, who

are Greeks; and here near the entrance of the gulf is a temple of Apollo Actius, situated on an eminence; in the plain

the most western of the streams which flow into the gulf, and the ancient

city was situated at about 15 miles from the mouth. The Loru (the Arathus); the Mauro Potamo or Glykys (the Acheron); the Zagura (the

Selleis?) which falls into it; and the Tercino, which falls into the Kalamas, (the Thyamis or Thyamus,) all rise in the mountain ridge Olytkiza, about 10 miles to the west of Ianina.</note> is situated a little above the recess of

the bay, and was founded by Gorgus, (Torgus, Tolgus,) the

son of Cypselus. The river Arathus flows beside it, which

may be navigated up the stream to the city, a distance of a

few stadia. It rises in Mount Tymphe, and the Paroræa.

This city was formerly in a very flourishing condition, and

hence the gulf received its name from the city. Pyrrhus,

however, embellished it more than any other person, and made

it a royal residence. In later times,<note anchored="yes">Livy xxxviii. c. 3.</note> the Macedonians and

Romans harassed this and other cities by continual wars,

caused by the refractory disposition of the inhabitants, so

that Augustus, at length perceiving that these cities were

entirely deserted, collected their remaining inhabitants into

one city, which he called Nicopolis, situated upon the gulf.

He called it after the victory which he obtained in front of



<pb n="499"/>



the gulf, over Antony, and Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt,

who was present in the engagement.
</p><p>Nicopolis is well peopled, and is improving every day. It

has a large territory, and is adorned with the spoils of war.

In the suburbs is a sacred enclosure; part of it is a grove,

containing a gymnasium and a stadium, intended for the celebration of quinquennial games; the other part, on a rising

ground overhanging the grove, is sacred to Apollo. The

Olympian game, called the Actia,<note anchored="yes">Virg. Æn. iii. 280.</note> is instituted there in honour

of Apollo Actius. It is under the superintendence of the

Lacedæmonians. The other surrounding settlements are dependent on Nicopolis. The Actian games<note anchored="yes">Virg. Æn. iii. 280.</note> were formerly

celebrated in honour of the god by the neighbouring people;

it was a contest in which the victor was crowned; but Cæsar

has conferred on it greater honours.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Ambracia follows the Amphilochian Argos, founded

by Alcmæon and his sons. According to Ephorus, Alcmæon,

after the expedition of the Epigoni<note anchored="yes">Descendants of the seven chiefs who fought and perished before

Thebes.</note> against Thebes, upon the

solicitation of Diomed, accompanied him in his invasion of

Ætolia, and obtained joint possession of this country and of

Acarnania. When Agamemnon invited them to come to the

siege of Troy, Diomed went, but Alcmaeon remained in

Acarnania, founded Argos, and gave it the name Amphilochian, after his brother Amphilochus. On the same authority

the river Inachus, which flows through the country and empties itself into the bay, received its name from the river in

the Argive territory. Thucydides, however, says that Amphilochus himself, upon his return from Troy, dissatisfied with

the state of things at Argos, passed over into Acarnania, and

having succeeded to the dynasty of his brother, founded the

city which is called after his name.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Amphilochians are Epirotæ, as also are those nations

who inhabit a rugged country situated above and close to the

Illyrian mountains, the Molotti, Athamanes, Æthices, Tymphæi, Orestæ Paroræi, and Atintanes, some of whom approach

nearer to Macedonia, others to the Ionian Gulf. It is said

that Orestes possessed the territory Orestias at the time of

his flight, after the murder of his mother, and left the country



<pb n="500"/>



bearing his name, where also he had built a city called Orestic

Argos. With these people are intermixed Illyrian nations,

some of whom are situated on the southern part of the mountainous district, and others above the Ionian Gulf. For above

Epidamnus and Apollonia, as far as the Ceraunian mountains,

live the Bulliones, Taulantii, Parthini, and Brygi.<note anchored="yes">These nations are mentioned by other authors; they were probably

separated by the numerous mountain ridges to the west of Pindus. See

below, § 9. But compare D Anville and the Austrian military map.</note>
</p><p>Somewhere near are the silver mines of Damastium. Here

the Perisadyes had established their sway, and Enchelii, who

are also called Sesarethii. Then come the Lyncestæ, the territory Deuriopus, Pelagonia-Tripolitis, the Eordi, Elimia,

and Eratyra. Formerly each of these nations was under its

own prince. The chiefs of the Enchelii were descendants of

Cadmus and Harmonia, and scenes of the fables respecting

these persons are shown in the territory. This nation, therefore, was not governed by native princes. The Lyncestæ

were under Arrhabæus, who was of the race of the Bacchiadæ. Irra was his daughter, and his grand-daughter was

Eurydice, the mother of Philip Amyntas.
</p><p>The Molotti also were Epirotæ, and were subjects of Pyrrhus Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, and of his descendants,

who were Thessalians. The rest were governed by native

princes. Some tribes were continually endeavouring to obtain the mastery over the others, but all were finally subdued

by the Macedonians, except a few situated above the Ionian

Gulf. They gave the name of Upper Macedonia to the

country about Lyncestis, Pelagonia, Orestias, and Elimia.

Later writers called it Macedonia the Free, and some extend

the name of Macedonia to all the country as far as Corcyra,

at the same time assigning as their reasons, the mode of cutting their hair, their language, the use of the chlamys, and

similar things in which they resemble the Macedonians; some

of them, however, speak two languages. On the dissolution

of the Macedonian empire, they fell under the power of the

Romans.
</p><p>The Egnatian Way, from Epidamnus and Apollonia, passes

through the territory of these people. Near the road to Candavia are the lakes about Lychnidus, which furnish large

supplies of fish for salting, and rivers, some of which empty

themselves into the Ionian Gulf. Some flow towards the

south, as the Inachus, the Arathus, (Ratoiis,) the Achelous,

and the Evenus, formerly called Lycormas. The Ratous discharges its waters into the Ambracian Gulf, the Inachus into

the Achelous, the Achelous itself into the sea, as also the

Evenus; the former traverses Acarnania, the latter Ætolia.

The Erigon, after having received many streams which flow

from the Illyrian mountains, and through the territories of

Lyncestæ, Brygi, Deuriopes, and Pelagonians, empties itself

into the Axius.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There were formerly cities among these nations. The

district Pelagonia-Tripolitis contained (as the name signifies)

three cities, of which Azorus was one. All the cities of the

Deuriopes were situated on the banks of the Erigon; among

which were Bryanium, Alalcomenæ,<note anchored="yes">Alcomene.</note> and Stymbara.<note anchored="yes">Styberra, <emph rend="ital">Polyb.;</emph> Stubera, <emph rend="ital">Liv.;</emph> Stobera, <emph rend="ital">Suid.</emph></note> Cydriæ

belonged to the Brygi, and Æginium on the confines of Æthicia, and Tricca, to the Tymphæi. Near Macedonia and Thessalia, about the mountains Pœus and Pindus, are the Æthices,

and the sources of the Peneus, which are a subject of dispute

between the Tymphei and the Thessalians, who are situated

below Pindus.
</p><p>On the banks of the river Ion is Oxynia, a city distant from

Azorus in the Tripolitis 120 stadia. Near Oxynia are Alalcomenæ, Æginium, Europus, and the confluence of the Ion

with the Peneus.
</p><p>At that time then, as I said before, the whole of Epirus

and Illyria were well peopled, although the country is rugged

and full of mountains, such as Tomarus, and Polyanus, and

many others. At present the greater part is uninhabited, and

the inhabited parts are left in the state of villages, or in ruins.

Even the oracle at Dodona has almost been deserted, like the

rest.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This oracle, according to Ephorus, was established by

Pelasgi, who are said to be the most ancient people that were

sovereigns in Greece. Thus the poet speaks,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>O great Pelasgic Dodonæan Jove;<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote></quote><bibl>Iliad, book xvi. 233.</bibl></cit></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Iliad, book xvi. 233.</bibl></cit>



and Hesiod,



<quote><lg>

<l>He went to Dodona, the dwelling of the Pelasgi, and to the beech tree.</l></lg></quote>



<pb n="502"/>



I have spoken of the Pelasgi in the account of Tyr-

rhenia.
</p><p>With respect to Dodona, Homer clearly intimates that the

people who lived about the temple were barbarians, from their

mode of life, describing them as persons who do not wash

their feet, and who sleep on the ground. Whether we should

read Helli, with Pindar, or Selli, as it is conjectured the word

existed in Homer, the ambiguity of the writing does not

permit us to affirm confidently. Philochorus says, that the

country about Dodona was called, like Eubœa, Hellopia; for

these are the words of Hesiod,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">There is a country Hellopia, rich in corn-fields and pastures; at its

extremity is built Dodona.</q></quote>



It is supposed, says Apollodorus, that it had this name from

the <q direct="unspecified">hele,</q> or marshes about the temple. He is of opinion

that the poet did not call the people about the temple Helli,

but Selli, adding, that Homer mentions a certain river (near)

of the name of Selleis. He specifies the name in this line,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">At a distance far from Ephyra, from the river Selleis.</q></quote>



[Demetrius of Skepsis contends that] Ephyra of Thesprotia

is not here meant, but Ephyra of Elis. For the river Selleis

is in Elis, and there is no river of this name either in Thesprotia or among the Molotti. The fable of the oak and the

doves, and other similar things, like the stories connected with

Delphi, although they are subjects more adapted to engage

the attention of a poet, yet are appropriate to the description

of the country with which we are now occupied.
</p><p>Dodona was formerly subject to the Thesproti, as was the

mountain Tomarus, or Tmarus, (both names are in use,) be

low which the temple is situated. The tragic writers and

Pindar give the epithet of Thesprotis to Dodona. It was said

to be subject, in later times, to the Molotti. Those called by

the poet Jove's interpreters,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">u\poqh=tai.</foreign></note> and described by him as men

with unwashen feet, who slept on the ground, were, it is said

called Tomuri<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tomou=o|oi.</foreign></note> from Mount Tomarus, and the passage in the
</p><p>Odyssey containing the advice of Amphinomus to the suitors



<pb n="503"/>



not to attack Telemachus before they had inquired of Jupiter

is as follows,



<cit><quote><q direct="unspecified">If the Tomuri of great Jove approve, I myself will kill him, and I

will order all to join in the deed; but if the god forbid it, I command to

withhold.</q></quote><bibl>Odys. xvi. 403.</bibl></cit>


For it is better, it is asserted, to write Tomuri<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tomou/o|ous.</foreign></note> than The-

Mistæ,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">qe/mistas.</foreign></note> because in no passage whatever are oracles called by

the poet Themistæ, this term being applied to decrees,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">boulai/.</foreign></note> or

statutes and rules of civil government; and the persons are

called Tomuri,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tomou/o|ous.</foreign></note> which is the contracted form of Tomaruri,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tomao|ou/o|ous.</foreign></note> or

guardians of Tomarus.
</p><p>In Homer, however, we must understand <foreign lang="greek">qe/mistes</foreign> in a

more simple sense, and, like <foreign lang="greek">boulai/,</foreign> by the figure Catachresis,

as meaning commands and oracular injunctions as well as

laws; for such is the import of this line:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">To listen to<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">boulh\n.</foreign></note> the will of Jove, which comes forth from the lofty and verdant oak.</q></quote>

common temple with Jupiter.
</p><p>Suidas, in order to court the favour of the Thessalians by

fabulous stories, says, that the temple was transported from

Scotussa of the Thessalian Pelasgiotis, accompanied by a great

multitude, chiefly of women, whose descendants are the present

<p>THE oracle was formerly at Scotussa, a city of Pelasgiotis,

but was transferred to Dodona by the command of Apollo,

after some persons had burnt down the tree. The oracular

answers were not conveyed by words, but by certain signs, as

at the oracle of Ammon in Libya. Probably the three doves

made some peculiar flight, which, observed by the priestesses,

suggested the oracular answer. Some say that, in the language of the Molotti and Thesprote, old women are called

<q direct="unspecified">peliæ,</q> and old men <q direct="unspecified">pelii,</q> so that the celebrated doves

were probably not birds, but three old women who passed an

<p>Among the Thesprotæ and Molotti old women are called

<p>The proverb, <q direct="unspecified">The brazen vessel of Dodona,</q> thus arose.

In the temple was a brazen vessel, having over it a statue of

a man (an offering of the Corcyræans) grasping in the hand

a brazen scourge of three thongs, woven in chains, from which

were suspended small bones. The bones striking continually

upon the brazen vessel, whenever they were agitated by the

wind, produced a long protracted sound, so that a person from

the beginning to the end of the vibrations might proceed to

count as far as four hundred. Whence also came the proverb,

divisions bear various names. The Ægean, Ambracian, and

Ionian Seas are said to be distinguishable from the highest

elevations, but this appears to me to be an extravagant assertion; for Pteleum rises to a considerable height, and is situated near the Ambracian Gulf, stretching on one side to the

<p>Of Europe, there remains Macedonia, and the parts of

Thrace contiguous to it, extending to Byzantium, Greece

also, and the adjacent islands: indeed, Macedonia is a part of

Greece. Following, however, the natural character of the

country and its form, we have determined to separate it

from Greece, and to unite it with Thrace, which borders upon

it.——Strabo, after a few remarks, mentions Cypsela<note anchored="yes">Ipsala.</note> and the

river Hebrus.<note anchored="yes">The Maritza.</note> He also describes a parallelogram in which is

placed the whole of Macedonia. E.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Macedonia is bounded on the west by the sea-coast of

the Adriatic; on the east by a meridian line parallel to this

coast, passing through the mouth of the river Hebrus, and the

city Cypsela; on the north by an imaginary straight line passing through the mountains Bertiscus, Scardus,<note anchored="yes">Schardagh.</note> Orbelus,<note anchored="yes">Egrisoudagh.</note>

Rhodope,<note anchored="yes">Despotodagh.</note> and Hæmus.<note anchored="yes">Velikidagh.</note> For these mountains extend in a

forming towards the south a great peninsula, which comprehends Thrace, Macedonia, Epirus, and Achaia. On the south,

Macedonia is bounded by the Egnatian Way, which goes from

Dyrrachium eastwards to Thessalonica, and thus has very

nearly the form of a parallelogram. EPIT.

<p>The country now called Macedonia was formerly called

Emathia. It acquired this name from Macedon, one of its

ancient princes. There was also a city Emathia near the sea.

The country was occupied by some of the Epirotæ and Illyrians, but the greatest part by Bottiæi and Thracians. The

Bottiæi were of Cretan origin, and came under the command

of Botton; the Pieres, who were Thracians, inhabited Pieria

and the parts about Olympus; the Pæonians, the borders of

the river Axius, from whence the region was called Amphaxitis; the Edoni and Bisalti, the rest of the country as far as

the Strymon. The Bisalti retained their name, but the Edoni

went under the various names of Mygdones, Edoni, (Odones?)

and Sithones. Of all these people, the Argeadæ and the

Chalcidenses of Eubœa became the chief. The Chalcidenses

came from Eubœa into the territory of the Sithones, and there

founded about thirty cities. They were subsequently driven

out by the Sithones, but the greater part of them collected

together into a single city, namely, Olynthus.<note anchored="yes">Above Agios-Mamas, in the Bay of Cassandra.</note> They had the

<p>The Peneus separates Lower Macedonia and the seaboard from Thessaly and Magnesia. The Haliacmon is the

<p>If a line is drawn from the recess of the Thermaic

Gulf, on the sea-coast of Macedonia, and from Thessalonica,

Thracian Chersonese, an angle will be made in the recess.

Macedonia extends in both directions, and we must begin with

the line first mentioned. The first part of it has beyond it

Attica with Megaris to the Crissæan Bay. Next succeeds

the sea-coast of Bœotia near Eubea. Above Eubœa an the

<p>From these reefs, says Strabo, we shall first mark the

boundaries of those who live about the river Peneus and

Haliacmon near the sea. The Peneus flows from Mount

Pindus through the middle of Thrace eastwards; passing

through the cities of the Lapithæ and some of the cities of the

Perrhæbi, it arrives at the vale of Tempe, having in its course

received the waters of several rivers: of these, the Europus

(Eurotas) is one, called by the poet Titaresius. It rises from

Titarius, (Titarus,) a mountain continuous with Olympus,

which at this point first begins to mark the boundary between

Macedonia and Thessaly. Tempe is a narrow valley between

Olympus and Ossa. The Peneus continues its course from

<p>Beneath Olympus is Dium; near it is a village, Pimplea, where it is said Orpheus lived. He was a Cicon (of the

people about him by the practice of music and witchcraft, and

by the introduction of mysterious ceremonies in religious

worship. After a time, obtaining a greater degree of self-

importance, he collected a multitude of followers, and acquired

influence. He had many willing followers, but becoming

suspected by a few of entertaining secret designs, and of an

intention of taking forcible possession of power, he was attacked by them and put to death. Near this place is Libethra. E.

<p>After Dium follow the mouths of the Haliacmon;

then Pydna, Methone, Alorus, and the rivers Erigon and Ludias. The Ludias flows from Triclari, through the Oresti and

the Pellæan country (Pelagonia): leaving the city on the left

it falls into the Axius. The Ludias is navigable up the stream

to Pella 120 stadia. Methone is situated in the middle, about

40 stadia distant from Pydna, and 70 stadia from Alorus.

Alorus is situated in the farthest recess of the Thermæan

Gulf. It was called Thessalonica on account of the splendid

[victory obtained over the Thessalians]. Alorus is considered

as belonging to Bottiæa and Pydna to Pieria. Pella is in

Lower Macedonia, which was in possession of the Bottiæi.

Here was formerly the Macedonian Treasury. Philip, who

was brought up in this place, raised it from an inconsiderable

city to some importance. It has a citadel situated on a lake

called Ludias. From this lake issues the river Ludias, which

is filled by a branch of the Axius. The Axius discharges

itself between Chalastra and Therma. Near this river is a

fortified place, now called Abydos; Homer calls it Amydon,

and says that the Pæonians came from hence to assist the

Trojans during the siege of Troy.

nearly 26 cities in the district of Crucis, and on the Thermræan Gulf, collecting the inhabitants into one city. It is the

metropolis of the present Macedonia. The cities transferred

to Thessalonica were Apollonia, Chalastra, Therma, Garescus, Ænea, and Cissus. Cissus, it is probable, belonged to

the river Axius the sea-coast on the north of the gulf bears

the name of Pieria, on which is situated the city Pydna, now

called Citrum. Then follow Methone and the river Alorus;

then the rivers Erigon and Ludias. From Ludias to the city

Pella the river is navigated upwards to the distance of 20

stadia. Methone is distant from Pydna 40 stadia, and 70

stadia from Alorus. Pydna is a Pierian, Alorus a Bottiæan

city. In the plain of Pydna the Romans defeated Perseus,

and put an end to the Macedonian empire. In the plain of

Methone, during the siege of the city, Philip Amyntas accidentally lost his right eye by an arrow discharged from a

catapult. EPIT.

<p>Philip, who was brought up at Pella, formerly a small

branch of the river Axius. Next follows the Axius, which

separates the territory of Bottiæa and Amphaxitis, and after

receiving the river Erigon, issues out between Chalestra and

Therme. On the river Axius is a place which Homer calls

Amydon, and says that the Pæones set out thence as auxiliaries to Troy:

<p>The city Acanthus, on the Singitic Gulf, is a maritime

Dium, Cleonæ, Thyssos, Olophyxis, Acrothoi, which is situated near the summit of Athos. Mount Athos is pap-shaped,

very pointed, and of very great height. Those who live upon

the summit see the sun rise three hours before it is visible on

the sea-shore. The voyage round the peninsula, from the

city Acanthus to the city Stagirus, the birth-place of Aristotle, is 400 stadia. It has a harbour called Caprus, and a

small island of the same name. Then follow the mouths of

the Strymon; then Phagres, Galepsus, and Apollonia, all of

them cities; then the mouth of the Nestus, which is the

boundary of Macedonia and Thrace, as settled, in their own

times, by Philip and Alexander his son. There are about the

Strymonic Gulf other cities also, as Myrcinus, Argilus, Drabescus, and Datum, which has an excellent and most productive soil, dock-yards for ship-building, and gold mines;

<p>Mount Athos is pap-shaped, and so lofty that the husbandmen on the summit are already weary of their labour,

the sun having long since risen to them, when to the inhabitants of the shore it is the beginning of cockcrowing. Thamyris, the Thracian, was king of this coast, and followed the

same practices as Orpheus. Here also, at Acanthus, is seen

the canal, which Xerxes is said to have made, and through

which he is said to have brought the sea from the Strymonic

Gulf, across the isthmus. Demetrius of Skepsis is of opinion

that this canal was not navigable; for, says he, the ground is

composed of deep earth, and admits of being dug for a distance

of 10 stadia only: the canal is a plethrum in width; then follows a high, broad, and flat rock, nearly a stadium in length,

which prevents excavation throughout the whole distance to

the sea. And even if the work could be carried on so far

across, yet it could not be continued to a sufficient depth, so

as to present a navigable passage. Here Alexarchus, the son

of Antipater, built the city Uranopolis, 30 stadia in circumference.
</p><p>This peninsula was inhabited by Pelasgi from Lemnos; they

were distributed into five small cities, Cleonæ, Olophyxis,

Acrothoi, Dium, Thyssos. After Athos comes the Strymonic

Gulf, extending to the river Nestus, which forms the boundary of Macedonia, as settled by Philip and Alexander. Accurately speaking, there is a promontory forming a gulf with

Athos, on which is the city Apollonia. First in the gulf, after the harbour of Acanthus, is Stagira, now deserted: it was

one of the Chalcidic cities, and the birth-place of Aristotle.

Caprus was the harbour, and there is a small island of the

same name. Then comes the Strymon, and Amphipolis, at

the distance of 20 stadia up the river. In this part is situated

an Athenian colony, called Ennea-Odoi (the Nine-Ways).

The country beyond the Strymon, which borders upon the

sea and includes the parts about Datum, is occupied by Odomantes, Edoni, and Bisaltæ, some of whom are an indigenous

government of Rhesus. Above Amphipolis live the Bisaltæ,

extending to the city Heraclea (Sintica); they occupy a fertile valley, through which passes the Strymon, which rises

among the Agrianes near Rhodope. Near the Agrianes is

situated Parorbelia of Macedonia. In the interior, in a valley,

which commences at Idomene, are situated Callipolis, Orthopolis, Philipopolis, and Garescus. Among the Bisaltæ, proceeding up the river Strymon, is situated Berga, a village,

distant from Amphipolis about 200 stadia. Proceeding northwards from Heraclea, and to the narrows, through which the

Strymon flows, keeping the river on the right, first on the

are the mountains Hæmus and Rhodope, with the adjacent

parts. On this side of the Strymon, close upon the river,

is Scotussa; near the lake Bolbe is Arethusa; the inhabitants

above the lake are chiefly Mygdones. Not only is the course

Bridge it is 170 stadia; after Sestos it is 280 stadia to Ægospotamos: it is a small city in ruins. At this place a stone is

said to have fallen from heaven during the Persian war.

Then Callipolis, from whence to Lampsacus in Asia is a

passage across of 40 stadia; then a small city Crithote in

ruins; then Pactya; next Macron-Tichos, and Leuce-Acte,

and Hieron-Oros, and Perinthus, a colony of the Samians;

then Selybria. Above these places is situated Silta. Sacred

rites are performed in honour of Hieron-Oros by the natives,

which is as it were the citadel of the country. It discharges

asphaltus into the sea. Proconnesus here approaches nearest

the continent, being 120 stadia distant; there is a quarry of

white marble in it, which is plentiful and of good quality;

after Selybria the rivers Athyras and [Bathynias]; then Byzantium and the parts reaching to the Cyanean rocks. E.

<p>From Perinthus to Byzantium it is 630 stadia; from

the Hebrus and Cypseli to Byzantium and the Cyanean rocks

it is, according to Artemidorus, 3100 stadia. The whole distance from Apollonia on the Ionian Gulf to Byzantium is

7320 stadia; Polybius makes this distance 180 stadia more,

by the addition of a third of a stadium to the sum of 8 stadia,

which compose a mile. Demetrius of Skepsis, in his account

of the disposition of the Trojan forces, says that it is 700

stadia from Perinthus to Byzantium, and the same distance

to Parium. He makes the length of the Propontis to be <date value="1400">1400</date>

and the breadth 500 stadia; the narrowest part also of the

Hellespont to be 7 stadia, and the length 400. E.

<p>All writers do not agree in their description of the

Hellespont, and many opinions are advanced on the subject.

Some describe the Propontis to be the Hellespont; others, that

part of the Propontis which is to the south of Perinthus; others

include a part of the exterior sea which opens to the Ægæan

and the Gulf Melas, each assigning different limits. Some

make their measurement from Sigeum to Lampsacus, and

Cyzicus, and Parium, and Priapus; and one is to be found

who measures from Singrium, a promontory of Lesbos. Some

do not hesitate to give the name of Hellespont to the whole

distance as far as the Myrtoan Sea, because (as in the Odes

of Pindar) when Hercules sailed from Troy through the vir-

gin strait of Hella, and arrived at the Myrtoan Sea, he returned back to Cos, in consequence of the wind Zephyrus

blowing contrary to his course. Thus some consider it correct to apply the name Hellespont to the whole of the Ægæan

Sea, and the sea along the coast of Thessaly and Macedonia,

invoking the testimony of Homer, who says,



<quote><lg>

<l>Thou shalt see, if such thy will, in spring,
</l><l>My ships shall sail to Hellespont.</l></lg></quote>



But the argument is contradicted in the following lines,

<quote><lg>

<l>Piros, Imbracius' son, who came from Ænos.</l></lg></quote>



Piros commanded the Thracians,



<quote><lg>

<l>Whose limits are the quick-flowing Hellespont.</l></lg></quote>



So that he would consider all people settled next to the

Thracians as excluded from the Hellespont. For Ænos is

situated in the district formerly called Apsynthis, but now

Corpilice. The territory of the Cicones is next towards the

west. E.

<p>SUMMARY.</p>

<p>The remaining parts of Macedonia are considered, and the whole of Greece;

on this the author dwells some time on account of the great reputation

of the country. He corrects minutely, and clears up, the confused and

vague accounts respecting the cities contained therein, given by poets and

historians, and especially in the Catalogue and in many other parts of the

<head>CHAPTER 1.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>AFTER having described as much of the western parts

of Europe as is comprised within the interior and exterior

seas, and surveyed all the barbarous nations which it contains,

as far as the Don<note anchored="yes">The ancient Tanais.</note> and a small part of Greece, [namely,

Macedonia,]<note anchored="yes">These words are interpolated. <emph rend="ital">Casaubon.</emph></note> we propose to give an account of the remainder

of the Helladic geography. Homer was the first writer on

the subject of geography, and was followed by many others,

some of whom composed particular treatises, and entitled them

<q direct="unspecified">Harbours,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Voyages,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Circuits of the Earth,</q><note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">lime/nes, peri/ploi, periosoi gh=s.</foreign></note> or gave them

some name of this kind, and these comprised the description

of the Helladic country. Some, as Ephorus and Polybius,

included in their general history a separate topography of

the continents; others, as Posidonius and Hipparchus, introduced matter relating to geography in their writings on

physical and mathematical subjects.
</p><p>It is easy to form an opinion of the other writers, but the

poems of Homer require critical consideration, both because

he speaks as a poet, and because he describes things not as



<pb n="2"/>



they exist at present, but as they existed anciently, and the

greater part of which have been rendered obscure by time.
</p><p>We must however undertake this inquiry as far as we are

able, beginning from the point where our description ended.
</p><p>It ended with an account of the Epirotic and Illyrian nations

on the west and north, and of Macedonia as far as Byzantium

on the east.
</p><p>After the Epirotæ and Illyrii follow the Acarnanes,<note anchored="yes">The territory of the Acarnanes is still called Carnia, south of the

Gulf of Arta. The rest of the countries mentioned by Strabo no longer

retain the ancient divisions, Bœotia is the modern Livadhia. G.</note> the

Ætoli, the Locri-Ozolæ, then the Phocæenses and Bœoti,

Grecian nations. Opposite to these on the other side of the

strait is Peloponnesus, which comprises the Gulf of Corinth,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Lepanto.</note>

interposed between, and determining the figure of the latter,

from which it also receives its own. Next to Macedonia<note anchored="yes">Makedunea.</note>

are the Thessalians,<note anchored="yes">The ancient Thessaly is the modern Vlakea.</note> extending as far as the Malienses,<note anchored="yes">The neighbourhood of the Gulf of Zeitun—the ancient Maliac Gulf.</note> and

the other nations, situated on both sides of the isthmus.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are many Greek tribes, but the chief people are

equal in number to the Greek dialects with which we are

acquainted, namely, four. Of these, the Ionic is the same as

the ancient Attic; (for Iones was the former name of the inhabitants of Attica; from thence came the Iones who settled

in Asia,<note anchored="yes">In Asia Minor, and founded the cities Miletus, Smyrna, Phocæa, &amp;c.</note> and use the dialect now called Ionic;) the Doric was

the same as the Æolic dialect, for all the people on the other

side of the isthmus except the Athenians, the Megareans, and

the Dorians about Parnassus, are even now called Æolians;

it is probable that the Dorians, from their being a small

nation, and occupying a most rugged country, and from want

of intercourse [with the Æolians], no longer resemble that

people either in language or customs, and, although of the

same race, have lost all appearance of affinity. It was the

same with the Athenians, who inhabiting a rugged country

with a light soil, escaped the ravages of invaders. As they

always occupied the same territory, and no enemy attempted to

expel them, nor had any desire to take possession of it themselves, on this account they were, according to Thucydides,

regarded as Autochthones, or an indigenous race. This was



<pb n="3"/>



probably the reason, although they were a small nation, why

they remained a distinct people with a distinct dialect.
</p><p>It was not in the parts only on the other side of the isthmus,

that the Æolian nation was powerful, but those on this side

also were formerly Æolians. They were afterwards intermixed first with Ionians who came from Attica, and got possession of Ægialus,<note anchored="yes">The word Ægialus (<foreign lang="greek">Ai)gialo\s</foreign>) signifies sea-shore. The name was

given to this part of the Peloponnesus (afterwards called Achaia) from

the towns being situated generally along the coast. Others, however, give

a different explanation to the word.</note> and secondly with Dorians, who under

the conduct of the Heracleidæ founded Megara and many of

the cities in the Peloponnesus. The Iones were soon expelled

by the Achæi, an Æolian tribe; and there remained in Peloponnesus the two nations, the Æolic and the Doric. Those

nations then that had little intercourse with the Dorians used

the Æolian dialect. (This was the case with the Arcadians

and Eleians, the former of whom were altogether a mountain

tribe, and did not share in the partition of the Peloponnesus;

the latter were considered as dedicated to the service of

the Olympian Jupiter, and lived for a long period in peace,

principally because they were of Æolian descent, and had

admitted into their country the army of Oxylus, about the time

of the return of the Heracleidæ.<note anchored="yes"><date value="1113">1113</date> before the Christian era. G.</note>) The rest used a kind of

dialect composed of both, some of them having more, others

less, of the Æolic dialect. Even at present the inhabitants of

different cities use different dialects, but all seem to Dorize,

or use the Doric dialect, on account of the ascendency of that

nation.
</p><p>Such then is the number of the Grecian nations, and thus

in general are they distinguished from each other.
</p><p>I shall resume my account of them, and describe each

nation in their proper order.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>According to Ephorus, Acarnania is the commencement

of Greece on the west, for it is the first country which lies

contiguous to the Epirotic nations. As this author follows

the coast in his measurements, and begins from thence, considering the sea the most important guide of topographical

description, (for otherwise he might have placed the beginning

of Greece in Macedonia and Thessaly,) so ought I, observing



<pb n="4"/>



the natural character of places, to keep in view the sea as a

mark by which I should direct the course of my description.
</p><p>The sea coming from Sicily spreads itself on one side

towards the Corinthian Gulf, and on the other forms a large

peninsula, the Peloponnesus, united to the main-land by a

narrow isthmus.
</p><p>The two largest bodies of country in Greece are that within

the isthmus, and that without the isthmus, [extending to the

mouths of the river Peneius]. That within the isthmas is however larger, and more celebrated. The Peloponnesus is, as it

were, the acropolis or citadel of all Greece; and all Greece in

a manner holds the chief or leading position in Europe. For

independently of the fame and power of the nations which

inhabited it, the position itself of the places in it suggests

this superiority. One site succeeds another diversified with

numerous most remarkable bays, and large peninsulas. The

first of these peninsulas is the Peloponnesus, closed in by

an isthmus of forty stadia in extent. The second comprehends the first, and has an isthmus reaching from Pagæ in

Megaris to Nisæa, which is the naval arsenal of the Megareans; the passage across the isthmus from sea to sea is 120

stadia.
</p><p>The third peninsula also comprises the latter. Its isthmus

extends from the farthest recess of the Crissæan Gulf to

Thermopylæ. The line supposed to be drawn between these

is about 508 stadia in length, including within it the whole

of Bœotia, and cutting Phocis and the country of the

Epicnemidii obliquely. The fourth peninsula has the isthmus

extending from the Ambracian Gulf through Mount Œta

and Traclinia to the Maliac Gulf and Thermopylæ, about

800 stadia.
</p><p>There is another isthmus of more than 1000 stadia reaching from the same Gulf of Ambracia, and passing through

the country of the Thessalians and Macedonians to the recess

of the Thermæan Gulf.
</p><p>The succession of peninsulas furnishes a convenient order

to be followed in describing the country.
</p><p>We must begin from the smallest, as being also the most

famous of these peninsulas.<note anchored="yes">Taking the reverse order in which these peninsulas are described,

the fifth and last contains all the rest, the fourth all but the difference

between the fourth and fifth, and so on in order until we come to the Peloponnesus, properly so called, which is thus the least of the peninsulas.

Strabo himself seems to admit the term peninsula to be improperly applied to these subdivisions, by first describing Greece to be divided into

two great bodies, viz. that within and that without the Isthmus of Corinth.</note>

<p>THE Peloponnesus resembles in figure the leaf of a plane

tree.<note anchored="yes">For the same reason, at a subsequent period, it obtained the name of

Morea, in Greek (<foreign lang="greek">Moo|e/a</foreign>) which signifies mulberry, a species or variety

of which tree bears leaves divided into five lobes—equal in number to the

five principal capes of the Peloponnesus. See book ii. ch. i. 30.</note> Its length and breadth are nearly equal, each about

<date value="1400">1400</date> stadia. The former is reckoned from west to east, that

is, from the promontory Chelonatas through Olympia and the

territory Megalopolitis to the isthmus; the latter from south

to north, or from Maliæ though Arcadia to Ægium.
</p><p>The circumference, according to Polybius, exclusive of the

circuit of the bays, is 4000 stadia. Artemidorus however

adds to this 400 stadia, and if we include the measure of the

bays, it exceeds 5600 stadia. We have already said that the

isthmus at the road where they draw vessels over-land from

one sea to the other is 40 stadia across.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eleians and Messenians occupy the western side of this

peninsula. Their territory is washed by the Sicilian Sea.

They possess the coast also on each side. Elis bends towards

the north and the commencement of the Corinthian Gulf as

far as the promontory Araxus,<note anchored="yes">Cape Papa.</note> opposite to which across the

strait is Acarnania; the islands Zacynthus,<note anchored="yes">Zante.</note> Cephallenia,<note anchored="yes">Cephalonia.</note>

Ithaca,<note anchored="yes">Theaki.</note> and the Echinades, to which belongs Dulichium, lie

in front of it. The greater part of Messenia is open to the

south and to the Libyan Sea as far as the islands Thyrides

near Tænarum.<note anchored="yes">Cape Matapan.</note>
</p><p>Next to Elis, is the nation of the Achæi looking towards

the north, and stretching along the Corinthian Gulf they

terminate at Sicyonia. Then follow Sicyon<note anchored="yes">Basilico.</note> and Corinth,

extending as far as the isthmus. Next after Messenia are



<pb n="6"/>



Laconia and Argeia, which latter country also reaches as far

as the isthmus.
</p><p>The bays of the Peloponnesus are the Messeniac,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Coron.</note> the Laconian,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Colochina.</note> a third the Argolic,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Napoli.</note> and a fourth the Hermionic,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Castri.</note>

or the Saronic,<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Egina.</note> which some writers call the Salaminiac bay.

Some of these bays are supplied by the Libyan, others by

the Cretan and Myrtoan Seas. Some call even the Saronic

Gulf a sea. In the middle of Peloponnesus is Arcadia, lying

contiguous to all the other nations.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Corinthian Gulf begins from the mouths of the

Evenus,<note anchored="yes">Fidari.</note> (some say from the mouths of the Achelous,<note anchored="yes">Aspropotamo.</note> which

is the boundary between the Acarnanes and Ætoli,) and from

the promontory Araxus. For there the shores on both sides

first begin to contract, and have a considerable inclination

towards each other; as they advance farther onwards they

nearly meet at Rhium<note anchored="yes">Drepano.</note> and Antirrhium,<note anchored="yes">Castle of Roumelia.</note> leaving a channel of

only about 5 stadia between them.
</p><p>Rhium is a promontory of Achaia, it is low, and bends inwards like a sickle, (indeed it has the name of Drepanum, or

the Sickle,) and lies between Patræ<note anchored="yes">Patras.</note> and Ægium,<note anchored="yes">Vostitza.</note> on it there

is a temple of Neptune. Antirrhium is situated on the confines of Ætolia and Locris. It is called Rhium Molycrium.

From this point the sea-shore again parts in a moderate degree on each side, and advancing into the Crissæan Gulf, terminates there, being shut in by the western boundaries of

Bœotia and Megaris.
</p><p>The Corinthian Gulf is 2230 stadia in circuit from the

river Evenus to the promontory Araxus; and if we reckon

from the Achelous, it would be increased by about 100 stadia.
</p><p>The tract from the Achelous to the Evenus is occupied by

Acarnanians; next are the Ætoli, reaching to the Cape Antirrhium. The remainder of the country, as far as the isthmus,

is occupied by Phocis, Bœotia, and by Megaris, it extends

<date value="1118">1118</date> stadia.
</p><p>The sea from Cape Antirrhium as far as the isthmus is

[the Crissæan Gulf, but from the city Creusa it is called the

Sea of] Alcyonis, and is a portion of the Crissæan Gulf.<note anchored="yes">The words in brackets are inserted according to the suggestion of Groskurd. The Gulf of Corinth is, in other passages, called by Strabo

the Crissæan Gulf.</note>

From the isthmus to the promontory Araxus is a distance of

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>AT present the whole sea-coast lying between the Achæi

and Messenii is called Eleia, it stretches into the inland parts

towards Arcadia at Pholoe, and the Azanes, and Parrhasii.

Anciently it was divided into several states; afterwards

into two, Elis of the Epeii, and Elis under Nestor, the son of

Neleus. As Homer says, who mentions Elis of the Epeii by

name,



<quote><lg>

<l>Sacred Elis, where the Epeii rule.</l></lg></quote>



The other he calls Pylus subject to Nestor, through which, he

says, the Alpheius flows:



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Alpheius, that flows in a straight line through the land of the Pylians.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. v. 545.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. v. 545.</bibl></cit>



The poet was also acquainted with a city Pylus;



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>They arrived at Pylus, the well-built city of Neleus.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Od. iii. 4.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Od. iii. 4.</bibl></cit>



The Alpheius however does not flow through nor beside the

city, but another river flows beside it, which some call

Pamisus, others Amathus, from which Pylus seems to be

termed Emathöeis, but the Alpheius flows through the Eleian

territory.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Elis, the present city, was not yet founded in the time

of Homer, but the inhabitants of the country lived in villages.

It was called Cœle [or Hollow] Elis, from the accident of its

locality, for the largest and best part of it is situated in a

hollow. It was at a late period, and after the Persian war,

that the people collected together out of many demi, or



<note anchored="yes">Od. xv. 298.</note>



<pb n="8"/>



burghs, into one city. And, with the exception of a few, the

other places in the Peloponnesus which the poet enumerates

are not to be called cities, but districts. Each contained several

assemblages of demi or burghs, out of which the famous

cities were afterwards formed, as Mantineia in Arcadia, which

was furnished with inhabitants from five burghs by Argives;

Tegea from nine; Heræa from as many during the reign of

Cleombrotus, or Cleonymus; Ægium out of seven, or eight;

Patræ out of seven; Dyme out of eight; thus Elis also was

formed out of the surrounding burghs. The demus of the

Agriades was one of those added to it. The Peneius<note anchored="yes">Igliaco</note> flows

through the city by the Gymnasium, which the Eleii constructed long after the countries which were subject to Nestor

had passed into their possession.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These were the Pisatis, of which Olympia is a part, and

Triphylia, and the territory of the Caucones. The Triphylii

had their name from the accident of the union of three tribes;

of the Epeii, the original inhabitants; of the Minyæ, who

afterwards settled there; and last of all of the Eleii, who

made themselves masters of the country. Instead of the Minyæ

some writers substitute Arcadians, who had frequently disputed the possession of the territory, whence Pylus had the

epithet Arcadian as well as Triphylian. Homer calls all this

tract as far as Messene by the name of Pylus, the name of the

city. The names of the chiefs, and of their abodes in the

Catalogue of the Ships, show that Cœle Elis, or the Hollow

Elis, was distinct from the country subject to Nestor.
</p><p>I say this on comparing the present places with Homer's

description of them, for we must compare one with the other

in consideration of the fame of the poet, and our being bred

up in an acquaintance with his writings; and every one will

conclude that our present inquiry is rightly conducted, if

nothing is found repugnant to his accounts of places, which

have been received with the fullest reliance on their credibility and his veracity.
</p><p>We must describe these places as they exist at present, and

as they are represented by the poet, comparing them together

as far as is required by the design of this work.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Araxus is a promontory of Eleia situated on the

north, 60 stadia from Dyme, an Achæan city. This promontory



<pb n="9"/>



we consider the commencement of the coast of Eleia. Proceeding thence towards the west is Cyllene,<note anchored="yes">Chiarenza, in ruins.</note> the naval arsenal

of the Eleii, from whence is an ascent of 120 stadia to the present city. This Cyllene Homer mentions in these words,



<quote><lg>

<l>Cyllenian Otus, chief of the Epeii,</l></lg></quote>



for he would not have given the title of chief of Epeii to one

who came from the Arcadian mountain of this name. It is a

village of moderate size, in which is preserved the Æsculapius

of Colotes, a statue of ivory, of admirable workmanship.

Next to Cyllene is the promontory Chelonatas,<note anchored="yes">Cape Tornese.</note> the most

westerly point of the Peloponnesus. In front of it there is a

small island and shoals on the confines of Hollow Elis, and the

territory of the Pisatæ. From hence [Cyllene] to Cephallenia

is a voyage of not more than 80 stadia. Somewhere on the

above-mentioned confines is the river Elisson, or Elissa.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Between the Chelonatas and Cyllene the river Peneius

empties itself, and that also called by the poet Selleis, which

flows from the mountain Pholoe. On this river is situated

Ephyra, a city to be distinguished from the Thesprotian,

Thessalian, and Corinthian Ephyras; being a fourth city of

this name, situated on the road leading to the Lasion seacoast, and which may be either the same place as Bœonoa,

(for it is the custom to call Œnoe by this name,) or a city

near this, distant from Elis 120 stadia. This Ephyra seems

to be the reputed birth-place of Astyochea, the mother of Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules,



<cit><quote><lg>

(for this was the principal scene of the adventures of Hercules; at the other places called Ephyra, there is no river

Selleis;) hence came the armour of Meges,

from this Ephyra came also mortal poisons. For Minerva

says, that Ulysses went to Ephyra

<l>In search of a mortal poison wherewith to anoint his arrows:<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Od. i. 261.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Od. i. 261.</bibl></cit>



And the suitors say of Telemachus;

<pb n="10"/>



And Nestor introduces the daughter of Augeas, king of the

Epeii, in his account of the war with that people, as one who

administered poisons:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">I first slew a man,<note anchored="yes">Il. xi. 738.</note> Mulius, a brave soldier. He was son-in-law of

Augeas; he had married his eldest daughter; she was acquainted with

</p><p>There is also near Sicyon a river, Selleis, and a village of

the name of Ephyra near it; and a village Ephyra in the

territory of Agræa in Ætolia, the people of which are called

Ephyri. There are also other Ephyri among the Perrhæbi

near Macedonia, who are Crannonians,<note anchored="yes">I read <foreign lang="greek">oi( kai\</foreign> as Meineke suggests, but the whole passage from <q direct="unspecified">there

ii</q> to <q direct="unspecified">Ephyra,</q> is, as he also remarks, probably an interpolation. Strabo

has already enumerated four cities of the name of Ephyra, viz. the Eliac,

the Thesprotic, the Corinthian, and the Thessalian; yet here two others

are presented to our notice, the Sicyonian and the Ætolian, of which

Strabo makes no mention in his account of Ætolia and Sicyonia.</note> and the Thesprotic

Ephyri of Cichyrus, which was formerly called Ephyra.

<p>Apollodorus, when he informs us in what manner the

Orchomenus for instance, designating that in Arcadia by the

as <q direct="unspecified">Minyeius;</q> by applying to Samos the term Thracian,

to distinguish it from Ionian Samos; so he says the Thesprotic Ephyra is distinguished from others by the words, <q direct="unspecified">at

agree with what Demetrius of Scepsis says, from whom he

borrows most of his information. For Demetrius does not

say that there is a river Selleis in Thesprotia, but in Elis,

near the Thesprotic Ephyra, as I have said before.
</p><p>What he says also about Œchalia requires examination,

where he asserts that the city of Eurytus of Œchalia is the

only city, when there is more than one city of that name. It

is therefore evident that he means the Thessalian city mentioned by Homer:

If this were the city in Thessaly, the Scepsian is mistaken in

mentioning some city in Arcadia, which is now called Andania.

If he is not mistaken, still the Arcadian Œchalia is said to

be the city of Eurytus, so that there is not one city only of

that name, although Apollodorus asserts that there is but one.

<p>There existed between the mouths of the Peneius and

another of that name, having nothing in common with that

on the Alpheius, nor even with that on the Pamisus, or, if

we must so call it, the Amathus. Some writers, through their

solicitude for the fame and noble descent of Nestor, give a

forced meaning to these words. Since there are three places

in Peloponnesus of the name of Pylus, (whence the saying

originated,

each place endeavour to show that the river in his own country is (Emathois) <foreign lang="greek">h/maqo/eis,</foreign> or sandy, and declare that to be

the country of Nestor.
</p><p>The greater number of other writers, both historians and

poets, say, that Nestor was a Messenian, assigning as his birthplace the Pylus, which continued to exist to their times.

Those, however, who adhere to Homer and follow his poem as

their guide, say, that the Pylus of Nestor is where the territory is traversed by the Alpheius. Now this river passes

through the Pisatis and Triphylia. The inhabitants of the

Hollow Elis were emulous of the same honour respecting the

Pylus in their own country, and point out distinctive marks,

as a place called Gerenus, and a river Geron, and another

river Geranius, and endeavour to confirm this opinion by

pretending that Nestor had the epithet Gerenius from these

places.
</p><p>The Messenians argue in the very same manner, but ap-

that in their territory there is a place better known, called

<p>The poet however, after having divided the country into

four parts, and mentioned the four chiefs, does not clearly

express himself, when he says:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">those who inhabit Buprasium and the sacred Elis, all whom Hyrminë

rock, and Aleisium contain, these were led by four chiefs; ten swift vessels

For, by applying the name Epeii to both people, the Buprasians and the Eleii, and by never applying the name Eleii to

the Buprasians, he may seem to divide, not Eleia, but the

country of the Epeii, into four parts, which he had before

divided into two; nor would Buprasium then be a part of Elis,

but rather of the country of the Epeii. For that he terms

the Buprasians Epeii, is evident from these words:

Again, by enumerating together <q direct="unspecified">Buprasium and sacred

Elis,</q> and then by making a fourfold division, he seems to

arrange these very four divisions in common under both Buprasium and Elis.
</p><p>Buprasium, it is probable, was a considerable settlement in

Eleia, which does not exist at present. But the territory only

has this name, which lies on the road to Dyme from Elis the

present city. It might be supposed that Buprasium had at

that time some superiority over Elis, as the Epeii had over

the Eleii, but afterwards they had the name of Eleii instead

of Epeii.
</p><p>Buprasium then was a part of Elis, and they say, that

Homer, by a poetical figure, speaks of the whole and of the

</p><p>If Homer has not called the Buprasii by the name of Eleii,

<p>But Hecatæus of Miletus says, that the Epeii are a

different people from the Eleii; that the Epeii accompanied

Hercules in his expedition against Augeas, and joined him in

Not that it is improbable that the Epeii, although a different people and at variance with the Eleii, when they

had gained the ascendency, united together, forming a com-

mon state, and their power extended even as far as Dyme.

The poet does not mention Dyme, but it is not improbable

that at that time it was subject to the Epeii, and afterwards

to the ones, or perhaps not even to this people, but to the

Achsæi, who were in possession of the country of the Iones.

Scollis is a rocky mountain, common to the Dymæi, and

Tritæenses, and Eleii, situated close to Lampeia, another mountain in Arcadia, which is distant from Elis 130 stadia, from

Tritæa 100, and an equal number [from Dyme] Achæan cities.
</p><p>Aleisium is the present Alesiæum, a place near Amphidolis,

where the neighbouring people hold a market every month.

It is situated upon the mountain road leading from Elis to

Olympia. Formerly, it was a city of the Pisatis, the boundaries of the country being different at different times on account of the change of masters. The poet also calls Aleisium,

the hill of Aleisius, when he says,

<p>Since a tribe of Caucones is mentioned in Triphylia

near Messenia, and as Dyme is called by some writers

Cauconis, and since between Dyme and Tritæa in the Dymæan

district there is also a river called Caucon, a question arises

respecting the Caucones, whether there are two nations of this

name, one situate about Triphylia, and another about Dyme,

Elis, and Caucon. This river empties itself into another

which is called Teutheas, in the masculine gender, and is the

name of a small town that was one of those that composed

Dyme; except that the town is of the feminine gender, and is

pronounced Teuthea, without the s, and the last syllable is long.
</p><p>There is a temple of Diana Nemydia (Nemeæma?). The

Teutheas discharges itself into the Achelous, which runs by

a certain district in the territory of the Epeii appears to be

designated, which the Caucones, a different nation from that

as the Dymean territory.] But it was not proper to omit,

whence Dyme had the name Cauconitis, nor why the river was

called Caucon, because the question is, who the Caucones<note anchored="yes">Book vii. ch. vii. 2.</note>

about Lepreum, I know not how this is probable; whence

some persons even write the passage,

<p>Next to the Chelonatas is the long tract of coast of the

small town of this name;

for there is a small river near it.
</p><p>Some writers say, that Pheia is the commencement of the

Pisatis. In front of Pheia is a small island and a harbour;

thence to Olympia by sea, which is the shortest way, is

120 stadia. Then immediately follows another promontory,

[Icthys,] projecting very far towards the west, like the

Chelonatas; from this promontory to Cephallenia are 120

stadia. Next the Alpheius discharges itself, at the distance

from the Chelonatas of 280, and from the Araxus of 545,

stadia. It flows from the same places as the Eurotas. There

is a village of the name of Asea in the Megalopolitis, where

the two sources, whence the above-mentioned rivers issue, are

near to one another. After running under the earth the distance of many stadia, they then rise to the surface, when one

takes its course to Laconia, the other to the Pisatis. The

Eurotas reappears at the commencement of the district Bleminates, flowing close beside Sparta, and passing through a

long valley near Helos, which the poet mentions, empties itself

between Gythium, the naval arsenal of Sparta, and Acræa.

But the Alpheius, after receiving the Celadon, (Ladon?) and

Erymanthus, and other obscure streams, pursues its course

through Phrixa, and the Pisatis, and Triphylia, close to Olympia,



<pb n="16"/>



and discharges itself into the Sicilian Sea between Pheia and

Epitalium. At its mouth, and at the distance of 80 stadia

from Olympia, is situated the grove of Artemis Alpheionia,

or Alpheiusa, for both words are in use. At Olympia an

annual festival, to which multitudes resort, is celebrated in

honour of this goddess, as well as of Diana Elaplia and

Diana Daphnia. The whole country is full of temples dedicated to Diana, and Aphrodite, and the Nymphs, which are

situated amidst flowery groves, and generally where there is

abundance of water. Hermeia, or images of Mercury, are

frequently met with on the road, and on the sea-shore, temples

dedicated to Neptune. In the temple of Diana Alpheionia

are pictures by Cleanthes and Aregon, Corinthian painters;

the former has depicted the taking of Troy, and the birth of

Minerva; the latter, Diana borne upon a griffin; which are

highly esteemed.

<p>Next is the mountain, which separates Macistia in

Triphylia from the Pisatis; then follows another river Chalcis,

and a spring called Cruni, and Chalcis a village, and next to

these the Samicum, where is the temple of the Samian Neptune, which is held in the highest honour. There is also a

grove full of wild olive trees. It was intrusted to the care

of the Macistii, whose business it was to announce the Samian

truce as it is called. All the Triphylii contribute to the temple.

<p>Near these temples, at the distance of 30 stadia, or a

little more, above the sea-coast, is situated the Triphyliac, or

Lepreatic, Pylus, which the poet calls Emathoeis, or Sandy,

and transmits to us as the native country of Nestor, as may

be collected from his poetry. It had the epithet Emathoeis

either from the river, which flows by the city towards the

north, and was formerly called Amathus, but now Mamaus,

or Arcadicus; or because this river was called Pamisus, the

same name as that of two rivers in Messenia, while with

respect to the city, the epithet Emathoeis, or sandy, is of uncertain origin, since it is not the fact, it is said, that either

the river or the country abounds with sand.



<pb n="17"/>



Towards the east is a mountain near Pylus, named after

Minthe, who, according to the fable, was the mistress of

Hades, and being deluded by Proserpine, was transformed

into the garden mint, which some call hedyosmus, or the

sweet-smelling mint. There is also near the mountain an enclosure, sacred to Hades, held in great veneration by the

Macistii; and a grove dedicated to Ceres, situated above the

Pyliac plain. This plain is fertile, and situated close to the

sea-coast; it extends along the interval between the Samicum

and the river Neda. The sea-shore is sandy and narrow, so

that no one could be censured for asserting that Pylus was

called <q direct="unspecified">sandy</q> from this tract.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Towards the north there were two small Triphyliac

towns, Hypana and Typaneæ, bordering upon Pylus; the

former of which was incorporated with Elis, the other remained separate. Two rivers flow near, the Dalion and the

Acheron, and empty themselves into the Alpheius. The

Acheron has its name from its relation to Hades. For at that

place were held in extraordinary reverence the temples of

Ceres, Proserpine, and Hades, perhaps on account of the contrariety of the properties of the country, which Demetrius

of Scepsis mentions. For Triphylia is fertile, but the soil is

subject to mildew, and produces rushes,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">qru/on</foreign> the meaning of this word is uncertain; Meyer in his <q direct="unspecified">Botanische erklarung</q> of Strabo does not attempt to explain it.</note> whence in these

places, instead of the product being large, there is frequently

no crop whatever.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Towards the south of Pylus is Lepreum. This also

was a city, situated 40 stadia above the sea-coast. Between

the Lepreum and the Annius (Anigrus? Alphæus?) is the

temple of the Samian Neptune. These places are distant 100

stadia from each other. This is the temple in which the poet

says that the Pylii were found by Telemachus engaged in

offering sacrifice:

For the poet was at liberty to feign things which did not

exist, but when it is possible to adapt poetry to reality, and

preserve the narrative . . . . it is better to abstain from

fiction.
</p><p>The Lepreatæ possessed a fertile country, on the confines of

which were situated the Cyparissenses. But Caucones were

masters of both these tracts, and even of the Macistus, which

some call Platanistus. The town has the same name as the

territory. It is said, that in the Lepreatis there is even a

monument of a Caucon, who had the name of the nation,

either because he was a chief, or for some other reason.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are many accounts respecting the Caucones.

They are said to be an Arcadian tribe, like the Pelasgi, and

also, like them, a wandering people. Thus the poet relates,

that they came as auxiliaries to the Trojans, but from what

country he does not mention, but it is supposed from Paphlagonia. For in that country there is a tribe of the name of

Cauconiatæ, that border upon the Mariandyni, who are themselves Paphlagonians. We shall say more of them when we

describe that country.<note anchored="yes">Book xii. c. 3, 4. Little, however, can be obtained of their history,

which is buried in the same obscurity as the Pelasgi and Leleges.</note>
</p><p>At present I must add some remarks concerning the

Caucones in Triphylia. For some writers say, that the

whole of the present Elis, from Messenia to Dyme, was called

Cauconia. Antimachus calls them all Epeii and Caucones.

But some writers say that they did not possess the whole

country, but inhabited it when they were divided into two

bodies, one of which settled in Triphylia towards Messenia,

the other in the Buprasian district towards Dyme, and in

the Hollow Elis. And there, and not in any other place,

Aristotle considered them to be situated. The last opinion

agrees better with the language of Homer, and the preceding

question is resolved. For Nestor is supposed to have lived at

the Triphyliac Pylus, the parts of which towards the south

and the east (and these coincide towards Messenia and Laconia) was the country subject to Nestor, but the Caucones

now occupy it, so that those who are going from Pylus to

Lacedæmon must necessarily take the road through the

Caucones. The temple of the Samian Neptune, and the

naval station near it, where Telemachus landed, incline to the

west and to the north. If then the Caucones lived there only,

the account of the poet must be erroneous.



<pb n="19"/>



[For, according to Sotades, Minerva enjoins Nestor to send

his son with Telemachus in a chariot to Lacedæmon towards

the east, while she herself returns back to the west, to pass the

night in the vessel;



<quote><lg>

<l>but at sun-rise she sets out to the magnanimous Caucones,</l></lg></quote>



to obtain payment of the debt, in a forward direction. How

then are we to reconcile these opinions? for Nestor might

say, <q direct="unspecified">The Caucones are my subjects, and lie directly in the

road of persons who are going to Lacedæmon; why then

do you not accompany Telemachus and his friends on his

journey, but take a road in an opposite direction?</q> Besides,

it was natural for one, who was going to recover payment of

a debt, and that a considerable sum, as she says, from a people

under the command of Nestor, to request some assistance from

him in case they should be so unjust, as usually happens, as to

refuse to discharge it. But she did not do this.
</p><p>If therefore the Caucones are to be found in one situation

only, these absurdities would follow. But if one division of

this tribe occupied the places in Elis near Dymë, Minerva

might be said to direct her journey thither, and even the

return to the ship would not be absurd, nor the separation

from the company of Telemachus, when her road was in an

opposite direction.
</p><p>The question respecting Pylus may perhaps be resolved in

for as the position of Arēnē has not been clearly discovered

Minyeius, empties itself. As no inconsiderable proof of this,

Homer says,

Now near the cave of the nymphs Anigriades is a fountain,

by which the subjacent country is rendered marshy, and filled

with pools of water. The Anigrus however receives the greater part of the water, being deep, but with so little current

that it stagnates. The place is full of mud, emits an offensive

smell perceptible at a distance of 26 stadia, and renders the

fish unfit for food. Some writers give this fabulous account

of these waters, and attribute the latter effect to the venom

of the Hydra, which some of the Centaurs<note anchored="yes">Hercules, after killing the Hydra, dipped the arrows which he after-

other sources; either from those who accompanied Chloris,

of Peripli, or Circumnavigations; because perhaps it had

been long since destroyed, and perhaps also on account of its

position. For the Poseidium is a grove, as I have said, near

<p>On the Triphylian Sea are situated Cyparissia, and

boundary of Triphylia towards Messenia is the impetuous

stream of the Neda descending from the Lycæus, a mountain

of Arcadia, and rising from a source which, according to the

fable, burst forth to furnish water in which Rhea was to wash

herself after the birth of Jupiter. It flows near Phigalia, and

empties itself into the sea where the Pyrgitæ, the extreme

tribe of the Triphylii, approach the Cyparissenses, the first of

tile Messenian nation. But, anciently, the country had other

boundaries, so that the dominions of Nestor included some

places on the other side of the Neda, as the Cyparisseïs, and

some others beyond that tract, in the same manner as the poet

extends the Pylian sea as far as the seven cities, which Agamemnon promised to Achilles,

</p><p>We ought not perhaps to carry our inquiries so far into antiquity, and it might be sufficient to describe the present state

of each place, if certain reports about them had not been delivered down to us in childhood; but as different writers give

different accounts, it is necessary to examine them. The most

famous and the most ancient writers being the first in point

of personal knowledge of the places, are, in general, persons of

the most credit. Now as Homer surpasses all others in these

respects, we must examine what he says, and compare his

descriptions with the present state of places, as we have just

said. We have already considered his description of the

Hollow Elis and of Buprasium.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He describes the dominions of Nestor in these words:



<quote>"And they who inhabited Pylus, and the beautiful Arene, and Thryum,

and Amphigeneia, and Pteleum, and Helos, and Dorium, where the

Muses having met with Thamyris the Thracian, deprived him of the

power of song, as he was coming from Œchalia, from the house of Eurytus

the Œchalian.<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 591.</note></quote>



It is Pylus, therefore, to which the question relates, and we

shall soon treat of it. We have already spoken of Arene.

The places, which he here calls Thryum, in another passage

he calls Thryoessa,

He calls it the ford or passage of the Alpheius, because, according to these verses, it seems as if it could be crossed at

this place on foot. Thryum is at present called Epitalium, a

but another is meant, a natural strong-hold in Macistia.

Writers who suppose this place to be meant, say, that Æpy is

the name of the city, and infer it from its natural properties,

the stream. Perhaps Thryum is meant by the ford, and by

Œchalia of Eurytus, the present Andania, a small Arcadian

<p>Hence it is evident that the country under the command

he calls the country of the Pylians, but nowhere does the

Alpheius touch Messenia, nor the Hollow Elis.<note anchored="yes">In the discussion which follows, Strabo endeavours to prove, that

the Pylus of Nestor is the Pylus of Triphylia, and not the Pylus of Messenia.</note>
</p><p>It is in this district that we have the native country of

Nestor, which we call the Triphylian, the Arcadian, and the

Lepreatic Pylus. For we know that other places of the name

of Pylus are pointed out, situated upon the sea, but this is

distant more than 30 stadia from it, as appears from the

poem. A messenger is sent to the vessel, to the companions

of Telemachus,—to invite them to a hospitable entertainment.

Telemachus, upon his return from Sparta, does not permit

Peisistratus to go to the city, but diverts him from it, and

prevails upon him to hasten to the ship, whence it appears

that the same road did not lead both to the city and to the

haven. The departure of Telemachus may in this manner

be aptly understood:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">they went past Cruni, and the beautiful streams of Chalcis; the sun

for to this place the direction of the vessel was towards the

north, and thence it turns to the east. The vessel leaves its

first and straight course in the direction of Ithaca, because the

suitors had placed an ambush there,


</p><p>"In the strait between Ithaca and Samos,
</p><p>And from thence he directed the vessel to the sharp-pointed islands, <foreign lang="greek">nh/soisi qohai\;</foreign><note anchored="yes">Od. iv. 671; xv. 298.</note>



the sharp-pointed (<foreign lang="greek">o)cei/ai</foreign>) he calls <foreign lang="greek">qoai\.</foreign> They belong to the

Echinades, and are near the commencement of the Corinthian

Gulf and the mouths of the Achelous. After having sailed

past Ithaca so as to leave the island behind him, he turns to

the proper course between Acarnania and Ithaca, and disembarks on the other side of the island, not at the strait of

Cephallenia, where the suitors were on the watch.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>If any one therefore should suppose that the Eleian

Pylus is the Pylus of Nestor, the ship would not properly be

said, after setting off thence, to take its course along Cruni

and Chalcis, as far as the west, then to arrive by night at

Pheæ, and afterwards to sail along the territory of Eleia, for



<pb n="26"/>



these places are to the south of Eleia, first Pheæ, then Chalcis,

then Cruni, then the Triphylian Pylus, and the Samicum.

In sailing then to the south from the Eleian Pylus this would

be the course. In sailing to the north, where Ithaca lies, all

these places are left behind, but they must sail along Eleia

itself, and before, although he says after, sun-set. Again, on

the other side, if any one should suppose the Messenian Pylus

and the Coryphasium to be the commencement of the voyage

after leaving the country of Nestor, the distance would be

great, and would occupy more time. For the distance only

to the Triphylian Pylus and the Samian Poseidium is 400

stadia, and the voyage would not be along Cruni, and Chalcis,

and Pheæ, the names of obscure places and rivers, or rather

of streams, but first along the Neda, then Acidon, next

Alpheius, and the places and countries lying between these

rivers, and lastly, if we must mention them, along the former,

because the voyage was along the former places and rivers

also.

<milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Besides, Nestor's account of the war between the

Pylians and Eleians, which he relates to Patroclus, agrees

with our arguments, if any one examines the lines. For he

says there, that Hercules laid waste Pylus, and that all the

youth were exterminated; that out of twelve sons of Neleus,

lie himself alone survived, and was a very young man, and

that the Epeii, despising Neleus on account of his old age

and destitute state, treated the Pylians with haughtiness and

insult. Nestor therefore, in order to avenge this wrong, collected

as large a body of his people as he was able, made an inroad

into Eleia, and carried away a large quantity of booty;



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Fifty herds of oxen, as many flocks of sheep,
</l><l>As many herds of swine,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il xi. 677.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il xi. 677.</bibl></cit>



and as many flocks of goats, an hundred and fifty brood

so that the capture of the booty, and the flight of those who

came to the assistance of people who were robbed, happened in the day-time, when, he says, he slew Itamon; and

they returned by night, so that they arrived by night at the



<pb n="27"/>



city. When they were engaged in dividing the booty, and in

sacrificing, the Epeii, having assembled in multitudes, on the

third day marched against them with an army of horse and

foot, and encamped about Thryum, which is situated on the

Alpheius. The Pylians were no sooner informed of this than

they immediately set out to the relief of this place, and having

passed the night on the river Minyeius near Arene, thence

arrive at the Alpheius at noon. After sacrificing to the gods,

and passing the night on the banks of the river, they immediately, in the morning, engaged in battle. The rout of the

enemy was complete, and they did not desist from the pursuit

and slaughter, till they came to Buprasium,

<p>From these verses how can it be supposed that Eleian

or Messenian Pylus is meant. I say the Eleian, because when

this was destroyed by Hercules, the country of the Epeii also

was ravaged at the same time, that is, Eleia. How then could

those, who were of the same tribe, and who had been plundered at that time, show such pride and insult to persons, who

were suffering under the same injuries? How could they

overrun and ravage their own country? How could Augeas

and Neleus be kings of the same people, and yet be mutual

enemies; for to Neleus

How came the Epeii, when marching against the Pylians, to

set out towards the Alpheius and Thryum, and after being

defeated there in battle, to fly to Buprasium? But on the

other side, if Hercules laid waste the Messenian Pylus, how

could they, who were at such a distance, treat the Pylians

with insult, or have so much intercourse and traffic with

them, and defraud them by refusing to discharge a debt, so

that war should ensue on that account? How too could

Nestor, after having got, in his marauding adventure, so large

a quantity of booty, a prey of swine and sheep, none of which

are swift-footed, nor able to go a long journey, accomplish a

march of more than 1000 stadia to Pylus near Coryphasium?

Yet all the Epeii arrive at Thryoessa and the river Alpheius

on the third day, ready to lay siege to the strong-hold. How

also did these districts belong to the chiefs of Messenia, when

the Caucones, and Triphylii, and Pisatæ occupied them?

But the territory Gerena, or Gerenia, for it is written both

ways, might have a name which some persons applied designedly, or which might have originated even in accident.
</p><p>Since, however, Messenia was entirely under the dominion

of Menelaus, to whom Laconia also was subject, as will be

evident from what will be said hereafter, and since the rivers,

the Pamisus and the Nedon, flow through this country, and

not the Alpheius at all, which runs in a straight line through

the country of the Pylians, of which Nestor was ruler, can

that account be credible, by which it appears that one man

takes possession by force of the dominion of another, and

deprives him of the cities, which are said to be his property

in the Catalogue of the Ships, and makes others subject to

the usurper.

<milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It remains that we speak of Olympia, and of the

manner in which everything fell into the power of the Eleii.
</p><p>The temple is in the district Pisatis, at the distance of less

than 300 stadia from Elis. In front of it is a grove of wild

olive trees, where is the stadium. The Alpheius flows beside

it, taking its course out of Arcadia to the Triphylian Sea

between the west and the south. The fame of the temple

was originally owing to the oracle of the Olympian Jove;

yet after that had ceased, the renown of the temple continued, and increased, as we know, to a high degree of celebrity, both on account of the assembly of the people of Greece,



<pb n="29"/>



which was held there, and of the Olympic games, in which

the victor was crowned. These games were esteemed sacred,

and ranked above all others. The temple was decorated

with abundance of offerings, the contributions of all Greece.

Among these offerings was a Jupiter of beaten gold, presented

by Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth. The largest was a

statue of Jupiter in ivory, the workmanship of Phidias of

Athens, the son of Charmides. Its height was so great, that

although the temple is very large, the artist seems to have

mistaken its proportions, and although he made the figure

sitting, yet the head nearly touches the roof, and presents the

appearance that, if it should rise, and stand upright, it would

unroof the temple. Some writers have given the measurement of the statue, and Callimachus has expressed it in some

iambic verses. Panænus, the painter, his nephew, and joint

labourer, afforded great assistance in the completion of the

statue with respect to the colours with which it was ornamented, and particularly the drapery.
</p><p>There are exhibited also many and admirable pictures

around the temple, the work of this painter. It is recorded

of Phidias, that to Panænus, who was inquiring after what

model he intended to form the figure of Jupiter, he replied,

that it would be from that of Homer delineated in these words;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">He spoke, and gave the nod with his sable brows, the ambrosial hair

shook on the immortal head of the king of gods, and vast Olympus

trembled.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. i. 528.</note></quote>



[This is well expressed, and the poet, as from other circumstances, so particularly from the brows, suggests the thought

that he is depicting some grand conception, and great power

worthy of Jupiter. So also in his description of Juno, in

both he preserves the peculiar decorum of each character, for

he says,

this was effected by the motion of her whole body, but

Olympus shakes when Jupiter only nods with his brows, the

hair of his head partaking of the motion. It was elegantly

said [of Homer] that he was the only person who had

seen and had made visible the figures of the gods.]<note anchored="yes">Probably an interpolation.</note>



<pb n="30"/>



To the Eleii above all other people is to be ascribed the

magnificence of the temple at Olympia, and the reverence in

which it was held. For about the Trojan times, and even

before that period, they were not in a flourishing state, having

been reduced to a low condition by war with the Pylii, and

afterwards by Hercules, when Augeas their king was overthrown. The proof is this. The Eleii sent forty ships to

Troy, but the Pylians and Nestor ninety; then after the

return of the Heracleidm the contrary happened. For the

Ætoli returning with the Heracleidœ under the command of

Oxylus, became joint settlers with the Epeii, on the ground of

ancient affinity. They extended the bounds of Hollow Elis,

got possession of a large portion of the Pisatis, and subjected

Olympia to their power. It was these people who invented

the Olympic games,<note anchored="yes">The establishment of the Olympic games is connected with many

legends and is involved in much obscurity. See Smith, Greek and Roman Antiq.</note> and instituted the first Olympiad. For

we must reject the ancient stories both respecting the foundation of the temple, and the establishment of the games, some

alleging that Hercules, one of the Idæan Dactyli, was the

founder; others, that the son of Alcmene and Jupiter founded

them, who also was the first combatant and victor. For such

things are variously reported, and not entitled to much credit.

It is more probable, that from the first Olympiad,<note anchored="yes"><date value="-776">776</date> B. C.</note> when

Corcebus the Eleian was the victor in the race in the stadium,

to the twenty-sixth, the Eleians presided over the temple, and

at the games. But in the Trojan times, either there were no

games where a crown was awarded, or they had not yet acquired any fame, neither these nor any of the games which

are now so renowned. Homer does not speak of these games,

but of others of a different kind, which were celebrated at

funerals. Some persons however are of opinion that he does

mention the Olympic games, when he says, that Augeas detained four victorious horses, which had been sent to contend

for the prize. It is also said that the Pisatæ did not take any

part in the Trojan war, being considered as consecrated to the

service of Jupiter. But neither was the Pisatis, the tract of

country in which Olympia is situated, subject at that time to

Augeas, but Eleia only, nor were the Olympic games cele-



<pb n="31"/>



brated even once in the Eleian district, but always at Olympia.

But the games, of which Homer speaks, seem to have taken

place in Elis, where the debt was owing,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>For a great debt was owing in the divine Elis,
</l><l>Namely, four victorious horses.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xi. 677.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xi. 677.</bibl></cit>



But it was not in these, but in the Olympic games, that the

victor was crowned, for here they were to contend for a tripod.
</p><p>After the twenty-sixth Olympiad, the Pisatæ, having recovered their territory, instituted games themselves, when

they perceived that these games were obtaining celebrity. But

in after-times, when the territory of the Pisatis reverted to the

Eleii, the presidency and celebration of the games reverted

to them also. The Lacedæmonians too, after the last defeat of

the Messenians, co-operated with the Eleii as allies, contrary

to the conduct of the descendants of Nestor and of the Arcadians, who were allies of the Messenians. And they assisted

them so effectually that all the country as far as Messene was

called Eleia, and the name continues even to the present time.

But of the Pisatæ, and Triphylii, and Caucones, not even the

names remain. They united also Pylus Emathoeis itself with

Lepreum in order to gratify the Lepreatæ, who had taken no

part in the war. They razed many other towns, and imposed

a tribute upon as many as were inclined to maintain their independence.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Pisatis obtained the highest celebrity from the

great power of its sovereigns, Œnomaus and his successor

Pelops, and the number of their children. Salmoneus is said

to have reigned there, and one of the eight cities, into which

the Pisatis is divided, has the name of Salmone. For these

reasons, and on account of the temple at Olympia, the fame

of the country spread everywhere.
</p><p>We must however receive ancient histories, as not entirely

agreeing with one another, for modern writers, entertaining

different opinions, are accustomed to contradict them frequently; as for example, according to some writers, Augeas

was king of the Pisatis, and Œnomaus and Salmoneus kings

of Eleia, while others consider the two nations as one. Still

we ought to follow in general what is received as true, since

writers are not agreed even upon the derivation of the word

Pisatis. Some derive it from Pisa, (<foreign lang="greek">Pi=sa,</foreign>) a city of the same



<pb n="32"/>



name as the fountain, and say that the fountain had that name,

as much as to say Pistra, (<foreign lang="greek">Pi/stra,</foreign>) which means Potistra,

(<foreign lang="greek">poti/sto|a</foreign>) or <q direct="unspecified">potable.</q> The city of Pisa is shown, situated

on an eminence between two mountains, which have the same

names as those in Thessaly, Ossa and Olympus. Some say,

that there was no such city as Pisa, for it would have been

one of the eight, but a fountain only, which is now called

Bisa, near Cicysium, the largest of the eight cities. But

Stesichorus calls the tract of country named Pisa, a city, as

the poet calls Lesbos, a city of Macar; and Euripides in the

play of Ion says

</p><p>Above and so very near Olympia, is Pholoe, an Arcadian

mountain, that the country at its foot belongs to the Pisatis.

Indeed the whole of the Pisatis and a great part of Triphylia

border upon Arcadia. For this reason, most of the places, which

have the name of Pylian in the Catalogue of the Ships, seem to

be Arcadian. Persons, however, who are well informed, say,

that the river Erymanthus, one of those that empty themselves into the Alpheius, is the boundary of Arcadia, and that

<p>According to Ephorus, "Ætolus, being banished by

Salmoneus, king of the Epeii, and the Pisatæ, from Eleia to

the cities there. His descendant Oxylus was the friend of

Temenus, and the Heracleidæ his companions, and was their

guide on their journey to Peloponnesus; he divided among

them the hostile territory, and suggested instructions relative

to the acquisition of the country. In return for these services

he was to be requited by the restoration of Elis, which had belonged to his ancestors. He returned with an army collected

out of Ætolia, for the purpose of attacking the Epeii, who

occupied Elis. On the approach of the Epeii in arms, when the

forces were drawn up in array against each other, there advanced in front, and engaged in single combat according to an

ancient custom of the Greeks, Pyrechmes, an Ætolian, and

Degmenus, an Epeian: the latter was lightly armed with a

armed soldier; the former, when he perceived the stratagem

of his adversary, provided himself with a sling, and a scrip

filled with stones. The kind of sling also happened to have

been lately invented by the Ætolians. As a sling reaches its

object at a greater distance than a bow, Degmenus fell; the

Ætolians took possession of the country, and ejected the Epeii.

They assumed also the superintendence of the temple at

Olympia, which the Epeii exercised; and on account of the

friendship which subsisted between Oxylus and the Heracleidæ,

it was generally agreed upon, and confirmed by an oath, that

the Eleian territory was sacred to Jupiter, and that any one

who invaded that country with an army, was a sacrilegious

person: he also was to be accounted sacrilegious, who did not

defend it against the invader to the utmost of his power. It

was for this reason, that the later founders of the city left it

without walls, and those who are passing through the country

with an army, deliver up their arms and receive them again

upon quitting the borders. Iphitus instituted there the

Olympic games, because the Eleians were a sacred people.

Hence it was that they increased in numbers, for while other

nations were continually engaged in war with each other, they

alone enjoyed profound peace, and not themselves only, but

strangers also, so that on this account they were a more

populous state than all the others.
</p><p>Pheidon the Argive was the tenth in descent from Temenus,

and the most powerful prince of his age; he was the inventor of

the weights and measures called Pheidonian, and stamped

money, silver in particular. He recovered the whole inheritance of Temenus, which had been severed into many portions.

He attacked also the cities which Hercules had formerly taken,

and claimed the privilege of celebrating the games which

Hercules had established, and among these the Olympian

games. He entered their country by force and celebrated the

games, for the Eleians had no army to prevent it, as they were

in a state of peace, and the rest were oppressed by his power.

The Eleians however did not solemnly inscribe in their records

this celebration of the games, but on this occasion procured

arms, and began to defend themselves. The Lacedæmonians

also afforded assistance, either because they were jealous of the

prosperity, which was the effect of the peaceful state of the

Eleians, or because they supposed that they should have the

aid of the Eleians in destroying the power of Pheidon, who

had deprived them of the sovereignty (<foreign lang="greek">h)gemoni/an</foreign>) of Peloponnesus, which they before possessed. They succeeded in

their joint attempt to overthrow Pheidon, and the Eleians

with this assistance obtained possession of Pisatis and Triphylia.

Being part of Laconia, it was subject in the Trojan times to

Menelaus. The name of the country was Messene. But the

present city called Messene, the acropolis of which was Ithome,

was not then founded. After the death of Menelaus, when

the power of those who succeeded to the possession of Laconia was altogether weakened, the Neleidæ governed Messenia.

At the time of the return of the Heracleidæ, and according

to the partition of the country at that time, Melanthus was

king of the Messenians, who were a separate community, but

formerly subject to Menelaus. As a proof of this, in the

space from the Messenian Gulf and the continuous gulf, (called

the Asinæan from the Messenian Asine,) were situated the

seven cities which Agamemnon promised to Achilles;

Hyameitis, he appointed kings, and put all the Messenians on

conjunction with their allies the Eleians [Arcadians], Argives, and Pisatæ, they revolted; the leader of the Arcadians

was Aristocrates, king of Orchomenus, and of the Pisatæ,

Pantaleon, son of Omphalion. In this war, Tyrtæus says, he

himself commanded the Lacedæmonian army, for in his elegiac

poem, entitled Eunomia, he says he came from Erineum;

Wherefore we must either invalidate the authority of the

elegiac verses, or we must disbelieve Philochorus, and Callisthenes, and many other writers, who say that he came from

Athens, or Aphidnæ, at the request of the Lacedæmonians,

whom an oracle had enjoined to receive a commander from

<p>With respect to the government of the Lacones, and the

changes which have taken place among them, many things,

as being well known, may be passed over, but some it may be

worth while to relate. It is said that the Achæan Phthiotæ,

who, with Pelops, made an irruption into Peloponnesus, settled

in Laconia, and were so much distinguished for their valour,

that Peloponnesus, which for a long period up to this time

had the name of Argos, was then called Achæan Argos; and

not Peloponnesus alone had this name, but Laconia also was

thus peculiarly designated. Some even understand the words

of the poet,

as implying, was he not in Laconia? But about the time of

the return of the Heracleidæ, when Philonomus betrayed the

country to the Dorians, they removed from Laconia to the

country of the Ionians, which at present is called Achaia. We

shall speak of them in our description of Achaia.
</p><p>Those who were in possession of Laconia, at first conducted

themselves with moderation, but after they had intrusted to

Lycurgus the formation of a political constitution, they acquired such a superiority over the other Greeks, that they

alone obtained the sovereignty both by sea and land, and continued to be the chiefs of the Greeks, till the Thebans, and

soon afterwards the Macedonians, deprived them of this ascendency.



<pb n="44"/>


</p><p>They did not however entirely submit even to these, but,

preserving their independence, were continually disputing the

sovereignty both with the other Greeks and with the Macedonian kings. After the overthrow of the latter by the

Romans, the Lacones living under a bad government at that

time, and under the power of tyrants, had given some slight

offence to the generals whom the Romans sent into the province. They however recovered themselves, and were held

in very great honour. They remained free, and performed no

other services but those expected from allies. Lately however Eurycles<note anchored="yes">His character is discreditably spoken of by Josephus, Antiq. b. xvi.

abused excessively, in the exercise of his authority, the friendship of Cæsar. The government soon came to an end by the

death of Eurycles, and the son rejected all such friendships.

6. As to the nature of the places in Laconia and Messenia,

we may take the description of Euripides;<note anchored="yes">This quotation, as also the one which follows, are from a tragedy of

Euripides, now lost.</note>



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Laconia has much land capable of tillage, but difficult to be worked,

for it is hollow, surrounded by mountains, rugged, and difficult of access

to an enemy.</q></quote>



Messenia he describes in this manner:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">It bears excellent fruit; is watered by innumerable streams; it affords

the finest pasture to herds and flocks; it is not subject to the blasts of

winter, nor too much heated by the coursers of the sun;</q></quote>



and a little farther on, speaking of the division of the country

by the Heracleidæ according to lot, the first was



<quote><lg>

<l>lord of the Lacænian land, a bad soil,</l></lg></quote>



the second was Messene,



<quote><lg>

<l>whose excellence no language could express;</l></lg></quote>



and Tyrtæus speaks of it in the same manner.
</p><p>But we cannot admit that Laconia and Messenia are

bounded, as Euripides says,



<quote><lg>

<l>by the Pamisus,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>The Pirnatza.</bibl></note> which empties itself into the sea;</l></lg></quote>



this river flows through the middle of Messenia, and does not

touch any part of the present Laconia. Nor is he right, when

he says that Mess nia is inaccessible to sailors, whereas it

borders upon the sea, in the same manner as Laconia.
</p><p>Nor does he give the right boundaries of Elis;



<quote><lg>

<l>after passing the liver is Elis, the neighbour of Jove;</l></lg></quote>



and he adduces a proof unnecessarily. For if he means the

present Eleian territory, which is on the confines of Messenia,

this the Pamisus does not touch, any more than it touches Laconia, for, as has been said before, it flows through the middle

of Messenia: or, if he meant the ancient Eleia, called the Hollow, this is a still greater deviation from the truth. For after

crossing the Pamisus, there is a large tract of the Messenian

country, then the whole district of [the Lepreatæ], and of the

[Macistii], which is called Triphylia; then the Pisatis, and

Olympia; then at the distance of 300 stadia is Elis.

whether it denotes <q direct="unspecified">large,</q> which is most probable. Some

understand <foreign lang="greek">kaieta/essa</foreign> to signify, <q direct="unspecified">abounding with calaminthus;</q> others suppose, as the fissures occasioned by earthquakes are called Cæeti, that this is the origin of the epithet.

Hence Cæietas also, the name of the prison among the Lacedæmonians, which is a sort of cave. Some however say, that

such kind of hollows are rather called Coi, whence the expression of Homer,<note anchored="yes">Il. i. 268.</note> applied to wild beasts, <foreign lang="greek">fho|si\n o)reskw/|oisin,</foreign>

which live in mountain caves. Laconia however is subject to

earthquakes, and some writers relate, that certain peaks of

Taÿgetum have been broken off by the shocks.<note anchored="yes">This may have taken place a little before the third Messenian war,

<p>It appears from Homer, that both the country and the

city had the name of Lacedæmon; I mean the country together with Messenia. When he speaks of the bow and

quiver of Ulysses, he says,

and adds,



<quote><lg>

He means the country which was a part of Messenia.<note anchored="yes">Eustathius informs us that, according to some writers, Sparta and Lacedæmon were the names of the two principal quarters of the city; and

adds that the comic poet, Cratinus, gave the name of Sparta to the whole

was then no difference whether he said <q direct="unspecified">A stranger, whom he

met at Lacedæmon, gave him,</q> or, <q direct="unspecified">they met at Messene;</q>

for it is evident that Pheræ was the home of Ortilochus:

namely, Telemachus and Pisistratus. Now Pheræ<note anchored="yes">Cheramidi.</note> belongs to

Messenia. But after saying, that Telemachus and his friend

set out from Pheræ, and were driving their two horses the

whole day, he adds,

Here we must understand the city; and if we do not, the poet

says, that they journeyed from Lacedæmon to Lacedæmon.

It is otherwise improbable that the palace of Menelaus should

not be at Sparta; and if it was not there, that Telemachus

should say,

for this seems to agree with the epithets applied to the country,<note anchored="yes">The text to the end of the section is very corrupt. The following is

a translation of the text as proposed to be amended by Groskurd. The

epithet of Lacedæmon, hollow, cannot properly be applied to the country,

for this peculiarity of the city does not with any propriety agree with the

epithets given to the country; unless we suppose the epithet to be a poetical licence. For, as has been before remarked, it must be concluded

from the words of the poet himself, that Messene was then a part of Laconia, and subject to Menelaus. It would then be a contradiction (in

Homer) not to join Messene, which took part in the expedition, with

Laconia or the Pylus under Nestor, nor to place it by itself in the Catalogue, as though it had no part in the expedition.</note> unless indeed any one should allow this to be a poetical

licence; for, if Messenia was a part of Laconia, it would be a

contradiction that Messene should not be placed together with

Laconia, or with Pylus, (which was under the command of

Nestor,) nor by itself in the Catalogue of Ships, as though it

had no part in the expedition.

for vessels, and harbours. The remainder of the coast has

good ports; there are also many small islands, not worthy of

mention, lying in front of it.

<p>To the Argives belong Prasiæ,<note anchored="yes">The ruins are on the bay of Rheontas.</note> and Temenium<note anchored="yes">Toniki, or Agenitzi.</note> where

Temenus lies buried. Before coming to Temenium is the district through which the river Lerna flows, that having the same

Hydra. The Temenium is distant from Argos 26 stadia from

the sea-coast; from Argos to Heræum are 40, and thence to

Mycenæ 10 stadia.
</p><p>Next to Temenium is Nauplia, the naval station of the

Argives. Its name is derived from its being accessible to

ships. Here they say the fiction of the moderns originated

respecting Nauplius and his sons, for Homer would not have

omitted to mention them, if Palamedes displayed so much

wisdom and intelligence, and was unjustly put to death; and

if Nauplius had destroyed so many people at Caphareus.<note anchored="yes">Napoli di Romagna. Nauplius, to avenge the death of his son Palamedes, was the cause of many Greeks perishing on their return from Troy

at Cape Caphareus in Eubœa, famous for its dangerous rocks. The

modern Greeks give to this promontory the name of <foreign lang="greek">Nulofa/gos,</foreign> (Xylophagos,) or devourer of vessels. Italian navigators call it Capo d'Oro,

which in spite of its apparent signification, Golden Cape, is probably a

transformation of the Greek word Caphareus.</note> But

the genealogy offends both against the mythology, and against

chronology. For if we allow that he was the son of Neptune,<note anchored="yes">Strabo confounds Nauplius, son of Clytoreus, and father of Palamedes, with Nauplius, son of Neptune and Amymone, and one of the

the Trojan times.

<p>And first, we may observe how frequently Argos is

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the descendants of Danaus had succeeded to the

sovereignty at Argos, and the Amythaonidæ, who came from

Pisatis and Triphylia, were intermixed with them by marriages, it is not surprising that, being allied to one another,

they at first divided the country into two kingdoms, in such a

manner that the two cities, the intended capitals, Argos and

Mycenæ, were not distant from each other more than 50 stadia,

and that the Heræum at Mycenæ should be a temple common

to both. In this temple were the statues the workmanship of

Polycletus. In display of art they surpassed all others, but

in magnitude and cost they were inferior to those of Pheidias.
</p><p>At first Argos was the most powerful of the two cities. Afterwards Mycenæ received a great increase of inhabitants in

consequence of the migration thither of the Pelopidæ. For when

everything had fallen under the power of the sons of Atreus,

Agamemnon, the elder, assumed the sovereign authority, and

by good fortune and valour annexed to his possessions a large

tract of country. He also added the Laconian to the Mycenæan

district.<note anchored="yes">About <date value="1283">1283</date>, B. C.</note> Menelaus had Laconia, and Agamemnon Mycenæ,

and the country as far as Corinth, and Sicyon, and the territory which was then said to be the country of Iones and

Ægialians, and afterwards of Achæi.
</p><p>After the Trojan war, when the dominion of Agamemnon was

at an end, the declension of Mycenæ ensued, and particularly

after the return of the Heracleidæ.<note anchored="yes">About <date value="1190">1190</date>, B. C.</note> For when these people

got possession of Peloponnesus, they expelled its former masters, so that they who had Argos possessed Mycenæ likewise,

as composing one body. In subsequent times Mycenæ was

razed by the Argives, so that at present not even a trace is to

be discovered of the city of the Mycenæans.<note anchored="yes">Not strictly correct, as in the time of Pausanias, who lived about 150

years after Strabo, a large portion of the walls surrounding Mycenæ still

If Mycenæ experienced this fate, it is not surprising that

some of the cities mentioned in the Catalogue of the Ships,

and said to be subject to Argos, have disappeared. These are

the words of the Catalogue:

Licymna has its name from Licymnius. It is distant from

Nauplia about 12 stadia. This place is deserted, as well as the

neighbouring Midéa, which is different from the Bœotian

Mídea, for that is accentuated Mídea, like <foreign lang="greek">po|o\nia,</foreign> but this is

</p><p>Prosylmna borders upon Midéa; it has also a temple of

Juno. The Argives have depopulated most of these for their

refusal to submit to their authority. Of the inhabitants some

went from Tiryns to Epidaurus; others from Hermione to the

Ialieis (the Fishermen), as they are called; others were transferred by the Lacedæmonians to Messenia from Asine, (which

is itself a village in the Argive territory near Nauplia,) and

they built a small city of the same name as the Argolic Asine.

For the Lacedæmonians, according to Theopompus, got possession of a large tract of country belonging to other nations,

and settled there whatever fugitives they had received, who

had taken refuge among them; and it was to this country the

Nauplians had retreated.

<p>Hermione is one of the cities, not undistinguished.

The coast is occupied by Halieis, as they are called, a tribe

who subsist by being employed on the sea in fishing. There

is a general opinion among the Hermionenses that there is a

short descent from their country to Hades, and hence they do

not place in the mouths of the dead the fare for crossing the

an asylum for fugitives. It is said that this god exchanged

Delos for Calauria with Latona, and Tænarum for Pytho with

Apollo. Ephorus mentions the oracle respecting it:

the Lacedæmonians in behalf of Prasiæ. The veneration

for this god prevailed so strongly among the Greeks, that

<p>Epidaurus was called Epitaurus [Epicarus?]. Aristotle says, that Carians occupied both this place and Hermione,

at Cos, and at Tricca. The city lies in the recess of the

Saronic Gulf, with a coasting navigation of 15 stadia, and its

aspect is towards the point of summer sun-rise. It is surrounded with lofty mountains, which extend to the coast, so

that it is strongly fortified by nature on all sides.

<p>Ægina is a place in the territory of Epidaurus. There

is in front of this continent, an island, of which the poet means

to speak in the lines before cited. Wherefore some write,



<quote><lg>

instead of



<quote><lg>

<l>and they who occupied Ægina,</l></lg></quote>



making a distinction between the places of the same name.
</p><p>It is unnecessary to remark, that this island is among the

most celebrated. It was the country of Æacus and his descendants. It was this island which once possessed so much

power at sea, and formerly disputed the superiority with the

Athenians in the sea-fight at Salamis during the Persian war.<note anchored="yes">Herodotus, b. v. c. 83, and b. viii. c. 93.</note>

The circuit of the island is said to be about 180 stadia. It

has a city of the same name on the south-west. Around it

are Attica, and Megara, and the parts of Peloponnesus as far

as Epidaurus. It is distant from each about 100 stadia. The

eastern and southern sides are washed by the Myrtoan and

Cretan seas. Many small islands surround it on the side

towards the continent, but Belbina is situated on the side

towards the open sea. The land has soil at a certain depth,

but it is stony at the surface, particularly the plain country,

whence the whole has a bare appearance, but yields large crops

of barley. It is said that the Æginetæ were called Myrmi-

dones, not as the fable accounts for the name, when the ants

were metamorphosed into men, at the time of a great famine,

by the prayer of Æacus; but because by digging, like ants,

they threw up the earth upon the rocks, and were thus made

able to cultivate the ground, and because they lived in excavations under-ground, abstaining from the use of bricks

and sparing of the soil for this purpose.

Its inhabitants were in succession Argives, Cretans, Epidauri

18. Among the cities of the Peloponnesus, the most celebrated

were, and are at this time, Argos and Sparta, and as their renown is spread everywhere, it is not necessary to describe

them at length, for if we did so, we should seem to repeat

what is said by all writers.
</p><p>Anciently, Argos was the most celebrated, but afterwards

the Lacedæmonians obtained the superiority, and continued to

maintain their independence, except during some short interval,

when they experienced a reverse of fortune.
</p><p>The Argives did not admit Pyrrhus within the city. He

fell before the walls, an old woman having let a tile drop from

a house upon his head.
</p><p>They were, however, under the sway of other kings. When

they belonged to the Achæan league they were subjected, together with the other members of that confederacy, to the

power of the Romans. The city subsists at present, and is

second in rank to Sparta.

<p>We shall next speak of those places which are said, in

the Catalogue of the Ships, to be under the government of

Mycenæ and Agamemnon: the lines are these:

<lg type="pentameter">

</p><p>Mycenæ exists no longer. It was founded by Perseus.

Sthenelus succeeded Perseus; and Eurystheus, Sthenelus.

These same persons were kings of Argos also. It is said that

Eurystheus, having engaged, with the assistance of the Athenians, in an expedition to Marathon against the descendants

of Hercules and Iolaus, fell in battle, and that the remainder

of his body was buried at Gargettus, but his head apart from

it at Tricorythus<note anchored="yes">Tricorythus in place of Corinth is the suggestion of <emph rend="ital">Coray.</emph></note> (Corinth?), Iolaus having severed it from

</p><p>Mycenæ then passed into the possession of the Pelopidæ

who were also masters of Argos. But after the sea-fight at

Salamis, the Argives, together with the Cleonæi, and the Tegetæ, invaded Mycenæ, and razed it, and divided the territory

among themselves. The tragic writers, on account of the

proximity of the two cities, speak of them as one, and use the

name of one for the other. Euripides in the same play calls

the same city in one place Mycenæ, and in another Argos, as

in the Iphigeneia,<note anchored="yes">Iph. Taur. 508 <emph rend="ital">et seq.</emph></note> and in the Orestes.<note anchored="yes">Orest. 98, 101, <date value="1246">1246</date>.</note>
</p><p>Cleonæ is a town situated upon the road leading from Argos to Corinth, on an eminence, which is surrounded on all

sides by dwellings, and well fortified, whence, in my opinion,

Cleonæ was properly described as <q direct="unspecified">well built.</q> There also,

between Cleonæ and Phlius, is Nemea, and the grove where

it was the custom of the Argives to celebrate the Nemean

games: here is the scene of the fable of the Nemean Lion,

and here also the village Bembina. Cleonæ is distant from

Argos 120 stadia, and 80 from Corinth. And we have ourselves beheld the city from the Acrocorinthus.

<p>Corinth is said to be opulent from its mart. It is

situated upon the isthmus. It commands two harbours, one

near Asia, the other near Italy, and facilitates, by reason of so

short a distance between them, an exchange of commodities

on each side.
</p><p>As the Sicilian strait, so formerly these seas were of difficult navigation, and particularly the sea above Maleæ, on account of the prevalence of contrary winds; whence the common proverb,



<quote><lg>

<l>When you double Maleæ forget your home.</l></lg></quote>



It was a desirable thing for the merchants coming from Asia,

and from Italy, to discharge their lading at Corinth without

being obliged to double Cape Maleæ. For goods exported

from Peloponnesus, or imported by land, a toll was paid to

those who had the keys of the country. This continued after-

terwards for ever. In after-times they enjoyed even additional

advantages, for the Isthmian games, which were celebrated

there, brought thither great multitudes of people. The Bacchiadæ, a rich and numerous family, and of illustrious descent,

were their rulers, governed the state for nearly two hundred

years, and peaceably enjoyed the profits of the mart. Their

power was destroyed by Cypselus, who became king himself,



<pb n="61"/>



and his descendants continued to exist for three generations.

A proof of the wealth of this family is the offering which

Cypselus dedicated at Olympia, a statue of Jupiter of beaten

gold.
</p><p>Demaratus, one of those who had been tyrant at Corinth,

flying from the seditions which prevailed there, carried with

him from his home to Tyrrhenia so much wealth, that he became sovereign of the city which had received him, and his

son became even king of the Romans.
</p><p>The temple of Venus at Corinth was so rich, that it had

more than a thousand women consecrated to the service of the

goddess, courtesans, whom both men and women had dedi-

cated as offerings to the goddess. The city was frequented

and enriched by the multitudes who resorted thither on ac-

count of these women. Masters of ships freely squandered

all their money, and hence the proverb,

<p>The position of the city as it is described by Hieronymus, and Eudoxus, and others, and from our own observation,

since its restoration by the Romans, is as follows.
</p><p>That which is called the Acrocorinthus is a lofty mountain,

perpendicular, and about three stadia and a half in height.

There is an ascent of 30 stadia, and it terminates in a sharp

point. The steepest part is towards the north. Below it lies

the city in a plain of the form of a trapezium, at the very foot

of the Acrocorinthus. The compass of the city itself was 40

stadia, and all that part which was not protected by the

mountain was fortified by a wall. Even the mountain itself, the Acrocorinthus, was comprehended within this wall,

wherever it would admit of fortification. As I ascended it,

the ruins of the circuit of the foundation were apparent, which

gave a circumference of about 85 stadia. The other sides of

the mountain are less steep; hence, however, it stretches on-

wards, and is visible everywhere. The summit has upon it a

small temple of Venus, and below it is the fountain Peirene,

which has no efflux, but is continually full of water, which is

transparent, and fit for drinking. They say, that from the

compression of this, and of some other small under-ground

veins, originates that spring at the foot of the mountain, which

runs into the city, and furnishes the inhabitants with a sufficient supply of water. There is a large number of wells in

the city, and it is said in the Acrocorinthus also, but this I

did not see. When Euripides says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">I come from the Acrocorinthus, well-watered on all sides, the sacred

hill and habitation of Venus,</q></quote>



the epithet <q direct="unspecified">well-watered on all sides,</q> must be understood to

refer to depth; pure springs and under-ground rills are dispersed through the mountain; or we must suppose, that, anciently, the Peirene overflowed, and irrigated the mountain.

There, it is said, Pegasus was taken by Bellerophon, while

drinking; this was a winged horse, which sprung from the

neck of Medusa when the head of the Gorgon was severed

from the body. This was the horse, it is said, which caused

the Hippocrene, or Horse's Fountain, to spring up in Helicon

by striking the rock with its hoof.
</p><p>Below Peirene is the Sisypheium, which preserves a large

portion of the ruins of a temple, or palace, built of white marble. From the summit towards the north are seen Parnassus

and Helicon, lofty mountains covered with snow; then the

Crissæan Gulf,<note anchored="yes">Strabo here gives the name of Crisssæan Gulf to the eastern half of the

Gulf of Corinth.</note> lying below both, and surrounded by Phocis,

Bœotia, Megaris, by the Corinthian district opposite to Phocis,

</p><p>Above all these are situated the Oneia<note anchored="yes">Of or belonging to asses.</note> mountains, as they

<p>Lechæum is the commencement of the coast on one

side; and on the other, Cenchreæ, a village with a harbour,

the trade with Asia, and Lechæum for that with Italy.

habited. There are long walls of about 12 stadia in length,

stretching on each side of the road towards Lechæum. The

sea-shore, extending hence to Pagæ in Megaris, is washed by

the Corinthian Gulf. It is curved, and forms the Diolcus, or

the passage along which vessels are drawn over the Isthmus

to the opposite coast at Schœnus near Cenchreæ.
</p><p>Between Lechæum and Pagæ, anciently, there was the

oracle of the Acræan Juno, and Olmiæ, the promontory that

the Saronic Gulf, and the Eleusiniac, which is almost the same,

temple of the Isthmian Neptune, shaded above with a grove of

pine trees, where the Corinthians celebrated the Isthmian games.
</p><p>Crommyon<note anchored="yes">Crommyon was distant 120 stadia from Corinth, (Thuc. iv. 45,) and

120 stadia. <emph rend="ital">Smith.</emph></note> is a village of the Corinthian district, and formerly belonging to that of Megaris, where is laid the scene of

the fable of the Crommyonian sow, which, it is said, was the

dam of the Calydonian boar, and, according to tradition, the:

destruction of this sow was one of the labours of Theseus.
</p><p>Tenea is a village of the Corinthian territory, where there

was a temple of Apollo Teneates. It is said that Archias,

who equipped a colony for Syracuse, was accompanied by a

great number of settlers from this place; and that this settlement afterwards flourished more than any others, and at length

had an independent form of government of its own. When

they revolted from the Corinthians, they attached themselves

to the Romans, and continued to subsist when Corinth was

destroyed.

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>THE Ionians, who were descendants of the Athenians,

were, anciently, masters of this country. It was formerly

called Ægialeia, and the inhabitants Ægialeans, but in later

times, Ionia, from the former people, as Attica had the name

of Ionia, from Ion the son of Xuthus.
</p><p>It is said, that Hellen was the son of Deucalion, and that

he governed the country about Phthia between the Peneins

and Asopus, and transmitted to his eldest son these dominions,

sending the others out of their native country to seek a settlement each of them for himself. Dorus, one of them, settled

the Dorians about Parnassus, and when he left them, they bore

his name. Xuthus, another, married the daughter of Erechtheus, and was the founder of the Tetrapolis of Attica, which

consisted of Œnoe, Marathon, Probalinthus, and Tricorythus.
</p><p>Achæus, one of the sons of Xuthus, having committed an

accidental murder, fled to Lacedæmon, and occasioned the inhabitants to take the name of Achæans.<note anchored="yes">The story is narrated differently in Pausanias, b. vii. c. 1.</note>
</p><p>Ion, the other son, having vanquished the Thracian army

with their leader Eumolpus, obtained so much renown, that

the Athenians intrusted him with the government of their

state. It was he who first distributed the mass of the people

into four tribes, and these again into four classes according to

their occupations, husbandmen, artificers, priests, and the

fourth, military guards; after having made many more regulations of this kind, he left to the country his own name.



<pb n="68"/>



It happened at that time that the country had such an

abundance of inhabitants, that the Athenians sent out a colony of Ionians to Peloponnesus, and the tract of country

which they occupied was called Ionia after their own name,

instead of Ægialeia, and the inhabitants Ionians instead of

Ægialeans, who were distributed among twelve cities.
</p><p>After the return of the Heracleidæ, these Ionians, being

expelled by the Achæans, returned to Athens, whence, in con-

junction with the Codridæ, (descendants of Codrus,) they sent

cut the Ionian colonists to Asia.<note anchored="yes">About <date value="-1044">1044</date> B. C.</note> They founded twelve cities

on the sea-coast of Caria and Lydia, having distributed themselves over the country into as many parts as they occupied in

Peloponnesus.<note anchored="yes">The twelve cities were Phocæa, Erythræ, Clazomenæ Teos, Lebedos,

Colophon, Ephesus, Priene, Myus, Miletus, and Samos and Chios in the

neighbouring islands. See b. xiv. c. i. § 3. This account of the expulsion of the Ionians from Peloponnesus is taken from Poilybius, b. ii. c.

41, and b. iv. c. 1.</note>
</p><p>The Achæans were Phthiotæ by descent, and were settled at

Lacedæmon, but when the Heracleidæ became masters of the

country, having recovered their power under Tisamenus, the

son of Orestes, they attacked the Ionians, as I said before,

and defeated them. They drove the Ionians out of the country, and took possession of the territory, but retained the

same partition of it which they found existing there. They

became so powerful, that, although the Heracleidæ, from whom

they had revolted, occupied the rest of Peloponnesus, yet they

defended themselves against them all, and called their own

country Achæa.
</p><p>From Tisamenus to Ogyges they continued to be governed

by kings. Afterwards they established a democracy, and acquired so great renown for their political wisdom, that the

Italian Greeks, after their dissensions with the Pythagoreans,

adopted most of the laws and institutions of the Achæans. After

the battle of Leuctra the Thebans<note anchored="yes">And Laceduæmonians, adds Polybius, b, ii. c, 39.</note> committed the disputes of

the cities among each other to the arbitration of the Achæans.

At a later period their community was dissolved by the Macedonians, but they recovered by degrees their former power.

<p>For the sea was raised to a great height by an earthquake, and overwhelmed both Helice and the temple of the

Heliconian Neptune, whom the Ionians still hold in great

veneration, and offer sacrifices to his honour. They celebrate

at that spot the Panionian festival.<note anchored="yes">This festival, Panionium, or assembly of all the Ionians, was celebrated at Mycale, or at Priene at the base of Mount Mycale, opposite the

island of Samos, in a place sacred to Neptune. The Ionians had a temple

also at Miletus and another at Teos, both consecrated to the Heliconian

Neptune. Herod. i. 148; Pausanias, b. vii. c. 24.</note> According to the conjecture of some persons, Homer refers to these sacrifices in

Heliconian Neptune in the territory of Priene; for the Prienians themselves are said to have come from Helice; a young

man also of Priene is appointed to preside as king at these

sacrifices, and to superintend the celebration of the sacred

rites. A still stronger proof is adduced from what is said by

the poet respecting the bull, for the Ionians suppose, that sacrifice is performed with favourable omens, when the bull bellows at the instant that he is wounded at the altar.

of the bull and the sacrifice, asserting that these things were

done there by established custom, and that the poet drew his

</p><p>According to Heracleides, the inundation took place in his

time, and during the night. The city was at the distance

of 12 stadia from the sea, which overwhelmed the whole intermediate country as well as the city. Two thousand men were

sent by the Achæans to collect the dead bodies, but in vain.

The territory was divided among the bordering people. This

calamity happened in consequence of the anger of Neptune,

for the Ionians, who were driven from Helice, sent particularly

to request the people of Helice to give them the image of

Neptune, or if they were unwilling to give that, to furnish

them with the model of the temple. On their refusal, the

Ionians sent to the Achæan body, who decreed, that they should

comply with the request, but they would not obey even this

injunction. The disaster occurred in the following winter,

and after this the Achæans gave the Ionians the model of the

temple.

<p>The Achæans, during a period of five and twenty years,

elected, annually, a common secretary, and two military chiefs.

Their common assembly of the council met at one place, called

Arnarium, (Homarium, or Amarium,) where these persons,

and, before their time, the Ionians, consulted on public affairs.

They afterwards resolved to elect one military chief. When

Aratus held this post, he took the Acrocorinthus from Antigonus, and annexed the city as well as his own country to

<p>The order of the places which the Achæans inhabited, according to the distribution into twelve parts, is as follows.

Next to Sicyon is Pellene; Ægeira, the second; the third,

Ægæ, with a temple of Neptune; Bura, the fourth; then

Helice, where the Ionians took refuge after their defeat by the

Achæans, and from which place they were at last banished;

after Helice are Ægium, Rhypes, Patræ, and Phara; then Olenus, beside which runs the large river [Peirus?]; then Dyme,

and Tritsæis. The Ionians dwelt in villages, but the Achæans

founded cities, to some of which they afterwards united others

transferred from other quarters, as Ægæ to Ægeira, (the inhabitants, however, were called Ægæi,) and Olenus to Dyme.

obstruction of its sources. For the Berethra near Pheneum,

through which it now passes, fell in in consequence of an

earthquake, which stopped the waters of the river, and affected far down the veins which supplied its source. This

is the account of some writers.
</p><p>Eratosthenes says, that about the Pheneus, the river called

Anias forms a lake, and then sinks under-ground into certain

openings, which they call Zerethra. When these are obstructed, the water sometimes overflows into the plains, and

when they are again open the water escapes in a body

from the plains, and is discharged into the Ladon<note anchored="yes">The Landona.</note> and the Alpheius,<note anchored="yes">The Carbonaro.</note> so that it happened once at Olympia, that the land

the return of the Heracleidæ; as Aletes, the founder of Corinth; Phalces, of Sicyon; Tisamenus, of cities in Achæa; Oxylus, of Elis, Cresphontes, of Messene; Eurysthenes and Procles, of Lacedæmon; Temenus and Cissus, of Argos; and

Agræus and Deiphontes, of the towns about Acte.

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>HAVING completed the description of Peloponnesus,

which we said was the first and least of the peninsulas of

which Greece consists, we must next proceed to those which

are continuous with it.<note anchored="yes">The peninsulas described by Strabo, are:


<p>1. The Peloponnesus, properly so called, bounded by the Isthmus of

Corinth.</p>


<p>2. The peninsula bounded by a line drawn from Pagæ to Nisæa, and

including the above.</p>


<p>3. The peninsula bounded by a line drawn from the recess of the

Crissæan Gulf, properly so called, (the Bay of Salona,) to Thermopylæ,

and includes the two first.</p>

<p>4. The peninsula bounded by a line drawn from the Ambracic Gulf

to Thermopylæ and the Maliac Gulf, and includes the three former.</p>


<p>5. The peninsula bounded by a line drawn from the Ambracic Gulf

to the recess of the Thermaic Gulf, and contains the former four peninsulas.</p></note>
</p><p>We described the second to be that which joins Megaris

to the Peloponnesus [so that Crommyon belongs to Megaris,

and not to the Corinthians];<note anchored="yes">These words are transposed from after the word Epicnemidii, as suggested by Cramer.</note> the third to be that which is

situated near the former, comprising Attica and Bœotia, some

part of Phocis, and of the Locri Epicnemidii. Of these we

are now to speak.
</p><p>Eudoxus says, that if we imagine a straight line to be

drawn towards the east from the Ceraunian Mountains to

Sunium, the promontory of Attica, it would leave, on the

right hand, to the south, the whole of Peloponnesus, and on

the left, to the north, the continuous coast from the Ceraunian



<pb n="79"/>



Mountains to the Crisæan Gulf, and the whole of Megaris

and Attica. He is of opinion that the shore which extends

from Sunium to the Isthmus, would not have so great a curvature, nor have so great a bend, if, to this shore, were not

added the parts continuous with the Isthmus and extending

to the Hermionic Bay and Acté; that in the same manner

the shore, from the Ceraunian Mountains to the Gulf of

Corinth, has a similar bend, so as to make a curvature, forming within it a sort of gulf, where Rhium and Antirrhium

contracting together give it this figure. The same is the

case with the shore about Crissa and the recess, where the

Crissæan Sea terminates.<note anchored="yes">The Crissæan Gulf, properly so called, is the modern Bay of Salona.

But probably Strabo (or rather Eudoxus, whose testimony he alleges) intended to comprehend, under the denomination of Crissæan, the whole

gulf, more commonly called Corinthian by the ancients, that is, the gulf

which commenced at the strait between Rhium and Antirrhium, and of

which the Crissæan Gulf was only a portion. The text in the above

passage is very corrupt.</note>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As this is the description given by Eudoxus, a mathematician, skilled in the delineations of figures and the inclinations of places, acquainted also with the places themselves, we must consider the sides of Attica and Megaris,

extending from Sunium as far as the Isthmus, to be curved,

although slightly so. About the middle of the above-men-

tioned line<note anchored="yes">From Sunium to the Isthmus.</note> is the Piræus, the naval arsenal of the Athenians.

It is distant from Schoenus, at the Isthmus, about 350 stadia;

from Sunium 330. The distance from the Piræus to Pagæ<note anchored="yes">Libadostani.</note>

and from the Piræus to Schœnus is nearly the same, yet the

former is said to exceed the latter by 10 stadia. After having

doubled Sunium, the navigation along the coast is to the

north with a declination to the west.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Acte (Attica) is washed by two seas; it is at first

narrow, then it widens towards the middle, yet it, nevertheless, takes a lunated bend towards Oropus in Bœotia, having

the convex side towards the sea. This is the second, the

eastern side of Attica.
</p><p>The remaining side is that to the north, extending from

the territory of Oropus towards the west, as far as Megaris,

and consists of the mountainous tract of Attica, having a

variety of names, and dividing Bœotia from Attica; so that,

as I have before remarked, Bœotia, by being connected with



<pb n="80"/>



two seas, becomes the Isthmus of the third peninsula, which

we have mentioned before, and this Isthmus includes within

it the Peloponnesus, Megaris, and Attica. For this reason

therefore the present Attica was called by a play upon the

words Acta and Actica, because the greatest part of it lies

under the mountains, and borders on the sea; it is narrow,

and stretches forwards a considerable length as far as Sunium. We shall therefore resume the description of these

sides, beginning from the sea-coast, at the point where we

left off.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Crommyon, rising above Attica, are the rocks

called Scironides, which afford no passage along the sea-side.

Over them, however, is a road which leads to Megara and

Attica from the Isthmus. The road approaches so near the

rocks that in many places it runs along the edge of precipices,

for the overhanging mountain is of great height, and impassable.
</p><p>Here is laid the scene of the fable of Sciron, and the

Pityocamptes, or the pine-breaker, one of those who infested

with their robberies the above-mentioned mountainous tract.

They were slain by Theseus.
</p><p>The wind Argestes,<note anchored="yes">N. W. by W., 1/4 W.</note> which blows from the left with

violence, from these summits is called by the Athenians

Sciron.
</p><p>After the rocks Scironides there projects the promontory

Minoa, forming the harbour of Nisæa. Nisæa is the arsenal

of Megara, and distant 18 stadia from the city; it is joined to it by walls on each side.<note anchored="yes">Literally, <q direct="unspecified">by legs on each side.</q> Nisæa was united to Megara, as

the Piræus to Athens, by two lone walls.</note> This also had the name of

Minoa.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In former times the Ionians occupied this country, and

were also in possession of Attica, before the time of the

building of Megara, wherefore the poet does not mention

these places by any appropriate name, but when he calls all

those dwelling in Attica, Athenians, he comprehends these

also in the common appellation, regarding them as Athenians;

so when, in the Catalogue of the Ships, he says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>And they who occupied Athens, a well-built city,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. ii. 546.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. ii. 546.</bibl></cit>



<pb n="81"/>



we must understand the present Megarenses also, as having

taken a part in the expedition. The proof of this is, that

Attica was, in former times, called Ionia, and Ias, and when

the poet says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>There the Bœoti, and Iaones,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xiii. 685.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xiii. 685.</bibl></cit>



he means the Athenians. But of this Ionia Megaris was a

part.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Besides, the Peloponnesians and Ionians having had frequent disputes respecting their boundaries, on which Crommyonia also was situated, assembled and agreed upon a spot

of the Isthmus itself, on which they erected a pillar having

an inscription on the part towards Peloponnesus,



<quote><lg>

<l>THIS IS PELOPONNESUS, NOT IONIA;</l></lg></quote>



and on the side towards Megara,



<quote><lg>

<l>THIS IS NOT PELOPONNESUS, BUT IONIA.</l></lg></quote>



Although those, who wrote on the history of Attica<note anchored="yes">See note to vol. i. page 329.</note> differ

in many respects, yet those of any note agree in this, that

when there were four Pandionidæ, Ægeus, Lycus, Pallas,

and Nisus; and when Attica was divided into four portions, Nisus obtained, by lot, Megaris, and founded Nisæa.

Philochorus says, that his government extended from the

Isthmus to Pythium,<note anchored="yes">This place is unknown.</note> but according to Andron, as far as

Eleusis and the Thriasian plain.
</p><p>Since, then, different writers give different accounts of the

division of the country into four parts, it is enough to adduce

these lines from Sophocles where Ægeus says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">My father determined that I should go away to Acte, having assigned

to me, as the elder, the best part of the land; to Lycus, the opposite garden of Eubœa; for Nisus he selects the irregular tract of the shore of

Sciron; and the rugged Pallas, breeder of giants, obtained by lot the part

to the south.</q><note anchored="yes">From a lost tragedy of Sophocles.</note></quote>



Such are the proofs which are adduced to show that Megaris was a part of Attica.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the return of the Heraclidæ, and the partition of

the country, many of the former possessors were banished from

their own land by the Heraclidæ, and by the Dorians, who

came with them, and migrated to Attica. Among these was

Melanthus, the king of Messene. He was voluntarily ap-



<pb n="82"/>



pointed king of the Athenians, after having overcome in

single combat, Xanthus, the king of the Bœotians. When

Attica became populous by the accession of fugitives, the

Heraclidæ were alarmed, and invaded Attica, chiefly at the

instigation of the Corinthians and Messenians; the former

of whom were influenced by proximity of situation, the latter

by the circumstance that Codrus, the son of Melanthus, was

at that time king of Attica. They were, however, defeated

in battle and relinquished the whole of the country, except

the territory of Megara, of which they kept possession, and

founded the city Megara, where they introduced as inhabitants Dorians in place of Ionians. They destroyed the pillar

also which was the boundary of the country of the Ionians

and the Peloponnesians.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The city of the Megarenses, after having experienced

many changes, still subsists. It once had schools of philosophers, who had the name of the Megaric sect. They succeeded Euclides, the Socratic philosopher, who was by birth a

Megarensian, in the same manner as the Eleiaci, among whom

was Pyrrhon, who succeeded Phædon, the Eleian, who was also

a Socratic philosopher, and as the Eretriaci succeeded Menedemus the Eretrean.
</p><p>Megaris, like Attica, is very sterile, and the greater part of

it is occupied by what are called the Oneii mountains, a kind

of ridge, which, extending from the Scironides rocks to Bœotia

and to Cithæron, separates the sea at Nisæa from that near

Page, called the Alcyonian Sea.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In sailing from Nisæa to Attica there lie, in the course

of the voyage, five small islands. Then succeeds Salamis,

which is about 70, and according to others, 80, stadia in

length. It has two cities of the same name. The ancient

city, which looked towards Ægina, and to the south, as

Æschylus has described it;



<quote><lg>

<l>Ægina lies towards the blasts of the south:</l></lg></quote>



it is uninhabited. The other is situated in a bay on a spot of a

peninsular form contiguous to Attica. In former times it

had other names, for it was called Sciras, and Cychreia, from

certain heroes; from the former Minerva is called Sciras;

hence also Scira, a place in Attica; Episcirosis, a religions

rite; and Scirophorion, one of the months. From Cychreia



<pb n="83"/>



the serpent Cychrides had its name, which Hesiod says

Cychreus bred, and Eurylochus ejected, because it infested

the island, but that Ceres admitted it into Eleusis, and it became her attendant. Salamis was called also Pityussa from

<q direct="unspecified">pitys,</q> the pine tree. The island obtained its renown from

the Æacidæ, who were masters of it, particularly from Ajax,

the son of Telamon, and from the defeat of Xerxes by the

Greeks in a battle on the coast, and by his flight to his own

country. The Æginetæ participated in the glory of that engagement, both as neighbours, and as having furnished a considerable naval force. [In Salamis is the river Bocarus, now

called Bocalia.]<note anchored="yes">Probably interpolated.</note>

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>At present the Athenians possess the island Salamis.

In former times they disputed the possession of it with the

Megarians. Some allege, that Pisistratus, others that

Solon, inserted in the Catalogue of Ships immediately after

this verse,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Ajax conducted from Salamis twelve vessels,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. ii. 557.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. ii. 557.</bibl></cit>



the following words,



<quote><lg>

<l>And stationed them by the side of the Athenian forces;</l></lg></quote>



and appealed to the poet as a witness, that the island originally belonged to the Athenians. But this is not admitted by

the critics, because many other lines testify the contrary.

For why does Ajax appear at the extremity of the line not

with the Athenians, but with the Thessalians under the command of Protesilaus;



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>There were the vessels of Ajax, and Protesilaus.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xiii. 681.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xiii. 681.</bibl></cit>

and again, respecting Ajax and the Salaminii;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">he came to the Ajaces,</q><note anchored="yes">Il. iv. 273.</note></quote>



and near them,

not Menestheus. The Athenians then seem to have alleged



<pb n="84"/>



some such evidence as this from Homer as a pretext, and the

Megarians to have replied in an opposite strain of this kind;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Ajax conducted ships from Salamis, from Polichna, from Ægirussa,

from Nisæa, and from Tripodes,</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 557.</note></quote>



which are places in Megaris, of which Tripodes has the name

of Tripodiscium, situated near the present forum of Megara.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some say, that Salamis is unconnected with Attica, because the priestess of Minerva Polias, who may not eat the

new cheese of Attica, but the produce only of a foreign

land, yet uses the Salaminian cheese. But this is a mistake, for she uses that which is brought from other islands,

that are confessedly near Attica, for the authors of this

custom considered all produce as foreign which was brought

over sea.
</p><p>It seems as if anciently the present Salamis was a separate

state, and that Megara was a part of Attica.
</p><p>On the sea-coast, opposite to Salamis, the boundaries of

Megara and Attica are two mountains called Cerata, or

Horns.<note anchored="yes">These horns, according to Wheler, are two pointed rocks on the sum-

rocks is a tower, called by the modern Greeks Cerata or Kerata-Pyrga.</note>

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Above this coast is a mountain called Corydallus, and

the demus Corydalleis: then the harbour of Phoron, (Robbers,)

and Psyttalia, a small rocky desert island, which, according to

some writers, is the eye-sore of the Piræus.
</p><p>Near it is Atalanta, of the same name as that between

Eubœa and the Locri; and another small island similar to

Psyttalia; then the Piræus, which is also reckoned among the

demi, and the Munychia.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Munychia is a hill in the shape of a peninsula,

hollow, and a great part of it excavated both by nature and

art, so as to serve for dwellings, with an entrance by a nar-

row opening. Beneath it are three harbours. Formerly the

Munychia was surrounded by a wall, and occupied by dwellings, nearly in the same manner as the city of the Rhodians,

comprehending within the circuit of the walls the Piræus and

the harbours full of materials for ship-building; here also

was the armoury, the work of Philon. The naval station

was capable of receiving the four hundred vessels; which

was the smallest number the Athenians were in the habit of

keeping in readiness for sea. With this wall were connected

the legs, that stretched out from the Asty. These were the

long walls, 40 stadia in length, joining the Asty<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">to\ a(/stu,</foreign> the Asty, was the upper town, in opposition to the lower

town, of Piræus. See Smith's Dictionary for a very able and interesting

Piræus. But in consequence of frequent wars, the wall and

the fortification of the Munychia were demolished; the

Piræus was contracted to a small town, extending round the

harbours and the temple of Jupiter Soter. The small porticoes of the temple contain admirable paintings, the work of

celebrated artists, and the hypæthrum, statues. The long

walls also were destroyed, first demolished by the Lacedæmonians, and afterwards by the Romans, when Sylla took the

Piræus and the Asty by siege.<note anchored="yes">Sylla took Athens, after a long and obstinate siege, on the 1st March,

built by Ictinus, in which is the Minerva, in ivory, the work

Yet this very writer mentions only one of the remarkable

things to be seen in the Acropolis. Polemo Periegetes<note anchored="yes">An eminent geographer. He made extensive journeys through

Greece to collect materials for his geographical works, and as a collector

remarks on other parts of the city, and of the territory: after

speaking of Eleusis, one of the hundred and seventy demi, to

which as they say four are to be added, he mentions no other

by name.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Many, if not all the demi, have various fabulous tales

thon, the battle with the Persians; at Rhamnus was the

statue of Nemesis, which, according to some writers, is the

work of Diodotus, according to others, of Agoracritus, the

Parian, so well executed, both as to size and beauty, as to

rival the art of Pheidias. Deceleia was the rendezvous of the

Peloponnesians in the Decelic war. From Phyle Thrasybu-

lus brought back the people to the Piræus, and thence to the

Asty. Thus also much might be told respecting many other

places; the Leocorium, the Theseium, and the Lyceum have

their own fables, and the Olympicum, called also the Olympium, which the king, who dedicated it, left, at his death,

half finished; so also much might be said of the Academia.

<p>The account would be much longer if we were to in-

quire who were the founders of the city from the time of

Cecrops, for writers do not agree, as is evident from the names

of persons and of places. For example, Attica,<note anchored="yes">The country was called Actica from Actæos. <emph rend="ital">Parian Chronicle.</emph></note> they say,

was derived from Actæon; Atthis, and Attica, from Atthis,

the daughter of Cranaus, from whom the inhabitants had the

name Cranai; Mopsopia from Mopsopus; Ionia from Ion, the

son of Xuthus; Poseidonia and Athenæ, from the deities of

that name. We have said, that the nation of the Pelasgi seem

to have come into this country in the course of their migrations, and were called from their wanderings, by the Attici,

Pelargi, or storks.

<p>In proportion as an earnest desire is excited to ascertain the truth about remarkable places and events, and in

proportion as writers, on these subjects, are more numerous,

so much the more is an author exposed to censure, who does

not make himself master of what has been written. For example, in <q direct="unspecified">the Collection of the Rivers,</q> Callimachus says,

that he should laugh at the person, who would venture to

describe the Athenian virgins as



<pb n="88"/>



<quote><lg>

from which even the herds would turn away. There are

indeed fountains of water, pure and fit for drinking, it is said,

without the gate called Diochares, near the Lyceium; formerly

also a fountain was erected near it, which afforded a large supply of excellent water; but if it is not so at present, is it at

all strange, that a fountain supplying abundance of pure and

potable water at one period of time, should afterwards have

the property of its waters altered?
</p><p>In subjects, however, which are so numerous, we cannot

enter into detail; yet they are not so entirely to be passed

over in silence as to abstain from giving a condensed account

of some of them.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It will suffice then to add, that, according to Philochorus, when the country was devastated on the side of the

sea by the Carians, and by land by the Bœotians, whom they

called Aones, Cecrops first settled a large body of people in

twelve cities, the names of which were Cecropia, Tetrapolis,

Epacria, Deceleia, Eleusis, Aplhidnæ, (although some persons

write it in the plural number, Aphidnæ,) Thoricus, Brauron,

Cytherus, Sphettus, Cephisia [Phalerus]. Again, at a subsequent period, Theseus is said to have collected the inhabitants of the twelve cities into one, the present city.
</p><p>Formerly, the Athenians were governed by kings; they

afterwards changed the government to a democracy; then

tyrants were their masters, as Pisistratus and his sons; afterwards there was an oligarchy both of the four hundred and

of the thirty tyrants, whom the Lacedæmonii set over them;

these were expelled by the Athenians, who retained the form

of a democracy, till the Romans established their empire.

For, although they were somewhat oppressed by the Macedonian kings, so as to be compelled to obey them, yet they preserved entire the same form of government. Some say, that

the government was very well administered during a period

of ten years, at the time that Casander was king of the

Macedonians. For this person, although in other respects

he was disposed to be tyrannical, yet, when lie was master of

the city, treated the Athenians with kindness and generosity.

He placed at the head of the citizens Demetrius the Phalerean,

a disciple of Theophrastus the philosopher, who, far from

dissolving, restored the democracy. This appears from his



<pb n="89"/>



memoirs, which he composed concerning this mode of government. But so much hatred and dislike prevailed against

anything connected with oligarchy, that, after the death of

Casander, he was obliged to fly into Egypt.<note anchored="yes">Demetrius Phalereus was driven from Athens, <date value="-307">307</date> B. C., whence he

<p>NEXT in order is Bœotia. When I speak of this country,

and of the contiguous nations, I must, for the sake of perspicuity, repeat what I have said before.
</p><p>We have said, that the sea-coast stretches from Sunium to

the north as far as Thessalonica, inclining a little toward the

west, and having the sea on the east, that parts situated above

this shore towards the west extend like belts<note anchored="yes">In the following description of Greece, Strabo employs the term belts

or bands (<foreign lang="greek">taini/as</foreign>) for the territory intercepted between the lines forming

the peninsulas. See note, chap. i. § 1, of this book.</note> parallel to one

another through the whole country. The first of these belts

is Attica with Megaris, the eastern side of which extends



<pb n="92"/>



from Sunium to Oropus, and Bœotia; on the western side is

the isthmus, and the Alcyonian sea commencing at Pagæ and

extending as far as the boundaries of Bœotia near Creusa,

the remaining two sides are formed by the sea-shore from

Sunium to the Isthmus, and the mountain tract nearly parallel with this, which separates Attica from Bœotia.
</p><p>The second belt is Bœotia, stretching from east to west

from the Eubœan sea to the Crisæan Gulf, nearly of equal

length with Attica, or perhaps somewhat less; in quality of

soil however it greatly surpasses Attica.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus declares the superiority of Bœotia over the

bordering nations not only in this respect, but also because it

alone has three seas adjoining it, and a great number of

harbours. At the Criss$ean and Corinthian Gulfs it received

the commodities of Italy, Sicily, and Africa. Towards Eubœa the sea-coast branches off on each side of the Euripus;

in one direction towards Aulis and Tanagrica, in the other,

to Salganeus and Anthedon; on one side there is an open

sea to Egypt, and Cyprus, and the islands; on the other to

Macedonia, the Propontis, and the Hellespont. He adds also

that Eubœa is almost a part of Bœotia, because the Euripus is

very narrow, and the opposite shores are brought into communication by a bridge of two plethra in length.<note anchored="yes">About 67 yards. See also b. x. ch. i. § 8.</note>
</p><p>For these reasons he praises the country, and says, that it

has natural advantages for obtaining supreme command, but

that from want of careful education and learning, even those

who were from time to time at the head of affairs did not long

maintain the ascendency they had acquired, as appears from

the example of Epaminondas; at his death the Thebans immediately lost the supremacy they had just acquired. This is

to be attributed, says Ephorus, to their neglect of learning, and

of intercourse with mankind, and to their exclusive cultivation of military virtues. It must be added also, that learning

and knowledge are peculiarly useful in dealing with Greeks,

but in the case of Barbarians, force is preferable to reason. In

fact the Romans in early times, when carrying on war with

savage nations, did not require such accomplishments, but

from the time that they began to be concerned in transactions with more civilized people, they applied themselves to

learning, and so established universal dominion.

3. Bœotia was first occupied by Barbarians, Aones, and

Temmices, a wandering people from Sunium, by Leleges, and

Hyantes. Then the Phœnicians, who accompanied Cadmus,

possessed it. He fortified the Cadmeian land, and transmitted the government to his descendants. The Phœnicians

founded Thebes, and added it to the Cadmeian territory. They

preserved their dominion, and exercised it over the greatest

part of the Bœotians till the time of the expedition of the

Epigoni. At this period they abandoned Thebes for a short

time, but returned again. In the same manner when they

were ejected by Thracians and Pelasgi, they established their

rule in Thessaly together with the Arnœi for a long period,

so that all the inhabitants obtained the name of Bœotians.

They returned afterwards to their own country, at the time

the Æolian expedition was preparing at Aulis in Bœotia

which the descendants of Orestes were equipping for Asia.

After having united the Orchomenian tract to Bœotia (for

formerly they did not form one community, nor has Homer

enumerated these people with the Bœotians, but by themselves, calling them Minyæ) with the assistance of the Orchomenians they drove out the Pelasgi, who went to Athens, a

part of which city is called from this people Pelasgic. The

Pelasgi however settled below Hymettus. The Thracians

retreated to Parnassus. The Hyantes founded Hyampolis in

Phocis.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus relates that the Thracians, after making treaty

with the Bœotians, attacked them by night, when encamped

in a careless manner during a time of peace. The Thracians

when reproached, and accused of breaking the treaty, replied,

that they had not broken it, for the conditions were <q direct="unspecified">by

day,</q> whereas they had made the attack by night, whence

the common proverb, <q direct="unspecified">a Thracian shuffle.</q>
</p><p>The Pelasgi and the Bœotians also went during the war to

consult the oracle. He cannot tell, he says, what answer was

given to the Pelasgi, but the prophetess replied to the Bœotians that they would prosper by committing some act of

impiety. The messengers sent to consult the oracle suspecting

the prophetess of favouring the Pelasgi on account of their

relationship, (for the temple had originally belonged to the

Pelasgi,) seized the woman, and threw her upon a burning

pile, considering, that whether her conduct bad been right or



<pb n="94"/>



wrong, in either case they were right; for if she had uttered

a deceitful answer she was duly punished; but if not, they

had only complied with the command of the oracle. Those

in charge of the temple did not like to put to death, particularly in the temple, the perpetrators of this act without a

formal judgment, and therefore subjected them to a trial.

They were summoned before the priestesses, who were also the

prophetesses, being the two survivors out of the three. The

Bœotians alleged that there was no law permitting women to

act as judges; an equal number of men were therefore chosen.

The men acquitted; the women condemned. As the votes

were equal, those for acquittal prevailed. Hence at Dodona

it is to the Bœotians only that men deliver oracles. The

prophetesses however give a different meaning to the answer

of the oracle, and say, that the god enjoins the Bœotians to

steal the tripods used at home, and to send them annually to

Dodona. This they did, for they were in the habit of carrying away by night some of the dedicated tripods, which they

concealed in their clothes, in order to convey them clandestinely as offerings to Dodona.

<p>After this they assisted Penthilus in sending out the

they were disappointed in their hope of obtaining this supremacy. They, nevertheless, fought in defence of the Greeks

against the Phocæans, who had plundered their common temple. Reduced by this war, and by the Macedonians, at the

time they invaded Greece, they lost their city, which was

that he was put to death before they reached the Euripus, by

the commander of the fleet, Megabates, as a traitor, for conducting the fleet deceitfully into a narrow opening of the sea,

Delphi whenever it is observed. They were to keep watch

for three months, and for three days and nights in each month,

at the altar of Jupiter Astrapius, or Dispenser of lightning.

This altar is in the wall, between the Pythium and the Olympium. Respecting the Bœotian Harma, some say, that Amphiaraus fell in battle out of his chariot, [harma,] near the

spot where his temple now stands, and that the chariot was

drawn empty to the place, which bears the same name

[Harma].<note anchored="yes">The exact site of Harma is uncertain. Leake supposes it to have

<p>The places next in order, in the inland parts, are

hollow plains, surrounded everywhere on the east and west by

mountains; on the south by the mountains of Attica, on the

north by those of Phocis: on the west, Cithæron inclines, obliquely, a little above the Crisæan Sea; it begins contiguous

to the mountains of Megaris and Attica, and then makes a

bend towards the plains, and terminates near the Theban

territory.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some of these plains become lakes, by rivers spreading

over or falling into them and then flowing off. Some are

dried up, and being very fertile, are cultivated in every possible way. But as the ground underneath is full of caverns

and fissures, it has frequently happened, that violent earthquakes have obstructed some passages, and formed others under-ground, or on the surface, the water being carried off,

either by subterranean channels, or by the formation of lakes

and rivers on the surface. If the deep subterranean passages

are stopped up, the waters of the lakes increase, so as to inundate and cover cities and whole districts, which become uncovered, if the same or other passages are again opened. The

same regions are thus traversed in boats or on foot, according

to circumstances; and the same cities are, occasionally, on the

borders of, or at a distance from, a lake.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>One of two things took place. The cities either retained their sites, when the rise of the water was insufficient

to overflow the houses, or they were deserted and rebuilt in

some other place, when the inhabitants, being frequently exposed to danger from their vicinity to the lake, released themselves from further apprehension, by changing to a more

distant or higher situation. It followed that the cities thus

rebuilt retained the same name. Formerly, they might have

had a name derived from some accidental local circumstance,

but now the site does not correspond with the derivation of

the name. For example, it is probable that Platææ was so

called, from <foreign lang="greek">pla/th,</foreign> or the flat part of the oar, and Platæans

from gaining their livelihood by rowing; but at present,

since they live at a distance from the lake, the name can no

longer, with equal propriety, be derived from this local circumstance. Helos also, and Heleon, and Heilesium<note anchored="yes">The sites of these places are unknown.</note> were so

called from their situation close to <foreign lang="greek">e(/lh,</foreign> (Hele,) or marshes;

but at present the case is different with all these places; either

they have been rebuilt, or the lake has been greatly reduced

in height by a subsequent efflux of its waters; for this is possible.

Mount Helicon. The stream on the western side of the city is the one

called Hoplites by Plutarch, where Lysander fell in battle with the Thebans, B. C. <date value="-395">395</date>, and is apparently the same as the Lophis of Pausanias.

The stream on the eastern side, the Kafalari, is formed by the union of

It has an ancient temple of Minerva, which is held in great

veneration. It is said that this was the place of her birth, as

Argos was that of Juno, and that Homer gave to both these

goddesses designations derived from their native places. Perhaps for this reason he has not mentioned, in the Catalogue,

the inhabitants; for having a sacred character, they were exempted from military service. Indeed the city has never suffered devastation by an enemy, although it is inconsiderable

in size, and its position is weak, for it is situated in a plain.

and particularly after they were defeated in a second battle at

Mantinea. Even after these reverses they preserved their

independence until the establishment of the Roman dominion,

and were always respected by that people on account of the

excellency of their form of government. The field of battle

is shown on the road which leads from Platææ to Thespiæ.

<p>The poet next mentions the Orchomenians in the Catalogue, and distinguishes them from the Bœotian nation. He

gives to Orchomenus the epithet Minyeian from the nation of

the Minyæ. They say that a colony of the Minyeians went

hence to Iolcus,<note anchored="yes">See below, ch. v. § 15.</note> and from this circumstance the Argonauts

were called Minyæ. It appears that, anciently, it was a rich

and very powerful city. Homer bears witness to its wealth,

for in his enumeration of places of great opulence, he says,



<q direct="unspecified">Not all that is brought to Orchomenus, or to Ægyptian Thebes.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ix. 381.</note>



Of its power there is this proof, that the Thebans always paid

tribute to the Orchomenians, and to Erginus their king, who it

is said was put to death by Hercules. Eteocles, one of the

kings that reigned at Orchomenus, first displayed both wealth

and power. He built a temple dedicated to the Graces, who

were thus honoured by him, either because he had been fortunate in receiving or conferring favours, or perhaps for both

these reasons.
</p><p>[For one who was inclined thus to honour these goddesses, must have been naturally disposed to be a benefactor,

and he must have possessed the power. But for this purpose

wealth is required. For he who has not much cannot give

much, nor can he who does not receive much possess much;

but when giving and receiving unite, then there is a just exchange. For a vessel which is simultaneously emptied and

filled is always full; but he who gives and does not receive

cannot succeed in either giving or receiving, for the giver

must desist from giving from failure of means. Givers also

will desist from giving to him who receives only, and confers

no benefits, so that he must fail in receiving. The same may

be said of power. For independently of the common saying,

we may examine the subject more in detail. We say, for example, that kings have the greatest power, (<foreign lang="greek">ma/lista du/nsqsi,</foreign>)

whence the name, dynasty. Their power is exerted by leading the multitude whither they like, by persuasion or by force.

Their power of persuasion chiefly rests in doing acts of kindness; for persuasion by words is not princely, but belongs to

the orator. By princely persuasion, I mean, when kings direct and lead men whither they please by acts of kindness.

They persuade by acts of kindness, but compel by means of

arms. Both power and possessions may be purchased by

money. For he has the largest body of forces, who is able to

maintain the largest; and he who has the largest possessions,

can confer the greatest benefits.<note anchored="yes">Probably an interpolation</note>]

The spot which the present lake Copaïs occupies, was formerly, it is said, dry ground, and was cultivated in various

ways by the Orchomenians, who lived near it; and this is alleged as a proof of wealth.

<p>NEXT to Bœotia and Orchomenus is Phocis, lying along

the side of Bœotia to the north, and, anciently, nearly from sea

to sea. For at that time Daphnus belonged to Phocis, dividing

Locris into two parts, and situated midway between the Opuntian Gulf and the sea-coast of the Epicnemidii. At present,

however, the district belongs to the Locri; but the town is in

ruins, so that Phocis no longer extends to the sea opposite Eubœa; but it is close to the Crisæan Gulf. For Crisa itself belongs to Phocis, and is situated immediately upon the sea.

Cirrha, Anticyra,<note anchored="yes">Aspra-Spitia.</note> and the places above them, in the interior

near Parnassus in continuous succession, namely, Delphi,<note anchored="yes">Kastri.</note>

Cirphis, and Daulis,<note anchored="yes">Daulia.</note> belong to Phocis, so also Parnassus itself, which is the boundary of the western side.
</p><p>In the same manner as Phocis lies along the side of Bœotia,

so are both the divisions of Locris situated with respect to

Phocis, for Locris is composed of two parts, being divided by

Parnassus. The western part lies along the side of Parnassus,

occupies a portion of it, and extends to the Crisæan Gulf; the

eastern part terminates at the sea near Eubœa. The inhabitants of the former are called Locri Hesperii, or Locri Ozolæs, and

have engraven on their public seal the star Hesperus. The rest

are again divided into two bodies: one, the Opuntii, who have

their name from the chief city, and border upon the Phocæans and Bœotians; the other, the Epicnemidii, who have their

name from the mountain Cnemis;<note anchored="yes">It is a continuation of the ridge of Œta.</note> and adjoin the Œtæi,

and the Malienses. In the midst of the Hesperii, and the

other Locri, is Parnassus, lying lengthwise towards the northern part, and extending from the neighbourhood of Delphi to

the junction of the Œtæn, and the Ætolian mountains, and

to the Dorians, who are situated between them. For as both

divisions of Locris extend along the side of Phocis, so also the

region of Æta with Ætolia, and some of the places situated in

the Doric Tetrapolis, extend along the sides of the two Locri,

Parnassus and the Dorians. Immediately above these are

situated the Thessalians, the northern Ætolians, the Acarnanians, and some of the Epirotic and Macedonian nations, as I

observed before, the above-mentioned tracts of country may

be considered as a kind of parallel bands stretching from the

west to the east.
</p><p>The whole of Parnassus is esteemed sacred, it contains

caves, and other places, which are regarded with honour and



<pb n="115"/>



reverence. Of these the most celebrated and the most beautiful is Corycium, a cave of the nymphs, having the same

name as that in Cilicia. Of the sides of Parnassus, the western is occupied by the Locri Ozolæ, and by some of the Dorians, and by the Ætoli, situated near Corax, an Ætolian

mountain. The eastern side is occupied by Phocians and by

the greater part of the Dorians, who hold the Tetrapolis, situated as it were round the side of Parnassus, but spreading out

in the largest extent towards the east. The sides of the

above-mentioned tracts and each of the bands are parallel, one

side being northern, and the other southern. The western

sides, however, are not parallel to the eastern, for the sea-coast

from the Crisæan Gulf to Actium<note anchored="yes">La Punta.</note> is not parallel to the coast

opposite Eubœa, and extending to Thessalonica. It is on

these shores the above-mentioned nations terminate. For the

figure of these countries is to be understood from the notion of

lines drawn parallel to the base of a triangle, where the separate parts lie parallel to one another, and have their sides in

latitude parallel, but not their sides in longitude. This is a

rough sketch of the country which remains to be examined.

We shall examine each separate part in order, beginning with

Phocis.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The two most celebrated cities of this country are Delphi and Elateia. Delphi is renowned for the temple of the

Pythian Apollo, and the antiquity of its oracle; since Agamemnon is said by the poet to have consulted it; for the minstrel is introduced singing of the



<quote><q direct="unspecified">fierce contest of Ulysses, and Achilles, the son of Peleus, how once they

contended together, and Agamemnon king of men was pleased, for so

Phœbus Apollo had foretold by the oracle in the illustrious Pytho.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. viii. 75.</note></quote>



Delphi then was celebrated on this account. Elateia was

famous as being the largest of the cities in that quarter, and

for its very convenient position upon the straits; for he, who

is the master of this city, commands the entrances into Phocis

and Bœotia. First, there are the Œtæan mountains, next the

mountains of the Locri, and the Phocians; they are not every

where passable for invading armies, coming from Thessaly,

but having narrow passes distinct from each other, which the

adjacent cities guard. Those, who take the cities, are masters



<pb n="116"/>



of the passes also. But since from its celebrity the temple at

Delphi possesses a pre-eminence, this, together with the position of the places, (for they are the most westerly parts of

Phocis,) suggest a natural commencement of our description,

and we shall begin from thence.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We have remarked, that Parnassus itself is situated on

the western boundaries of Phocis. The western side of this

mountain is occupied by the Locri Ozolæ; on the southern is

Delphi, a rocky spot, resembling in shape a theatre; on its

summit is the oracle, and also the city, which comprehends a

circle of 16 stadia. Above it lies Lycoreia; here the Delphians were formerly settled above the temple. At present

they live close to it around the Castalian fountain. In front

of the city, on the southern part, is Cirphis, a precipitous hill,

leaving in the intermediate space a wooded ravine, through

which the river Pleistus flows. Below Cirphis near the sea

is Cirrha, an ancient city, from which there is an ascent to

Delphi of about 80 stadia. It is situated opposite to Sicyon.

Adjoining to Cirrha is the fertile Crisæan plain. Again,

next in order follows another city Crisa, from which the

Crissæan Gulf has its name; then Anticyra,<note anchored="yes">Aspra Spitia.</note> of the same name

as the city, on the Maliac Gulf, and near Æta. The best

hellebore is said to grow in the Maliac Anticyra,<note anchored="yes">At the mouth of the Spercheius.</note> but here

it is prepared in a better manner; on this account many

persons resort hither for the purpose of experiencing its

purgative qualities, and of being cured of their maladies. In

the Phocian territory there is found a medicinal plant, resembling Sesamum, (Sesamoides,) with which the Œtæan hellebore is prepared.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Anticyra still remains, but Cirrha and Crisa<note anchored="yes">The ruins are near Chryso.</note> are in

ruins; Cirrha was destroyed by the Criseeans; and Crisa,

afterwards, by Eurylochus the Thessalian, in the Crisæan

war; for the Crisæi enriched themselves by duties levied on

merchandise brought from Sicily and Italy, and laid grievous

imposts on those who resorted to the temple, contrary to the

decrees of the Amphictyons. The same was the case with the

Amphissenses, who belong to the Locri Ozolæ. This people

made an irruption into the country, and took possession of

Crisa, and restored it. The plain, which had been consecrated



<pb n="117"/>



by the Amphictyons, was diligently cultivated, but strangers

were more harshly treated than by the Crisæans before them.

The Amphictyons punished them and restored the territory to

the god. The temple at Delphi is now much neglected, although

formerly it was held in the greatest veneration. Proofs of the

respect which was paid to it are, the treasuries constructed at

the expense of communities and princes, where was deposited

the wealth dedicated to sacred uses, the works of the most

eminent artists, the Pythian games, and a multitude of celebrated oracles.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The place where the oracle is delivered, is said to be a

deep hollow cavern, the entrance to which is not very wide.

From it rises up an exhalation which inspires a divine frenzy:

over the mouth is placed a lofty tripod on which the Pythian

priestess ascends to receive the exhalation, after which she

gives the prophetic response in verse or prose. The prose is

adapted to measure by poets who are in the service of the

temple. Phemonoë is said to have been the first Pythian prophetess, and both the prophetess and the city obtained their

appellation from the word Pythesthai, to inquire, (<foreign lang="greek">puqe/sqai</foreign>).

The first syllable was lengthened, as in the words <foreign lang="greek">a)qa/natos</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">a)ka/matos dia/konos.</foreign>
</p><p><note anchored="yes">Apparently an interpolation. <emph rend="ital">Groskurd.</emph></note>[The establishment of cities, and the honour paid to common temples, are due to the same feelings and causes. Men were

collected together into cities and nations, from a natural disposition to society, and for the purpose of mutual assistance.

Hence common temples were resorted to, festivals celebrated,

and meetings held of the general body of the people. For

friendship commences from and is promoted by attending the

same feasts, uniting in the same worship, and dwelling under

the same roof. The advantages derived from these meetings

were naturally estimated from the number of persons who attended them, as also from the number of places from whence

they came.]

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Although the highest honour was paid to this temple on

account of the oracle, (for it was the most exempt of any from

deception,) yet its reputation was owing in part to its situation

in the centre of all Greece, both within and without the isthmus. It was also supposed to be the centre of the habitable



<pb n="118"/>



earth, and was called the Navel of the earth. A fable, referred to by Pindar, was invented, according to which two

eagles, (or, as others say, two crows,) set free by Jupiter, one

from the east, the other from the west, alighted together at

Delphi. In the temple is seen a sort of navel wrapped in

bands, and surmounted by figures representing the birds of

the fable.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As the situation of Delphi is convenient, persons easily

assembled there, particularly those from the neighbourhood, of

whom the Amphictyonic body is composed. It is the business

of this body to deliberate on public affairs, and to it is more

particularly intrusted the guardianship of the temple for the

common good; for large sums of money were deposited there,

and votive offerings, which required great vigilance and

religious care. The early history of this body is unknown,

but among the names which are recorded, Acrisius appears to

have been the first who regulated its constitution, to have

determined what cities were to have votes in the council, and

to have assigned the number of votes and mode of voting. To

some cities he gave a single vote each, or a vote to two cities,

or to several cities conjointly. He also defined the class of

questions which might arise between the different cities,

which were to be submitted to the decision of the Amphictyonic tribunal; and subsequently many other regulations were

made, but this body, like that of the Achæans, was finally

dissolved.
</p><p>At first twelve cities are said to have assembled, each of

which sent a Pylagoras. The convention was held twice a

year, in spring and autumn. But latterly a greater number

of cities assembled. They called both the vernal and the

autumnal convention Pylæan, because it was held at Pyle,

which has the name also of Thermopylæ. The Pylagoræ

sacrificed to Ceres.
</p><p>In the beginning, the persons in the neighbourhood only assembled, or consulted the oracle, but afterwards people repaired thither from a distance for this purpose, sent gifts, and

constructed treasuries, as Crœsus, and his father Alyattes,

some of the Italians also, and the Siceli (Sicilians).

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But the wealth, being an object of cupidity, was guarded

with difficulty, although dedicated to sacred uses. At present, however, whatever it might have been, the temple at



<pb n="119"/>



Delphi is exceedingly poor. Some of the offerings have

been taken away for the sake of the money, but the greater

part remain there. It is true that the temple was once very

opulent, as Homer testifies;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Nor all the wealth, which the marble threshold of Phœbus Apollo, the

Archer, (Aphetor,)<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)fh/two|.</foreign></note> contains in the rocky Pytho.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ix. 404.</note></quote>



The treasuries indicate its riches, and the plunder committed

by the Phocians, which gave rise to the Phocic or Sacred

war, as it was called. It is however supposed that a spoliation of the temple must have taken place at some more remote period, when the wealth mentioned by Homer disappeared; for no vestige of it whatever was preserved to later

times, when Onomarchus and Phayllus pillaged the temple, as

the property [then] removed was of a more recent date than

that referred to by the poet. For there were once deposited

in the treasuries, offerings from spoils, bearing inscriptions

with the names of the donors, as of Gyges, of Crœsus, of the

Sybaritæ, of the Spinetæ on the Adriatic, and of others also.

It would be unbecoming to suppose<note anchored="yes">A conjecture by Kramer.</note> that modern and ancient

treasures were confounded together: other places pillaged by

these people confirm this view.
</p><p>Some persons, however, understanding the word Aphetor

to signify treasure, and the threshold of the aphetor the repository of the treasure under-ground, say, that this wealth was

buried beneath the temple, and that Onomarchus and his

companions attempted to dig it up by night; violent shocks

of an earthquake caused them to fly out of the temple, and

desist from their excavation; thus others were impressed

with a dread of making similar attempts.

<pb n="120"/>



to the injunction of an oracle. Neoptolemus was killed by

Machæreus, a Delphian, when, as the fable goes, he was seeking redress from the god for the murder of his father, but,

probably, he was preparing to pillage the temple. Branchus,

who presided over the temple at Didyma, is said to have been

a descendant of Machæreus.

<p>There was anciently a contest held at Delphi, of players

on the cithara, who executed a pæan in honour of the god. It

was instituted by Delphians. But after the Crisæan war the

Amphictyons, in the time of Eurylochus, established contests

for horses, and gymnastic sports, in which the victor was

crowned. These were called Pythian games. The players<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Kiqao|w|doi\</foreign> played on the cithara, accompanying it with words.</note>

on the cithara were accompanied by players on the flute, and

by citharists,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Kiqao|stai\</foreign> played on the cithara alone.</note> who performed without singing. They performed a strain (Melos),<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">me/los.</foreign></note> called the Pythian mood (Nomos).<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">no/mos.</foreign></note>

It consisted of five parts; the anacrusis, the ampeira, cataceleusmus, iambics and dactyls, and pipes.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">su/rigc</foreign></note> Timosthenes, the commander of the fleet of the Second Ptolemy, and who was the

author of a work in ten books on Harbours, composed a melos.

His object was to celebrate in this melos the contest of Apollo

with the serpent Python. The anacrusis was intended to express the prelude; the ampeira, the first onset of the contest;

the cataceleusmus, the contest itself; the iambics and dactyls

denoted the triumphal strain on obtaining the victory, together

with musical measures, of which the dactyl is peculiarly appropriated to praise, and the use of the iambic to insult and

reproach; the syringes or pipes described the death, the

players imitating the hissings of the expiring monster.<note anchored="yes">Groskurd and Meineke propose emendations of the text of this

<p>Ephorus, whom we generally follow, on account of his

exactness in these matters, (as Polybius, a writer of repute,

testifies,) seems to proceed contrary to his proposed plan, and

to the promise which he made at the beginning of his work.

For after having censured those writers who are fond of intermixing fable with history, and after having spoken in

praise of truth, he introduces, with reference to this oracle, a

grave declaration, that he considers truth preferable at all

times, but especially in treating subjects of this kind. For it

is absurd, he says, if, in other things, we constantly follow this

practice, but that when we come to speak of the oracle, which

of all others is the most exempt from deception, we should

introduce tales so incredible and false. Yet immediately

afterwards he says, that it is the received opinion that

Apollo, by the aid of Themis, established this oracle with

a view to benefit the human race. He then explains these

benefits, by saying, that men were invited to pursue a more

civilized mode of life, and were taught maxims of wisdom by

oracles; by injunctions to perform or to abstain, or by positive refusal to attend to the prayers of petitioners. Some,

he says, suppose, that the god himself in a bodily form directs these things; others, that he communicates an intimation of his will to men [by words].

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>And lower down, when speaking of the Delphians and

their origin, he says, that certain persons, called Parnassii,

an indigenous tribe, anciently inhabited Parnassus, about

which time Apollo, traversing the country, reclaimed men

from their savage state, by inducing them to adopt a more

civilized mode of life and subsistence; that, setting out from

Athens on his way to Delphi, he took the same road along

which the Athenians at present conduct the procession of the

Pythias; that when he arrived at the Panopeis, he put to

death Tityus, who was master of the district, a violent and

lawless man; that the Parnassii having joined him informed

him of Python, another desperate man, surnamed the Dragon.

Whilst he was despatching this man with his arrows, they

shouted, Hie Paian;<note anchored="yes">Probably, says <emph rend="ital">Palmer,</emph> the expression is derived from <foreign lang="greek">i(/e pai/e,</foreign> O

strike, or <foreign lang="greek">i(/e pai=,</foreign> O youth.</note> whence has been transmitted the custom

of singing the Pæan before the onset of a battle; that after the

death of the Python the Delphians burnt even his tent, as they

still continue to burn a tent in memorial of these events. Now

what can be more fabulous than Apollo discharging his arrows,

chastising Tityi and Pythons, his journey from Athens to

Delphi, and his travels over the whole country? If he did

not consider these as fables, why did he call the fabulous

Themis a woman, and the fabulous dragon a man, unless he

intended to confound the provinces of history and fable.

His account of the Ætolians is similar to this. After having



<pb n="122"/>



asserted that their country was never ravaged at any period,



he says, that at one time it was inhabited by Ætolians, who

had expelled the Barbarians; that at another time, Ætolus,

together with the Epeii from Elis, inhabited it; [that Ætolus

was overthrown by the Epeii,] and these again by Alcmæon

and Diomedes.

Panopeis, and Daulieis. It is situated at the entrance from

Bœotia to the Phocians, upon an eminence of moderate

height, between Parnassus and the mountain [Hadylium,

which runs the Cephissus, affording on each side a narrow

<p>LOCRIS, which we are now to describe, follows next in

</p><p>It is divided into two parts, one of which is occupied by the

Locri opposite Eubœa, and, as we have already said, formerly consisted of two bodies, situated one on each side of

Daphnus. The Locri Opuntii had their surname from Opus,<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Opus are indicated as existing between Talanti and

The rest are the Locri Hesperii, who are called also Locri

Ozolæ. These are separated from the Locri Opuntii and

Epicnemidii by Parnassus, which lies between them, and by

the Tetrapolis of the Dorians. We shall first speak of the

Opuntii.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Immediately after Halæ, where the Bœotian coast opposite Eubœa terminates, is the Opuntian bay. Opus is the

Deucalion is said to have lived at Cynus. There also is

shown the tomb of Pyrrha; but that of Deucalion is at

Athens. Cynus is distant from Mount Cnemis about 50

stadia. The island Atalanta<note anchored="yes">Diodorus Siculus asserts that &lt;*&gt; separated from the continent by an earthquake; but statements of this kind were commonly and hastily

some Opuntii are to be found in the Eleian territory, whom

it is not worth while to notice, except that they pretend to

trace some affinity subsisting between themselves and the

Locri Opuntii. Homer<note anchored="yes">Il. xxiii. 85.</note> says that Patroclus was from Opus,

and that having committed murder undesignedly, he fled to

Peleus, but that the father Menœtius remained in his native

country; for it is to Opus that Achilles promised Menœtius

that he would bring back Patroclus on his return from the

Trojan expedition.<note anchored="yes">Il. xviii. 326.</note> Not that Menœtius was king of the

Opuntii, but Ajax the Locrian, who, according to report, was

born at Narycus. The name of the person killed by Patroclus was Æanes; a grove, called after him Æaneium, and a

fountain, Æanis, are shown.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next after Cynus is Alopē<note anchored="yes">The ruins have been discovered by Gell on an insulated hill, near the

we have said, is in ruins. At Alopē is a harbour, distant

from Cynus about 90 stadia, and 120 from Elateia, in the

interior of the country. But these belong to the Maliac,

which is continuous with the Opuntian Gulf.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to Daphnus, at the distance of about 20 stadia by

sea, is Cnemides, a strong place, opposite to which in Eubœa

is Cenæum, a promontory, looking towards the west and the

Maliac Gulf, and separated by a strait of nearly 20 stadia.
</p><p>At Cnemides we are in the territory of the Locri Epicnemidii. Here are the Lichades, as they are called, three islands,

having their name from Lichas; they lie in front of Cnemides.

Other islands also are met with in sailing along this coast,

which we purposely pass over.

<p>It is not worth while to speak of any of the other cities.

Of those mentioned by Homer, Calliarus is no longer inhabited, it is now a well-cultivated plain. Bessa, a sort of plain,

<p>Tarphe is situated upon a height, at the distance of 20

stadia from [Thronium]. It has a territory, productive and

well wooded; for this place also has its name from its being

Pharygæa is there, called so from the Argive Juno at Pharygæ;

and the inhabitants assert that they are of Argive origin.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Homer does not mention, at least not in express words

the Locri Hesperii, but only seems to distinguish them from

the people of whom we have spoken;

Ætolians, by a decree of Philip.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There also is Chalcis, mentioned by the poet<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 640.</note> in the

Ætolian Catalogue. It is below Calydon. There also is the

hill Taphiassus, on which is the monument of Nessus, and of

the other Centaurs. From the putrefaction of the bodies of

these people there flows, it is said, from beneath the foot of

that hill a stream of water, which exhales a fœtid odour, and

contains clots of blood. Hence also the nation had the name

of Ozolæ.<note anchored="yes">From <foreign lang="greek">o)zei=n,</foreign> to smell.</note>

Opposite Antirrhium is Molycreia,<note anchored="yes">Maurolimne.</note> a small Ætolian city.
</p><p>Amphissa is situated at the extremity of the Crissæan plain.

It was razed, as we have said before, by the Amphictyons.

Œanthia and Eupalium belong to the Locri. The whole voyage along the coast of the Locri is a little more than 200 stadia.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is an Alopē<note anchored="yes">The site is unknown.</note> both here among the Locri Ozole, as

also among the Epicnemidii, and in the Phthiotis. These are

a colony of the Epicnemidii, and the Epizephyrii a colony of

the Ozolæ.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ætolians are continuous with the Locri Hesperii, and

the Ænianes, who occupy Œta with the Epicnemidii, and between them Dorians. These last are the people who inhabited the Tetrapolis, which is called the capital of all the

Dorians. They possessed the cities Erineus, Bœum, Pindus,

Cytinium. Pindus is situated above Erineus. A river of the

same name flows beside it, and empties itself into the Cephissus, not far from Lilæa. Some writers call Pindus, Acyphas.
</p><p>Ægimius, king of these Dorians, when an exile from his

kingdom, was restored, as they relate, by Hercules. He requited this favour after the death of Hercules at Œta by

adopting Hyllus, the eldest of the sons of Hercules, and both he

and his descendants succeeded him in the kingdom. It was

from this place that the Heracleidæ set out on their return to

Peloponnesus.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These cities were for some time of importance, although

they were small, and their territory not fruitful. They were

afterwards neglected. After what they suffered in the Phocian war and under the dominion of the Macedonians, Ætolians, and Athamanes, it is surprising that even a vestige of

them should have remained to the time of the Romans.
</p><p>It was the same with the Ænianes, who were exterminated

by Ætolians and Athamanes. The Ætolians were a very

powerful people, and carried on war together with the Acarnanians. The Athamanes were the last of the Epeirotæ, who

attained distinction when the rest were declining, and acquired

power by the assistance of their king Amynander. The

Ænianes, however, kept possession of Œta.

12. This mountain extends from Thermopylæ and the east, to

the Ambracian Gulf and the west; it may be said to cut at right

angles the mountainous tract, extending from Parnassus as far

as Pindus, and to the Barbarians who live beyond. The portion of this mountain verging towards Thermopylæ<note anchored="yes">Near Dervend-Elapha.</note> is called

Œta; it is 200 stadia in length, rocky and elevated, but the

highest part is at Thermopylæ, for there it forms a peak, and

terminates with acute and abrupt rocks, continued to the sea.

It leaves a narrow passage for those who are going from

Thessaly to Locris.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This passage is called Pylæ, or gates, straits, and Thermopylæ, because near the straits are hot springs, which are

held in honour as sacred to Hercules. The mountain above

is called Callidromus; but some writers call by the name of

Callidromus the remaining part of the range extending

through Ætolia and Acarnania to the Ambracian Gulf.
</p><p>At Thermopylæ within the straits are strongholds, as

Nicæa, on the sea of the Locri, Teichius and Heracleia above

it, formerly called Trachin, founded by the Lacedæmonians.

Heracleia is distant from the ancient Trachin about 6 stadia.

Next follows Rhoduntia, strong by its position.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These places are rendered difficult of access by a rocky

country, and by bodies of water, forming ravines through

which they pass. For besides the Spercheius,<note anchored="yes">The Hellada.</note> which flows

past Anticyra, there is the Dyras, which, it is said, endeavoured to extinguish the funeral pile of Hercules, and another

river, the Melas, distant about 5 stadia from Trachin. Herodotus says,<note anchored="yes">B. vii. c. 198, and c. 200.</note> that to the south of Trachin there is a deep

fissure, through which the Asopus, (which has the same name

as other rivers that we have mentioned,) empties itself into

the sea without the Pylæ, having received the river Phoenix

which flows from the south, and unites with it. The latter

river bears the name of the hero, whose tomb is shown near it.

From the Asopus (Phoenix?) to Thermopylæ are 15 stadia.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These places were of the greatest celebrity when they

formed the keys of the straits. There were frequent contests

for the ascendency between the inhabitants without and those

within the straits. Philip used to call Chalcis and Corinth

the fetters of Greece with reference to the opportunity which

they afforded for invasions from Macedonia; and persons in

later times called both these places and Demetrias <q direct="unspecified">the

<p>It was at these straits that Leonidas and his companions, together with a small body of persons from the

neighbourhood, resisted the numerous forces of the Persians,

until the Barbarians, making a circuit of the mountains along

narrow paths, surrounded and cut them to pieces. Their place

of burial, the Polyandrium, is still to be seen there, and the

celebrated inscription sculptured on the Lacedæmonian pillar;

<q direct="unspecified">Stranger, go tell Lacedæmon that we lie here in obedience

to her laws.</q>

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is also a large harbour here and a temple of

Ceres, in which the Amphictyons at the time of every Pylæan

assembly offered sacrifice. From the harbour to the Heracleian Trachin are 40 stadia by land, but by sea to Cenæum<note anchored="yes">C. Lithada.</note>

it is 70 stadia. The Spercheius empties itself immediately

without the Pylæ. To Pylæ from the Euripus are 530 stadia.

And here Locris terminates. The parts without the Pylæ towards the east, and the Maliac Gulf, belong to the Thessalians; those towards the west, to the Ætolians and Acarnanians. The Athamanes are extinct.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Thessalians form the largest and most ancient

community. One part of them has been mentioned by Homer,

and the rest by many other writers. Homer constantly mentions the Ætolians under one name; he places cities, and not

nations dependent upon them, if we except the Curetes, whom

we must place in the division of Ætolians.
</p><p>We must begin our account with the Thessalians, omitting

very ancient and fabulous stories, and what is not generally

<p>THE sea-coast, extending from Thermopylæ to the

mouths of the Peneius,<note anchored="yes">The Salambria.</note> and the extremities of Pelion, looking

towards the east, and the northern extremities of Eubœa, is

that of Thessaly. The parts opposite Eubœa and Thermopylæ are occupied by Malienses, and by Achæan Phthiotæ;

those towards Pelion by the Magnetes. This may be called

the eastern and maritime side of Thessaly. From either side

from Pelion, and the Peneius, towards the inland parts are

Macedonians, who extend as far as Pæonia, (Pindus?) and the

Epeirotic nations. From Thermopylæ, the Ætæan and Ætolian mountains, which approach close to the Dorians, and

Parnassus, are parallel to the Macedonians. The side towards

the Macedonians may be called the northern side; the other,

the southern. There remains the western side, enclosed by

Ætolians and Acarnanians, by Amphilochians and Athamanes,

who are Epirotæ; by the territory of the Molotti, formerly

said to be that of the Æthices, and, in short, by the country

about Pindus. Thessaly,<note anchored="yes">This paragraph is translated as proposed by Meineke, who has fol-

<p>These are the middle parts of Thessaly, a district of very

fertile country, except that part of it which is overflowed by

rivers. The Peneius flows through the middle of the country,

and receiving many rivers, frequently overflows. Formerly,

according to report, the plain was a lake; it is enclosed on all

sides inland by mountains, and the sea-coast is more elevated

than the plains. When a chasm was formed, at the place now

called Tempe, by shocks of an earthquake, and Ossa was riven

from Olympus, the Peneius flowed out through it to the sea,

and drained this tract of country. Still there remained the

large lake Nessonis, and the lake Bœbeis; which is of less

extent than the Nessonis, and nearer to the sea-coast.

3. Such then is Thessaly, which is divided into four parts,

Phthiotis, Hestiæotis, Thessaliotis, and Pelasgiotis.
</p><p>Phthiotis comprises the southern parts, extending along

Œta from the Maliac and (or) Pylaïc Gulf<note anchored="yes">G. of Zeitun.</note> as far as Dolopia

and Pindus, increasing in breadth to Pharsalia and the Thessalian plains.
</p><p>Hestiæotis comprises the western parts and those between

Pindus and Upper Macedonia; the rest is occupied by the

inhabitants of the plains below Hestiæotis, who are called

Pelasgiotæ, and approach close to the Lower Macedonians; by

the [Thessalians] also, who possess the country next in

order, as far as the coast of Magnesia.
</p><p>The names of many cities might here be enumerated,

which are celebrated on other accounts, but particularly as

being mentioned by Homer; few of them, however, but most

of all Larisa, preserve their ancient importance.

taken in addition some portion of the Œtæan and Locrian territory, and of that also which is now assigned to the Macedonians, shows (what commonly happened to every country) the

changes which, entirely or in part, they undergo according to

the power possessed by their respective governors.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The poet first enumerates the Thessalians subject to

Achilles, who occupied the southern side, and adjoined Œta,

and the Locri Epicnemidii;

Trachin; they who possessed Phthia, and Hellas, abounding with beautiful women, were called Myrmidones, Hellenes, and Achæi.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 681.</note></quote>



He joins together with these the people under the command of

Phoenix, and makes them compose one common expedition.

The poet nowhere mentions the Dolopian forces in the battles

near Ilium, neither does he introduce their leader Phoenix, as

undertaking, like Nestor, dangerous enterprises. But Phoenix

is mentioned by others, as by Pindar,

for it would be ridiculous for the king to engage in the expe-

and his subjects not to accompany him. For [thus] he would

not appear to be a comrade of Achilles in the expedition, but

only as the commander of a small body of men, and a speaker,

and if so, a counsellor. The verses seem to imply this meaning, for they are to this effect,

subjects of controversy.
</p><p>Some have understood Pelasgic Argos to be a Thessalian

city, formerly situated near Larisa, but now no longer in existence. Others do not understand a city to be meant by this

name, but the Thessalian plain, and to have been so called by

Abas, who established a colony there from Argos.

The poet then makes these places to be two, but whether

cities or countries he does not expressly say. Some of the

later writers, who affirm that it is a country, suppose it to

have extended from Palæpharsalus to Thebæ Phthiotides.

In this country also is Thetidium, near both the ancient and

the modern Pharsalus; and it is conjectured from Theti-

dium that the country, in which it is situated, was a part of

that under the command of Achilles. Others, who regard it

as a city, allege that the Pharsalii show at the distance of 60

stadia from their own city, a city in ruins, which they believe

to be Hellas, and two springs near it, Messeis and Hypereia.

But the Melitæenses say, that at the distance of about 10

stadia from their city, was situated Hellas on the other side

of the Enipeus,<note anchored="yes">The Vlacho.</note> when their own city had the name of Pyrrha,

and that the Hellenes migrated from Hellas, which was built

in a low situation, to theirs. They adduce in proof of this

the tomb of Hellen, son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, which is in

their market-place. For according to historians, Deucalion

was king of Phthiotis and of all Thessaly. The Enipeus flows

from Othrys<note anchored="yes">Part of the range of Mount Gura.</note> beside Pharsalus,<note anchored="yes">Satalda. The plain of Pharsalia is to the north.</note> and empties itself into the

Apidanus,<note anchored="yes">The Gura.</note> and the latter into the Peneius.
</p><p>Thus much, then, respecting the Hellenes.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The people under the command of Achilles, Protesilaus,

and Philoctetes, are called Phthii. The poet furnishes evidence of this. Having recited in the Catalogue of those

under the command of Achilles,

<l>the people of Phthia,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. ii. 683.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. ii. 683.</bibl></cit>



he represents them at the battle at the ships, as remaining in

the ships with Achilles, and inactive; but those under the

command of Philoctetes, as fighting with Medon [as their

leader], and those under the command of Protesilaus, with

Podarces [as their chief]. Of these the poet speaks in

general terms;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">there were Bœoti and Iaones wearing long robes, Locri, Phthii, and

illustrious Epeii.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xiii. 685.</note></quote>



But here he particularizes them;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">at the head of the Phthii fought Medon and Podarces, firm in battle.

These armed with breastplates fought together with Bœoti, at the head of

the magnanimous Phthii, keeping away the enemy from the ships.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xiii. 693, 699.</note></quote>


</p><p>Perhaps the people with Eurypylus were called Phthii, as

they bordered upon the country of the latter. At present,

however, historians assign to Magnesia the country about

Ormenium, which was subject to Eurypylus, and the whole of

that subject to Philoctetes; but they regard the country un-

der the command of Protesilaus as belonging to Phthia, from

Dolopia and Pindus to the sea of Magnesia; but as far as the

city Antron, (now written in the plural number,) which was

subject to Protesilaus, beginning from Trachinia and Œta, is

the width of the territory belonging to Peleus and Achilles.

But this is nearly the whole length of the Maliac Gulf.

<p>They entertain doubts respecting Halus and Alope,

whether Homer means the places which are now comprised

in the Phthiotic government, or those among the Locri, since

the dominion of Achilles extended hither as well as to Trachin and the Œtæan territory. For Halus and Halius, as

well as Alope, are on the coast of the Locri. But some substitute Halius for Alope, and write the verse in this manner;

But the Phthiotic Halus lies under the extremity of the mountain Othrys, which lies to the north of Phthiotis, and borders

upon the mountain Typhrestus and the Dolopians, and

thence stretches along to the country near the Maliæ Gulf.

Halus,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o( Alos,</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">h( (/Alos.</foreign></note> either masculine or feminine, for it is used in both

genders, is distant from Itonus<note anchored="yes">Armyrus.</note> about 60 stadia. Athamas

founded Halus; it was destroyed, but subsequently [restored by

the Pharsalii]. It is situated above the Crocian plain, and the

river Amphrysus<note anchored="yes">Hence Virgil, Geor. 3, calls Apollo, Pastor ab Amphryso.</note> flows by its walls. Below the Crocian plain

lies Thebæ Phthiotides; Halus likewise, which is in Achaia,

is called Phthiotis; this, as well as the foot of Mount Othrys,

approaches close to the Malienses. As Phylace too, which was

under the command of Protesilaus, so Halus also belongs to

Phthiotis, which adjoins to the Malienses. Halus is distant from

Thebes about 100 stadia, and lies in the middle between Pharsalus and Thebæ Phthiotides. Philip, however, took it from

the latter, and assigned it to the Pharsalii. Thus it happens,

as we have said before, that boundaries and the distribution of

nations and places are in a state of continual change. Thus

Sophocles also called Phthiotis, Trachinia, Artemidorus places

Halus on the coast beyond the Maliac Gulf, but as belonging

to Phthiotis. For proceeding thence in the direction of the

Peneius, he places Pteleum after Antron, then Halus at the

distance of 110 stadia from Pteleum.



<pb n="136"/>



I have already spoken of Trachin, and described the nature

of the place. The poet mentions it by name.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As Homer frequently mentions the Spercheius as a river

of the country, having its source in the Typhrestus, a Dryopian mountain, formerly called [Tymphrestus], and emptying itself near Thermopylæ, between Trachin and Lamia,<note anchored="yes">Isdin or Zeitun.</note> he

might imply that whatever parts of the Maliac Gulf were

either within or without the Pylæ, were subject to Achilles.
</p><p>The Spercheius is distant about 30 stadia from Lamia,

which lies above a plain, extending to the Maliac Gulf. That

the Spercheius is a river of the country [subject to Achilles], appears from the words of Achilles, who says, that he

had devoted his hair to the Spercheius; and from the circumstance, that Menesthius, one of his commanders, was said

to be the son of Spercheius and the sister of Achilles.
</p><p>It is probable that all the people under the command of

Achilles and Patroclus, and who had accompanied Peleus in

his banishment from Ægina, had the name of Myrmidons,

but all the Phthiotæ were called Achæcans.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They reckon in the Phthiotic district, which was subject to Achilles, beginning from the Malienses, a considerable

number of towns, and among them Thebæ Phthiotides, Echinus, Lamia, near which the war was carried on between the

Macedonians and Antipater, against the Athenians. In this

war Leosthenes, the Athenian general, was killed, [and Leonnatus,] one of the companions of Alexander the king. Besides the above-mentioned towns, we must add [Narthac]ium,

Erineus, Coroneia, of the same name as the town in Bœotia,

Melitæa, Thaumaci, Proerna, Pharsalus, Eretria, of the same

name as the Euboic town, Paracheloïtæ, of the same name

as those in Ætolia; for here also, near Lamia, is a river Achelous, on the banks of which live the Paracheloïtæ.
</p><p>This district, lying to the north, extended to the northwestern territory of the Asclepiadæ, and to the territory of

Eurypylus and Protesilaus, inclining to the east; on the south

it adjoined the Œtæan territory, which was divided into fourteen demi, and contained Heracleia and Dryopis, which was

once a community of four cities, (a Tetrapolis,) like Doris,

and accounted the capital of the Dryopes in Peloponnesus.

To the Œtæan district belong also the Acyphas, Parasopias,



<pb n="137"/>



$Oeneiadæ, and Anticyra, of the same name as the town among

the Locri Hesperii. I do not mean that these divisions always continued the same, for they underwent various changes.

The most remarkable, however, are worthy of notice.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The poet with sufficient clearness describes the situation

of the Dolopes, as at the extremity of Phthia, and says that

both they and the Phthiotæ were under the command of the

same chief, Peleus;

Peleus, however, had conferred on him the authority.
</p><p>This region is close to Pindus, and the places about it, most

of which belong to the Thessalians. For in consequence of

the renown and ascendency of the Thessalians and Macedonians, those Epeirotæ, who bordered nearest upon them, became, some voluntarily, others by force, incorporated among

the Macedonians and Thessalians. In this manner the Athamanes, Æthices, and Talares were joined to the Thessalians,

and the Orestæ, Pelagones, and Elimiotæ to the Macedonians.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Pindus is a large mountain, having on the north Macedonia, on the west Perrhæbi, settlers from another country,

on the south Dolopes, [and on the east Hestiæotis] which

belongs to Thessaly. Close upon Pindus dwelt Talares,

a tribe of Molotti, detached from the Molotti about Mount

Tomarus, and Æthices, among whom the poet says the Centaurs took refuge when expelled by Peirithous.<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 744.</note> They

are at present, it is said, extinct. But this extinction is to

be understood in two senses; either the inhabitants have

been exterminated, and the country deserted, or the name of

the nation exists no longer, or the community does not preserve its ancient form. Whenever the community, which

continues, is insignificant, we do not think it worth while to

record either its existence or its change of name. But when

it has any just pretensions to notice, it is necessary to remark

the change which it has undergone.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It remains for us to describe the tract of sea-coast subject to Achilles: we begin from Thermopylæ, for we have

spoken of the coast of Locris, and of the interior.
</p><p>Thermopylæ is separated from the Cenæum by a strait 70

stadia across. Coasting beyond the Pylæ, it is at a distance

from the Spercheius of about 10, (60?) and thence to Phalara

of 20 stadia. Above Phalara, 50 stadia from the sea, lies the

city of the [Lamians]. Then coasting along the shore 100

stadia, we find above it, Echinus. At the distance of 20 stadia

from the following tract of coast, in the interior, is Larisa

Cremaste, which has the name also of Larisa Pelasgia.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Then follows a small island, Myonnesus; next Antron; which was subject to Protesilaus. Thus much concerning the territory subject to Achilles.
</p><p>As the poet, in naming the chiefs, and cities under their

rule, has divided the country into numerous well-known parts,

and has given an accurate account of the whole circuit of

Thessaly, we shall follow him, as before, in completing the

description of this region.
</p><p>Next to the people under the command of Achilles, he

enumerates those under the command of Protesilaus. They

were situated, next, along the sea-coast which was subject to

Achilles, as far as Antron. The boundary of the country

under the command of Protesilaus, is determined by its being

situated without the Maliac Gulf, yet still in Phthiotis, though

not within Phthiotis subject to Achilles.
</p><p>Phylacē<note anchored="yes">Above S. Theodoro.</note> is near Thebæ Phthiotides, which was subject to

Protesilaus, as were also Halus, Larisa Cremaste, and Demetrium, all of which lie to the east of Mount Othrys.
</p><p>The Demetrium he speaks of<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 695.</note> as an enclosure sacred to Ceres,

and calls it Pyrasus. Pyrasus was a city with a good harbour,

having at the distance of 2 stadia from it a grove, and a temple

consecrated to Ceres. It is distant from Thebæ 20 stadia.

The latter is situated above Pyrasus. Above Thebæ in the

inland parts is the Crocian plain at the extremity of the mountain Othrys. Through this plain flows the river Amphrysus.

Above it is the Itonus, where is the temple of the Itonian

Minerva, from which that in Bœotia has its name, also the

river Cuarius. [Of this river and] of Arnē we have spoken

in our account of Bœotia.
</p><p>These places are in Thessaliotis, one of the four divisions of

all Thessaly, in which were the possessions of Eurypylus.

Phyllus, where is a temple of the Phyllæan Apollo, Ichnæ,

where the Ichnæan Themis is worshipped, Cierus, and [all

the places as far as] Athamania, are included in Thessaliotis.
</p><p>At Antron, in the strait near Eubœa, is a sunk rock, called



<pb n="139"/>



<q direct="unspecified">the Ass of Antron.</q> Next are Pteleum and Halus; next

the temple of Ceres, and Pyrasus in ruins; above these, Thebæ;

then Pyrrha, a promontory, and two small islands near, one of

which is called Pyrrha, the other Deucalion. Somewhere

here ends the territory of Phthiotis.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The poet next mentions the people under Eumelus, and

the continuous tract of coast which now belongs to Magnesia,

and the Pelasgiotis.
</p><p>Pheræ is the termination of the Pelasgic plains towards

Magnesia, which plains extend as far as Pelion, a distance of

160 stadia. Pagasæ is the naval arsenal of Pheræ, from which

it is distant 90 stadia, and 20 from Iolcus. Iolcus has been

razed from ancient times. It was from this place that Pelias

despatched Jason and the ship Argo. Pagasæ had its name,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ph/gnumi,</foreign> to fasten.</note>

according to mythologists, from the building of the ship Argo

at this place. Others, with more probability, suppose that the

name of the place was derived from the springs, (<foreign lang="greek">phgai/,</foreign>) which

are very numerous and copious. Near it is Aphetæ, (so

named) as the starting-place<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)feth/rion,</foreign> a starting-place.</note> from which the Argonauts set

off. Iolcus is situated 7 stadia from Demetrias, overlooking

the sea. Demetrias was founded by Demetrius Poliorcetes,

who called it after his own name. It is situated between

Nelia and Pagasæ on the sea. He collected there the inhabitants of the neighbouring small cities, Nelia, Pagasæ, Ormenium, and besides these, Rhizus, Sepias, Olizon, Bœbe, and

Iolcus, which are at present villages belonging to Demetrias.

For a long time it was a station for vessels, and a royal seat of

the Macedonian kings. It had the command of Tempe, and

of both the mountains Pelion and Ossa. At present its extent of power is diminished, yet it still surpasses all the cities

in Magnesia.
</p><p>The lake Bœbeis<note anchored="yes">Karlas.</note> is near Pheræ,<note anchored="yes">Veler&lt;*&gt;.</note> and approaches close to

the extremities of Pelion and Magnesia. Bœbe is a small

place situated on the lake.
</p>
<p>As civil dissensions and usurpations reduced the flourishing condition of Iolcus, formerly so powerful, so they affected

Pheræ in the same manner, which was raised to prosperity,

and was destroyed by tyrants.
</p><p>Near Demetrias flows the Anaurus. The continuous line



<pb n="140"/>



of coast is called also Iolcus. Here was held the Pylaic

(Peliac?) assembly and festival.
</p><p>Artemidorus places the Gulf of Pagasæ farther from Demetrias, near the places subject to Philoctetes. In the gulf he says

is the island Cicynethus,<note anchored="yes">Trikeri.</note> and a small town of the same name.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The poet next enumerates the cities subject to Philoctetes.
</p><p>Methone is not the Thracian Methone razed by Philip.

We have already noticed the change of name these places and

others in the Peloponnesus have undergone. Other places

enumerated as subject to Philoctetes, are Thaumacia, Olizon,

and Melibœa, all along the shore next adjacent.
</p><p>In front of the Magnetes lie clusters of islands; the most

celebrated are Sciathus,<note anchored="yes">Sciathos.</note> Peparethus,<note anchored="yes">Scopelo?</note> Icus,<note anchored="yes">Selidromi?</note> Halonnesus, and

Scyrus,<note anchored="yes">Scyros.</note> which contain cities of the same name. Scyrus however is the most famous of any for the friendship which subsisted between Lycomedes and Achilles, and for the birth and

education of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. In after

times, when Philip became powerful, perceiving that the

Athenians were masters of the sea, and sovereigns both of

these and other islands, he made those islands which lay near

his own country more celebrated than any of the rest. For

as his object in waging war was the sovereignty of Greece,

he attacked those places first which were near him; and as

he attached to Macedonia many parts of Magnesia itself, of

Thrace, and of the rest of the surrounding country, so also he

seized upon the islands in front of Magnesia, and made the

possession of islands which were before entirely unknown, a

subject of warlike contention, and brought them into notice.
</p><p>Scyrus however is particularly celebrated in ancient histories. It is also highly reputed for the excellence of its

goats, and the quarries of variegated marble, such as the

Carystian, the Deucallian, (Docimæan?) the Synnadic, and

the Hierapolitic kinds. For there may be seen at Rome

columns, consisting of a single stone, and large slabs of

variegated marble, (from Scyrus,) with which the city is embellished both at the public charge and at the expense of individuals, which has caused works of white marble to be little

esteemed.

These places belong to Histiæotis, which was formerly called

Doris. When it was in the possession of the Perrhæbi, who destroyed Histiæotis in Eubœa, and had removed the inhabitants

by force to the continent, they gave the country the name of

Histiæotis, on account of the great numbers of Histiæans among

the settlers. This country and Dolopia are called Upper Thessaly, which is in a straight line with Upper Macedonia, as

should be pronounced without the first syllable, Thome, for

this was its former name. At present, it is changed to

[Thumæum]. It is a spot strong by nature, and in reality

rocky. It lies between four strong-holds, which form a square,

Tricca, Metropolis, Pelinnæum, and Gomphi.<note anchored="yes">The ruins are pointed out to the south of Stagus Kalabak.</note> Ithome belongs to the district of the Metropolitæ. Metropolis was

formed at first out of three small obscure cities, and afterwards more were included, and among these Ithome. Callimachus says in his Iambics,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">among the Venuses, (for the goddess bears several titles,) Venus Castnietis surpasses all others in wisdom,</q></quote>



for she alone accepts the sacrifice of swine. Certainly Callimachus, if any person could be said to possess information,

was well informed, and it was his object, as he himself says,

all his life to relate these fables. Later writers, however,

have proved that there was not one Venus only, but several,

who accepted that sacrifice, from among whom the goddess

worshipped at Metropolis came, and that this [foreign] rite

was delivered down by one of the cities which contributed to

form that settlement.

Pharcadon also is situated in the Hestiœotis. The Peneius

and the Curalius flow through it. The Curalius, after flowing beside the temple of the Itonian Minerva, empties itself

into the Peneius.
</p><p>The Peneius itself rises in Mount Pindus, as I have before

said. It leaves Tricca, Pelinnæum, and Pharcadon on the

After having received the rivers of the Thessaliotis it flows

onwards through Tempe, and it empties itself into the sea.

Æolus. The sons of Ormenus were Amyntor and Eumæmon;

the son of the former was Phœnix, and of the latter, Eurypylus. The succession to his possessions was preserved secure

for Eurypylus, after the departure of Phœnix from his home,

his neighbours, which is the common practice of every housebreaker, and not of persons living at a distance. But Demetrius the Scepsian says, that there is no such place on Parnassus as Eleon, but Neon, which was built after the Trojan

war, and that digging through houses was not confined to

robbers of the neighbourhood. Other things might be advanced, but I am unwilling to insist long on this subject.

</p><p>The Perrhæbi, oppressed by the Lapithæ, retreated in great

numbers to the mountainous country about Pindus, and to the

Athamanes and Dolopes; but the Larisæi became masters of

the country and of the Perrhæbi who remained there. The

Larisæi lived near the Peneius, but in the neighbourhood of

the Perrhæbi. They occupied the most fertile portion of the

plains, except some of the very deep valleys near the lake

Nessonis, into which the river, when it overflowed, usually

carried away a portion of the arable ground belonging to the

Larisæ, who afterwards remedied this by making embankments.
</p><p>These people were in possession of Perrhæbia, and levied

imposts until Philip became master of the country.
</p><p>Larisa is a place situated on Ossa, and there is Larisa

Cremaste, by some called Pelasgia. In Crete also is a city

Larisa, the inhabitants of which were embodied with those of

Hierapytna; and from this place the plain below is called the

Larisian plain. In Peloponnesus the citadel of the Argives is



<pb n="145"/>



called Larisa, and there is a river Larisus, which separates

Eleia from Dyme. Theopompus mentions a city Larisa, situated on the immediate confines of this country. In Asia is

Larisa Phriconis near Cume, and another Larisa near Hamaxitus, in the Troad. There is also an Ephesian Larisa, and a

Larisa in Syria. At 50 stadia from Mitylene are the Larisæn rocks, on the road to Methymne. There is a Larisa in

Attica; and a village of this name at the distance of 30 stadia

from Tralleis, situated above the city, on the road to the plain

of the Cayster, passing by Mesogis towards the temple of

Mater Isodroma. This Larisa has a similar position, and

possesses similar advantages to those of Larisa Cremaste; for

it has abundance of water and vineyards. Perhaps Jupiter

had the appellation of Larisæus from this place. There is

also on the left side of the Pontus (Euxine) a village called

Larisa, near the extremities of Mount Hæmus, between Naulochus [and Odessus].<note anchored="yes">Groskurd suggests the insertion here of Messembria or Odessus.

Kramer is inclined to adopt the latter.</note>
</p><p>Oloosson, called the White, from its chalky soil, Elone, and

Gonnus are Perrhæbic cities. The name of Elone was changed

to that of Leimone. It is now in ruins. Both lie at the foot

of Olympus, not very far from the river Eurotas, which the

poet calls Titaresius.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The poet speaks both of this river and of the Perrhæbi in the subsequent verses, when he says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Guneus brought from Cyphus two and twenty vessels. His followers

were Enienes and Peræbi, firm in battle. They dwelt near the wintry

Dodona, and tilled the fields about the lovely Titaresius.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 748.</note></quote>


</p><p>He mentions therefore these places as belonging to the Perrhæbi, which comprised a part of the Hestiæotis.<note anchored="yes">Or Pelasgiotis. <emph rend="ital">Groskurd.</emph></note> They were

in part Perrhæbic towns, which were subject to Polypcetes.

He assigned them however to the Lapithæ, because these

people and the Perrhæbi lived intermixed together, and the

Lapithæ occupied the plains. The country, which belonged

to the Perrhæbi, was, for the most part, subject to the Lapithæ, but the Perrhæbi possessed the more mountainous

tracts towards Olympus and Tempe, such as Cyphus, Dodonē,

and the country about the river Titaresius. This river rises



<pb n="146"/>



in the mountain Titarius, which is part of Olympus. It flows

into the plain near Tempe belonging to Perrhæbia, and somewhere there enters the Peneius.
</p><p>The water of the Peneius is clear, that of the Titaresius

is unctuous; a property arising from some matter, which

</p><p>Because the Perrhæbi and Lapithæ lived intermingled together, Simonides calls all those people Pelasgiotæ, who occupy the eastern parts about Gyrton and the mouths of the

Peneius, Ossa, Pelion, and the country about Demetrias, and

the places in the plain, Larisa, Crannon, Scotussa, Mopsium,

Atrax, and the parts near the lakes Nessonis and Bœbeis.

The poet mentions a few only of these places, either because

they were not inhabited at all, or badly inhabited on account

of the inundations which had happened at various times.

For the poet does not mention even the lake Nessonis, but the

Bœbeis only, which is much smaller, for its water remained

constant, and this alone remains, while the former probably

was at one time filled irregularly to excess, and at another

contained no water.
</p><p>We have mentioned Scotussa in our accounts of Dodona,

and of the oracle, in Thessaly, when we observed that it was

near Scotussa. Near Scotussa is a tract called Cynoscephalæ.

It was here that the Romans with their allies the Ætolians, and

their general Titus Quintius, defeated in a great battle Philip,

son of Demetrius, king of Macedon.

<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Something of the same kind has happened in the territory of Magnetis. For Homer having enumerated many

places of this country, calls none of them Magnetes, but those

only whom he indicates in terms obscure, and not easily understood;



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>They who dwelt about Peneius and Pelion with waving woods.<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. ii. 756.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. ii. 756.</bibl></cit>



Now about the Peneius and Pelion dwell those (already

mentioned by Homer) who occupied Gyrton, and Ormenium,

and many other nations. At a still greater distance from

Pelion, according to later writers, were Magnetes, begin-

ning from the people, that were subject to Eumelus. These



<pb n="147"/>



writers, on account of the continual removals from one settle

ment to another, alterations in the forms of government, and

intermixture of races, seem to confound both names and nations, which sometimes perplexes persons in these times, as is

first to be observed in the instances of Crannon and Gyrton.
</p><p>Formerly they called the Gyrtonians Phlegyæ, from

Phlegyas, the brother of Ixion; and the Crannonii, Ephyri, so

that there is a doubt, when the poet says,



<q direct="unspecified">These two from Thrace appeared with breastplates armed against

Ephyri, or haughty Phlegyæ,</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xiii. 301</note>



what people he meant.

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The same is the case with the Perrhæbi and Ænianes,

for Homer joins them together, as if they dwelt near each

other; and it is said by later writers, that, for a long period,

the settlement of the Ænianes was in the Dotian plain. Now

this plain is near Perrhæbia, which we have just mentioned,

Ossa, and the lake Bœbeis: it is situated about the middle of

Thessaly, but enclosed by itself within hills. Hesiod speaks of

it in this manner;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Or, as a pure virgin, who dwells on the sacred heights of the Twin hills,

comes to the Dotian plain, in front of Amyrus, abounding with vines, to

bathe her feet in the lake Bœbias.</q></quote>



The greater part of the Ænianes were expelled by the Lapithæ,

and took refuge in Œta, where they established their power,

having deprived the Dorians and the Malienses of some portions of country, extending as far as Heracleia and Echinus.

Some of them however remained about Cyphus, a Perrhæbic

mountain, where is a settlement of the same name. As to the

Perrhæbi, some of them collected about the western parts of

Olympus and settled there, on the borders of the Macedonians.

But a large body took shelter among the mountains near

Athamania, and Pindus. But at present few, if any, traces

of them are to be found.
</p><p>The Magnetes, who are mentioned last in the Thessalian

catalogue of the poet, must be understood to be those situated

within Tempe, extending from the Peneius and Ossa to Pelion, and bordering upon the Pieriotæ in Macedonia, who occupy the country on the other side the Peneius as far as

the sea.
</p><p>Homolium, or Homolē, (for both words are in use,) must



<pb n="148"/>



be assigned to the Magnetes. I have said in the description

of Macedonia, that Homolium is near Ossa at the beginning

of the course which the Peneius takes through Tempe.
</p><p>If we are to extend their possessions as far as the sea-coast,

which is very near Homolium, there is reason for assigning to

them Rhizus, and Erymnæ, which lies on the sea-coast in the

tract subject to Philoctetes and Eumelus. Let this however

remain unsettled. For the order in which the places as far as

the Peneius follow one another, is not clearly expressed, and

as the places are not of any note, we need not consider that

uncertainty as very important. The coast of Sepias, however,

is mentioned by tragic writers, and was chaunted in songs on

account of the destruction of the Persian fleet. It consists of

a chain of rocks.
</p><p>Between Sepias and Casthanæa, a village situated below

Pelion, is the sea-shore, where the fleet of Xerxes was lying,

when an east wind began to blow violently; some of the vessels were forced on shore, and immediately went to pieces;

others were driven on Hipnus, a rocky spot near Pelion,

others were lost at Melibœa, others at Casthanæa.
</p><p>The whole of the coasting voyage along Pelion, to the extent of about 80 stadia, is among rocks. That along Ossa is

of the same kind and to the same extent.
</p><p>Between them is a bay of more than 200 stadia in extent,

upon which is situated Melibœa.
</p><p>The whole voyage from Demetrias, including the winding

of the bays, to the Peneius is more than 1000 stadia, from the

Spercheius 800 stadia more, and from the Euripus 2350

stadia.
</p><p>Hieronymus assigns a circuit of 3000 stadia to the plain

country in Thessaly and Magnesia, and says, that it was inhabited by Pelasgi, but that these people were driven into

Italy by Lapithæ, and that the present Pelasgic plain is that

in which are situated Larisa, Gyrton, Pheræ, Mopsium, Bœbeis, Ossa, Homole, Pelion, and Magnetis. Mopsium has not

its name from Mopsus, the son of Manto the daughter of

Teiresias, but from Mopsus, one of the Lapithæ, who sailed

with the Argonauts. Mopsopus, from whom Attica is called

Mopsopia, is a different person.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This then is the account of the several parts of Thes-

saly.



<pb n="149"/>


</p><p>In general we say, that it was formerly called Pyrrhæa,

from Pyrrha, the wife of Deucalion; Hæmonia, from Hæmon;

and Thettalia, from Thettalus, the son of Hæmon. But some

writers, after dividing it into two portions, say, that Deucalion

obtained by lot the southern part, and called it Pandora, from

his mother; that the other fell to the share of Hæmon, from

whom it was called Hæmonia; that the name of one part was

changed to Hellas, from Hellen, the son of Deucalion, and of

the other to Thettalia, from Thettalus, the son of Hæmon.

But, according to some writers, it was the descendants of Antiphus and Pheidippus, sons of Thettalus, descended from

Hercules, who invaded the country from Ephyra in Thesprotia, and called it after the name of Thettalus their progenitor. It has been already said that once it had the name

of Nessonis, as well as the lake, from Nesson, the son of

Thettalus.

<p>SINCE Eubœa<note anchored="yes">In the middle ages Eubœa was called Egripo, a corruption of Euripus, the name of the town built upon the ruins of Chalcis. The Venetians, who obtained possession of the island upon the dismemberment of the

Byzantine empire by the Latins, called it Negropont, probably a corruption of <emph rend="ital">Egripo</emph> and <emph rend="ital">Ponte,</emph> a bridge. <emph rend="ital">Smith.</emph></note> stretches along the whole of this coast

from Sunium to Thessaly, except the extremity on each side,<note anchored="yes">This expression is obscure; probably it may mean that Eubœa is

not equal in length to the coast comprehended between Sunium and the

southern limits of Thessaly.</note>

it may be convenient to connect the description of this island

with that of Thessaly. We shall then pass on to Ætolia and

Acarnania, parts of Europe of which it remains to give an

account.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The island is oblong, and extends nearly <date value="1200">1200</date> stadia

from Cenæum<note anchored="yes">C. Lithada. The mountain Lithada above the cape, rises to the

across. See <emph rend="ital">Smith</emph> art. Eubœa.</note>



<pb n="151"/>



Cenæum is opposite to Thermopylæ, and in a small decree



to the parts beyond Thermopylæ: Geræstus<note anchored="yes">Cape Mantelo.</note> and Petalia<note anchored="yes">Strabo is the only ancient author who describes a place of this name

opposite to Sunium.
</p><p>Eubœa then fronts<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)nti/poo|qmos.</foreign></note> Attica, Bœotia, Locris, and the Malienses. From its narrowness, and its length, which we have

mentioned, it was called by the ancients Macris.<note anchored="yes">Eubœa has various names. Formerly (says Pliny, b. iv. c. 12) it

was called Chalcedontis or Macris, according to Dionysius and Ephorus;

Aacra, according to Aristides; Chalcis, from brass being there first discovered, according to Callidemus; Abantias, according to Menæchmus;

and Asopis by the poets in general.</note>
</p><p>It approaches nearest to the continent at Chalcis. It projects with a convex bend towards the places in Bœotia near

Aulis, and forms the Euripus,<note anchored="yes">The narrow channel between the island and the mainland.</note> of which we have before

spoken at length. We have also mentioned nearly all the

places on either side of the Euripus, opposite to each other

across the strait, both on the continent and on the island. If

anything is omitted we shall now give a further explanation.
</p><p>And first, the parts lying between Aulis (Chalcis?) and

the places about Geræstus are called the Hollows of Eubœa,

for the sea-coast swells into bays, and, as it approaches Chalcis, juts out again towards the continent.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The island had the name not of Macris only, but of

Abantis also. The poet in speaking of Eubœa never calls the

inhabitants from the name of the island, Eubœans, but always

Abantes;

Aristotle says that Thracians, taking their departure from

Aba, the Phocian city, settled with the other inhabitants in

the island, and gave the name of Abantes to those who already occupied it; other writers say that they had their name

from a hero,<note anchored="yes">From Abas, great grandson of Erectheus.</note> as that of Eubœa was derived from a heroine.<note anchored="yes">From Eubœa, daughter of the river Asopus and mistress of Neptune</note>

But perhaps as a certain cave on the sea-coast fronting the

Ægean Sea is called Boos-Aule, (or the Cow's Stall.) where

lo is said to have brought forth Epaphus, so the island may

have had the name Eubœa<note anchored="yes">From <foreign lang="greek">eu/(</foreign> well, and <foreign lang="greek">bou=s,</foreign> a cow. The ancient coins of the island

bear the head of an ox.</note> on this account.
</p><p>It was also called Oché, which is the name of one of the

largest mountains<note anchored="yes">Mount St. Elias, 4748 feet above the level of the sea. Bochart derives the name from an eastern word signifying <q direct="unspecified">narrow.</q></note> there.
</p><p>It had the name of Ellopia, from Ellops, the son of Ion;

according to others, he was the brother of Æclus, and Cothus, who is said to have founded Ellopia,<note anchored="yes">At the base of Ploko Vuno.</note> a small place

Oreitæ also, for afterwards the Histiæans had that name, and

the city, instead of Histiæa, was called Oreus. According to

some writers, Histiæa was colonized by Athenians from the

demus of the Histiæeis, as Eretria was from the demus of the

Eretrieis. But Theopompus says, that when Pericles had reduced Eubœa, the Histiæans agreed to remove into Macedonia, and that two thousand Athenians, who formerly composed the demus of the Histiæans, came, and founded Oreus.<note anchored="yes">Not the town named Histiæa-Oreus, which was on the sea-coast.</note>

perhaps because the Ellopians, the former inhabitants, were a

mountain tribe,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">dia\ to\ o)rei/ous ei/(nai.</foreign></note> the city had the name of Oreus. Orion, who

place. But according to some writers, the Oreitæ, who had a

city of their own, being attacked by the Ellopians, migrated,

and settled with the Histiæans, and although it was a single

city it had both appellations, as Lacedæmon and Sparta were

the same city. We have said, that the Histiæotis in Thessaly had its name from the people who were carried away

from this country by the Perrhæbi.

<p>Next to Geræstus is Eretria, which, after Chalcis, is the

it were of the island, situated immediately on the Euripus.

Both these cities are said to have been founded by Athenians

before the Trojan war; [but it is also said that] after the

Trojan war, Æclus and Cothus took their departure from

Athens; the former to found Eretria, and Cothus, Chalcis.

A body of Æolians who belonged to the expedition of Penthilus remained in the island. Anciently, even Arabians<note anchored="yes">As this statement is unsupported by any other authority, Meineke

</p><p>These cities, Eretria and Chalcis, when their population

was greatly augmented, sent out considerable colonies to Macedonia, for Eretria founded cities about Pallene and Mount

Athos; Chalcis founded some near Olynthus, which Philip

agreed upon certain conditions, on which the war was to be

conducted. This appears by a column standing in the Amarynthium, which interdicts the use of missiles. [For with

respect to warlike usages and armour, there neither is nor

that by the words of the poet,

But the Corinthians who were despatched by Cypselus and

Gorgus, obtained possession of this coast, and advanced as far

as the Ambracian Gulf. Ambracia and Anactorium were

both founded. They cut through the isthmus of the peninsula,

converted Leucas into an island, transferred Neritus to the

spot, which was once an isthmus, but is now a channel connected with the land by a bridge, and changed the name to

Leucas from Leucatas, as I suppose, which is a white rock,

projecting from Leucas into the sea towards Cephallenia, so

the Leucadians at the annual sacrifice performed in honour of

Apollo, to precipitate from the rock one of the condemned

criminals, with a view to avert evil. Various kinds of wings

were attached to him, and even birds were suspended from his

body, to lighten by their fluttering the fall of the leap. Below many persons were stationed around in small fishing boats

to receive, and to preserve his life, if possible, and to carry

him beyond the boundaries of the country. The author of

the Alcmæonis says that Icarius, the father of Penelope, had

two sons, Alyzeus, and Leucadius, who reigned after their

father in Acarnania, whence Ephorus thinks that the cities

were called after their names.

he makes a distinction between places of the same name by an

epithet, assigning the name not to the city, but to the island.

For the island contains four cities, one of which, called Samos,

or Same, for it had either appellation, bore the same name as

the island. But when the poet says,



<cit><quote><lg>

he is evidently enumerating the islands, and calls that Same

which he had before called Samos.
</p><p>But Apollodorus at one time says that the ambiguity is removed by the epithet, which the poet uses, when he says,



<quote><lg>

<l>and hilly Samos,</l></lg></quote>

ought to write



<quote><lg>

<l>Dulichium, and Samos,</l></lg></quote>



and not



<quote><lg>

<l>Same,</l></lg></quote>



and evidently supposes that the city is called by either name,

Samos or Samé, but the island by that of Samos only. That

the city is called Same is evident from the enumeration of

the suitors from each city, where the poet says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>there are four and twenty from Samé,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Od. xvi. 249.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Od. xvi. 249.</bibl></cit>

</p><p>There is reason in this. For the poet does not express

himself distinctly either about Cephallenia, or Ithaca, or the

other neighbouring places, so that both historians and commentators differ from one another.

he denotes by the epithet, that he means Neritum the mountain. In other passages he expressly mentions the mountain;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">I dwell at Ithaca, turned to the western sun; where is a mountain,

Neritum, seen from afar with its waving woods;</q><note anchored="yes">Od. ix. 21.</note></quote>



but whether he means the city, or the island, is not clear, at

least from this verse;



<quote><lg>

<l>they who possessed Ithaca, and Neritum.</l></lg></quote>



Any one would understand these words in their proper sense

to mean the city, as we speak of Athens, Lycabettus, Rhodes,

Atabyris, Lacedæmon, and Taygetus, but in a poetical sense

the contrary is implied.
</p><p>In the verses,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">I dwell at Ithaca, turned to the western sun, in which is a mountain

Neritum,</q></quote>



the meaning is plain, because the mountain is on the island

and not in the city; and when he says,

<l>we came from Ithaca situated under Neium,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Od. iii. 81.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Od. iii. 81.</bibl></cit>



it is uncertain whether he means that Neium was the same as

Neritum, or whether it is another, either mountain or place.

[He, who writes Nericum for Neritum, or the reverse, is

quite mistaken. For the poet describes the former as <q direct="unspecified">waving

southern. The sun in its course from east to west continues always as

during every cloudy season either by day or by night. Now

the celestial appearances alter very much as we advance more

or less towards the south, or the contrary; but this alteration

does not prevent our observing the setting and rising of the

sun, for in fine weather these phenomena are always visible

whether in the south or the north. For the pole is the most

northerly point: when this moves, and is sometimes over our

heads and sometimes below the earth, the arctic circles change

their position with it. Sometimes they disappear during

In our time Caius Antonius, the uncle of Marcus Antonius,

founded an additional city, when (being an exile after his consulship in which he was the colleague of Cicero the orator) he

lived at Cephallenia, and was master of the whole island, as

if it had been his own property. He returned from exile before he completed the foundation of the settlement, and died

when engaged in more important affairs.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some writers do not hesitate to affirm, that Cephallenia

and Dulichium are the same; others identify it with Taphos,

and the Cephallenians with Taphians, and these again with

Teleboæ. They assert that Amphitryon, with the aid of Cephalus, the son of Deioneus, an exile from Athens, undertook

an expedition against the island, and having got possession of

it, delivered it up to Cephalus; hence this city bore his name,

and the rest those of his children. But this is not in accordance with Homer, for the Cephallenians were subject to

Ulysses and Lærtes, and Taphos to Mentes;

Taphos is now called Taphius.<note anchored="yes">I. Meganisi.</note> Nor does Hellanicus follow

Homer when he calls Cephallenia, Dulichium, for Dulichium,

and the other Echinades, are said to be under the command

of Meges, and the inhabitants, Epeii, who came from Elis;

Neither, as Andro asserts, is Cephallenia, according to Homer,

Dulichium, nor does Dulichium belong to Cephallenia, for

Epeii possessed Dulichium, and Cephallenians the whole of

Cephallenia, the former of whom were under the command

of Ulysses, the latter of Meges. Paleis is not called Dulichium by Homer, as Pherecydes says. But he who asserts

that Cephallenia and Dulichium are the same contradicts

most strongly the account of Homer; for as fifty-two of the

suitors came from Dulichium, and twenty-four from Samé,

would he not say, that from the whole island came such a

number of suitors, and from a single city of the four came

half the number within two? If any one should admit this,

we shall inquire what the Samé could be, which is mentioned

in this line,

<p>The poet also gives the name of Samos to Thracia,

with the Ionian island, for he seems to have been acquainted

with the Ionian migration. He would not, otherwise, have

made a distinction between islands of the same names, for in

speaking of Samothrace, he makes the distinction sometimes

by the epithet,

He was therefore acquainted with the Ionian island, although

he has not mentioned its name. Nor had it formerly always

the same name, but was called Melamphylus, then Anthemis,

then Parthenia, from the river Parthenius, the name of which

was changed to Imbrasus. Since then both Cephallenia and

Samothracé were called Samos<note anchored="yes">In the Valle d' Alessandro, in Cephalonia, there is still a place called

war, (for if it had not been so Hecuba would not have been

was not yet colonized (by Ionians), which is evident from its

having the same name from one of the islands earlier (called

Samos), that had it before; whence this also is clear, that

those persons contradict ancient history, who assert, that

colonists came from Samos after the Ionian migration, and

the arrival of Tembrion, and gave the name of Samos to

Samothracé. The Samians invented this story out of vanity.

Those are more entitled to credit, who say, that heights are

But according to some writers, Samos had its name from the

Saii, a Thracian tribe, who formerly inhabited it, and who occupied also the adjoining continent, whether they were the

same people as the Sapæ, or the Sinti, whom the poet calls

Sinties, or a different nation. Archilochus mentions the

they are all barren and rocky, and lie in front of the mouth

of the Achelous, the most remote of them at the distance of

were farther out at sea, but the accumulation of earth, which

is brought down in great quantity by the Achelous, has already joined some, and will join others, to the continent. This

accumulation of soil anciently formed the tract Paracheloitis,

which the river overflows, a subject of contention, as it was

continually confounding boundaries, which had been determined by the Acarnanians and the Ætolians. For want of

arbitrators they decided their dispute by arms. The most

powerful gained the victory. This gave occasion to a fable,

how Hercules overcame the Achelous in fight, and received in

marriage as the prize of his victory, Deianeira, daughter of

Œneus. Sophocles introduces her, saying,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">My suitor was a river, I mean the Achelous, who demanded me of my

Some writers add, that this was the horn of Amaltheia, which

Hercules broke off from the Achelous, and presented to

Œneus as a bridal gift. Others, conjecturing the truth included in this story, say, that Achelous is reported to have

resembled a bull, like other rivers, in the roar of their waters,

and the bendings of their streams, which they term horns;

and a serpent from its length and oblique course; and bull-fronted because it was compared to a bull's head; and that

Hercules, who, on other occasions, was disposed to perform

acts of kindness for the public benefit, so particularly, when he

was desirous of contracting an alliance with Œneus, performed

for him these services; he prevented the river from overflowing its banks, by constructing mounds and by diverting its

streams by canals, and by draining a large tract of the Paracheloitis, which had been injured by the river; and this is the

horn of Amaltheia.

</p><p>But since Homer, and others, both poets and historians,

<pb n="173"/>



a beginning, or with an occasion of inquiring into what is

controverted.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>First then with respect to Acarnania. We have already said, that it was occupied by Lærtes and the Cephallenians; but as many writers have advanced statements respecting the first occupants in terms sufficiently clear, indeed, but

contradictory, the inquiry and discussion are left open to us.
</p><p>They say, that the Taphii and Teleboæ, as they are called,

were the first inhabitants of Acarnania, and that their chief,

Cephalus, who was appointed by Amphitryon sovereign of the

islands about Taphus, was master also of this country. Hence

is related of him the fable, that he was the first person who

took the reputed leap from Leucatas. But the poet does not

say, that the Taphii inhabited Acarnania before the arrival of

the Cephallenians and Lærtes, but that they were friends of

the Ithacenses; consequently, in his time, either they had

not the entire command of these places, or had voluntarily retired, or had even become joint settlers.
</p><p>A colony of certain from Lacedæmon seems to have settled

in Acarnania, who were followers of Icarius, father of Penelope, for the poet in the Odyssey represents him and the

brothers of Penelope as then living;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">who did not dare to go to the palace of Icarius with a view of his disposing of his daughter in marriage.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. ii. 52.</note></quote>



And with respect to the brothers;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">for now a long time both her father and her brothers were urging her

to marry Eurymachus.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. xv. 16.</note></quote>



Nor is it probable that they were living at Lacedæmon, for

Telemachus would not, in that case, have been the guest of

Menelaus upon his arrival, nor is there a tradition, that they

had any other habitation. But they say that Tyndareus and

his brother Icarius, after being banished from their own

country by Hippocoon, repaired to Thestius, the king of the

Pleuronii, and assisted in obtaining possession of a large

tract of country on the other side of the Achelous on condition of receiving a portion of it; that Tyndareus, having

espoused Leda the daughter of Thestius, returned home; that

Icarius continued there in possession of a portion of Acarnania, and had Penelope and her brothers by his wife Poly-

casta, daughter of Lygæus.



<pb n="174"/>



We lave shown by the Catalogue of the Ships in Homer,

that the Acarnanians were enumerated among the people who

took part in the war of Troy; and among these are reckoned

the inhabitants of the Acté, and besides these,



<quote><lg>

<l>they who occupied Epirus, and cultivated the land opposite.</l></lg></quote>



But Epirus was never called Acarnania, nor Acté, Leucas.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus does not say that they took part in the expedition against Troy; but he says that Alcmæon, the son of

Amphiaraus, who was the companion of Diomede, and the

other Epigoni in their expedition, having brought the war

against the Thebans to a successful issue, went with Diomede

to assist in punishing the enemies of Œneus, and having delivered up Ætolia to Diomede, he himself passed over into

Acarnania, which country also he subdued. In the mean

time Agamemnon attacked the Argives, and easily overcame

them, the greatest part having attached themselves to the followers of Diomede. But a short time afterwards, when the

expedition took place against Troy, he was afraid, lest, in his

absence with the army, Diomede and his troops should return

home, (for there was a rumour that he had collected a large

force,) and should regain possession of a territory to which

they had the best right, one being the heir of Adrastus, the

other of his father. Reflecting then on these circumstances,

he invited them to unite in the recovery of Argos, and to

take part in the war. Diomede consented to take part in the

expedition, but Alcmæon was indignant and refused; whence

the Acarnanians were the only people who did not participate in the expedition with the Greeks. The Acarnanians,

probably by following this account, are said to have imposed

upon the Romans, and to have obtained from them the privilege of an independent state, because they alone had not

taken part in the expedition against the ancestors of the Romans, for their names are neither in the Ætolian Catalogue,

nor are they mentioned by themselves, nor is their name

mentioned anywhere in the poem.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus then having represented Acarnania as subject

to Alcmeon before the Trojan war, ascribes to him the foundation of Amphilochian Argos, and says that Acarnania had

its name from his son Acarnan, and the Amphilochians from

his brother Amphilochus; thus he turns aside to reports contrary to the history in Homer. But Thucydides and other



<pb n="175"/>



writers say, that Amphilochus, on his return from the Trojan

expedition, being displeased with the state of affairs at Argos,

dwelt in this country; according to some writers, he obtained

it by succeeding to the dominions of his brother; others represent it differently. So much then respecting the Acarnanians considered by themselves. We shall now speak of their

affairs where they are intermixed in common with those of

the Ætolians, and we shall then relate as much of the history

of the Ætolians as we proposed to add to our former account

of this people.

<p>SOME writers reckon the Curetes among the Acarnanians, others among the Ætolians; some allege that they came

from Crete, others that they came from Eubœa. Since,

however, they are mentioned by Homer, we must first examine his account of them. It is thought that he does not

mean the Acarnanians, but the Ætolians, in the following

verses, for the sons of Porthaon were,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Agrius, Melas, and the hero Œneus,
</l><l>These dwelt at Pleuron, and the lofty Calydon,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xiv. 116.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xiv. 116.</bibl></cit>



both of which are Ætolian cities, and are mentioned in the

Ætolian Catalogue; wherefore since those who inhabited

Pleuron appear to be, according to Homer, Curetes, they

might be Ætolians. The opponents of this conclusion are

misled by the mode of expression in these verses,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>Curetes and Ætolians, firm in battle, were fighting for the city Calydon,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. ix. 525.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. ix. 525.</bibl></cit>



for neither would he have used appropriate terms if he had

said,



<quote><lg>

<l>Bœotians and Thebans were contending against each other,</l></lg></quote>



nor



<quote><lg>

<l>Argives and Peloponnesians.</l></lg></quote>



But we have shown in a former part of this work, that this

mode of expression is usual with Homer, and even trite among

other poets. This objection then is easily answered. But

let the objectors explain, how, if these people were not Æto-



<pb n="176"/>



lians, the poet came to reckon the Pleuronii among the Æto

lians.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus, after having asserted that the nation of the

Ætolians were never in subjection to any other people, but,

from all times of which any memorial remains, their country

continued exempt from the ravages of war, both on account of

its local obstacles and their own experience in warfare, says,

that from the beginning Curetes were in possession of the

whole country, but on the arrival of Ætōlus, the son of Endy-

nion, from Elis, who defeated them in various battles, the

Curetes retreated to the present Acarnania, and the Ætolians

returned with a body of Epeii, and founded ten of the most

ancient cities in Ætolia; and in the tenth generation afterwards Elis was founded, in conjunction with that people, by

Oxylus, the son of Hæmon, who had passed over from Ætolia.

They produce, as proofs of these facts, inscriptions, one

sculptured on the base of the statue of Ætolus at Therma in

Ætolia, where, according to the custom of the country, they

assemble to elect their magistrates;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">this statue of Ætolus, son of Endymion, brought up near the streams of

the Alpheius, and in the neighbourhood of the stadia of Olympia, Ætolians

dedicated as a public monument of his merits.</q></quote>



And the other inscription on the statue of Oxylus is in the

market-place of Elis;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Ætolus, having formerly abandoned the original inhabitants of this

country, won by the toils of war the land of the Curetes. But Oxylus,

the son of Hæmon, the tenth scion of that race, founded this ancient

city.</q></quote>



<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He rightly alleges, as a proof of the affinity subsisting

reciprocally between the Eleii and the $Etolians, these inscriptions, both of which recognise not the affinity alone, but

also that their founders had established settlers in each other's

country. Whence he clearly convicts those of falsehood who

assert, that the Eleii were a colony of Ætolians, and that the

Ætolians were not a colony of Eleii. But he seems to exhibit the same inconsistency in his positions here, that we

proved with regard to the oracle at Delphi. For after asserting that Ætolia had never been ravaged by war from all

time of which there was any memorial, and saying, that from

the first the Curetes were in possession of this country, he



<note anchored="yes">B. ix. c. iii. § ll.</note>



<pb n="177"/>



ought to have inferred from such premises, that the Curetes

continued to occupy the country of Ætolia to his days. For

in this manner it might be understood never to have been

devastated, nor in subjection to any other nation. But forgetting his position, he does not infer this, but the contrary,

that Ætolus came from Elis, and having defeated the Curetes

in various battles, these people retreated into Acarnania.

What else then is there peculiar to the devastation of a country

than the defeat of the inhabitants in war and their abandonment of their land, which is evinced by the inscription among

the Eleii; for speaking of Ætolus the words are,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">he obtained possession of the country of the Curetes by the continued

toils of war.</q></quote>



<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But perhaps some person may say, that he means Ætolia

was not laid waste, reckoning from the time that it had this

name after the arrival of Ætolus; but he takes away the

ground of this supposition, by saying afterwards, that the

greatest part of the people, that remained among the Ætolians,

were those called Epeii, with whom Ætolians were afterwards intermingled, who had been expelled from Thessaly

together with Bœotians, and possessed the country in common

with these people. But is it probable that, without any hostilities, they invaded the country of another nation and

divided it among themselves and the original possessors,

who did not require such a partition of their land? If this is

not probable, is it to be believed that the victors agreed to an

equal division of the territory? What else then is devastation

of a country, but the conquest of it by arms? Besides, Apollodorus says that, according to history, the Hyantes abandoned Bœotia and came and settled among the Ætolians, and

concludes as confident that his opinion is right by saying it is

our custom to relate these and similar facts exactly, whenever any of them is altogether dubious, or concerning which

erroneous opinions are entertained.

<p>Notwithstanding these faults in Ephorus, still he is

<p>With respect to the Curetes, some facts are related

which belong more immediately, some more remotely, to the

history of the Ætolians and Acarnanians. The facts more

immediately relating to them, are those which have been

mentioned before, as that the Curetes were living in the

country which is now called Ætolia, and that a body of

Ætolians under the command of Ætolus came there, and drove

them into Acarnania; and these facts besides, that Æolians

invaded Pleuronia, which was inhabited by Curetes, and

called Curetis, took away their territory, and expelled the

possessors.

their settlement at Chalcis, but being continually at war about

and drag them by the hair of the forehead, they wore their

hair long behind, and cut the hair short in front, whence they

had the name of Curetes, (or the shorn,) from eura, (<foreign lang="greek">kouo|a/,</foreign>)

children, (the Thestiadæ,) who probably succeeded in gaining possession

of the whole country. The Porthaonidæ of the branch of Agrius, were

Thersites, Onchestus, Prothous, Celeulor, Lycopeiis, and Melanippus.

<p>The myths relating to the Curetes abound with different statements

and confusion. The following are the only points to be borne in mind.

The Curetes belong to the most ancient times of Greece, and probably

are to be counted among the first inhabitants of Phrygia. They were the

authors and expositors of certain religious rites, which they celebrated

with dances. According to mythology they played a part at the birth of

Jupiter. They were sometimes called Idæan Dactyli. Hence their

name was given to the ministers of the worship of the Great Mother

among the Phrygians, which was celebrated with a kind of religious

frenzy. The Curetes were also called Corybantes. Hence also arose the

confusion between the religious rites observed in Crete, Phrygia, and

Samothrace. Again, on the other hand, the Curetes have been mistaken

for an Ætolian people, bearing the same name. Heyne, Not. ad Virgil.

represented as certain dæmons, or ministers of the gods, by

those who have handed down the traditions respecting Cretan

and Phrygian affairs, and which involve certain religious

rites, some mystical, others the contrary, relative to the nurture of Jupiter in Crete; the celebration of orgies in honour

of the mother of the gods, in Phrygia, and in the neighbourhood of the Trojan Ida. There is however a very great

variety<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tosau/th poikili/a,</foreign> will bear also to be translated, id tantum varietatis,

<q direct="unspecified">this difference only,</q> as Groskurd observes.</note> in these accounts. According to some, the Corybantes, Cabeiri, Idæan Dactyli, and Telchines are repre-

sented as the same persons as the Curetes; according to

others, they are related to, yet distinguished from, each other

by some slight differences; but to describe them in general

terms and more at length, they are inspired with an enthusiastic and Bacchic frenzy, which is exhibited by them as ministers at the celebration of the sacred rites, by inspiring terror

with armed dances, accompanied with the tumult and noise

of cymbals, drums, and armour, and with the sound of pipes

and shouting; so that these sacred ceremonies are nearly the

same as those that are performed among the Samothracians

in Lemnus, and in many other places; since the ministers of

the god are said to be the same.<note anchored="yes">M. de Saint Croix (Recherches sur les Mystères, &amp;c. sect. 2, page

<p>But since even the historians, through the similarity of

they have some degree of probability in their favour. They

say, for instance, that the people about Ætolia have the name

of Curetes from wearing long dresses like girls, (<foreign lang="greek">ko/rai,</foreign>) and

that there was, among the Greeks, a fondness for some such

girls and youths;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ko/rais kai\ ko)rois.</foreign></note> whence in several ways it is easy to find a

derivation of the name Curetes. It is also probable, that the

practice of armed dances, first introduced by persons who

paid so much attention to their hair and their dress, and who

were called Curetes, afforded a pretence for men more warlike

than others, and who passed their lives in arms, to be themselves called by the same name of Curetes, I mean those in

Eubœa, Ætolia, and Acarnania. Homer also gives this name

to the young soldiers;

So much then on the subject of the etymology of the name

Curetes. [The dance in armour is a military dance; this is

shown by the Pyrrhic dance and by Pyrrichus, who, it is said,

invented this kind of exercise for youths, to prepare them for

military service.]<note anchored="yes">Kramer suspects this passage to be an interpolation.</note>

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We are now to consider how the names of these people

agree together, and the theology, which is contained in their

history.
</p><p>Now this is common both to the Greeks and the Barbarians, to perform their religious ceremonies with the observance of a festival, and a relaxation from labour; some are

performed with enthusiasm, others without any emotion;

some accompanied with music, others without music; some in

mysterious privacy, others publicly; and these are the dictates

of nature.<note anchored="yes">The reading in the text is <foreign lang="greek">to\n d' o(/ntws nou=n.</foreign> The translation adopts

Meineke's reading, <foreign lang="greek">noou=ta.</foreign></note> For relaxation from labour withdraws the thoughts

from human occupations, and directs the reflecting mind to the

divinity: enthusiasm seems to be attended with a certain divine inspiration, and to approach the prophetic character;

the mystical concealment of the sacred rites excites veneration

for the divinity, and imitates his nature, which shuns human

senses and perception; music also, accompanied with the

dance, rhythm, and song, for the same reason brings us near

the deity by the pleasure which it excites, and by the charms

of art. For it has been justly said, that men resemble the

gods chiefly in doing good, but it may be said more properly,

when they are happy; and this happiness consists in rejoicing, in festivals, in philosophy, and in music.<note anchored="yes">Quam præclare philosophatus sit Strabo, me non monente, unusquisque assequitur; præclarius, utique, quam illi, qui ex nostro ritu religioso

<p>Hence Plato, and, before his time, the Pythagoreans,

called music philosophy. They maintained that the world

subsisted by harmony, and considered every kind of music to

be the work of the gods. It is thus that the muses are regarded as deities, and Apollo has the name of President of

the Muses, and all poetry divine, as being conversant about

the praises of the gods. Thus also they ascribe to music the

formation of manners, as everything which refines the mind

approximates to the power of the gods.
</p><p>The greater part of the Greeks attribute to Bacchus,

Apollo, Hecate, the Muses, and Ceres, everything connected

with orgies and Bacchanalian rites, dances, and the mysteries

attended upon initiation. They call also Bacchus, Dionysus,

and the chief Dæmon of the mysteries of Ceres.<note anchored="yes">Following the reading suggested by Groskurd.</note> The carrying about of branches of trees, dances, and initiations are

common to the worship of these gods. But with respect to

Apollo and the Muses, the latter preside over choirs of singers

and dancers; the former presides both over these and divination. All persons instructed in science, and particularly

those who have cultivated music, are ministers of the Muses;

these and also all who are engaged in divination are ministers

of Apollo. Those of Ceres, are the Mystæ, torch-bearers

and Hierophants; of Dionysus, Seileni, Satyri, Tityri, Bacchæ

Lenæ, Thyiæ, Mimallones, Naïdes, and Nymphæ, as they are

called.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But in Crete both these, and the sacred rites of Jupiter

in particular, were celebrated with the performance of orgies,

and by ministers, like the Satyri, who are employed in the worship of Dionysus. These were called Curetes, certain youths

who executed military movements in armour, accompanied

with dancing, exhibiting the fable of the birth of Jupiter, in

which Saturn was introduced, whose custom it was to devour

his children immediately after their birth; Rhea attempts to

conceal the pains of childbirth, and to remove the new-born

infant out of sight, using her utmost endeavours to preserve it.



<pb n="184"/>



In this she has the assistance of the Curetes who surround

the goddess, and by the noise of drums and other similar

sounds, by dancing in armour and by tumult, endeavour to

strike terror into Saturn, and escape notice whilst removing

his child. The child is then delivered into their hands to

be brought up with the same care by which he was rescued.

The Curetes therefore obtained this appellation, either because they were boys (<foreign lang="greek">ko/roi</foreign>), or because they educated Jupiter

in his youth (<foreign lang="greek">kourotroqei=n</foreign>), for there are two explanations,

inasmuch as they acted the same part with respect to Jupiter

as the Satyri (with respect to Dionysus). Such then is the

worship of the Greeks, as far as relates to the celebration of

orgies.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But the Berecyntes, a tribe of Phrygians, the Phrygians in general, and the Trojans, who live about Mount Ida,

themselves also worship Rhea, and perform orgies in her

honour; they call her mother of gods, Agdistis, and Phrygia,<note anchored="yes">This word appears here misplaced.</note>

the Great Goddess; from the places also where she is worshipped, Idæa, and Dindymene,<note anchored="yes">The chain of mountains extending from the sources of the Sagaris

Cybele.<note anchored="yes">This name is not derived from any place.</note> The Greeks call her ministers by the same name

Curetes, not that they follow the same mythology, but they

mean a different kind of persons, a sort of agents analogous to

the Satyri. These same ministers are also called by them

Corybantes.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We have the testimony of the poets in favour of these

opinions. Pindar, in the Dithyrambus, which begins in this

manner;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">formerly the dithyrambus used to creep upon the ground, long and

After mentioning the hymns, both ancient and modern, in

where he combines with one another the rites celebrated

for these are like the Phrygian ceremonies, nor is it at all

improbable that, as the Phrygians themselves are a colony of

Thracians, so they brought from Thrace their sacred ceremonies, and by joining together Dionysus and the Edonian

Lycurgus they intimate a similarity in the mode of the worship of both.

<p>From the song, the rhythm, and the instruments, all

Thracian music is supposed to be Asiatic. This is evident

For Pieria, Olympus, Pimpla, and Leibethrum were anciently

places, and mountains, belonging to the Thracians, but at

present they are in the possession of the Macedonians. The

Thracians, who were settled in Bœotia, dedicated Helicon to

the Muses, and consecrated the cave of the Nymphs, Leibethriades. The cultivators of ancient music are said to have

been Thracians, as Orpheus, Musaus, Thamyris; hence also

Eumolpus had his name. Those who regard the whole

<p>As in other things the Athenians always showed

their admiration of foreign customs, so they displayed it in

what respected the gods. They adopted many foreign sacred

ceremonies, particularly those of Thrace and Phrygia; for

which they were ridiculed in comedies. Plato mentions the

Bendidean, and Demosthenes the Phrygian rites, where he

is exposing Æschines and his mother to the scorn of the

people; the former for having been present when his mother

was sacrificing, and for frequently joining the band of Bacchanalians in celebrating their festivals, and shouting, Evoi,

<p>But there may be discovered respecting these dæmons,

Phrygia, because, after the devastation of Troy, the neighbouring Phrygians became masters of the country. It is also

supposed that the Curetes and the Corybantes were descendants of the Idæan Dactyli, and that they gave the name of

Idæan Dactyli to the first hundred persons who were born in

may thus with less difficulty form conjectures about the truth.

For example, mythologists probably represented the ministers

of the gods, and the gods themselves, as coursing over the

mountains, and their enthusiastic behaviour, for the same

reason that they considered the gods to be celestial beings,

and to exercise a providential care over all things, and

especially over signs and presages. Mining, hunting, and a

search after things useful for the purposes of life, appeared to

have a relation to this coursing over the mountains, but juggling and magic to be connected with enthusiastic behaviour,

religious rites, and divination. Of such a nature, and connected in particular with the improvement of the arts of life,

were the Dionysiac and Orphic arts. But enough of this subject.

ference of 30 stadia, between the Lyctian and Gortynian

Lyctus 80, stadia from the African sea. Cnossus has a marine

Minos<note anchored="yes"></note> is regarded as an excellent legislator, and the first

who possessed the sovereignty of the sea. He divided the

first to civilize the island by laws and institutions, by founding

cities, and by establishing forms of government. He pre-

tended to receive from Jupiter the decrees which he promul-

gated. It was probably in imitation of Rhadamanthus that

Minos went up to the cave of Jupiter, at intervals of nine

years, and brought from thence a set of ordinances, which he

Such is the statement of Ephorus; the ancients on the other

<p>It is difficult to determine which is right. There is

another story also not generally received; some persons affirming that Minos was a foreigner, others that he was a

these again afterwards were subject to the devastations of

the Cilicians. But the Romans destroyed them all after the

<p>So much then respecting Cnossus, a city to which I

am no stranger; but owing to the condition of human affairs,

their vicissitudes and accidents, the connexion and intercourse that subsisted between ourselves and the city is at an

end. Which may be thus explained. Dorylaiis, a military

tactician, a friend of Mithridates Euergetes, was appointed,

on account of his experience in military affairs, to levy a body

of foreigners, and was frequently in Greece and Thrace, and

often in the company of persons who came from Crete, before

the Romans were in possession of the island. A great multitude of mercenary soldiers was collected there, from whom



<pb n="198"/>



even the bands of pirates were recruited. During the stay

of Dorylaüs in the island, a war happened to break out between the Cnossians and the Gortynians. He was appointed

general by the Cnossians, and having finished the war speed-

ily and successfully, he obtained the highest honours. A

short time afterwards, being informed that Euergetes had been

treacherously put to death by his courtiers at Sinope, and

that he was succeeded in the government by his wife and

children, he abandoned everything there, remained at Cnossus, and married a Macedonian woman of the name of Sterope, by whom he had two sons, Lagetas and Stratarchas,

(the latter I myself saw when in extreme old age,) and one

daughter. Of the two sons of Euergetes, he who was surnamed Eupator succeeded to the throne when he was eleven

years of age; Dorylaüs, the son of Philetærus, was his foster brother. Philetærus was the brother of Dorylaüs the Tactician. The king had been so much pleased with his intimacy

with Dorylaüs when they lived together as children, that on

attaining manhood he not only promoted Dorylaiis to the highest honours, but extended his regard to his relations and

sent for them from Cnossus. At this time Lagetas and his

brother had lost their father, and were themselves grown up

to manhood. They quitted Cnossus, and came to Mithridates.

My mother's mother was the daughter of Lagetas. While

he enjoyed prosperity, they also prospered; but upon his

downfal (for he was detected in attempting to transfer the

kingdom to the Romans with a view to his own appointment

to the sovereignty) the affairs of Cnossus were involved in his

ruin and disgrace; and all intercourse with the Cnossians,

who themselves had experienced innumerable vicissitudes of

fortune, was suspended.

<p>After Cnossus, the city Gortyna seems to have held

the second place in rank and power. For when these cities

acted in concert they held in subjection all the rest of the inhabitants, and when they were at variance there was discord

throughout the island; and whichever party Cydonia espoused,

to them she was a most important accession.

the mountain. Pashley, Travels in Crete, vol. i. p. 290. Kramer does not

agree with Pashley, and, until further information shall be obtained, rests

upon the authority of Boeckh, C. I. No. 2556, who affirms that there is

some doubt about the name Priansus, which is only found on coins and

inscriptions; both Hoeck (v. Kreta I. p. 413) and Boeckh (C. I. ii. p. 405)

Ida; since Dicte is distant 1000 stadia from Mount Ida, and

100 stadia from the promontory Samonium. Prasus was

situated between the promontory Samonium, and the Cherrhonesus, at the distance of 60 stadia from the sea. It was razed

by the Hierapytnii. He says, too, that Callimachus<note anchored="yes">Callim, Hymn to Diana, 195.</note> is not

right in asserting that Britomartis, in her escape from the

of the fishermen (<foreign lang="greek">di/ktua</foreign>), and that hence she had the name of

<p>Cydonia is situated on the sea, fronting Laconia, at an

<p>As the poet in one place speaks of Crete as having a

ans, who accompanied Alhæmenes the Argive, and that

hence Ulysses speaks of its ninety cities. This account is

probable. But others say, that the ten were razed by the

enemies of Idomeneus; but the poet does not say that Crete

had a hundred cities at the time of the Trojan war, but in his

own age, for he speaks in his own person; but if the words

had been those of some person then living, as those in the

Odyssey, where Ulysses says, Crete had ninety cities, they

might have been properly understood in this manner. But

even if we admit this, the subsequent verses will not be exempt from objection. For neither at the time of the expedition, nor after the return of Idomeneus, is it probable that

these cities were destroyed by his enemies, for the poet says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">but Idomeneus brought back all his companions who had survived the

war to Crete; the sea had not deprived him of any of them;</q><note anchored="yes">Od. iii. 191.</note></quote>



for he would have mentioned such a misfortune. Ulysses indeed might not have been acquainted with the destruction of

these cities, for he had not had any intercourse with any of the

Greeks either during or after his wanderings; but (Nestor),

who had been the companion of Idomeneus in the expedition

and in his escape from shipwreck, could not be ignorant of

what had happened at home during the expedition and before

his return. But he must certainly have been aware of what

occurred after his return. For if he and all his companions

escaped, he returned so powerful that their enemies were not

in a position to deprive them of ten cities.
</p><p>Such then is the general description of the country of Crete.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>With respect to the form of government, which Ephorus has described at large, it will be sufficient to give a cur-

sory account of the principal parts. The law-giver, says

Ephorus, seems to lay, as the foundation of his constitution,

the greatest good that states can enjoy, namely, liberty; for it

is this alone which makes the property of every kind which

a man possesses his own; in a state of slavery it belongs to

the governor, and not to the governed. The liberty also

which men enjoy must be guarded. Unanimity ensues, when

the dissensions that arise from covetousness and luxury<note anchored="yes">Sordid avarice and covetousness have taken such hold upon them, that

among the Cretans alone, of all nations, nothing in the form of gain is

considered dishonourable. Polybius, b. vi.</note> are



<pb n="202"/>



removed. Now where all live temperately and frugally, neither envy, nor injuries, nor hatred have place among equals.

Whence the young were enjoined to repair to the Agelæ, and

those of mature age to assemble at the Syssitia, or common

meals, called Andreia, in order that the poorer sort, who were

fed at the public charge, might partake of the same fare as

the rich.
</p><p>With a view that courage, and not fear, should predominate,

they were accustomed from childhood to the use of arms, and

to endure fatigue. Hence they disregarded heat and cold,

rugged and steep roads, blows received in gymnastic exercises and in set battles.
</p><p>They practised archery, and the dance in armour, which

the Curetes first invented, and was afterwards perfected by

Pyrrhichus, and called after him Pyrrhiche. Hence even their

sports were not without their use in their training for war.

With the same intention they used the Cretan measures in

their songs; the tones of these measures are extremely loud;

they were invented by Thales, to whom are ascribed the

pæans and other native songs and many of their usages.

They adopted a military dress also, and shoes, and considered

armour as the most valuable of all presents.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some, he says, alleged that many of the institutions

supposed to be Cretan were of Lacedæmonian origin; but the

truth is, they were invented by the former, but perfected by the

Spartans. The Cretans, when their cities, and particularly

Cnossus, were ravaged, neglected military affairs, but some

usages were more observed by the Lyttii and Gortynii, and

some other small cities, than by the Cnossians. Those persons, who maintain the priority of the Laconian institutions,

adduce as evidence of this those of the Lyttii, because as colonists they would retain the customs of the parent state. Otherwise, it would be absurd for those, who lived under a better

form of constitution and government, to be imitators of a

worse. But this is not correct. For we ought not to form

conjectures respecting the ancient from the present state of

things, for each has undergone contrary changes. The Cretans were formerly powerful at sea, so that it was a proverbial saying addressed to those who pretended to be ignorant of what they knew, <q direct="unspecified">a Cretan, and not know the sea;</q>

but at present they have abandoned nautical affairs.



<pb n="203"/>



Nor did it follow necessarily that, because there were some

cities in Crete colonized by Spartans, they should continue

to observe Spartan usages, since many of the cities of colonists

do not preserve the customs of the mother country; and there

are many cities in Crete, the inhabitants of which are not

colonists, and yet have the same usages as those that have received colonies.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Lycurgus, the Spartan legislator, he says, was five

generations later than Althæmenes, who conducted the colony

into Crete. He is said by historians to have been the son of

Cissus, who founded Argos<note anchored="yes">His father, Temenus, was the founder of Argos. See b. viii.</note> about the same time that Procles

was engaged in establishing a colony at Sparta. It is also

generally admitted that Lycurgus was the sixth in descent

from Procles.<note anchored="yes">There is, however, diversity of opinions on the subject.</note> Copies do not precede the models, nor modern precede ancient things. The usual kind of dancing

practised among the Lacedæmonians, the measures, and the

pæans sung according to a certain mood, and many other

usages, are called among them Cretan, as if they came from

Crete. But among the ancient customs, those relative to the

administration of the state have the same designations as in

Crete,<note anchored="yes">Aristotle, Politics, b. ii. c. 10, where he compares the Cretan with

the Lacedæmonian constitution.</note> as the council of Gerontes<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tw=v gero/ntwn.</foreign></note> and that of the Knights,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">i(ppe(wn.</foreign></note>

except that in Crete the knights had horses; whence it is

conjectured, that the council of Knights in Crete is more

ancient, since the origin of the appellation is preserved. But

the Spartan knight did not keep a horse. They who perform the same functions as the Cosmi in Crete, have the different title of Ephori [in Sparta]. The Syssitia, or common

meal, is even at present called Andreia among the Cretans;

but among the Spartans they did not continue to call it by its

former name, as it is found in the poet Alcman;

<p>The occasion of the journey of Lycurgus to Crete is

said by the inhabitants to be as follows. The elder brother

of Lycurgus was Polydectes, who, at his death, left his wife

pregnant. Lycurgus reigned in place of his brother till the



<pb n="204"/>



birth of a son. He then became the guardian of the child,

who was heir to the kingdom. Some one said to him insultingly, he was sure Lycurgus would be king. Suspecting

that by this speech he might be accused of contriving a plot

against the child, and fearing that, if the child should die by

any accident, his enemies might impute its death to him, he

departed to Crete. This is said to have been the cause of his

journey. Upon his arrival in Crete he became acquainted with

Thales, the lyric poet and legislator. He learnt from this person the plan adopted by Rhadamanthus in former times, and

afterwards by Minos in promulgating their laws, so as to procure a belief that they proceeded from Jupiter. He was also

in Ægypt, and obtained information respecting the laws and

customs of that country.<note anchored="yes">According to Plutarch, with the poems of Homer.</note> According to some writers, he met

at Chios with Homer, who was living there, and then returned to his own country, where he found Charilaus, the son

of his brother Polydectes, upon the throne. He then began to

frame laws, repairing to the god at Delphi, and bringing thence

ordinances, as Minos brought his from the cave of Jupiter.<note anchored="yes">Herod. i. 65.</note>

The greater part of these ordinances were similar to those of

Minos.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The following are the principal of the laws of Crete,

which Ephorus has given in detail.
</p><p>All the Cretans, who are selected at the same time from

the troop (<foreign lang="greek">a)ge/lh</foreign>) of youths, are compelled to marry at once.

They do not however take the young women whom they

have married immediately to their homes, until they are qualified to administer household affairs.
</p><p>The woman's dower, if she has brothers, is half of the brother's portion.
</p><p>The children are taught to read, to chaunt songs taken

from the laws, and some kinds of music.
</p><p>While they are still very young they are taken to the Syssitia, called Andreia. They sit on the ground, eating their food

together, dressed in mean garments, which are not changed

in winter or summer. They wait upon themselves and on the

men. Both those of the same and those of different messes

have battles with one another. A trainer of boys presides

over each Andreion. As they grow older they are formed into



<pb n="205"/>



(<foreign lang="greek">)Age/lai</foreign>) or troops of youths. The most illustrious and powerful of the youths form Agelæ, each individual assembling together as many as he can collect. The governor of the troop

is generally the father of the youth who has assembled them

together, and has the power of taking them to hunt and to

exercise themselves in running, and of punishing the disobedient. They are maintained at the public charge.
</p><p>On certain set days troop encounters troop, marching in

time to the sound of the pipe and lyre, as is their custom in

actual war. They inflict blows, some with the hand, and

some even with iron weapons.

<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They have a peculiar custom with respect to their attachments. They do not influence the objects of their love

by persuasion, but have recourse to violent abduction. The

lover apprizes the friends of the youth, three or more days

beforehand, of his intention to carry off the object of his affection. It is reckoned a most base act to conceal the youth, or

not to permit him to walk about as usual, since it would be

an acknowledgment that the youth was unworthy of such a

lover. But if they are informed that the ravisher is equal or

superior in rank, or other circumstances, to the youth, they

pursue and oppose the former slightly, merely in conformity

with the custom. They then willingly allow him to carry off

the youth. If however he is an unworthy person, they take

the youth from him. This show of resistance does not end,

till the youth is received into the Andreium to which the

ravisher belongs. They do not regard as an object of affection a youth exceedingly handsome, but him who is distinguished for courage and modesty. The lover makes the youth

presents, and takes him away to whatever place he likes.

The persons present at the abduction accompany them, and

having passed two months in feasting, and in the chase, (for

it is not permitted to detain the youth longer,) they return to

the city. The youth is dismissed with presents, which consist of a military dress, an ox, and a drinking cup; the last

are prescribed by law, and besides these many other very

costly gifts, so that the friends contribute each their share in

order to diminish the expense.
</p><p>The youth sacrifices the ox to Jupiter, and entertains at a

feast those who came down with him from the mountains.

He then declares concerning the intercourse with the lover,



<pb n="206"/>



whether it took place with his consent or not, since the law

allows him, if any violence is used in the abduction, to insist

upon redress, and set him free from his engagement with the

lover. But for the beautiful and high-born not to have

lovers is disgraceful, since this neglect would be attributed to

a bad disposition.
</p><p>The parastathentes, for this is the name which they give

to those youths who have been carried away, enjoy certain

honours. At races and at festivals they have the principal

places. They are permitted to wear the stole, which distinguishes them from other persons, and which has been presented to them by their lovers; and not only at that time, but

in mature age, they appear in a distinctive dress, by which

each individual is recognised as Kleinos, for this name is

given to the object of their attachment, and that of Philetor

to the lover.
</p><p>These then are the usages respecting attachments.

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They elect ten Archons. On matters of highest moment they have recourse to the counsel of the Gerontes, as

they are called. They admit into this council those who

have been thought worthy of the office of Cosmi, and who

were otherwise persons of tried worth.
</p><p>I considered the form of government among the Cretans as

worthy of description, on account both of its peculiarity and

its fame. Few of these institutions are now in existence, and

the administration of affairs is chiefly conducted according to

the orders of the Romans, as is the case also in their other

provinces.

<p>It is divided into many parts, which are circumscribed

by boundaries of greater or less extent, and distinguished by

various names.
</p><p>But as such an extended range of mountains must comprise

nations some of which are little known, and others with

whom we are well acquainted, as Parthians,<note anchored="yes">Strabo calls the Parthians, Parthyæi; and Parthia, Pathyæa.</note> Medes, Armenians, some of the Cappadocians, Cilicians, and Pisidians;

those which approach near the northern parts must be assigned to the north, (northern Asia,) those approximating

the southern parts, to the south, (southern Asia,) and those

situated in the middle of the mountains must be placed on

account of the similarity of the temperature of the air, for it

is cold to the north, while the air of the south is warm.
</p><p>The currents of almost all the rivers which flow from the

Taurus are in a direction contrary to each other, some running to the north, others to the south, at least at the commencement of their course, although afterwards some bend

towards the east or west. They naturally suggest the adoption of this chain of mountains as a boundary in the division

of Asia into two portions; in the same manner that the sea

within the Pillars, which for the most part runs in the same

line with these mountains, conveniently forms two continents, Europe and Africa, and is a remarkable boundary to

both.

<p>In passing in our geographical description from Europe

to Asia, the first parts of the country which present themselves are those in the northern division, and we shall therefore begin with these.
</p><p>Of these parts the first are those about the Tanaïs, (or

Don,) which we have assumed as the boundary of Europe

and Asia. These have a kind of peninsular form, for they are

surrounded on the west by the river Tanaïs (or Don) and

the south is the tract of country extending from the mouth of

the Cyrus as far as Colchis, and comprising about 3000

stadia from sea to sea, across the territory of the Albani, and

Iberes,<note anchored="yes">See b. ii. c. v. § 31.</note> so as to represent an isthmus.<note anchored="yes">To understand how this part of Asia formed a peninsula, according to

the ideas of our author, we must bear in mind, that (1) he supposed the

source of the Don to have been situated in the neighbourhood of the

Northern Ocean; (2) he imagined the Caspian Sea to communicate with

the same Ocean. Thus all the territory comprehended between the Don

and the Caspian formed a sort of peninsula, united to the continent by an

isthmus which separated the Euxine from the Caspian and on which was

situated Colchis, Iberia, and Albania. The 3000 stadia assigned to the

breadth of this isthmus appears to be measured by stadia of <date value="1111">1111</date> 1/2 to a de-

Posidonius the isthmus is <date value="1500">1500</date> stadia in extent, that is, as

large as the isthmus from Pelusium to the Red Sea. And I

Having assumed the Tanaïs as the boundary of Europe and

2. The Tanaïs or Don flows from the northern parts. It does

not however flow in a direction diametrically opposite to the

Nile, as some suppose, but its course is more to the east than

that of the latter river; its sources, like those of the Nile,

are unknown. A great part of the course of the Nile is apparent, for it traverses a country the whole of which is easy

of access, and its stream is navigable to a great distance from

its mouth. We are acquainted with the mouths of the Don,

(there are two in the most northerly parts of the Mæotis, distant 60 stadia from each other,) but a small part only of the

tract above the mouths is explored, on account of the severity of the cold, and the destitute state of the country; the

natives are able to endure it, who subsist, like the wandering

shepherd tribes, on the flesh of their animals and on milk, but

strangers cannot bear the climate nor its privations. Besides,

the nomades dislike intercourse with other people, and being

a strong and numerous tribe have excluded travellers from

every part of the country which is accessible, and from all

such rivers as are navigable. For this reason some have supposed that the sources of the river are among the Caucasian

mountains, that, after flowing in a full stream towards the

north, it then makes a bend, and discharges itself into the

Mæotis. Theophanes<note anchored="yes">Cn. Pompeius Theophanes was one of the more intimate friends of

Pompey, by whom he was presented with the Roman franchise in the

presence of his army. This occurred in all probability about B. C. C2.

<emph rend="ital">Smith,</emph> art. Theophanes.</note> of Mitylene is of the same opinion with

these writers. Others suppose that it comes from the higher

parts of the Danube, but they do not produce any proof of so

the north.

mart both of the Asiatic and of the European nomades, and

of those who navigate the lake from the Bosporus, some of

whom bring slaves and hides, or any other nomadic commodity; others exchange wine for clothes, and other articles

peculiar to a civilized mode of life.

<p>In the voyage along the coast, the first object which

presents itself to those who have proceeded to the distance of

800 stadia from the Tanaïs, is the Great Rhombites, as it is

called, where large quantities of fish are captured for the purpose of being salted. Then at the distance of 800 stadia

more is the Lesser Rhombites,<note anchored="yes">Strabo makes the distance too great between the two rivers Rhombites.</note> and a promontory, which has

smaller fisheries. The [nomades] at the former have small

islands as stations for their vessels, those at the Lesser Rhombites are the Mæotæ who cultivate the ground. For along

the whole of this coasting voyage live Mæotæ, who are husbandmen, but not less addicted to war than the nomades.

They are divided into several tribes; those near the Tanaïs

are more savage, those contiguous to the Bosporus are more

gentle in their manners.
</p><p>From the Lesser Rhombites to Tyrambe, and the river Anticeites, are 600 stadia; then 120 to the Cimmerian village,

whence vessels set out on their voyage along the lake. In

this coasting voyage we meet with some look-out places, (for

observing the fish,) said to belong to the Clazomenians.

<p>Cimmericum was formerly a city built upon a peninsula,

the isthmus of which it enclosed with a ditch and mound.

The Cimmerii once possessed great power in the Bosporus,

whence it was called the Cimmerian Bosporus. These are

the people who overran the territory of the inhabitants of

the inland parts, on the right of the Euxine, as far as Ionia.

They were dislodged from these places by Scythians, and the

Scythians by Greeks, who founded Panticapæum,<note anchored="yes">Kertch.</note> and the

other cities on the Bosporus.

6. Next to the village Achilleium,<note anchored="yes">According to La Motraye, Achilleum corresponds to Adasbournout,

but Du Theil quotes also the following passage from Peyssonel. According to Strabo, Achilleum must have been situated opposite Casau-dip,

the ancient Parthenium on the point Tchochekha-Bournou (the pig's

head). But perhaps the ancients placed Achilleum near the entrance of

the Euxine into the Palus Mæotis. Is not the fort of Achou, which is 8

leagues more to the east on the Palus Mæotis, the true Achilleum, the

name being corrupted and abridged by the Tartars?</note> where is the temple of

Achilles, are 20 stadia. Here is the narrowest passage, 20

stadia or more, across the mouth of the Mæotis; on the opposite continent is Myrmecium, a village. Near are Heracleium and Parthenium.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Thence to the monument of Satyrus are 90 stadia; this

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Near it is Patræus,<note anchored="yes">Ada.</note> a village, from which to Corocondame,<note anchored="yes">Taman.</note> a village, are 130 stadia. This is the termination of

the Cimmerian Bosporus, as it is called. The narrow passage at the mouth of the Mœotis derives its name from the

straits opposite the Achilleium, and the Myrmecium; it extends as far as Corocondame and a small village opposite to

it in the territory of the Panticapæans, called Acra,<note anchored="yes">C. Takli.</note> and

separated by a channel of 70 stadia in width. The ice

reaches even to this place, for the Mæotis is frozen during

severe frost so as to become passable on foot. The whole of

this narrow passage has good harbours.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Beyond Corocondame is a large lake<note anchored="yes">Ak Tengis.</note> which is called

from the place Corocondametis. It discharges itself into the

sea at the distance of 10 stadia from the village. A branch<note anchored="yes">Another branch of the Kuban.</note>

of the river Anticeites empties itself into the lake, and forms

an island, which is surrounded by the waters of the lake, of

the Mæotis, and of the river. Some persons give this river

the name of Hypanis,<note anchored="yes">The Kuban, anciently also the Vardanus.</note> as well as to that<note anchored="yes">The Bog.</note> near the Borysthenes.<note anchored="yes">The Dnieper.</note>

<p>Upon sailing<note anchored="yes">It is probable that the Kuban Lake is here confounded with, or considered a portion of, the Lake Ak Tengis. Considering the intricacy of

all this coast, the changes that have taken place, and the absence of accurate knowledge, both in ancient and modern times, of these unfrequented parts, much must be left to conjecture. The positions therefore

assigned to ancient cities are doubtful. The names indeed are inserted

Phanagoria, a considerable city, Cepi, Hermonassa, and Apa

turum, the temple of Venus (Apatura). Of these cities Phanagoria and Cepi are situated in the above-mentioned island on

the left hand at the entrance of the lake; the others are on

the right hand in Sindica beyond the Hypanis. There is

Gorgipia,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)/sti de\ kai\ Goo|gipi/a.</foreign> Some word or words appear to be wanting

here. Kiepert assigns a place to this name, but it seems doubtful whether a place or a district is to be understood. Below, § 14, the Sindic

harbour and city are mentioned, which may have been situated at

Sound-jouk-kale. D' Anville places them here or at Anapa, but the

contour of the coast in his map does not resemble that of any modern

maps.</note> but the royal seat of the Sindi is in Sindica near

the sea, and Aborace.
</p><p>All those who are subject to the princes of the Bosporus

are called Bosporani. The capital of the European Bosporani is Panticapæum, and of the Asian Bosporani, the city of

Phanagorium,<note anchored="yes">The modern town Phanagoria does not seem to occupy the site of

the ancient city.</note> for this is the name given to it. Phanagoria

seems to be the mart for those commodities which are

brought down from the Mæotis, and from the barbarous country lying above it; and Panticapæum, the mart for the commodities which are transported thither from the sea. There

is also in Phanagoria a magnificent temple of Venus Apatura, the Deceitful. This epithet of the goddess is derived

from a fable, according to which the giants assaulted her in

this place. Having obtained the assistance of Hercules she hid

him in a cave, and then admitted the giants one by one into

her presence, and delivered them over to Hercules, thus

craftily<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)c a)pa/ths.</foreign></note> to be put to death.

<p>The Sindi, Dandarii, Toreatæ, Agri, Arrhechi, and

besides these, the Tarpetes, Obidiaceni, Sittaceni, Dosci, and

many others, belong to the Mæotæ; to this people belong the

Aspurgiani also, who live between Phanagoria and Gorgipia, at the distance of 500 stadia [from the Mæotis?]. Polemon, the king, entered the country of these people under a

show of friendship, but his design was discovered, and they

on their part attacked him unawares. He was taken prisoner,

and put to death.
</p><p>With respect to the Asian Mæotæ in general, some of

them were the subjects of those who possessed the mart on

the Tanaïs; others, of the Bosporani; and different bodies

have revolted at different times. The princes of the Bosporani were frequently masters of the country as far as the

Tanaïs, and particularly the last princes, Pharnaces, Asander,

and Polemon.
</p><p>Pharnaces is said to have once brought even the river

Hypanis over the territory of the Dandarii through some

ancient canal, which he had caused to be cleared, and inundated the country.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to Sindica, and Gorgipia upon the sea, is the

sea-coast inhabited by the Achæi, Zygi, and Heniochi. It

is for the most part without harbours and mountainous, being

a portion of the Caucasus.
</p><p>These people subsist by piracy.
</p><p>Their boats are slender, narrow, light, and capable of holding about five and twenty men, and rarely thirty. The

Greeks call them camaræ. They say, that at the time of

the expedition of Jason the Achæi Phthio$tæ founded the

Achaia there, and the Lacedæmonians, Heniochia. Their

leaders were Rhecas, and Amphistratus, the charioteers<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h(ni/oxoi.</foreign></note> of

the Dioscuri; it is probable that the Heniochi had their

name from these persons. They equip fleets consisting of

these camaræ, and being masters of the sea sometimes attack vessels of burden, or invade a territory, or even a city.

Sometimes even those who occupy the Bosporus assist them,

by furnishing places of shelter for their vessels, and supply

them with provision and means for the disposal of their

booty. When they return to their own country, not having

places suitable for mooring their vessels, they put their camaræ

on their shoulders, and carry them up into the forests, among

which they live, and where they cultivate a poor soil. When

the season arrives for navigation, they bring them down again

to the coast. Their habits are the same even in a foreign

country, for they are acquainted with wooded tracts, in which,

after concealing their camaræ, they wander about on foot day



<pb n="225"/>



and night, for the purpose of capturing the inhabitants and

reducing them to slavery. But they readily allow whatever

is taken to be ransomed, and signify this after their departure

to those who have lost their property. In places where there

is a regular government, the injured find means of repelling

them. For, frequently, the pirates are attacked in return, and

are carried off together with their camaræ. But the country

subject to the Romans is not so well protected, in conse-

quence of the neglect of those who are sent there.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such then is their mode of life. But even these people are governed by persons called Sceptuchi, and these again

are subject to the authority of tyrants, or of kings. The

Heniochi had four kings at the time that Mithridates Eupator

fled from the country of his ancestors to the Bosporus, and

passed through their country, which was open to him, but he

avoided that of the Zygi on account of its ruggedness, and

the savage character of the people. He proceeded with difficulty along the sea-coast, frequently embarking in vessels,

till he came to the country of the Achæi, by whom he was

hospitably received. He had then completed a journey from

the Phasis of not much less than 4000 stadia.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>From Corocondame, the course of the voyage is directly towards the east. At the distance of 180 stadia is the

Sindic harbour, and a city. Then at the distance of 400

stadia is Bata,<note anchored="yes">Pschate.</note> as it is called, a village with a harbour. It is

at this place that Sinope on the south seems to be directly

opposite to this coast, as Carambis<note anchored="yes">Keremp.</note> has been said to be opposite to Criu-Metopon.<note anchored="yes">C. Aia.</note>
</p><p>Next to Bata Artemidorus places the coast of the Cercetæ,

which has places of shelter for vessels, and villages along an

extent of about 850 stadia; then at 500 stadia more the

coast of the Achæi, then that of the Heniochi, at 1000 stadia,

then the Great Pityus, from which to Dioscurias are 360

stadia.
</p><p>The authors most worthy of credit who have written the

history of the Mithridatic wars, enumerate the Achæi first,

then Zygi, then Heniochi, then Cercetæ, Moschi, Colchi, and

above these the Phtheirophagi, Soanes, and other smaller

nations about the Caucasus.

The direction of the sea-coast is at first, as I have said,

towards the east, with a southern aspect; but from Bata

it makes a bend for a small distance, then fronts the west,

and terminates towards Pityus, and Dioscurias, for these

places are contiguous to the coast of Colchis, which I have

already mentioned. Next to Dioscurias is the remainder of

the coast of Colchis, and Trapezus contiguous to it; where

the coast, having made a considerable turn, then extends

nearly in a straight line, and forms the side on the right hand

of the Euxine, looking to the north.
</p><p>The whole of the coast of the Achæi, and of the other

nations, as far as Dioscurias, and the inland places lying in a

straight line towards the south, are at the foot of the Caucasus.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This mountain overhangs both the Euxine and the Caspian seas, forming a kind of rampart to the isthmus which

separates one sea from the other. To the south it is the

boundary of Albania and Iberia, to the north, of the plains

of the Sarmatians. It is well wooded, and contains various kinds of timber, and especially trees adapted to shipbuilding. Eratosthenes says that the Caucasus is called

Mount Caspius by the natives, a name borrowed perhaps

from the Caspii. It throws out forks towards the south, which

embrace the middle of Iberia, and touch the Armenian and

those called the Moschic mountains,<note anchored="yes">The Tschilder mountains, of which Scydeces and Paryandres are a

continuation.</note> and besides these the

mountains of Scydises, and the Paryadres. All these are

portions of the Taurus, which forms the southern side of

Armenia, and are broken off in a manner from it towards the

north, and extend as far as Caucasus, and the coast of the

Euxine which lies between Colchis and Themiscyra.<note anchored="yes">Thermeh.</note>

<p>Situated on a bay of this kind, and occupying the most

built SEBASTOPOLIS, (Steph. B.; Procop. B. G. iv. 4,) which was deserted

in the time of Pliny, but was afterwards garrisoned by Justinian. The

Not as if the author of the iambic intended to speak of the

river, nor of the city of the same name upon the river, but

Colchis designated by a part, because from the city and the

river there remains a voyage of not less than 600 stadia in a

straight line to the recess of the bay. This same Dioscurias

is the commencement of the isthmus lying between the Caspian Sea and the Euxine. It is a common mart of the nations

situated above it, and in its neighbourhood. There assemble

<p>How great anciently was the celebrity of this country,

appears from the fables which refer obscurely to the expedition

of Jason, who advanced as far even as Media; and still earlier

intimations of it are found in the fables relative to the expedition of Phrixus. The kings that preceded, and who possessed the country when it was divided into Sceptuchies,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">skhptouxi/as.</foreign></note>

were not very powerful, but when Mithridates Eupator had

enlarged his territory, this country fell under his dominion.

One of his courtiers was always sent as sub-governor and

administrator of its public affairs. Of this number was Moaphernes, my mother's paternal uncle. It was from this country

that the king derived the greatest part of his supplies for the

equipment of his naval armament. But upon the overthrow

of Mithridates, all the country subject to his power was disunited, and divided among several persons. At last Polemon



<pb n="229"/>



obtained possession of Colchis, and after his death his wife

Pythodoris reigned over the Colchians, Trapezus, Pharnacia,

and the Barbarians situated above them, of whom I shall

speak in another place.
</p><p>The territory of the Moschi, in which is situated the temple, is divided into three portions, one of which is occupied

by Colchians, another by Iberians, and the third by Armenians. There is in Iberia on the confines of Colchis, a small

city, the city of Phrixus, the present Idessa, a place of

strength. The river Charis<note anchored="yes">Casaubon would read Corax.—The Sukum.</note> flows near Dioscurias.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Among the nations that assemble at Dioscurias are

the Phtheiropagi, who have their appellation from their dirt

and filth.
</p><p>Near them live the Soanes, not less dirty in their habits,

but superior perhaps to all the tribes in strength and courage.

They are masters of the country around them, and occupy

the heights of Caucasus above Dioscurias. They have a king,

and a council of three hundred persons. They can assemble,

it is said, an army of two hundred thousand men, for all their

people are fighting men, but not distributed into certain orders.

In their country the winter torrents are said to bring down

even gold, which the Barbarians collect in troughs pierced

with holes, and lined with fleeces; and hence the fable of

the golden fleece. Some<note anchored="yes">Adopting Kramer's proposed reading, <foreign lang="greek">e)/nioi</foreign> in place of <foreign lang="greek">ei) mh\.</foreign></note> say that they are called Iberians

(the same name as the western Iberians) from the gold mines

found in both countries. The Soanes use poison of an extraordinary kind for the points of their weapons; even the odour

of this poison is a cause of suffering to those who are wounded

by arrows thus prepared.
</p><p>The other neighbouring nations about the Caucasus occupy

barren and narrow tracts of land. But the tribes of the Albanians and Iberians, who possess nearly the whole of the

above-mentioned isthmus, may also be denominated Caucasian, and yet they live in a fertile country and capable of

<p>THE greater part of Iberia is well inhabited, and contains cities and villages where the houses have roofs covered

with tiles, and display skill in building; there are marketplaces in them, and various kinds of public edifices.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some part of the country is encompassed by the Caucasian mountains; for branches of this range advance, as I have

said, towards the south. These districts are fruitful, comprise the whole of Iberia, and extend to Armenia and Colchis.

In the middle is a plain watered by rivers, the largest of

which is the Cyrus, which, rising in Armenia, immediately

enters the above-mentioned plain, having received the Aragus,<note anchored="yes">The Arak.</note> which flows at the foot of the Caucasus, and other

streams, passes through a narrow channel into Albania. It

flows however between this country and Armenia in a large

body through plains, which afford excellent pasture. After

having received several rivers, and among these the Alazonius,<note anchored="yes">In the English map, reduced from the Russian military map, there

are two rivers Alasan, flowing in contrary directions from M. Bebala.

The modern names of the other rivers here mentioned are not well ascertained.</note> Sandobanes, the Rhœtaces, and Chanes, all of which

are navigable, it discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. Its

former name was Corus.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The plain is occupied by those Iberians who are more

disposed to agriculture, and are inclined to peace. Their

dress is after the Armenian and Median fashion. Those

who inhabit the mountainous country, and they are the most

numerous, are addicted to war, live like the Sarmatians and

Scythians, on whose country they border, and with whom

they are connected by affinity of race. These people however engage in agriculture also, and can assemble many

myriads of persons from among themselves, and from the

Scythians and Sarmatians, whenever any disturbance occurs.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are four passes into the country; one through

quence of the winding of its stream, descends abruptly and

violently into Colchis. The places in its course are hollowed

by numerous torrents, during the rainy season. It rises in

the mountains which lie above, and many springs contribute

to swell its stream. In the plains it receives other rivers

also, among which are the Glaucus<note anchored="yes">Tchorocsu.</note> and the Hippus.<note anchored="yes">Ilori.</note> The

stream thus filled and navigable discharges itself into the

Pontus. It has on its banks a city of the same name, and

near it a lake. Such is the nature of the entrance into

Iberia from Colchis, shut in by rocks and strongholds, and

by rivers running through ravines.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>From the Nomades on the north there is a difficult

ascent for three days, and then a narrow road by the side of

the river Aragus, a journey of four days, which road admits

only one person to pass at a time. The termination of the

road is guarded by an impregnable wall.
</p><p>From Albania the entrance is at first cut through rocks,

then passes over a marsh formed by the river (Alazonius),<note anchored="yes">Probably the Alasan flowing from M. Bebala.</note>

in its descent from the Caucasus. On the side of Armenia are

the narrow passes on the Cyrus, and those on the Aragus, for

before the junction of these rivers they have on their banks

strong cities set upon rocks, at the distance from each other

of about 18 stadia, as Harmozica<note anchored="yes">Akalziche.</note> on the Cyrus, and on the

other (Aragus) Seusamora. Pompey formerly in his way

from Armenia, and afterwards Canidius, marched through

these passes into Iberia.

<p>The inhabitants of this country are also divided into

four classes; the first and chief is that from which the kings

<p>THE Albanians pursue rather a shepherd life, and resemble more the nomadic tribes, except that they are not savages,

and hence they are little disposed to war. They inhabit the

country between the Iberians and the Caspian Sea, approaching close to the sea on the east, and on the west border upon

the Iberians.
</p><p>Of the remaining sides the northern is protected by the

Caucasian mountains, for these overhang the plains, and are

called, particularly those near the sea, Ceraunian mountains.

The southern side is formed by Armenia, which extends

along it. A large portion of it consists of plains, and a

large portion also of mountains, as Cambysene, where the

Armenians approach close both to the Iberians and the Albanians.

<p>The Cyrus, which flows through Albania, and the other

rivers which swell the stream of the Cyrus, improve the

qualities of the land, but remove the sea to a distance. For

the mud, accumulating in great quantity, fillsup the channel

in such a manner, that the small adjacent islands are annexed to the continent, irregular marshes are formed, and

difficult to be avoided; the reverberation also of the tide increases the irregular formation of the marshes. The mouth

of the river is said to be divided into twelve branches, some

of which afford no passage through them, others are so shallow

as to leave no shelter for vessels. The shore for an extent

of more than 60 stadia is inundated by the sea, and by the

rivers; all that part of it is inaccessible; the mud reaches

even as far as 500 stadia, and forms a bank along the coast.

The Araxes<note anchored="yes">The Aras.</note> discharges its waters not far off, coming with

an impetuous stream from Armenia, but the mud which this

<p>Perhaps such a race of people have no need of the sea,

for they do not make a proper use even of the land, which

produces every kind of fruit, even the most delicate, and

every kind of plant and evergreen. It is not cultivated with

the least care; but all that is excellent grows without sowing,

and without ploughing, according to the accounts of persons

who have accompanied armies there, and describe the inhabitants as leading a Cyclopean mode of life. In many places the

ground, which has been sowed once, produces two or three

crops, the first of which is even fifty-fold, and that without

a fallow, nor is the ground turned with an iron instrument,

but with a plough made entirely of wood. The whole plain

is better watered than Babylon or Ægypt, by rivers and

streams, so that it always presents the appearance of herbage,

and it affords excellent pasture. The air here is better than

in those countries. The vines remain always without digging

round them, and are pruned every five years. The young

trees bear fruit even the second year, but the full grown

yield so much that a large quantity of it is left on the

branches. The cattle, both tame and wild, thrive well in this

country.

<p>The men are distinguished for beauty of person and for

size. They are simple in their dealings and not fraudulent,

for they do not in general use coined money; nor are they

acquainted with any number above a hundred, and transact

their exchanges by loads. They are careless with regard to

the other circumstances of life. They are ignorant of weights

and measures as far as exactness is concerned; they are im-

provident with respect to war, government, and agriculture.

there is no war they frequently attack these people and prevent them from cultivating the ground. They use javelins

<p>Their kings differ from one another; at present one king

governs all the tribes. Formerly each tribe was governed by

a king, who spoke the peculiar language of each. They

<p>The gods they worship are the Sun, Jupiter, and the

Moon, but the Moon above the rest. She has a temple near

Iberia. The priest is a person who, next to the king, receives the highest honours. He has the government of the

sacred land, which is extensive and populous, and authority

over the sacred attendants, many of whom are divinely inspired, and prophesy. Whoever of these persons, being violently possessed, wanders alone in the woods, is seized by the

priest, who, having bound him with sacred fetters, maintains

him sumptuously during that year. Afterwards he is brought

forth at the sacrifice performed in honour of the goddess, and

is anointed with fragrant ointment and sacrificed together with

other victims. The sacrifice is performed in the following

manner. A person, having in his hand a sacred lance, with

which it is the custom to sacrifice human victims, advances out

of the crowd and pierces the heart through the side, which he

does from experience in this office. When the man has fallen,

certain prognostications are indicated by the manner of the

fall, and these are publicly declared. The body is carried away

to a certain spot, and then they all trample upon it, performing this action as a mode of purification of themselves.

Jason, accompanied by Armenus the Thessalian, undertook

the voyage to the Colchi, they advanced as far as the Caspian

Sea, and traversed Iberia, Albania, a great part of Armenia,

and Media, as the Jasoneia and many other monuments testify. Armenus, they say, was a native of Armenium, one of

the cities on the lake Beebeis, between Pheræ and Parisa, and

that his companions settled in Acilisene, and the Suspiritis,

and occupied the country as far as Calachene and Adiabene,

and that he gave his own name to Armenia.

When at home they are occupied in performing with their

own hands the work of ploughing, planting, pasturing cattle,

and particularly in training horses. The strongest among

them spend much of their time in hunting on horseback, and

practise warlike exercises. All of them from infancy have

the right breast seared, in order that they may use the arm with

ease for all manner of purposes, and particularly for throwing the javelin. They employ the bow also, and sagaris,

(a kind of sword,) and wear a buckler. They make helmets,

and coverings for the body, and girdles, of the skins of wild

animals. They pass two months of the spring on a neighbouring mountain, which is the boundary between them and

the Gargarenses. The latter also ascend the mountain according to some ancient custom for the purpose of performing common sacrifices, and of having intercourse with the

women with a view to offspring, in secret and in darkness,

the man with the first woman he meets. When the women

are pregnant they are sent away. The female children that

may be born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but

the males are taken to the Gargarenses to be brought up.

The children are distributed among families, in which the

master treats them as his own, it being impossible to ascertain

the contrary.

<p>There is a peculiarity in the history of the Amazons.

In other histories the fabulous and the historical parts are

kept distinct. For what is ancient, false, and marvellous is

called fable. But history has truth for its object, whether

it be old or new, and it either rejects or rarely admits the

marvellous. But, with regard to the Amazons, the same facts

are related both by modern and by ancient writers; they are

marvellous and exceed belief. For who can believe that an

army of women, or a city, or a nation, could ever subsist

without men? and not only subsist, but make inroads upon

the territory of other people, and obtain possession not only

of the places near them, and advance even as far as the present Ionia, but even despatch an expedition across the sea to

Attica? This is as much as to say that the men of those

days were women, and the women men. But even now the

same things are told of the Amazons, and the peculiarity of

their history is increased by the credit which is given to

ancient, in preference to modern, accounts.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They are said to have founded cities, and to have given

their names to them, as Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, Myrina,

besides leaving sepulchres and other memorials. Themiscyra,

the plains about the Thermodon, and the mountains lying

above, are mentioned by all writers as once belonging to the

Amazons, from whence, they say, they were driven out. Where

they are at present few writers undertake to point out, nor do

they advance proofs or probability for what they state; as in

the case of Thalestria, queen of the Amazons, with whom

Alexander is said to have had intercourse in Hyrcania with

the hope of having offspring. Writers are not agreed on this

point, and among many who have paid the greatest regard to

truth none mention the circumstance, nor do writers of the

highest credit mention anything of the kind, nor do those who

record it relate the same facts. Cleitarchus says that Thalestria set out from the Caspian Gates and Thermodon to

meet Alexander. Now from the Caspian Gates to Thermodon

are more than 6000 stadia.

they transferred, for example, the Caucasus to the mountains

of India, and to the eastern sea, which approaches close to

them, from the mountains situated above Colchis, and the

Euxine Sea. These are the mountains to which the Greeks

give the name of Caucasus, and are distant more than 30,000

stadia from India. Here they lay the scene of Prometheus

and his chains, for these were the farthest places towards the

east with which the people of those times were acquainted.

The expeditions of Bacchus and of Hercules against the

Indi indicate a mythological story of later date, for Hercules

is said to have released Prometheus a thousand years after he

was first chained to the rock. It was more glorious too for

Alexander to subjugate Asia as far as the mountains of India,

than to the recess only of the Euxine Sea and the Caucasus

The celebrity, and the name of the mountain, together with

the persuasion that Jason and his companions had accomplished the most distant of all expeditions when they had

arrived in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus, and the tradition that Prometheus had been chained on Caucasus at the

extremity of the earth, induced writers to suppose that they

should gratify the king by transferring the name of the

mountain to India.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The highest points of the actual Caucasus are the most

southerly, and lie near Albania, Iberia, the Colchi, and Heniochi. They are inhabited by the people whom I have mentioned as assembling at Dioscurias. They resort thither

chiefly for the purpose of procuring salt. Of these tribes

some occupy the heights; others live in wooded valleys, and

subsist chiefly on the flesh of wild animals, wild fruits, and

milk. The heights are impassable in winter; in summer they

are ascended by fastening on the feet shoes as wide as drums,

made of raw hide, and furnished with spikes on account of the

snow and ice. The natives in descending with their loads

slide down seated upon skins, which is the practice in Media,

Atropatia, and at Mount Masius in Armenia, but there they

fasten circular disks of wood with spikes to the soles of their

feet. Such then is the nature of the heights of Caucasus.

also that it is navigable with ease, (this circumstance both

Aristobulus and Eratosthenes borrow from Patrocles,) and

that large quantities of Indian merchandise are conveyed by

it to the Hyrcanian Sea, and are transferred from thence into

Albania by the Cyrus, and through the adjoining countries to

the Euxine. The Ochus is not often mentioned by the ancients, but Apollodorus, the author of the Parthica, frequently

<p>Many additional falsehoods were invented respecting

this sea, to flatter the ambition of Alexander and his love of

glory; for, as it was generally acknowledged that the river

Tanaïs separated Europe from Asia throughout its whole

course, and that a large part of Asia, lying between this sea

and the Tanaïs, had never been subjected to the power of the

Macedonians, it was resolved to invent an expedition, in order

that, according to fame at least, Alexander might seem to

have conquered those countries. They therefore made the

lake Mæotis, which receives the Tanaïs, and the Caspian Sea,

which also they call a lake, one body of water, affirming that

there was a subterraneous opening between both, and that

one was part of the other. Polycleitus produces proofs to

show that this sea is a lake, for instance, that it breeds serpents, and that the water is sweetish.<note anchored="yes">The same statement was made to Pompey, when in these regions in

stance of the Tanaïs discharging itself into it. From the

same mountains in India, where the Ochus and the Oxus rise,

many other rivers take their course, and among these the

laxartes, which like the former empties itself into the Caspian Sea, although it is the most northerly of them all. This

river then they called Tanaïs, and alleged, as a proof that it

was the Tanaïs mentioned by Polycleitus, that the country on

the other side of the river produced the fir-tree, and that the

Scethians there used arrows made of fir-wood. It was a

proof also that the country on the other side of the river was

a part of Europe and not of Asia, that Upper and Eastern Asia

do not produce the fir-tree. But Eratosthenes says that the

fir does grow even in India, and that Alexander built his

ships of that wood. Eratosthenes collects many things of this

kind, with a view to show their contradictory character. But

<p>Among the peculiarities recorded of the Hyrcanian sea,

Eudoxus and others relate the following. There is a certain

coast in front of the sea hollowed out into caverns, between

which and the sea there lies a flat shore. Rivers on reaching

this coast descend from the precipices above with sufficient force

to dart the water into the sea without wetting the intervening

shore, so that even an army could pass underneath sheltered

by the stream above. The inhabitants frequently resort to

this place for the purposes of festivity and of performing

sacrifices, one while reclining beneath the caverns, at another

basking in the sun (even) beneath the fall of water. They

divert themselves in various ways, having in sight on each

side the sea and shore, the latter of which by the dew [and

moisture of the falls] is rendered a grassy and flowery meadow.

<p>On the left hand<note anchored="yes">On advancing from the S. E. of the Hyrcanian Sea towards the E.</note> opposite to these parts are situated

the Scythian and nomadic nations, occupying the whole of

the northern side. Most of the Scythians, beginning from

the Caspian Sea, are called Dahæ Scythæ, and those situated

more towards the east Massagetæ and Sacæ; the rest have

the common appellation of Scythians, but each separate tribe

has its peculiar name. All, or the greatest part of them, are

nomades. The best known tribes are those who deprived

the Greeks of Bactriana, the Asii, Pasiani, (Asiani?) Tochari,

and Sacarauli, who came from the country on the other side

of the Iaxartes,<note anchored="yes">The Syr-Daria.</note> opposite the Sacæ and Sogdiani, and which

country was also occupied by Sacæ; some tribes of the

Dahæ are surnamed Aparni, some Xanthii, others Pissuri.<note anchored="yes">Aparni, Xanthii, and Pissuri, in this passage, seem to be the same as

Parni, Xandii, and Parii, in c. ix. § 3, if we may understand in the present passage these people to be referred to only by name, but not as

living in the country here described.</note>



<pb n="246"/>



The Aparni approach the nearest of any of these people to

llyrcania, and to the Caspian Sea. The others extend as far

as the country opposite to Aria.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Between these people, Hyrcania, and Parthia as far as

Aria lies a vast and arid desert, which they crossed by long

journeys, and overran Hyrcania, the Nesæan country, and

the plains of Parthia. These people agreed to pay a tribute

on condition of having permission to overrun the country at

stated times, and to carry away the plunder. But when these

incursions became more frequent than the agreement allowed,

war ensued, afterwards peace was made, and then again war

was renewed. Such is the kind of life which the other Nomades also lead, continually attacking their neighbours, and

then making peace with them.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Sacæ had made incursions similar to those of the

Cimmerians and Treres, some near their own country, others

at a greater distance. They occupied Bactriana, and got

possession of the most fertile tract in Armenia, which was

called after their own name, Sacasene. They advanced even

as far as the Cappadocians, those particularly situated near

the Euxine; who are now called Pontici. When they were

assembled together and feasting on the division of the booty,

they were attacked by night by the Persian generals who

were then stationed in that quarter, and were utterly exterminated. The Persians raised a mound of earth in the form

of a hill over a rock in the plain, (where this occurred,) and

fortified it. They erected there a temple to Anaïtis and tile

gods Omanus and Anadatus, Persian deities who have a

common altar.<note anchored="yes">These gods, otherwise unknown, are mentioned again in b. xv. c. iii.

§ 15.</note> They also instituted an annual festival, (in

memory of the event,) the Sacæa, which the occupiers of Zela,

for this is the name of the place, celebrate to this day. It is

a small city chiefly appropriated to the sacred attendants.

Pompey added to it a considerable tract of territory, the inhabitants of which he collected within the walls. It was one

of the cities which he settled after the overthrow of Mithridates.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such is the account which is given of the Sacæ by some

writers. Others say, that Cyrus in an expedition against the



<pb n="247"/>



Sacæ was defeated, and fled. He advanced with his army to

the spot where he had left his stores, consisting of large supplies of every kind, particularly of wine; he stopped a short

time to refresh his army, and set out in the evening, as

though he continued his flight, the tents being left full of provisions. He proceeded as far as he thought requisite, and

then halted. The Sacæ pursued, who, finding the camp abandoned and full of the means of gratifying their appetites, indulged themselves without restraint. Cyrus then returned

and found them drunk and frantic; some were killed, stretched on the ground drowsy or asleep; others, dancing and maddened with wine, fell defenceless on the weapons of their

enemies. Nearly all of them perished. Cyrus ascribed

this success to the gods; lie consecrated the day to the goddess worshipped in his own country, and called it Sacæ.

Wherever there is a temple of this goddess, there the Sacœan

festival, a sort of Bacchanalian feast, is celebrated, in which

both men and women, dressed in the Scythian habit, pass day

and night in drinking and wanton play.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Massagetæ signalized their bravery in the war with

Cyrus, of which many writers have published accounts; we

must get our information from them. Such particulars as

the following are narrated respecting this nation; some

tribes inhabit mountains, some plains, others live among

marshes formed by the rivers, others on the islands among the

marshes. The Araxes is said to be the river which is the chief

cause of inundating the country; it is divided into various

branches and discharges itself by many mouths into the other

sea<note anchored="yes">The Northern Ocean.</note> towards the north, but by one only into the Hyrcanian

Gulf. The Massagetæ regard no other deity than the sun, and

to his honour they sacrifice a horse. Each man marries only

one wife, but they have intercourse with the wives of each

other without any concealment. He who has intercourse with

the wife of another man hangs up his quiver on a waggon,

and lies with her openly. They account the best mode of

death to be chopped up when they grow old with the flesh of

sheep, and both to be devoured together. Those who die of'

disease are cast out as impious, and only fit to be the prey of

wild beasts; they are excellent horsemen, and also fight well

on foot. They use bows, swords, breastplates, and sagares



<pb n="248"/>



of brass, they wear golden belts, and turbans<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">diadh/mata.</foreign></note> on their heads

in battle. Their horses have bits of gold, and golden breastplates; they have no silver, iron in small quantity, but gold

and brass in great plenty.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Those who live in the islands have no corn-fields. Their

food consists of roots and wild fruits. Their clothes are made

of the bark of trees, for they have no sheep. They press out

and drink the juice of the fruit of certain trees.
</p><p>The inhabitants of the marshes eat fish. They are clothed

in the skins of seals, which come upon the island from the sea.
</p><p>The mountaineers subsist on wild fruits. They have besides a few sheep, but they kill them sparingly, and keep

them for the sake of their wool and milk. Their clothes

they variegate by steeping them in dyes, which produce a

colour not easily effaced.
</p><p>The inhabitants of the plains, although they possess land,

do not cultivate it, but derive their subsistence from their

flocks, and from fish, after the manner of the nomades and

Scythians. I have frequently described a certain way of life

common to all these people. Their burial-places and their

manners are alike, and their whole manner of living is independent, but rude, savage, and hostile; in their compacts, however, they are simple and without deceit.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Attasii (Augasii?) and the Chorasmii belong to

the Massagetæ and Sacæ, to whom Spitamenes directed his

flight from Bactria and Sogdiana. He was one of the Persians who, like Bessus, made his escape from Alexander by

flight, as Arsaces afterwards fled from Seleucus Callinicus,

and retreated among the Aspasiacæ.
</p><p>Eratosthenes says, that the Bactrians lie along the Arachoti

and Massagetæ on the west near the Oxus, and that Sacæ and

Sogdiani, through the whole extent of their territory,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">toi=s o(/lois e\da/fesin.</foreign></note> are opposite to India, but the Bactrii in part only, for the greater part

of their country lies parallel to the Parapomisus; that the

Sacæ and Sogdiani are separated by the Iaxartes, and the

Sogdiani and Bactriani by the Oxus; that Tapyri occupy

the country between Hyrcani and Arii; that around the

shores of the sea, next to the Hyrcani, are Amardi, Anariacæ,

Cadusii, Albani, Caspii, Vitii, and perhaps other tribes extending as far as the Scythians; that on the other side of the

<p>PARTHIA is not an extensive tract of country; for this

reason it was united with the Hyrcani for the purpose of paying tribute under the Persian dominion and afterwards, during

a long period when the Macedonians were masters of the country. Besides its small extent, it is thickly wooded, mountainous, and produces nothing; so that the kings with their

multitude of followers pass with great speed through the

country, which is unable to furnish subsistence for such numbers even for a short time. At present it is augmented in

extent. Comisene<note anchored="yes">Its present name is said to be Comis.</note> and Chorene are parts of Parthiene, and

perhaps also the country as far as the Caspian Gates, Rhagæ,

and the Tapyri, which formerly belonged to Media. Apameia

and Heracleia are cities in the neighbourhood of Rhagæ.
</p><p>From the Caspian Gates to Rhagæ are 500 stadia according to Apollodorus, and to Hecatompylos, the royal seat of

the Parthians, <date value="1260">1260</date> stadia. Rhagæ<note anchored="yes">The Rents.</note> is said to have had its

name from the earthquakes which occurred in that country, by

which many cities and two thousand villages, as Poseidonius

relates, were overthrown. The Tapyri are said to live between the Derbices and the Hyrcani. Historians say, that

it is a custom among the Tapyri to surrender the married

women to other men, even when the husbands have had two

or three children by them, as Cato surrendered Marcia in

our times, according to an ancient custom of the Romans, to

government of it occasioned first the revolt of Bactriana;

then Euthydemus and his party the revolt of all the country

near that province. Afterwards Arsaces, a Scythian, (with

the Parni, called nomades, a tribe of the Dahæ, who live on

the banks of the Ochus,) invaded Parthia, and made himself

master of it. At first both Arsaces and his successors were

weakened by maintaining wars with those who had been deprived of their territory. Afterwards they became so powerful,

in consequence of their successful warfare, continually depriving their neighbours of portions of their territory, that at last

they took possession of all the country within the Euphrates.

They deprived Eucratidas, and then the Scythians, by force

of arms, of a part of Bactriana. They now have an empire

comprehending so large an extent of country, and so many

nations, that it almost rivals that of the Romans in magnitude.

This is to be attributed to their mode of life and manners,

which have indeed much of the barbarous and Scythian character, but are very well adapted for establishing dominion,

and for insuring success in war.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They say that the Dahæ Parni were an emigrant tribe

from the Dahæ above the Mæotis, who are called Xandii

and Parii. But it is not generally acknowledged that Dahæ

are to be found among the Scythians above the Meotis, yet

from these Arsaces according to some was descended; according to others he was a Bactrian, and withdrawing himself from the increasing power of Diodotus, occasioned the

revolt of Parthia.
</p><p>We have enlarged on the subject of the Parthian customs

in the sixth book of historical commentaries, and in the second

of those, which are a sequel to Polybius: we shall omit what

we said, in order to avoid repetition; adding this only, that

Poseidonius affirms that the council of the Parthians is composed of two classes, one of relatives, (of the royal family,)

and another of wise men and magi, by both of which kings

are chosen.

got possession not only of Pattalene,<note anchored="yes">Tatta or Sindi.</note> but of the kingdoms of

Saraostus, and Sigerdis, which constitute the remainder of the

coast. Apollodorus in short says that Bactriana is the ornament of all Ariana. They extended their empire even as far

as the Seres and Phryni.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Their cities were Bactra, which they call also Zariaspa,

(a river of the same name flows through it, and empties itself

into the Oxus,) and Darapsa,<note anchored="yes">Adraspa. B. xv. c. ii. § 10.</note> and many others. Among

these was Eucratidia, which had its name from Eucratidas,

the king. When the Greeks got possession of the country,

they divided it into satrapies; that of Aspionus and Turiva<note anchored="yes">Mentioned nowhere else. Kramer seems to approve of Du Theil's

proposed correction, Tapunia.</note>

the Parthians took from Eucratidas. They possessed Sogdiana also, situated above Bactriana to the east, between the

river Oxus (which bounds Bactriana and Sogdiana) and the

Iaxartes; the latter river separates the Sogdii and the

nomades.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Anciently the Sogdiani and Bactriani did not differ

much from the nomades in their mode of life and manners,

yet the manners of the Bactriani were a little more civilized.

Onesicritus however does not give the most favourable account

of this people. Those who are disabled by disease or old age

years, confine them, and let them die of hunger. This custom, although Scythian in character, is more tolerable than

that of the Bactrians, and is similar to the domestic law of

to conjecture,<note anchored="yes">The text is corrupt.</note> if Alexander found such customs prevailing

there, what were the customs which probably were observed

by them in the time of the first kings of Persia, and of the

princes who preceded them.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Alexander, it is said, founded eight cities in Bactriana

and Sogdiana; some he razed, among which were Cariatæ in

Bactriana, where Callisthenes was seized and imprisoned;

Maracanda in Sogdiana, and Cyra, the last of the places

founded by Cyrus, situated upon the river Iaxartes, and the

boundary of the Persian empire. This also, although it was

attached to Cyrus, he razed on account of its frequent revolts.
</p><p>Alexander took also, it is said, by means of treachery, strong

fortified rocks; one of which belonged to Sisimithres in Bactriana, where Oxyartes kept his daughter Roxana; another to

Oxus in Sogdiana, or, according to some writers, to Ariamazas. The stronghold of Sisimithres is described by historians to have been fifteen stadia in height, and eighty stadia

in circuit. On the summit is a level ground, which is fertile

and capable of maintaining 500 men. Here Alexander was

entertained with sumptuous hospitality, and here he espoused

Roxana the daughter of Oxyartes. The height of the fortress

in Sogdiana is double the height of this. It was near these

places that he destroyed the city of the Branchidæ, whom

Xerxes settled there, and who had voluntarily accompanied him

from their own country. They had delivered up to the Persians the riches of the god at Didymi, and the treasure there

deposited. Alexander destroyed their city in abhorrence of

their treachery and sacrilege.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus calls the river, which runs through Sogdiana, Polytimetus, a name imposed by the Macedonians, as

they imposed many others, some of which were altogether

This river after watering the country flows through a desert

and sandy soil, and is absorbed in the sand, like the Arius,

which flows through the territory of the Arii.
</p><p>It is said that on digging near the river Ochus a spring of

oil was discovered. It is probable, that as certain nitrous, astringent, bituminous, and sulphurous fluids permeate the

earth, greasy fluids may be found, but the rarity of their occurrence makes their existence almost doubtful.



<pb n="255"/>



The course of the Ochus, according to some writers, is

through Bactriana, according to others parallel to it. Some

allege that, taking a more southerly direction, it is distinct

from the Oxus to its mouths, but that they both discharge

themselves (separately) into the Caspian in Hyrcania. Others

again say that it is distinct, at its commencement, from the

Oxus, but that it (afterwards) unites with the latter river,

having in many places a breadth of six or seven stadia.
</p><p>The Iaxartes is distinct from the Oxus from its commencement to its termination, and empties itself into the same sea.

Their mouths, according to Patrocles, are about 80 parasangs

distant from each other. The Persian parasang some say

contains 60, others 30 or 40, stadia.
</p><p>When I was sailing up the Nile, schœni of different measures were used in passing from one city to another, so that

the same number of schœni gave in some places a longer, in

others a shorter, length to the voyage. This mode of computation has been handed down from an early period, and is

continued to the present time.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In proceeding from Hyrcania towards the rising sun as

far as Sogdiana, the nations beyond (within?) the Taurus

were known first to the Persians, and afterwards to the Macedonians and Parthians. The nations lying in a straight line<note anchored="yes">i. e. on the same parallel.</note>

above these people are supposed to be Scythian, from their

resemblance to that nation. But we are not acquainted with

any expeditions which have been undertaken against them,

nor against the most northerly tribes of the nomades. Alexander proposed to conduct his army against them, when he

was in pursuit of Bessus and Spitamenes, but when Bessus was

taken prisoner, and Spitamenes put to death by the Barbarians, he desisted from executing his intention.

<p>It is said that the termination of Taurus, which is called

length towards the east, namely, 30,000 stadia.<note anchored="yes">I am unable to fix upon the author's train of thought. For immediately after having assigned to this portion of the Habitable Earth (whose

dimensions he wishes to determine) 30,000 stadia as its <q direct="unspecified">greatest length,</q>

and 10,000 stadia as its <q direct="unspecified">greatest breadth,</q> Strabo proceeds to prove

what he had just advanced respecting its greatest length. Then he

should, it seems, have endeavoured to furnish us, in the same manner,

with a proof that its greatest breadth is not more, as he says, than 10,000.

But in what follows there is nothing advanced on this point; all that he

says is to develope another proposition, viz. that the extent of the Hyrcanian—Caspian Sea is at the utmost 6000 stadia.

<p>The arguments contained in this paragraph on the whole appear to me

strange; they rest on a basis which it is difficult to comprehend; they

establish explicitly a proposition which disagrees with what the author

has said elsewhere, and lastly they present an enormous geographical

error.
</p><p>It will therefore be useful to the reader to explain, as far as I understand it the argument of our author.

</p>
<p>1.The exact form of the chlamys is unknown to us, but it was such, that

its greatest <emph rend="ital">breadth</emph> was to be found, it' not exactly in, at least near, the

middle of its <emph rend="ital">length.</emph> The Habitable Earth being of the form of a Chlamys, its greatest <emph rend="ital">breadth</emph> would be found about the middle of its

greatest <emph rend="ital">length.</emph>

</p>
<p>2. The greatest <emph rend="ital">length</emph> of the Habitable World being 70,000 stadia, its

greatest <emph rend="ital">breadth</emph> ought to be found at the distance of 35,000 stadia from

its eastern or western extremity, but this greatest <emph rend="ital">breadth</emph> is only 30,000

stadia, and it does not extend, on the north, beyond the parallel of the

mouth of the Hyrcanian Sea. B. ii.

</p>
<p>3. The meridian which passes at the distance of 35,000 stadia from the

eastern or western extremities of the Habitable Earth, is that which,

drawn from the mouth of the Hyrcanian Sea to the Northern Ocean, and

prolonged in another direction through the mouth of the Persian Gulf

to the sea called Erythræan, would pass through the city Artemita. Consequently it is on the meridian of Artemita that we must look for the

greatest breadth of the Habitable Earth.

</p>
<p>4. On this same meridian, we must reckon from the parallel of the

last habitable country in the south to the mouth of the Persian Gulf;

about 8000 stadia; then from the mouth of the Persian Gulf to Artemita,

8000 stadia; and from Artemita to the bottom of the Hyrcanian Sea,

8000 stadia: total 24,000 stadia.

</p>
<p>5. It being established that the breadth of the Habitable Earth is

30,000 stadia, and not to extend it northwards beyond the parallel of the

mouth of the Hyrcanian Sea, where it communicates with the Northern

Ocean, the distance to this point from the bottom of this same sea must.

be calculated at 6000 stadia. <emph rend="ital">Du Theil.</emph></p></note>



<pb n="257"/>



Again, since the breadth of the longest part of the habitable

earth, which has the shape of a chlamys, (or a military cloak,)

is about 30,000 stadia, this distance would be near the meridian line drawn through the Hyrcanian and the Persian

Seas, for the length of the habitable earth is 70,000 stadia.

If therefore from Hyrcania to Artemita<note anchored="yes">The modern Shirban is supposed to occupy its site.</note> in Babylonia are

8000 stadia according to Apollodorus of Artemita, and thence

to the mouth of the Persian Sea 8000, and again 8000, or a

little short of that number, to the places on the same parallel

with the extremities of Æthiopia, there would remain, to

complete the breadth as I have described it, of the habitable

earth, the number of stadia<note anchored="yes">Namely 6000. B. ii. c. i. § 17.</note> which I have mentioned, reckoning from the recess of the Hyrcanian Sea to its mouth. This

segment of the earth being truncated towards the eastern

parts, its figure would resemble a cook's knife, for the mountainous range being prolonged in a straight line, answers to

the edge, while the shape of the coast from the mouth of the

Hyrcanian Sea to Tamarus on the other side terminates in a

circular truncated line.

8. We must mention some of the extraordinary circum

stances which are related of those tribes which are perfectly

barbarous, living about Mount Caucasus, and the other mountainous districts.
</p><p>What Euripides expresses in the following lines is said to

be a custom among them;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">they lament the birth of the new-born on account of the many evils to

which they are exposed; but the dead, and one at rest from his troubles,

is carried forth from his home with joy and gratulation.</q></quote>


</p><p>Other tribes do not put to death even the greatest offenders,

but only banish them from their territories together with

their children; which is contrary to the custom of the Derbices, who punish even slight offences with death. The Derbices worship the earth. They neither sacrifice, nor eat the

female of any animal. Persons who attain the age of above

seventy years are put to death by them, and their nearest relations eat their flesh. Old women are strangled, and then

buried. Those who die under seventy years of age are not

eaten, but are only buried.
</p><p>The Siginni in general practise Persian customs. They

have small horses with shaggy hair, but which are not able

to carry a rider. Four of these horses are harnessed together,

driven by women, who are trained to this employment from

childhood. The best driver marries whom she pleases. Some,

they say, make it their study to appear with heads as long as

possible, and with foreheads projecting over their chins.
</p><p>The Tapyrii have a custom for the men to dress in black,

and wear their hair long, and the women to dress in white,

and wear their hair short. [They live between the Derbices

and Hyrcani.]<note anchored="yes">Introduced from the margin according to Groskurd's opinion, sup-

ported also by Kramer.</note> He who is esteemed the bravest marries

</p><p>The Caspii starve to death those who are above seventy

years old, by exposing them in a desert place. The exposed

are observed at a distance; if they are dragged from their

resting-place by birds, they are then pronounced happy; but

if by wild beasts, or dogs, less fortunate; but if by none of

these, ill-fated.

<p>SINCE the Taurus constitutes the northern parts of Asia,

which are called also the parts within the Taurus, I propose

to speak first of these.
</p><p>They are situated either entirely,—or chiefly, among the

mountains. Those to the east of the Caspian Gates admit of

a shorter description on account of the rude state of the people, nor is there much difference whether they are referred to

one climate<note anchored="yes">i. e. To northern or southern Asia. B. ii. c. I. § 20.</note> or the other. All the western countries furnish

abundant matter for description. We must therefore proceed

to the places situated near the Caspian Gates.
</p><p>Media lies towards the west, an extensive country, and

formerly powerful; it is situated in the middle of Taurus,

which here has many branches, and contains large valleys, as

is the case in Armenia.

<p>This mountain has its beginning in Caria and Lycia,

Here its height and breadth become greater, and its branches

more numerous. The Taurus extends the farthest distance

towards the south, where it separates Armenia from Mesopotamia.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>From the south flow both rivers, the Euphrates and

the Tigris, which encircle Mesopotamia, and approach close

to each other at Babylonia, and then discharge themselves

into the sea on the coast of Persia. The Euphrates is the

larger river, and traverses a greater tract of country with a tortuous course, it rises in the northern part of Taurus, and flows

toward the west through Armenia the Greater, as it is called,

to Armenia the Less, having the latter on the right and

Acilisene on the left hand. It then turns to the south, and

at its bend touches the boundaries of Cappadocia. It leaves

this and Commagene on the right hand; on the left Acilisene and Sophene,<note anchored="yes">Dzophok.</note> belonging to the Greater Armenia. It

proceeds onwards to Syria, and again makes another bend in

its way to Babylonia and the Persian Gulf.
</p><p>The Tigris takes its course from the southern part of the

same mountains to Seleucia,<note anchored="yes">Azerbaijan</note> approaches close to the Euphrates, with which it forms Mesopotamia. It then empties

itself into the same gulf.
</p><p>The sources of the Tigris and of the Euphrates are distant

from each other about 2500 stadia.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Towards the north there are many forks which branch

away from the Taurus. One of these is called Anti-Taurus,

for there the mountain had this name, and includes Sophene

in a valley situated between Anti-Taurus and the Taurus.
</p><p>Next to the Anti-Taurus on the other side of the Euphrates,

along the Lesser Armenia, there stretches towards the north

a large mountain with many branches, one of which is called

Paryadres,<note anchored="yes">The range overhanging Cerasus, now Kerasun.</note> another the Moschic mountains, and others by

other names. The Moschic mountains comprehend the whole

of Armenians as far as the Iberians and Albanians. Other

mountains again rise towards the east above the Caspian Sea,

and extend as far as Media the Greater, and the Atropatian-

<p>In our opinion these nations may be considered as situated to the north, since they are within the Taurus. But

Eratosthenes, having divided Asia into southern and northern

some as northern, others as southern, makes the Caspian

Gates the boundary of both climates. He might without any

impropriety have represented the more southern parts of the

Caspian Gates as in southern Asia, among which are Media

and Armenia, and the parts more to the north than the Caspian Gates in northern Asia, which might be the case according to different descriptions of the country. But perhaps

Eratosthenes did not attend to the circumstance, that there

<p>MEDIA is divided into two parts, one of which is called

the Greater Media. Its capital is Ecbatana,<note anchored="yes">Hamadan.</note> a large city

containing the royal seat of the Median empire. This palace

the Parthians continue to occupy even at this time. Here

their kings pass the summer, for the air of Media is cool.

Their winter residence is at Seleucia, on the Tigris, near

Babylon.
</p><p>The other division is Atropatian Media. It had its name

from Atropatus, a chief who prevented this country, which is

a part of Greater Media, from being subjected to the dominion of the Macedonians. When he was made king he

established the independence of this country; his successors

continue to the present day, and have at different times contracted marriages with the kings of Armenia, Syria, and

Parthia.

They have powerful neighbours in the Armenians and

Parthians, by whom they are frequently plundered; they resist however, and recover what has been taken away, as they

recovered Symbace<note anchored="yes">It is uncertain whether this is a place, or a district.</note> from the Armenians, who were defeated

<p>The summer palace is at Gazaka, situated in a plain;

the winter palace<note anchored="yes">Adopting Groskurd's emendation <foreign lang="greek">xeima/dian.</foreign></note> is in Vera, a strong fortress which Antony

besieged in his expedition against the Parthians. The last

is distant from the Araxes, which separates Armenia and

Atropatene, 2400 stadia, according to Dellius, the friend of

Antony, who wrote an account of the expedition of Antony

against the Parthians, which he himself accompanied, and in

which he held a command.
</p><p>The other parts of this country are fertile, but that towards

the north is mountainous, rugged, and cold, the abode of the

mountain tribes of Cadusii Amardi, Tapyri, Curtii, and other

similar nations, who are migratory, and robbers. These people are scattered over the Zagrus and Niphates. TheCurtii

<p>The Cadusii have an army of foot soldiers not inferior

in number to that of the Ariani. They are very expert in

throwing the javelin. In the rocky places the soldiers engage in battle on foot, instead of on their horses. The expedition of Antony was harassing to the army, not by the

nature of the country, but by the conduct of their guide,

Artavasdes, king of the Armenii, whom Antony rashly made

his adviser, and master of his intentions respecting the war,

when at the same time that prince was contriving a plan for

his destruction. Antony punished Artavasdes, but too late;

the latter had been the cause of many calamities to the

Romans, in conjunction with another person; he made the

march from the Zeugma on the Euphrates to the borders of

Atropatene to exceed 8000 stadia, or double the distance of

the direct course, [by leading the army] over mountains, and

places where there were no roads, and by a circuitous route.

5. The Greater Media anciently governed the whole of

Asia, after the overthrow of the Syrian empire: but afterwards, in the time of Astyages, the Medes were deprived of

this extensive sovereignty by Cyrus and the Persians, yet

they retained much of their ancient importance. Ecbatana

was the winter (royal?) residence<note anchored="yes">In the text <foreign lang="greek">xeima/dwn.</foreign> Kramer suggests the reading <foreign lang="greek">basi/leion.</foreign></note> of the Persian kings, as it

was of the Macedonian princes, who overthrew the Persian

empire, and got possession of Syria. It still continues to

serve the same purpose, and affords security to the kings of

Parthia.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Media is bounded on the east by Parthia, and by the

mountains of the Cossæi, a predatory tribe. They once furnished the Elymæi, whose allies they were in the war against

the Susii and Babylonians, with 13,000 archers. Nearchus

says that there were four robber tribes; the Mardi, who were

contiguous to the Persians; the Uxii and Elymæi, who were

on the borders of the Persians and Susii; and the Cossæi, on

those of the Medes; that all of them exacted tribute from the

kings; that the Cossæi received presents, when the king, having passed his summer at Ecbatana went down to Babylonia;

that Alexander attacked them in the winter time, and repressed their excessive insolence. Media is bounded on the

east by these nations, and by the Parætaceni, who are contiguous to the Persians, and are mountaineers, and robbers;

on the north by the Cadusii, who live above the Hyrcanian

Sea, and by other nations, whom we have just enumerated;

on the south by the Apolloniatis, which the ancients called

Sitacene, and by the Zagrus, along which lies Massabatica,

which belongs to Media, but according to others, to Elymæa;

on the west by the Atropatii, and by some tribes of the Armenians.
</p><p>There are also Grecian cities in Media, founded by Macedonians, as Laodiceia, Apameia, Heracleia near Rhagæ, and

Rhaga itself, founded by Nicator, who called it Europus, and

the Parthians Arsacia, situated about 500 stadia to the south

of the Caspian Gates, according to Apollodorus of Artemita.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The greater part of Media consists of high ground, and is

cold; such are the mountains above Ecbatana, and the places

about Rhagæ and the Caspian Gates, and the northern parts

in general extending thence as far as Matiane and Armenia.

The country below the Caspian Gates consists of flat grounds

and valleys. It is very fertile, and produces everything except

the olive, or if it grows anywhere it does not yield oil, and is

dry. The country is peculiarly adapted, as well as Armenia,

for breeding horses. There is a meadow tract called Hippobotus, which is traversed by travellers on their way from

Persia and Babylonia to the Caspian Gates. Here, it is said,

fifty thousand mares were pastured in the time of the Persians, and were the king's stud. The Nesæan horses, the

best and largest in the king's province, were of this breed,

according to some writers, but according to others they came

from Armenia. Their shape is peculiar, as is that of the Parthian horses, compared with those of Greece and others in our

country.
</p><p>The herbage which constitutes the chief food of the horses

we call peculiarly by the name of Medic, from its growing in

Media in great abundance. The country produces Silphium,<note anchored="yes">Lucerne?</note>

from which is obtained the Medic juice, much inferior to the

Cyrenaic, but sometimes it excels the latter, which may be

accounted for by the difference of places, or from a change

the plant may undergo, or from the mode of extracting and

preparing the juice so as to continue good when laid by

for use.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such then is the nature of the country with respect to

magnitude; its length and breadth are nearly equal. The

greatest breadth (length?)<note anchored="yes">Groskurd proposes <q direct="unspecified">length.</q></note> however seems to be that reckoned

from the pass across the Zagrus, which is called the Median

Gate, to the Caspian Gates, through the country of Sigriana,

4100 stadia.
</p><p>The account of the tribute paid agrees with the extent and

wealth of the country. Cappadocia paid to the Persians

yearly, in addition to a tribute in silver, <date value="1500">1500</date> horses, 2000

mules, and 50,000 sheep, and the Medes contributed nearly

double this amount.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Many of their customs are the same as those of the Armenians, from the similarity of the countries which they inhabit. The Medes however were the first to communicate

them to the Armenians, and still before that time to the Persians, who were their masters, and successors in the empire

of Asia.

The Persian stole, as it is now called, the pursuit of archery

and horsemanship, the court paid to their kings, their attire,

and veneration fitting for gods paid by the subjects to the

prince,—these the Persians derived from the Medes. That

this is the fact appears chiefly from their dress. A tiara, a

citaris, a hat,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">pi=los.</foreign></note> tunics with sleeves reaching to the hands, and

trowsers, are proper to be worn in cold and northerly places,

such as those in Media, but they are not by any means adapted to inhabitants of the south. The Persians had their

principal settlements on the Gulf of Persia, being situated

more to the south than the Babylonians and the Susii. But

after the overthrow of the Medes they gained possession of

some tracts of country contiguous to Media. The custom

however of the vanquished appeared to the conquerors to be

so noble, and appropriate to royal state, that instead of nakedness or scanty clothing, they endured the use of the feminine

stole, and were entirely covered with dress to the feet.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some writers say that Medeia, when with Jason she

ruled in these countries, introduced this kind of dress, and

concealed her countenance as often as she appeared in public

in place of the king; that the memorials of Jason are, the

Jasonian heroa,<note anchored="yes">Heroic monuments of Jason.</note> held in great reverence by the Barbarians,

(besides a great mountain above the Caspian Gates on the

left hand, called Jasonium,) and that the memorials of Medeia

are the kind of dress, and the name of the country. Medus, her

son, is said to have been her successor in the kingdom, and

the country to have been called after his name. In agreement

with this are the Jasonia in Armenia, the name of the country, and many other circumstances which we shall mention.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is a Median custom to elect the bravest person as

king, but this does not generally prevail, being confined to

the mountain tribes. The custom for the kings to have many

wives is more general, it is found among all the mountaineers

also, but they are not permitted to have less than five. In the

same manner the women think it honourable for husbands to

have as many wives as possible, and esteem it a misfortune if

they have less than five.
</p><p>While the rest of Media is very fertile, the northern and

mountainous part is barren. The people subsist upon the

produce of trees. They make cakes of apples, sliced and



<pb n="267"/>



dried, and bread of roasted almonds; they express a wine

from some kind of roots. They eat the flesh of wild animals,

and do not breed any tame animals. So much then respect-

ing the Medes. As to the laws and customs in common use

throughout the whole of Media, as they are the same as those

of the Persians in consequence of the establishment of the

Persian empire, I shall speak of them when I give an account of the latter nation.

<p>THE southern parts of Armenia lie in front of the Taurus, which separates Armenia from the whole of the country

situated between the Euphrates and the Tigris, and which is

called Mesopotamia. The eastern parts are contiguous to

the Greater Media, and to Atropatene. To the north are the

range of the mountains of Parachoathras lying above the

Caspian Sea, the Albanians, Iberians, and the Caucasus. The

Caucasus encircles these nations, and approaches close to the

Armenians, the Moschic and Colchic mountains, and extends as far as the country of the people called Tibareni. On

are very productive, as the Araxenian plain, through which

the river Araxes flows to the extremities of Albania, and

empties itself into the Caspian Sea. Next is Sacasene,

which borders upon Albania, and the river Cyrus; then

Gogarene. All this district abounds with products of the soil,

cultivated fruit trees and evergreens. It bears also the olive.
</p><p>There is Phauene, (Phanenæ, Phasiana?) a province of Armenia, Comisene, and Orchistene, which furnishes large bodies of cavalry.

Chorzene<note anchored="yes">Kars is the capital of this country.</note> and Cambysene are the most northerly countries,

and particularly subject to falls of snow. They are contiguous to the Caucasian mountains, to Iberia, and Colchis.

Here, they say, on the passes over mountains, it frequently

happens that whole companies of persons have been overwhelmed in violent snow-storms. Travellers are provided

against such dangerous accidents with poles, which they force

upwards to the surface of the snow, for the purpose of breathing, and of signifying their situation to other travellers who

may come that way, so that they may receive assistance, be

extricated, and so escape alive.
</p><p>They say that hollow masses are consolidated in the snow,

which contain good water, enveloped as in a coat; that animals are bred in the snow, which Apollonides call scoleces,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">skw/lhks</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">qo|i=pas,</foreign> species of worms.

tain good water, which is obtained by breaking open their

coats or coverings. The generation of these animals is supposed to be similar to that of the gnats, (or mosquitos,) from

flames, and the sparks in mines.

<p>According to historians, Armenia, which was formerly

a small country, was enlarged by Artaxias and Zariadris,

who had been generals of Antiochus the Great, and at last,

after his overthrow, when they became kings, (the former

of Sophene, Acisene, (Amphissene?) Odomantis, and some

other places, the latter of the country about Artaxata,) they

simultaneously aggrandized themselves, by taking away portions of the territory of the surrounding nations: from the

Medes they took the Caspiana, Phaunitis, and Basoropeda;

from the Iberians, the country at the foot of the Paryadres, the Chorzene, and Gogarene, which is on the other

side of the Cyrus; from the Chalybes, and the Mosynœci,

Carenitis and Xerxene, which border upon the Lesser Armenia, or are even parts of it; from the Cataones, Acilisene,<note anchored="yes">Melitene. Groskurd.</note>

and the country about the Anti-Taurus; from the Syrians,

both situated on the Araxes; Arxata on the confines of

Atropatia, and Artaxata near the Araxenian plain; it is

well inhabited, and the seat of the kings of the country. It

lies upon a peninsular elbow of land; the river encircles the

walls except at the isthmus, which is enclosed by a ditch

and rampart.
</p><p>Not far from the city are the treasure-storehouses of Tigranes and Artavasdes, the strong fortresses Babyrsa, and

Olane. There were others also upon the Euphrates. Ador,

(Addon?) the governor of the fortress, occasioned the revolt

of Artageræ, but the generals of Cæsar retook it after a

long siege, and destroyed the walls.

<p>There are many rivers in the country. The most celebrated are the Phasis and Lycus; they empty themselves

into the Euxine; (Eratosthenes instead of the Lycus mentions the Thermodon, but erroneously;) the Cyrus and the

Araxes into the Caspian, and the Euphrates and the Tigris

into the Persian Gulf.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are also large lakes in Armenia; one the Mantiane,<note anchored="yes">We should read probably Matiane. The meaning of the word proposed by Strabo may easily be proved to be incorrect, by reference to

the Armenian language, in which no such word is to be found bearing

this sense. As <emph rend="ital">Kapoit</emph> in the Armenian tongue signifies <q direct="unspecified">blue,</q> this explanation of Strabo's appears to refer to the lake Spauta or Kapauta,

its stream unmixed with the water of the lake, whence it has

its name, for the Medes call an arrow, Tigris. This river

contains fish of various kinds, but the lake one kind only.

At the extremity of the lake the river falls into a deep cavity

in the earth. After pursuing a long course under-ground, it

re-appears in the Chalonitis; thence it goes to Opis, and to

the wall of Semiramis, as it is called, leaving the Gordyæi<note anchored="yes">The Kurds.</note>

<p>Of the riches and power of this country, this is no

slight proof, that when Pompey imposed upon Tigranes, the

father of Artavasdes, the payment of 6000 talents of silver, he

immediately distributed the money among the Roman army,

to each soldier 50 drachmæ, 1000 to a centurion, and a talent

<p>Theophanes represents this as the size of the country;

its breadth to be 100 schœni, and its length double this number, reckoning the schœnus at 40 stadia; but this computation exceeds the truth. It is nearer the truth to take the



<pb n="272"/>



length as he has given it, and the breadth at one half, or a

little more.
</p><p>Such then is the nature of the country of Armenia, and its

power.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There exists an ancient account of the origin of this

nation to the following effect. Armenus of Armenium, a Thessalian city, which lies between Pheræ and Larisa on the lake

Bœbe, accompanied Jason, as we have already said, in his expedition into Armenia, and from Armenus the country had

its name, according to Cyrsilus the Pharsalian and Medius

the Larisæan, persons who had accompanied the army of

Alexander. Some of the followers of Armenus settled in

Acilisene, which was formerly subject to the Sopheni; others

in the Syspiritis, and spread as far as Calachene and Adiabene, beyond the borders of Armenia.
</p><p>The dress of the Armenian people is said to be of Thessalian origin; such are the long tunics, which in tragedies are called Thessalian; they are fastened about the body with a girdle,

and with a clasp on the shoulder. The tragedians, for they

required some additional decoration of this kind, imitate the

Thessalians in their attire. The Thessalians in particular,

from wearing a long dress, (probably because they inhabit the

most northerly and the coldest country in all Greece,) afforded the most appropriate subject of imitation to actors for their

theatrical representations. The passion for riding and the

care of horses characterize the Thessalians, and are common

to Armenians and Medes.
</p><p>The Jasonia are evidence of the expedition of Jason: some

of these memorials the sovereigns of the country restored, as

Parmenio restored the temple of Jason at Abdera.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is supposed that Armenus and his companions called

the Araxes by this name on account of its resemblance to

the Peneius, for the Peneius had the name of Araxes from

bursting through Tempe, and rending (<foreign lang="greek">a)pao|a/cai</foreign>) Ossa from

Olympus. The Araxes also in Armenia, descending from the

mountains, is said to have spread itself in ancient times, and

to have overflowed the plains, like a sea, having no outlet;

that Jason, in imitation of what is to be seen at Tempe, made

the opening through which the water at present precipitates

itself into the Caspian Sea; that upon this the Araxenian



<pb n="273"/>



plain, through which the river flows to the cataract, became

uncovered. This story which is told of the river Araxes

contains some probability; that of Herodotus<note anchored="yes">Herod. i. 202.</note> none whatever.

For he says that, after flowing out of the country of the Matiani, it is divided into forty rivers, and separates the Scythians

from the Bactrians. Callisthenes has followed Herodotus.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some tribes of Ænianes are mentioned, some of whom

settled in Vitia, others above the Armenians beyond the Abus

and the Nibarus. These latter are branches of Taurus; the

Abus is near the road which leads to Ecbatana by the temple

of Baris (Zaris?).
</p><p>Some tribes of Thracians, surnamed Saraparæ, or decapitators, are said to live above Armenia, near the Gouranii and

Medes. They are a savage people, intractable mountaineers,

and scalp and decapitate strangers; for such is the meaning

of the term Saraparæ.
</p><p>I have spoken of Medeia in the account of Media, and it is

conjectured from all the circumstances that the Medes and

Armenians are allied in some way to the Thessalians, descended from Jason and Medeia.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This is the ancient account, but the more recent, anc

extending from the time of the Persians to our own age, may

be given summarily, and in part only (as follows); Persians

and Macedonians gained possession of Armenia, next those

who were masters of Syria and Media. The last was Orontes,

a descendant of Hydarnes, one of the seven Persians: it was

then divided into two portions by Artaxias and Zariadris,

generals of Antiochus the Great, who made war against the

Romans. These were governors by permission of the king,

but upon his overthrow they attached themselves to the Romans, were declared independent, and had the title of kings.

Tigranes was a descendant of Artaxias, and had Armenia,

properly so called. This country was contiguous to Media,

to the Albani, and to the Iberes, and extended as far as Colchis, and Cappadocia upon the Euxine.
</p><p>Artanes the Sophenian was the descendant of Zariadris, and had the southern parts of Armenia, which verge

rather to the west. He was defeated by Tigranes, who became master of the whole country. He had experienced

many vicissitudes of fortune. At first he had served as a



<pb n="274"/>



hostage among the Parthians; then by their means he return

ed to his country, in compensation for which service they obtained seventy valleys in Armenia. When he acquired power,

he recovered these valleys, and devastated the country of the

Parthians, the territory about Ninus, and that about Arbela.<note anchored="yes">Arbil.</note>

He subjected to his authority the Atropatenians, and the

Gordyæans; by force of arms he obtained possession also of

the rest of Mesopotamia, and, after crossing the Euphrates, of

Syria and Phœnicia. Having attained this height of prosperity, he even founded near Iberia,<note anchored="yes">That this is an error is manifest. Falconer proposes Armenia; Groskurd, Assyria; but what name is to be supplied is altogether uncertain.

The name of the city is also wanting, according to Kramer, who proposes

Nisibis.</note> between this country

and the Zeugma on the Euphrates, a city, which he named

Tigranocerta, and collected inhabitants out of twelve Grecian

cities, which he had depopulated. But Lucullus, who had

commanded in the war against Mithridates, surprised him,

thus engaged, and dismissed the inhabitants to their respective homes. The buildings which were half finished he demolished, and left a small village remaining. He drove Tigranes both out of Syria and Phœnicia.
</p><p>Artavasdes, his successor, prospered as long as he continued a friend of the Romans. But having betrayed Antony to the Parthians in the war with that people, he suffered

punishment for his treachery. He was carried in chains to

Alexandria, by order of Antony, led in procession through

the city, and kept in prison for a time. On the breaking

out of the Actiac war he was then put to death. Many

kings reigned after Artavasdes, who were dependent upon

Cæsar and the Romans. The country is still governed in

the same manner.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Both the Medes and Armenians have adopted all the

sacred rites of the Persians, but the Armenians pay particu-

lar reverence to Anaitis, and have built temples to her honour in several places, especially in Acilisene. They dedicate

there to her service male and female slaves; in this there

is nothing remarkable, but it is surprising that persons of the

highest rank in the nation consecrate their virgin daughters

to the goddess. It is customary for these women, after being



<pb n="275"/>



prostituted a long period at the temple of Anaitis, to be dis-

posed of in marriage, no one disdaining a connexion with

such persons. Herodotus mentions something similar respecting the Lydian women, all of whom prostitute themselves. But they treat their paramours with much kindness,

they entertain them hospitably, and frequently make a return

of more presents than they receive, being amply supplied

with means derived from their wealthy connexions. They

do not admit into their dwellings accidental strangers, but

prefer those of a rank equal to their own.

customs, it is surprising how entirely the characteristic marks

of a foreign nation have disappeared, yet they were distinct

nations; Ariarathes, the first who bore the title of king of

the Cappadocians, annexed the Cataonians to Cappadocia.

<p>This country composes the isthmus, as it were, of a

Herodotus calls him king of the nations on this side the river

Halys. But writers of the present time give the name of

Asia, which is the appellation of the whole continent, to the

country within the Taurus.

near the Taurus, or Cappadocia the Great; the other they

called Pontus, but according to other writers, Cappadocia on

Pontus.
</p><p>We are ignorant at present how Cappadocia the Great

was at first distributed; upon the death of Archelaus the

king, Cæsar and the senate decreed that it should be a Roman province. But when the country was divided in the

time of Archelaus and of preceding kings into ten provinces, they reckoned five near the Taurus, Melitene, Cataonia,

Cilicia, Tyanitis, and Garsauritis; the remaining five were

Laviansene, Sargarausene, Saravene, Chamanene, Morimene.

The Romans afterwards assigned to the predecessors of Archelaus an eleventh province formed out of Cilicia, consisting of the country about Castabala and Cybistra,<note anchored="yes">Eregli near the lake Al-gol.</note> extending

to Derbe, belonging to Antipater, the robber. Cilicia Trachea about Elæussa was assigned to Archelaus, and all the

<p>MELITENE resembles Commagene, for the whole of it is

planted with fruit-trees, and is the only part of all Cappadocia

which is planted in this manner. It produces oil, and the

wine Monarites, which vies with the wines of Greece. It is

situated opposite to Sophene, having the river Euphrates

flowing between it and Commagene, which borders upon it.

n the country on the other side of the river is Tomisa, a

considerable fortress of the Cappadocians. It was sold to the

prince of Sophene for a hundred talents. Lucullus presented

it afterwards as a reward of valour to the Cappadocian prince

for his services in the war against Mithridates.

<p>Cataonia is a plain, wide and hollow,<note anchored="yes">That is, surrounded by mountains, as below.</note> and produces

the Syrian sea towards the west and south. In this intervening

space it comprises the whole of the gulf of Issus, and the

plains of the Cilicians which lie towards the Taurus. But

the Anti-Taurus inclines to the north, and a little also to the

east, and then terminates in the interior of the country.

which they call Ma. It is a considerable city. It contains

a very great multitude of persons who at times are actuated

by divine impulse, and of servants of the temple. It is in-

habited by Cataonians, who are chiefly under the command of

the priest, but in other respects subject to the king. The

former presides over the temple, and has authority over the

servants belonging to it, who, at the time that I was there,

exceeded in number six thousand persons, including men and

women. A large tract of land adjoins the temple, the revenue

of which the priest enjoys. He is second in rank in Cappadocia after the king, and, in general, the priests are descended

from the same family as the kings. Orestes, when he came

hither with his sister Iphigenia from Tauric Scythia,<note anchored="yes">The Crimea.</note> is

thought to have introduced the sacred rites performed in

honour of Diana Tauropolus, and to have deposited here the

tresses (Coman, <foreign lang="greek">ko/mhn.</foreign>) of mourning, from which the city had

the name of Comana.
</p><p>The river Sarus flows through this city, and passes out

through the valleys of the Taurus to the plains of Cilicia, and

to the sea lying below them.

<p>The Pyramus,<note anchored="yes">Dschehan-Tschai.</note> which has its source in the middle of the

plain, is navigable throughout Cataonia. There is a large subterraneous channel, through which the water flows underground

to a great distance, and then may be seen springing up again to

the surface. If an arrow is let down into the pit from above, the

resistance of the water is so great that it is scarcely immersed.

Although it pursues its course with great<note anchored="yes">The text is here corrupt.</note> depth and breadth,

it undergoes an extraordinary contraction of its size by the

time it has reached the Taurus. There is also an extraordinary fissure in the mountain, through which the stream is

carried. For, as in rocks which have burst and split in two



<pb n="280"/>



parts, the projections in one correspond so exactly with the

follows in the other that they might even be fitted together,

so here I have seen the rocks at the distance of two or three

plethra, overhanging the river on each side, and nearly reaching to the summit of the mountain, with hollows on one side

answering to projections on the other. The bed between (the

mountains) is entirely rock; it has a deep and very narrow

fissure through the middle, so that a dog and a hare might

leap across it. This is the channel of the river; it is full to

the margin, and in breadth resembles a canal.<note anchored="yes">The reading is doubtful.</note> But on account of the winding of its course, the great contraction of

the stream, and the depth of the ravine, a noise, like that of

thunder, strikes at a distance on the ears of those who approach it. In passing out through the mountains, it brings

down from Cataonia, and from the Cilician plains, so great a

quantity of alluvial soil to the sea, that an oracle to the following effect is reported to have been uttered respecting it:

Perasia, where, it is said, the priestesses walk with naked

</p><p>In the Cilician province, as it is called, is Mazaca,<note anchored="yes">Kaisarieh.</note> the

they are not many) say that both the Euxine and the sea of

Issus may be seen from thence in clear weather.
</p><p>Mazaca is not adapted in other respects by nature for the

settlement of a city, for it is without water, and unfortified.

Through the neglect of the governors, it is without walls, perhaps intentionally, lest, trusting to the wall as to a fortification,

the inhabitants of a plain, which has hills situated above it, and

not exposed to the attacks of missile weapons, should addict

themselves to robbery. The country about, although it consists of plains, is entirely barren and uncultivated, for the soil

is sandy, and rocky underneath. At a little distance further

there are burning plains, and pits full of fire to an extent of

many stadia, so that the necessaries of life are brought from a

distance. What seems to be a peculiar advantage (abundance

of wood) is a source of danger. For though nearly the whole

of Cappadocia is without timber, the Argæus is surrounded

by a forest, so that wood may be procured near at hand, yet

even the region lying below the forest contains fire in many

parts, and springs of cold water; but as neither the fire nor

the water break out upon the surface, the greatest part of the

country is covered with herbage. In some parts the bottom

is marshy, and flames burst out from the ground by night.

Those acquainted with the country collect wood with caution;

but there is danger to others, and particularly to cattle, which

fall into these hidden pits of fire.

<p>In the plain in front of the city, and about 40 stadia

inhabitants, because it does not flow from an elevated situation.

It spreads abroad in marshes and lakes, and in the summertime corrupts the air round the city. A valuable stone

quarry is rendered almost useless by it. For there are extensive beds of stone, from which the Mazaceni obtain an

abundant supply of materials for building, but the slabs, being covered with water, are not easily detached by the workmen. These are the marshes which in every part are subject

to take fire.
</p><p>Ariarathes the king filled in some narrow channels by

which the Melas entered the Halys, and converted the neighbouring plain into a wide lake. There he selected some small

islands like the Cyclades, where he passed his time in boyish

and frivolous diversions. The barrier, however, was broken

down all at once, and the waters again flowed abroad and

swelled the Halys, which swept away a large part of the Cappadocian territory, and destroyed many buildings and plantations; it also damaged a considerable part of the country of

the Galatians, who occupy Phrygia. In compensation for

this injury he paid a fine of three hundred talents to the inhabitants, who had referred the matter to the decision of the

Romans. The same was the case at Herpa; for he there

obstructed the stream of the Carmalas, and, on the bursting

of the dyke, the water damaged some of the places in the

Cilician territories about Mallus; he was obliged to make

compensation to those who had sustained injury.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Although the territory of the Mazaceni is destitute in

many respects of natural advantages, it seems to have been

preferred by the kings as a place of residence, because it was

nearest the centre of those districts which supplied timber,

stone for building, and fodder, of which a very large quantity

was required for the subsistence of their cattle. Their city

was almost a camp. The security of their persons and treasure<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ao|hma/twn,</foreign> the reading proposed by Kramer.</note> depended upon the protection afforded by numerous

fortresses, some of which belonged to the king, others to their

friends.

a Nomōdist, (or Chanter of the Laws,) who, like the Jurisconsults of the Romans, is the interpreter of their laws. Tigranes the Armenian, when he overran Cappadocia, treated

them with great severity. He forced them to abandon their

settlements, and go into Mesopotamia; they peopled Tigranocerta, chiefly by their numbers. Afterwards, upon the capture of Tigranocerta, those who were able returned to their

own country.

<p>The breadth of the country from Pontus to the Taurus is

about <date value="1800">1800</date> stadia; the length from Lycaonia and Phrygia, as

far as the Euphrates to the east, and Armenia, is about 3000

stadia. The soil is fertile, and abounds with fruits of the

earth, particularly corn, and with cattle of all kinds. Although

it lies more to the south than Pontus, it is colder. Bagadania,

although a plain country, and situated more towards the south

than any district in Cappadocia, (for it lies at the foot of the

Taurus,) produces scarcely any fruit-bearing trees. It affords

pasture for wild asses, as does a large portion of the other

parts of the country, particularly that about Garsauira, Lycaonia, and Morimene.
</p><p>In Cappadocia is found the red earth called the Sinopic,

which is better than that of any other country. The Spanish

only can rival it. It had the name of Sinopic, because the

merchants used to bring it down from Sinope, before the traffic

of the Ephesians extended as far as the people of Cappadocia.

It is said that even plates of crystal and of the onyx stone were

discovered by the miners of Archelaus near the country of the

Galatians. There was a place where was found a white stone

of the colour of ivory in pieces of the size of small whetstones,

from which were made handles for small swords. Another

place produced large masses of transparent stone for windows,

which were exported.

<p>When the Romans, after the defeat of Antiochus, first

governed Asia, they made treaties of friendship and alliance

both with the nations and with the kings. This honour was

conferred upon the other kings separately and independently,

but upon the king of Cappadocia in common with the nation.

On the extinction of the royal race, the Romans admitted the

independence of the Cappadocians according to the treaty of

friendship and alliance which they had made with the nation.

The deputies excused themselves from accepting the liberty

which was offered to them, declaring that they were unable to

bear it, and requested that a king might be appointed. The

Romans were surprised that any people should be unwilling

to enjoy liberty, but permitted<note anchored="yes">Du Theil quotes Justin, 38, c. 2, where it is stated that Ariobarzanes

Armenia. Pompey, after the overthrow of Mithridates, found

the kingdom comprised within these boundaries. He distributed the country towards Armenia and towards Colchis

among the princes who had assisted him in the war; the remainder he divided into eleven governments, and annexed

them to Bithynia, so that out of both there was formed one

province. Some people in the inland parts he subjected to the

kings descended from Pylæmenes, in the same manner as he

delivered over the Galatians to be governed by tetrarchs of

that nation.
</p><p>In later times the Roman emperors made different divisions

these the first tract of country belongs to the Bithynians, the

next to the Mariandyni, or, as some say, to the Caucones; next

is that of the Paphlagonians, extending to the Halys, then that

of the Cappadocians near the Pontus, and then a district

reaching to Colchis.<note anchored="yes">The Bithynians, or rather Thyni, occupied the sea-coast from the

Bosphorus to the river Sagaris (Sakaria). The Mariandyni extended to

Heracleia (Erekli); and the Caucones to the east as far as the river

Parthenius (Tschati-su).</note> All this country has the name of the

Dexia (or right) of Pontus. This whole coast, from Colchis to Heracleia, was subject to Mithridates Eupator. But

the parts on the other side to the mouth of the Euxine and

Chalcedon, remained under the government of the king of

Bithynia. After the overthrow of the kings the Romans preserved the same boundaries of the kingdoms; Heracleia was

annexed to Pontus, and the country beyond assigned to the

Bithynians.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged by writers, that the Bithynians, who were formerly Mysians, received this name from

Bithynians and Thyni, Thracian people, who came and settled

among them. They advance as a proof of their statement,

first as regards the Bithynians, that there still exists in Thrace

a people called Bithynians, and then, as regards the Thyni,

that the sea-shore, near Apollonia<note anchored="yes">Sizeboli, south of the Gulf of Burgas.</note> and Salmydessus,<note anchored="yes">Midjeh.</note> is called

Thynias. The Bebryces, who preceded them as settlers in

Mysia, were, as I conjecture, Thracians. We have said<note anchored="yes">B. vii. c. iii. § 2.</note> that

the Mysians themselves were a colony of those Thracians who

are now called Mæsi.
</p><p>Such is the account given of these people.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is not, however, the same agreement among writers

with regard to the Mariandyni, and the Caucones. For they

say that Heracleia is situated among the Mariandyni, and was

founded by Milesians.<note anchored="yes">Kramer is of opinion that Strabo is mistaken in this account of the

origin of Heracleia.</note> But who they are, or whence they

came, nothing is said. There is no difference in language,

nor any other apparent national distinction between them and

the Bithynians, whom they resemble in all respects. It is

probable therefore the Mariandyni were a Thracian tribe.
</p><p>Theopompus says that Mariandynus, who governed a part

of Paphlagonia, which was subject to many masters, invaded

and obtained possession of the country of the Bebryces, and

that he gave his own name to the territory which he had before occupied. It is also said that the Milesians who first

founded Heracleia, compelled the Mariandyni, the former possessors of the place, to serve as Helots, and even sold them,

but not beyond the boundaries of their country. For they

were sold on the same conditions as the class of persons called

ten schœni from Amastris. But Zenodotus writes the verse

in this manner, <q direct="unspecified">From Heneta,</q> and says that it means the

present Amisus. According to others it was a tribe bordering upon the Cappadocians, which engaged in an expedition

with the Cimmerians, and were afterwards driven away into

Adria. But the account most generally received is, that the

Heneti were the most considerable tribe of the Paphlagonians;

that Pylæmenes was descended from it; that a large body of

this people accompanied him to the Trojan war; that when

they had lost their leader they passed over to Thrace upon

the capture of Troy; and in the course of their wanderings

arrived at the present Henetic territory.

divided into two parts, the inland, and the maritime, extending from the Halys as far as Bithynia. Mithridates Eupator

possessed the maritime part as far as Heracleia, and of the

inland country he had the district nearest to Heracleia, some

parts of which extended even beyond the Halys. These are

also the limits of the Roman province of Pontus. The remainder was subject to chiefs, even after the overthrow of

a long period, it did not preserve its liberty to the last, but

then to his successors, to the time when the Romans put an

end to the power of Mithridates Eupator. This prince was

born and brought up in this city, on which he conferred distinguished honour, and made it a capital of the kingdom. It

has received advantages from nature which have been improved by art. It is built upon the neck of a peninsula; on

each side of the isthmus are harbours, stations for vessels, and

fisheries worthy of admiration for the capture of the pelamydes. Of these fisheries we have said<note anchored="yes">B. vii. c. vi. § 2.</note> that the people of

Sinope have the second, and the Byzantines the third, in

point of excellence.
</p><p>The peninsula projects in a circular form; the shores are

surrounded by a chain of rocks, and in some parts there are

cavities, like rocky pits, which are called Chœnicides. These

are filled when the sea is high. For the above reason, the

place is not easily approached; besides which, along the whole

surface of rock the road is covered with sharp-pointed stones,

and persons cannot walk upon it with naked feet. The lands

in the higher parts and above the city have a good soil, and

are adorned with fields dressed as gardens, and this is the case

in a still greater degree in the suburbs. The city itself is

well secured with walls, and magnificently ornamented with

a gymnasium, forum, and porticos. Notwithstanding these

advantages for defence, it was twice taken; first by Pharnaces, who attacked it unexpectedly; afterwards by Lucullus,

<p>Next to the mouth of the Halys is Gadilónitis, extending

as far as the Saramene; it is a fertile country, wholly consisting of plains, and produces every kind of fruit. It affords

also pasture for flocks of sheep which are covered<note anchored="yes">B. iv. c. iv. § 3.</note> with skins,

which are rare in other parts.
</p><p>The Amiseni possess one part of this country. Pompey

gave another to Deïotarus, as well as the tract about Pharnacia and Trapezus as far as Colchis and the Lesser Armenia.

Pompey appointed him king of these people and countries: he

had already inherited the tetrarchy of the Galatians, called the

Tolistobogii. Upon his death various persons succeeded to

the different parts of his kingdom.

<p>Next to Gadilon<note anchored="yes">Wesir Kopti.</note> are the Saramene,<note anchored="yes">The district between the Halys (Kizil Irmak) and the Iris (Jeschil

</p><p>This city also was in the possession of the kings. Mithridates Eupator embellished it with temples, and added a part

to it. Lucullus, and afterwards Pharnaces, who came from

across the Bosporus, besieged it. Antony surrendered it to

the kings of Pontus, after it had been declared free by Divus

Cæsar. Then the Tyrant Strato oppressed the inhabitants,

who again recovered their liberty under Cæsar Augustus after

the battle of Actium. They are now in a prosperous condition. Among other fertile spots is Themiscyra,<note anchored="yes">The tract of country between the Iris and the Thermodon.</note> the abode of

the Amazons, and Sidene.<note anchored="yes">The territory on the east of the Thermodon (Termeh).</note>



<pb n="295"/>



15. Themiscyra is a plain, partly washed by the sea, and

distant about 60 stadia from the city (Amisus); and partly

situated at the foot of a mountainous country, which is well

wooded, and intersected with rivers, which have their source

among the mountains. A river, named Thermodon, which

receives the water of all these rivers traverses the plain.
</p><p>Another river very similar to this, of the name of Iris,<note anchored="yes">Jeschil Irmak.</note>

flowing from a place called Phanarœa,<note anchored="yes">Tasch Owa.</note> traverses the same plain.

It has its sources in Pontus. Flowing westward through the

city of Pontic Comana,<note anchored="yes">Gumenek.</note> and through Dazimonitis,<note anchored="yes">Kas Owa.</note> a fertile

plain, it then turns to the north beside Gaziura,<note anchored="yes">Turchal.</note> an ancient

seat of the kings, but now deserted; it then again returns to

the east, where, uniting with the Scylax<note anchored="yes">Tschoterlek Irmak.</note> and other rivers,

and taking its course beside the walls of my native place,

Amaseia,<note anchored="yes">Amasija.</note> a very strongly fortified city, proceeds to Phanarœa.

There when joined by the Lycus,<note anchored="yes">Germeili Tschai.</note> which rises in Armenia, it

becomes the Iris. It then enters Themiscyra, and discharges itself into the Euxine. This plain, therefore, is well

watered with dews, is constantly covered with herbage, and

is capable of affording food to herds of cattle as well as to

horses. The largest crops there consist of panic and millet,

or rather they never fail, for the supply of water more than

counteracts the effect of all drought; these people, therefore,

never on any occasion experience a famine. The country at

the foot of the mountains produces so large an autumnal crop

of spontaneous-grown wild fruits, of the vine, the pear, the

apple, and hazel, that, in all seasons of the year, persons who

go into the woods to cut timber gather them in large quantities; the fruit is found either yet hanging upon the trees or

lying beneath a deep covering of fallen leaves thickly strewed

upon the ground. Wild animals of all kinds, which resort

here on account of the abundance of food, are frequently

hunted.

<p>Next to Sidene is Pharnacia<note anchored="yes">According to Arrian, Pharnacia in his time was the name of Cerasus

(Kerasun).</note> a small fortified city, and

Ischopolis, which is in ruins. Next is a bay on which are

situated Cerasus, and Hermonassa,<note anchored="yes">Platana.</note> small settlements. Near

Hermonassa is Trapezus, then Colchis. Somewhere about

this place is a settlement called Zygopolis.
</p><p>I have already spoken of Colchis, and of the sea-coast beyond.<note anchored="yes">B. xi. c. ii. § 12.</note>

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Above Trapezus and Pharnacia are situated Tibareni,

Chaldæi, Sanni, (who were formerly called Macrones,<note anchored="yes">Probably the same as the Macropogones and Macrocephali.</note>) and

the Lesser Armenia. The Appaitæ also, formerly called

Cercitæ, are not far from these places. Through the country belonging to these people stretches the Scydises,<note anchored="yes">Aggi-dagh.</note> a very rugged

mountain, contiguous to the Moschic mountains<note anchored="yes">The mountains above Erzeroum.</note> above Colchis.

The heights of the Scydises are occupied by the Heptacometæ.<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of the Seven Villages.</note>

This country is likewise traversed by the Paryadres,<note anchored="yes">Iildiz-dagh.</note> which

extends from the neighbourhood of Sidene and Themiscyra to

the Lesser Armenia, and forms the eastern side of the Pontus.



<pb n="297"/>



All the inhabitants of these mountains are quite savage,

but the Heptacometæ are more so than all the others. Some

of them live among trees, or in small towers, whence the

ancients called them Mosynceci,<note anchored="yes">Dwellers in towers.</note> because the towers were

called mosȳnes. Their food consists of the flesh of wild animals and the fruits of trees. They attack travellers, leaping

down from the floors of their dwellings among the trees. The

Heptacometæ cut off three of Pompey's cohorts, as they were

passing through the mountains, by placing on their road

vessels filled with maddening honey, which is procured from

the branches of trees. The men who had tasted the honey

and lost their senses were attacked and easily despatched.

Some of these barbarians were called Byzeres.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The present Chaldæi were anciently called Chalybes.

It is in their territory chiefly that Pharnacia is situated. On

the sea-coast it has natural advantages for the capture of the

pelamydes. For this fish is first caught at this place. On

the mainland there are at present mines of iron; formerly

there were also mines of silver. The sea-shore along all these

places is very narrow, for directly above it are hills, which

abound with mines and forests; much, however, of the country

is not cultivated. The miners derive their subsistence from

the mines, and the fishermen from the fisheries, especially

from the capture of pelamydes and dolphins. The dolphins

pursue shoals of fish, the cordyla, the tunny, and even the

pelamys; they grow fat on them, and as they approach the

land incautiously, are easily taken. They are caught with a

bait and then cut into pieces; large quantities of the fat are

used for all purposes.

cially when we know that names are subject to many changes,

more especially among barbarians. For example, a tribe of

Thracians were called Sinties, then Sinti, then Saii, in whose

country Archilochus is said to have thrown away his shield:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">one of the Saii exults in having a shield, which, without blame, I involuntarily left behind in a thicket.</q></quote>



This same people have now the name of Sapæi. For all

these people were settled about Abdera, they also held Lemnos and the islands about Lemnos. Thus also Brygi, Briges,

and Phryges are the same people; and Mysi, Mæones, and

Meones are the same people. But it is unnecessary to multiply instances of this kind.
</p><p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) throws some doubt on the alteration of the name from Alybes to Chalybes, but not understanding what follows, nor what accords with it, nor, in particular, why the poet calls the Chalybes Alizoni, he rejects

the opinion that there has been an alteration of name. In

comparing his opinion with my own I shall consider also the

hypotheses entertained by others.

<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Some persons alter the word to Alazones, others to

Amazons, and <q direct="unspecified">Alybe</q> to <q direct="unspecified">Alope,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Alobe,</q> calling

the Scythians above the Borysthenes Alazones and Callipidæ,

and by other names, about which Hellanicus, Herodotus, and

Eudoxus have talked very absurdly; some say that the Amazons were situated between Mysia, Caria, and Lydia near

Cyme, which is the opinion also of Ephorus, who was a native

of the latter place. And this opinion may not be unreasonable, for he may mean the country which in later times was

inhabited by the Æolians and Ionians, but formerly by Amazons. There are some cities, it is said, which have their

names from the Amazons; as Ephesus, Smyrna, Cyme, and

Myrina. But would any one think of inquiring in these

places after Alybe, or, according to some writers, Alope, or

Alobe; what would be the meaning of <q direct="unspecified">from afar,</q> or where

is the silver mine?

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These objections he solves by an alteration in the text,

for he writes the verses in this manner,



<quote><lg>

<l>But Odius and Epistrophus led the Amazons,
</l><l>Who came from Alope, whence the tribe of the Amazonides.</l></lg></quote>



But by this solution he has invented another fiction. For



<pb n="299"/>



Alope is nowhere to be found in that situation, and the alteration in the text, itself a great change, and contrary to the

authority of ancient copies, looks like an adaptation formed

for the occasion.
</p><p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) does not adopt the opinion of

Ephorus, nor does he agree with those who suppose them to

be the Halizoni about Pallene, whom we mentioned in the description of Macedonia. He is at a loss also to understand

how any one could suppose that auxiliaries could come to the

Trojans from the Nomades situated above the Borysthenes.

He much approves of the opinion of Hecateus the Milesian,

and of Menecrates of Elea, disciples of Xenocrates, and that

of Palæphatus. The first of these says in his work entitled

<q direct="unspecified">the Circuit of the Earth,</q> <q direct="unspecified">near the city Alazia is the river

Odrysses, which after flowing through the plain of Mygdonia

from the west, out of the lake Dascylitis, empties itself into

the Rhyndacus.</q> He further relates that Alazia is now deserted, but that many villages of the Alazones through which

the Odrysses flows are inhabited. In these villages Apollo

is worsihpped with peculiar honours, and especially on the

confines of the Cyziceni.
</p><p>Menecrates, in his work <q direct="unspecified">the Circuit of the Hellespont,</q>

says that above the places near Myrleia there is a continuous

mountain tract occupied by the nation of the Halizoni. The

name, he says, ought to be written with two l's, Hallizoni,

but the poet uses one only on account of the metre.
</p><p>Palæphatus says that Odius and Epistrophus levied their

army from among the Amazons then living in Alope, but at

present in Zeleia.<note anchored="yes">Sarakoi.</note>
</p><p>Do the opinions of these persons deserve approbation? For

besides their alteration of the ancient text, and the position of

this people, they neither point out the silver mines, nor where

in Myrleatis Alope is situated, nor how they, who came

thence to Troy, came <q direct="unspecified">from afar,</q> although it should be

granted that there existed an Alope, or an Alazia. For these

are much nearer Troy than the places about Ephesus. Those,

however, are triflers, in the opinion of Demetrius, who speak of

the existence of Amazons near Pygela, between Ephesus,

Magnesia, and Priene, for the words <q direct="unspecified">from afar</q> do not

agree with the spot; much less will they agree with a situation about Mysia, and Teuthrania.

23. This may be true, says he, but some expressions are to

be understood as loosely applied, such as these,

But admitting this, the other assertions are not to be allowed

to which Demetrius is disposed to attend; nor has he refuted

in a convincing manner those persons who maintain that we

ought to read <q direct="unspecified">far from Chalybe.</q> For having conceded

that, although at present there are not silver mines among the

Chalybes, they might formerly have existed, he does not

grant that they were far-famed, and worthy of notice, like

the iron mines. But some one may say, what should prevent

them from being as famous as the iron mines, or does an

abundance of iron make a place celebrated, and not an abundance of silver? Again, if the silver mines had obtained

celebrity in the age of Homer, but not in the heroic times can

any one blame the poet's representation? How did their fame

reach him? How did the fame of the copper mines at Temesa

in Italy, or of the wealth of Thebes in Egypt, reach his ears,

although Egyptian Thebes was situated almost at double the

distance of the Chaldæi.
</p><p>But Demetrius does not altogether agree with those whose

opinions he espouses. For when he is describing the neighbourhood of Scepsis his own birth-place, he mentions Enea, a

village, Argyria, and Alazonia, as near Scepsis, and the Æsepus;<note anchored="yes">In Kiepert's map it is without a name. Leake calls it Boklu. It

falls into the sea to the west of Cyzicus.</note>

but if these places exist at all, they must be near the sources of

the Æsepus. Hecatæus places them beyond the mouths of that

river. Palsæphatus, who says that the Amazons formerly occupied Alope, and at present Zeleia, does not advance anything in agreement with these statements. But if Menecrates

agrees with Demetrius, neither does Menecrates say what this

Alope, or Alobe, is, (or, in whatever manner they please to

write the name,) nor yet does Demetrius himself.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>With regard to Apollodorus, who mentions these places

in his discourse on the array of the Trojan forces, we have



<pb n="301"/>



said much before in reply to him, and we must now speak of

him again.<note anchored="yes">B. vii. c. iii. § 6. B. i. c. ii. § 23.</note> He is of opinion that we ought not to understand

the Halizoni without the Halys, for no auxiliaries came to

Troy from the country on the other side of the Halys.

First, then, we will inquire of him who are the Halizoni

within the Halys, and situated



<quote><lg>

<l>far from Alybe, where are silver mines?</l></lg></quote>



He will not be able to reply. Next we will ask the reason

why he does not admit that some auxiliaries came from the

country on the other side of the Halys. For if it was the

case, that all the rest were living on this side the Halys, except the Thracians, nothing prevented this one body of allies

from coming from afar, from the country beyond the Leuco-

Syrians? Or, was it possible for the persons immediately

engaged in the war to pass over from those places, and from

the country beyond them, as the Amazons, Treres, and Cimmerians, but impossible for allies to do so?
</p><p>The Amazons were not allies, because Priam had fought in

alliance with the Phrygians against them:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">at that time, says Priam, I was among their auxiliaries on that day,

when the Amazons came to attack them.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. iii. 189.</note></quote>


</p><p>The people also who were living on the borders of the

country of the Amazons were not situated at so great a distance that it was difficult to send for them from thence, nor

did any animosity exist, I suppose, at that time to prevent

them from affording assistance.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Nor is there any foundation for the opinion, that all the

ancients agree that no people from the country beyond the

Halys took part in the Trojan war. Testimony may be

found to the contrary. Mæandrius at least says that Heneti

came from the country of the Leuco-Syrians to assist the Tro-

jans in the war; that they set sail thence with the Thracians,

and settled about the recess of the Adriatic; and that the

Heneti, who had no place in the expedition, were Cappadocians.

This account seems to agree with the circumstance, that the

people inhabiting the whole of that part of Cappadocia near the

Halys, which extends along Paphlagonia, speak two dialects,

and that their language abounds with Paphlagonian names, as



<pb n="302"/>



Bagas, Biasas, Æniates, Rhatotes, Zardoces, Tibius, Gasys,

Oligasys, and Manes. For these names are frequently to be

found in the Bamonitis, the Pimolitis, the Gazaluitis, and

Gazacene, and in most of the other districts. Apollodorus

himself quotes the words of Homer, altered by Zenodotus;



<quote><lg>

<l>from Henete, whence comes a race of wild mules,</l></lg></quote>



and says, that Hecatæus the Milesian understands Henete to

mean Amisus. But we have shown that Amisus belongs to

the Leuco-Syrians, and is situated beyond the Halys.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He also somewhere says that the poet obtained his

knowledge of the Paphlagonians, situated in the interior, from

persons who had travelled through the country on foot, but

that he was not acquainted with the sea-coast any more than

with the rest of the territory of Pontus; for otherwise he

would have mentioned it by name. We may, on the contrary, after the description which has just been given of the

country, retort and say that he has traversed the whole of the

sea-coast, and has omitted nothing worthy of record which

existed at that time. It is not surprising that he does not

mention Heracleia, Amastris, or Sinope, for they were not

founded; nor is it strange that he should omit to speak of

the interior of the country; nor is it a proof of ignorance

not to specify by name many places which were well known,

as we have shown in a preceding part of this work.
</p><p>He says that Homer was ignorant of much that was remarkable in Pontus, as rivers and nations, otherwise he would

have mentioned their names. This may be admitted with

respect to some very remarkable nations and rivers, as the

Scythians, the Palus Mæotis, and the Danube. For he would

not have described the Nomades, by characteristic signs, as

living on milk, Abii, a people without certain means of subsistence, <q direct="unspecified">most just</q> and <q direct="unspecified">renowned Hippemolgi,</q> (milkers

of mares,) and not distinguished them as Scythians, or Sauromatæ, or Sarmatæ, if, indeed, they had these names among

the Greeks (at that time). Nor in mentioning the Thracians

and Mysians, who live near the Danube, would he have

passed over in silence the Danube itself, one of the largest

rivers, particularly as, in other instances, he is inclined to

mark the boundaries of places by rivers; nor in speaking of

the Cimmerians would he have omitted the Bosporus, or the

Mæotis.



<pb n="303"/>



27. With respect then to places not so remarkable, or not

famous at that time, or not illustrating the subject of his poem,

who can blame the poet for omitting them? As, for example,

omitting to mention the Don, famed only as it is for being the

boundary of Asia and Europe. The persons however of that

time were not accustomed to use the name either of Asia or

Europe, nor was the habitable earth divided into three continents; otherwise he would have mentioned them by name on

account of their strong characteristic marks, as he mentioned

by name Libya (Africa), and the Libs (the south-west wind),

blowing from the western parts of Africa. But as the continents were not yet distinguished, it was not necessary that he

should mention the Don. There were many things worthy of

record, which did not occur to him. For both in actions and

in discourse much is done and said without any cause or motive,

by merely spontaneously presenting itself to the mind.
</p><p>It is evident from all these circumstances that every person

who concludes that because a certain thing is not mentioned

by the poet he was therefore ignorant of it, uses a bad argument; and we must prove by several examples that it is bad,

for many persons employ this kind of evidence to a great

extent. We must refute them therefore by producing such

instances as these which follow, although we shall repeat what

has been already said.
</p><p>If any one should maintain that the poet was not acquainted

with a river which he has not mentioned, we should say that

his argument is absurd, for he has not mentioned by name even

the river Meles, which runs by Smyrna, his birth-place according to many writers, while he has mentioned the rivers

Hermus and Hyllus by name, but yet not the Pactolus,<note anchored="yes">B. xiii. c. iv. § 5, it joins the Hyllus, called Phrygius in the time of

Strabo. The Phrygius takes its rise in the mountains north of Thyatira,

(Ak Hissar,) and falls into the Hermus (Gedis Tschai).</note> which

discharges itself into the same channel as these rivers, and

rises in the mountain Tmolus.<note anchored="yes">Bos Dagh.</note> He does not mention either

Smyrna itself, or the other cities of the Ionians, or most of those

of the Æolians, although he specifies Miletus, Samos, Lesbos,

and Tenedos. He does not mention the Lethæus, which flows

beside Magnesia,<note anchored="yes">Manisa.</note> nor the Marsyas, which rivers empty themselves into the Mæander,<note anchored="yes">Bojuk Meinder.</note> which he mentions by name, as well as



<pb n="304"/>

<l>the Rhesus, Heptapous, Caresus, and Rhodius,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xii. 20.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xii. 20.</bibl></cit>



and others, many of which are not more than small streams.

While he specifies by name many countries and cities, sometimes he makes an enumeration of rivers and mountains,

sometimes he does not do so. He does not mention the rivers

in Ætolia and Attica, nor many others. And if, in mentioning

people that live afar off, he does not mention those who are

very near, it is certainly not through ignorance of them, for

they were well known to other writers. With respect to people who were all equally near, he does not observe one rule,

for some he mentions, and not others, as for instance he mentions

the Lycii, and Solymi, but not the Milye, nor Pamphylians,

nor Pisidians; the Paphlagonians, Phrygians, and Mysians,

but not the Mariandyni, nor Thyni, nor Bithynians, nor Bebryces; the Amazons, but not the Leuco-Syrians, nor Syrians,

nor Cappadocians, nor Lycaonians, while he frequently speaks

of the Phœnicians, Ægyptians, and Æthiopians. He mentions the Aleian plain, and the Arimi mountains, but not the

nation among which these are situated.
</p><p>The argument drawn from this is false; the true argument

would have been to show that the poet has asserted what is

not true. Apollodorus has not succeeded in this attempt, and

he has more particularly failed when he ventures to call by the

name of fiction <q direct="unspecified">the renowned Hippemolgi and Galactophagi.</q>

So much then in reply to Apollodorus. I now return to the

part of my description which follows next in order.

<p>Above the places about Pharnacia and Trapezus are

the Tibareni, and Chaldæi, extending as far as the Lesser

Armenia.
</p><p>The Lesser Armenia is sufficiently fertile. Like Sophene

it was always governed by princes who were sometimes in

alliance with the other Armenians, and sometimes acting independently. They held in subjection the Chaldæi and Tibareni.

Their dominion extended as far as Trapezus and Pharnacia.

When Mithridates Eupator became powerful, he made himself

master of Colchis, and of all those places which were ceded to

him by Antipater the son of Sisis. He bestowed however so

much care upon them, that he built seventy-five strongholds,

in which he deposited the greatest part of his treasure. The

most considerable of these were Hydara, Basgedariza, and



<note anchored="yes">B. vii. c. iii. § 6.</note>

Sinoria, a fortress situated on the borders of the Greater Armenia, whence Theophanes parodied the name, and called it

Synoria.
</p><p>All the mountainous range of the Paryadres has many such

convenient situations for fortresses, being well supplied with

water and timber, it is intersected in many places by abrupt

ravines and precipices. Here he built most of the strongholds

for keeping his treasure. At last on the invasion of the

country by Pompey he took refuge in these extreme parts of

the kingdom of Pontus, and occupied a mountain near Dasteira in Acilisene, which was well supplied with water. The

Euphrates also was near, which is the boundary between Acilisene and the Lesser Armenia. Mithridates remained there

till he was besieged and compelled to fly across the mountains

into Colchis, and thence to Bosporus. Pompey built near this

same place in the Lesser Armenia Nicopolis, a city which yet

subsists, and is well inhabited.

<milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Lesser Armenia, which was in the possession of

different persons at different times, according to the pleasure

of the Romans, was at last subject to Archelaus. The Tibareni, however, and Chaldæi, extending as far as Colchis, Pharnacia, and Trapezus, are under the government of Pythodoris,

a prudent woman, and capable of presiding over the management of public affairs. She is the daughter of Pythodorus of

Tralles. She was the wife of Polemo, and reigned conjointly with him for some time. She succeeded, after his

two sons by Polemo, and a daughter who was married to

Cotys the Sapæan. He was treacherously murdered, and she

became a widow. She had children by him, the eldest of whom

is now king. Of the sons of Pythodoris, one as a private

person, administers, together with his mother, the affairs of

the kingdom, the other has been lately made king of the

Greater Armenia. Pythodoris however married Archelaus,

and remained with him till his death. At present she is a

widow, and in possession of the countries before mentioned,

and of others still more beautiful, of which we shall next speak.

<p>Sidene, and Themiseyra are contiguous to Pharnacia.

Above these countries is situated Phanarœa, containing the

best portion of the Pontus, for it produces excellent oil and



<pb n="306"/>



wine, and possesses every other property of a good soil. On

the eastern side it lies in front of the Paryadres which

runs parallel to it; on the western side it has the Lithrus,

and the Ophlimus. It forms a valley of considerable length

and breadth. The Lycus, coming out of Armenia, flows

through this valley, and the Iris, which issues from the passes

near Amaseia. Both these rivers unite about the middle

of the valley. A city stands at their confluence which the

first founder called Eupatoria, after his own name. Pompey

found it half-finished, and added to it a territory, furnished

it with inhabitants, and called it Magnopolis. It lies in the

middle of the plain. Close to the foot of the Paryadres is

situated Cabeira, about 150 stadia further to the south than

Magnopolis, about which distance likewise, but towards the

west, is Amaseia. At Cabeira was the palace of Mithridates,

the water-mill, the park for keeping wild animals, the hunting-ground in the neighbourhood, and the mines.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There also is the Cainochorion, (New Castle,) as it is

called, a fortified and precipitous rock, distant from Cabeira

less than 200 stadia. On its summit is a spring, which throws

up abundance of water, and at its foot a river, and a deep ravine.

The ridge of rocks on which it stands is of very great height,

so that it cannot be taken by siege. It is enclosed with an excellent wall, except the part where it has been demolished by

the Romans. The whole country around is so covered with

wood, so mountainous, and destitute of water, that an enemy

cannot encamp within the distance of 120 stadia. There

Mithridates had deposited his most valuable effects, which are

now in the Capitol, as offerings dedicated by Pompey.
</p><p>Pythodoris is in possession of all this country; (for it is contiguous to that of the barbarians, which she holds as a conquered country;) she also holds the Zelitis and the Megalopolitis.

After Pompey had raised Cabeira to the rank of a city, and

called it Diospolis, Pythodoris improved it still more, changed

its name to Sebaste, (or Augusta,) and considers it a royal city.
</p><p>She has also the temple of Men surnamed of Pharnaces, at

Ameria, a village city, inhabited by a large body of sacred

menials, and having annexed to it a sacred territory, the produce of which is always enjoyed by the priest. The kings

held this temple in such exceeding veneration, that this was

the Royal oath, <q direct="unspecified">by the fortune of the king, and by Mēn of

<p>Above Phanarœa is Comana<note anchored="yes">Gumenek.</note> in Pontus, of the same

name as that in the Greater Cappadocia, and dedicated to the

same goddess. The temple is a copy of that in Cappadocia,

and nearly the same course of religious rites is practised there;

the mode of delivering the oracles is the same; the same respect

is paid to the priests, as was more particularly the case in the

time of the first kings, when twice a year, at what is called the

Exodi of the goddess, (when her image is carried in procession,)

the priest wore the diadem of the goddess and received the

chief honours after the king.

<p>We have formerly mentioned Dorylaus the Tactician,

who was my mother's great grandfather; and another Dorylaus,

who was the nephew of the former, and the son of Philetærus;

I said that, although he had obtained from Mithridates the

highest dignities and even the priesthood of Comana, he was

detected in the fact of attempting the revolt of the kingdom

to the Romans. Upon his fall the family also was disgraced.

At a later period however Moaphernes, my mother's uncle, rose

to distinction near upon the dissolution of the kingdom. But a

second time he and his friends shared in the misfortunes of

the king, except those persons who had anticipated the calamity and deserted him early. This was the case with my

maternal grandfather, who, perceiving the unfortunate progress

of the affairs of the king in the war with Lucullus, and at the

same time being alienated from him by resentment for having

lately put to death his nephew Tibius, and his son Theophilus.

undertook to avenge their wrongs and his own. He obtained

pledges of security from Lucullus, and caused fifteen fortresses

to revolt; in return he received magnificent promises. On

the arrival of Pompey, who succeeded Lucullus in the conduct

of the war, he regarded as enemies (in consequence of the

enmity which subsisted between himself and that general) all

those persons who had performed any services that were acceptable to Lucullus. On his return home at the conclusion

of the war he prevailed upon the senate not to confirm those

honours which Lucullus had promised to some persons of



<pb n="308"/>



Pontus, maintaining it to be unjust towards a general who had

brought the war to a successful issue, that the rewards and distribution of honours should be placed in the hands of another.

<milestone n="34" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The affairs of Comana were administered as has been

described in the time of the kings. Pompey, when he had obtained the power, appointed Archelaus priest, and assigned to

him a district of two schoeni, or 60 stadia in circuit, in addition to the sacred territory, and gave orders to the inhabitants

to obey Archelaus. He was their governor, and master of the

sacred slaves who inhabited the city, but had not the power of

selling them. The slaves amounted to no less than six thousand.
</p><p>This Archelaus was the son of that Archelaus who received

honours from Sylla and the senate; he was the friend of

Gabinius, a person of consular rank. When the former was

sent into Syria, he came with the expectation of accompanying

in, when he was making preparations for the Parthian war,

out the senate would not permit him to do so, and he abandoned

this, and conceived a greater design.
</p><p>Ptolemy, the father of Cleopatra, happened at this time to be

ejected from his kingdom by the Ægyptians. His daughter

however, the elder sister of Cleopatra, was in possession of the

throne. When inquiries were making in order to marry her to

a husband of royal descent, Archelaus presented himself to

those who were negotiating the affair, and pretended to be

the son of Mithridates Eupator. He was accepted, but reigned

only six months. He was killed by Gabinius in a pitched

battle, in his attempt to restore Ptolemy.

<milestone n="35" unit="section"/></p>
<p>His son however succeeded to the priesthood, and Lycomedes succeeded him, to whom was assigned an additional

district of four schœni (or 120 stadia) in extent. When Lycomedes was dispossessed he was succeeded by Dyteutus, the

son of Adiatorix, who still occupies the post, and appears to

have obtained this honour from Cæsar Augustus on account of

his good conduct on the following occasion.
</p><p>Cæsar, after leading in triumph Adiatorix, with his wife and

children, had resolved to put him to death together with the

eldest of his sons. Dyteutus was the eldest; but when the

second of his brothers told the soldiers who were leading them

away to execution that he was the eldest, there was a contest

between the two brothers, which continued for some time, till



<pb n="309"/>



the parents prevailed upon Dyteutus to yield to the younger,

assigning as a reason, that the eldest would be a better person

to protect his mother and his remaining brother. The younger

was put to death together with his father; the elder was saved,

and obtained this office. When Cæsar was informed of the

execution of these persons, he regretted it, and, considering

the survivors worthy of his favour and protection, bestowed

upon them this honourable appointment.

<milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Comana is populous, and is a considerable mart, frequented by persons coming from Armenia. Men and women

assemble there from all quarters from the cities and the country

to celebrate the festival at the time of the exodi or processions

of the goddess. Some persons under the obligation of a vow

are always residing there, and perform sacrifices in honour

of the goddess.
</p><p>The inhabitants are voluptuous in their mode of life. All

their property is planted with vines, and there is a multitude

of women, who make a gain of their persons, most of whom

are dedicated to the goddess. The city is almost a little

Corinth. On account of the multitude of harlots at Corinth,

who are dedicated to Venus, and attracted by the festivities of

the place, strangers resorted thither in great numbers. Merchants and soldiers were quite ruined, so that hence the proverb originated,

<q direct="unspecified">every man cannot go to Corinth.</q>

Such is the character of Comana.

<p>All the country around is subject to Pythodoris, a .d

she possesses also Phanarœa, the Zelitis, and the Megalopolitis.
</p><p>We have already spoken of Phanarœa.
</p><p>In the district Zelitis is the city Zela,<note anchored="yes">Zileh.</note> built upon the mound

of Semiramis. It contains the temple of Anaitis, whom the

Armenians also worship. Sacrifices are performed with more

pomp than in other places, and all the people of Pontus take

oaths here in affairs of highest concern. The multitude

of the sacred menials, and the honours conferred upon the

priests, were in the time of the kings, upon the plan which I

have before described. At present, however, everything is

under the power of Pythodoris, but many persons had previously reduced the number of the sacred attendants, injured

the property and diminished the revenue belonging to the



<pb n="310"/>



temple. The adjacent district of Zelitis, (in which is the

city Zela, on the mound of Semiramis,) was reduced by being

divided into several governments. Anciently, the kings did

not govern Zela as a city, but regarded it as a temple of the

Persian gods; the priest was the director of everything relating to its administration. It was inhabited by a multitude

of sacred menials, by the priest, who possessed great wealth,

and by his numerous attendants; the sacred territory was

under the authority of the priest, and it was his own property.

Pompey added many provinces to Zelitis, and gave the name

of city to Zela, as well as to Megalopolis. He formed Zelitis,

Culupene, and Camisene, into one district. The two latter

bordered upon the Lesser Armenia, and upon Laviansene.

Fossile salt was found in them, and there was an ancient

fortress called Camisa, at present in ruins. The Roman governors who next succeeded assigned one portion of these two

governments to the priests of Comana, another to the priest of

Zela, and another to Ateporix, a chief of the family of the

tetrarchs of Galatia; upon his death, this portion, which was

not large, became subject to the Romans under the name of a

province. This little state is a political body of itself, Carana<note anchored="yes">This district is at the foot of the mountains which separated the

Roman from the Persian Armenia. Carana (now <emph rend="ital">Erzurm,</emph> Erzerum, or

was for a long time subject to the Byzantine emperors, who considered it

the most important fortress of Armenia. About the middle of the 11th

Neapolitis. He raised the village Phazemon to the rank of a

</p><p>The part of Phazemonitis towards Phanarœa is occupied by

a lake, sea-like in magnitude, called Stiphane,<note anchored="yes">Ladik-Gol.</note> which abounds

with fish, and has around it a large range of pasture adapted

Phazemonitee, highly salubrious, and the Sagylium,<note anchored="yes">Ijan (Tauschan) Kalessi.</note> a strong-

hold situated on a lofty perpendicular hill, stretching upwards

and terminating in a sharp peak. In this fortress is a reservoir well supplied with water, which is at present neglected,

but was useful, on many occasions, to the kings. Here the

sons of Pharnaces the king captured and put to death Arsaces,

who was governing without the authority of the Roman generals, and endeavouring to produce a revolution in the state.

The fortress was taken by Polemo and Lycomedes, both of

them kings, by famine and not by storm. Arsaces, being prevented from escaping into the plains, fled to the mountains

without provisions. There he found the wells choked up with

large pieces of rock. This had been done by order of Pompey,

who had directed the fortresses to be demolished, and to leave

nothing in them that could be serviceable to robbers, who

might use them as places of refuge. Such was the settlement

of the Phazemonitis made by Pompey. Those who came afterwards divided this district among various kings.

valley, through which runs the river Iris.<note anchored="yes">Tusanlu-su, a branch of the Ieschil Irmak.</note> It is indebted to

nature and art for its admirable position and construction. It



<pb n="312"/>



answers the double purpose of a city and a fortress. It is a

high rock, precipitous on all sides, descending rapidly down

to the river: on the margin of the river, where the city stands,

is a wall, and a wall also which ascends on each side of the

city to the peaks, of which there are two, united by nature, and

completely fortified with towers. In this circuit of the wall

are the palace, and the monuments of the kings. The peaks

are connected together by a very narrow ridge, in height five

or six stadia on each side, as you ascend from the banks

of the river, and from the suburbs. From the ridge to the

peaks there remains another sharp ascent of a stadium in length,

which defies the attacks of an enemy. Within the rock are

reservoirs of water, the supply from which the inhabitants

cannot be deprived of, as two channels are cut, one in the

direction of the river, the other of the ridge. Two bridges

are built over the river, one leading from the city to the suburbs, the other from the suburbs to the country beyond; for

near this bridge the mountain, which overhangs the rock, terminates.
</p><p>A valley extends from the river; it is not very wide at its

commencement, but afterwards increases in breadth, and forms

the plain called the Chiliocomon (The Thousand Villages).

Next is the Diacopene, and the Pimolisene, the whole of which

is a fertile district extending to the Halys.
</p><p>These are the northern parts of the country of the Amasenses, and are in length about 500 stadia. Then follows the

remainder, which is much longer, extending as far as Babanomus, and the Ximene,<note anchored="yes">West of Koseh Dagh.</note> which itself reaches to the Halys.

40. There remains to be described the country within the

Halys, belonging to the province of Pontus, and situated about

the Olgassys,<note anchored="yes">Alkas-Dagh.</note> and contiguous to the Sinopic district. The Ol-

gassys is a very lofty mountain, and difficult to be passed. The

Paphlagonians have erected temples in every part of this

mountain. The country around, the Blæne, and the Domanitis, through which the river Amnias<note anchored="yes">Gok-Irmak, or Kostambul Tschai, flowing between the mountain

ridges. Jeralagoz-Dagh and Sarikawak-Dagh.</note> runs, is sufficiently

fertile. Here it was that Mithridates Eupator entirely destroyed<note anchored="yes">B. C. <date value="-88">88</date>.</note> the army of Nicomedes the Bithynian, not in person,

for he himself happened to be absent, but by his generals.

Nicomedes fled with a few followers, and escaped into his own

country, and thence sailed to Italy. Mithridates pursued him,

and made himself master of Bithynia as soon as he entered it,

and obtained possession of Asia as far as Caria and Lycia.

Here is situated Pompeiopolis,<note anchored="yes">Tasch-Kopri.</note> in which city is the Sandaracurgium,<note anchored="yes">Pliny, xxxiv. c. 18.</note> (or Sandaraca works,) it is not far distant

from Pimolisa, a royal fortress in ruins, from which the country on each side of the river is called Pimolisene. The Sandaracurgium is a mountain hollowed out by large trenches

made by workmen in the process of mining. The work is always carried on at the public charge, and slaves were employed in the mine who had been sold on account of their crimes.

Besides the great labour of the employment, the air is said to

be destructive of life, and scarcely endurable in consequence of

the strong odour issuing from the masses of mineral; hence

the slaves are short-lived. The mining is frequently suspended

from its becoming unprofitable, for great expense is incurred

by the employment of more than two hundred workmen, whose

number is continually diminishing by disease and fatal accidents.

</p><p>On the same bay was Astacus a city founded by Megareans

<p>It is difficult to define the boundaries of the Bithynians,

Mysians, Phrygians, of the Doliones about Cyzicus, and of the

Mygdones and Troes; it is generally admitted that each of

these tribes ought to be placed apart from the other. A proverbial saying is applied to the Phrygians and Mysians,

<q direct="unspecified">The boundaries of the Mysi and Phryges are apart from one another,</q>

but it is difficult to define them respectively. The reason is

this; strangers who came into the country were soldiers and

barbarians; they had no fixed settlement in the country of

which they obtained possession, but were, for the most part,

wanderers, expelling others from their territory, and being expelled themselves. All these nations might be supposed to be

Thracians, because Thracians occupy the country on the other

side, and because they do not differ much from one another.

<p>But as far as we are able to conjecture, we may place

Mysia between Bithynia and the mouth of the Æsepus, contiguous to the sea, and nearly along the whole of Olympus.

Around it, in the interior, is the Epictetus, nowhere reaching

the sea, and extending as far as the eastern parts of the Ascanian lake and district, for both bear the same name. Part of

this territory was Phrygian, and part Mysian; the Phrygian

was further distant from Troy; and so we must understand

the words of the poet<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 862.</note>, when he says,

</p><p>It is not then surprising that he should speak of an Ascanius, a leader of the Phrygians, who came from Ascania, and

<p>The poet himself assigns the Æsepus as the boundary of

the Mysians, for after having described the country above

Ilium, and lying along the foot of the mountains subject to

Æneas, and which he calls Dardania, he places next towards

the north Lycia, which was subject to Pandarus, and where

Zeleia<note anchored="yes">Sarakoi.</note> was situated; he says,

such disposition of these nations. But the present changes

have produced many differences in consequence of' the continual succession of governors of the country, who confounded together people and districts, and separated others. The

Phrygians and Mysians were masters of the country after the

capture of Troy; afterwards the Lydians; then the Æolians

and Ionians; next, the Persians and Macedonians; lastly, the

Romans, under whose government most of the tribes have lost

even their languages and names, in consequence of a new

partition of the country having been made. It will be proper

to take this into consideration when we describe its present

state, at the same time showing a due regard to antiquity.

Antigonia. It was then rebuilt by Lysimachus, who changed

its name to that of his wife Nicæa. She was the daughter of

Antipater. The city is situated in a plain. Its shape is

quadrangular, eleven stadia in circuit. It has four gates. Its

streets are divided at right angles, so that the four gates may

be seen from a single stone, set up in the middle of the Gymnasium. A little above the Ascanian lake is Otrcæa, a small

town situated just on the borders of Bithynia towards the east.

It is conjectured that Otrcæa was so called from Otreus.

Dionysius, who composed a work on <q direct="unspecified">the foundation of cities.</q>

He says that the straits at Chalcedon, and Byzantium, which

are now called the Thracian, were formerly called the Mysian

Bosporus. Some person might allege this as a proof that the

Olympus (whom some writers call Bithyni Olympeni, and

others Hellespontii) and Phrygia upon the Hellespont. To the

south of the Paphlagonians are the Galatians, and still further

to the south of both these nations are the Greater Phrygia,

and Lycaonia, extending as far as the Cilician and Pisidian

Taurus. But since the parts continuous with Paphlagonia adjoin Pontus, Cappadocia, and the nations which we have just

described, it may be proper first to give an account of the

parts in the neighbourhood of these nations, and then proceed

to a description of the places next in order.

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>To the south of the Paphlagonians are the Galatians, of

whom there are three tribes; two of them, the Trocmi and

the Tolistobogii, have their names from their chiefs; the third,

the Tectosages, from the tribe of that name in Celtica. The

Galatians took possession of this country after wandering about

for a long period, and overrunning the country subject to the

Attalic and the Bithynian kings, until they received by a

voluntary cession the present Galatia, or Gallo-Græcia, as it is

called. Leonnorius seems to have been the chief leader of these

people when they passed over into Asia. There were three

nations that spoke the same language, and in no respect differed from one another. Each of them was divided into four

portions called tetrarchies, and had its own tetrarch, its own

judge, and one superintendent of the army, all of whom were

under the control of the tetrarch, and two subordinate super-



<pb n="320"/>



intendents of the army. The Council of the twelve Tetrarchs

consisted of three hundred persons, who assembled at a place

called the Drynemetum.<note anchored="yes">Probably a grove.</note> The council determined causes relative to murder, the others were decided by the tetrarchs and

the judges. Such, anciently, was the political constitution of

Galatia; but, in our time, the government was in the hands of

three chiefs, then of two, and at last it was administered by

Deiotarus, who was succeeded by Amyntas. At present, the

Romans possess this as well as all the country which was subject to Amyntas, and have reduced it into one province.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Trocmi occupy the parts near Pontus and Cappadocia, which are the best which the Galatians possess. They

have three walled fortresses, Tavium, a mart for the people in

that quarter, where there is a colossal statue of Jupiter in brass,

and a grove, which is used as a place of refuge; Mithridatium,

which Pompey gave to Bogodiatarus, (Deïotarus?) having

separated it from the kingdom of Pontus; and thirdly, Danala,

where Pompey, when he was about to leave the country to

celebrate his triumph, met Lucullus and delivered over to him

as his successor the command of the war.
</p><p>This is the country which the Trocmi possess.
</p><p>The Tectosages occupy the parts towards the greater

Phrygia near Pessinus,<note anchored="yes">Bala Hissar, to the south of Siwri-Hissar; between these two places

is Mt. Dindymus, Gunescth-Dagh.</note> and the Orcaorci. They had the

fortress Ancyra,<note anchored="yes">On the west of the lake Simau.</note> of the same name as the small Phrygian

city towards Lydia near Blaudus.<note anchored="yes">Suleimanli.</note> The Tolistobogii border

upon the Bithynians, and Phrygia Epictetus, as it is called.

They possess the fortresses Blucium, (Luceium,) which was the

royal seat of Deiotarus, and Peium, which was his treasure-hold.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Pessinus is the largest mart of any in that quarter. It

contains a temple of the Mother of the Gods, held in the

highest veneration. The goddess is called Agdistis. The

priests anciently were a sort of sovereigns, and derived a large

revenue from their office. At present their consequence is

much diminished, but the mart still subsists. The sacred

enclosure was adorned with fitting magnificence by the Attalic

kings,<note anchored="yes">The kings of Pergamus.</note> with a temple, and porticos of marble. The Romans



<pb n="321"/>



gave importance to the temple by sending for the statue of the

goddess from thence according to the oracle of the Sibyl, as

they had sent for that of Asclepius from Epidaurus.
</p><p>The mountain Dindymus is situated above the city; from

Dindymus comes Dindymene, as from Cybela, Cybele. Near

it runs the river Sangarius, and on its banks are the ancient

dwellings of the Phrygians, of Midas, and of Gordius before

his time, and of some others, which do not preserve the

vestiges of cities, but are villages a little larger than the rest.

Such is Gordium,<note anchored="yes">Juliopolis.</note> and Gorbeus (Gordeus), the royal seat

of Castor, son of Saocondarius, (Saocondarus?) in which he

was put to death by his father-in-law, Deiotarus, who there

also murdered his own daughter. Deiotarus razed the fortress,

and destroyed the greater part of the settlement.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to Galatia towards the south is the lake Tatta,<note anchored="yes">Tuz-Tscholli.</note>

lying parallel to that part of the Greater Cappadocia which

is near the Morimeni. It belongs to the Greater Phrygia, as

well as the country continuous with this, and extending as

far as the Taurus, and of which Amyntas possessed the greatest part. Tatta is a natural salt-pan. The water so readily

makes a deposit around everything immersed in it, that upon

letting down wreaths formed of rope, chaplets of salt are drawn

up. If birds touch the surface of the water with their wings,

they immediately fall down in consequence of the concretion

of the salt upon them, and are thus taken.

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>SUCH is the description of Tatta. The places around

Orcaorci, Pitnisus and the mountainous plains of Lycaonia,

are cold and bare, affording pasture only for wild asses; there

is a great scarcity of water, but wherever it is found the wells

are very deep, as at Soatra, where it is even sold. Soatra is

a village city near Garsabora (Garsaura?). Although the

country is ill supplied with water, it is surprisingly well

adapted for feeding sheep, but the wool is coarse. Some

persons have acquired very great wealth by these flocks alone.

Amyntas had above three hundred flocks of sheep in these

parts. In this district there are two lakes, the greater Coralis,

the smaller Trogitis. Somewhere here is Iconium,<note anchored="yes">Konia.</note> a small

town, well built, about which is a more fertile tract of land

than the pastures for the wild asses before mentioned. Polemo

possessed this place.
</p><p>Here the Taurus approaches this country, separating Cappadocia and Lycaonia from Cilicia Tracheia. It is the boundary of the Lycaonians and Cappadocians, between Coropassus,

a village of the Lycaonians, and Gareathyra (Garsaura), a

small town of the Cappadocians. The distance between these

fortressess is about 120 stadia.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To Lycaonia belongs Isaurica, near the Taurus, in which

are the Isaura, two villages of the same name, one of which is

surnamed Palæa, or the Old, the other [the New], the latter is

well fortified.<note anchored="yes">Meineke's correction.</note> There were many other villages dependent

upon these. They are all of them, however, the dwellings of

robbers. They occasioned much trouble to the Romans, and

to Publius Servilius, surnamed Isauricus, with whom I was

acquainted; he subjected these places to the Romans, and

destroyed also many of the strong-holds of the pirates, situated

upon the sea.

Cappadocia. Laranda<note anchored="yes">Caraman.</note> also belonged to Antipater. In my

time Amyntas attacked and killed Antipater Derbætes, and

got possession of the Isaura and of Derbe. The Romans

gave him the Isaura where he built a palace for himself, after

having destroyed Isauria Palæa (the Old). He began to build

in the same place a new wall, but before its completion he was

killed by the Cilicians in an ambuscade, when invading the

country of the Homonadeis.

Taurus and overran this district, which belonged to the

Phrygians and Cilicians (Lycaonians). He razed also many

fortresses, which before this time were considered impregna

by storm Sandalium, situated between Cremna and Sagalassus.

<p>Cremna is occupied by a Roman colony.
</p><p>Sagalassus is under the command of the same Roman governor, to whom all the kingdom of Amyntas is subject. It

is distant from Apameia a day's journey, having a descent of

nearly 30 stadia from the fortress. It has the name also of

Selgessus. It was taken by Alexander.
</p><p>Amyntas made himself master of Cremna and passed into

the country of the Homonadeis, who were supposed to be the

most difficult to reduce of all the tribes. He had already got

into his power most of their strong-holds, and had killed the

</p><p>Among the heights of Taurus, and in the midst of rocks

and precipices for the most part inaccessible, is a hollow and

fertile plain divided into several valleys. The inhabitants

cultivate this plain, but live among the overhanging heights

of the mountains, or in caves. They are for the most part

armed, and accustomed to make incursions into the country of

other tribes, their own being protected by mountains, which

serve as a wall.

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>CONTIGUOUS to these, among other tribes of the Pisidians,

are the Selgeis, the most considerable tribe of the nation.

dus,<note anchored="yes">Balkesi.</note> which are Pamphylian cities, occupy heights, all of which

are planted with olives. The parts above these, a mountainous country, are occupied by the Catennenses, who border upon

the Selgeis and the Homonadeis. The Sagalasseis occupy

the parts within the Taurus towards Milyas.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Artemidorus says that Selge, Sagalassus, Petnelissus,

Adada, Tymbrias, Cremna, Pityassus, (Tityassus?) Amblada,

Anabura, Sinda, Aarassus, Tarbassus, Termessus, are cities of

the Pisidians. Of these some are entirely among the mountains, others extend on each side even as far as the country at

the foot of the mountains, and reach to Pamphylia and Milyas,

and border on Phrygians, Lydians, and Carians, all of whom

are disposed to peace, although situated to the north.<note anchored="yes">To the north of the chain of Taurus which commenced at the pro-

</p><p>The Pamphylians, who partake much of the character of

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>All the rest of the mountain tribes of the Pisidians

whom I have spoken of are divided into states governed by

tyrants, and follow like the Cilicians a predatory mode of

life. It is said that anciently some of the Leleges, a wandering people, were intermixed with them, and from the similarity of their habits and manners settled there.
</p><p>Selge<note anchored="yes">Surk.</note> had the rank of a city from the first when founded by

tle Lacedæmonians, but at a still earlier period by Calchas.

Latterly it has maintained its condition and flourished in consequence of its excellent constitution and government, so that

at one time it had a population of 20,000 persons. The place

deserves admiration from the advantages which nature has

bestowed upon it. Among the summits of Taurus is a very

fertile tract capable of maintaining many thousand inhabitants. Many spots produce the olive and excellent vines, and

afford abundant pasture for animals of all kinds. Above and



<pb n="325"/>



all around are forests containing trees of various sorts. The

styrax is found here in great abundance, a tree not large but

straight in its growth. Javelins, similar to those of the

cornel tree, are made of the wood of this tree. There is bred

in the trunk of the styrax tree, a worm, which eats through

the timber to the surface, and throws out raspings like bran, or

saw-dust, a heap of which is collected at the root. Afterwards a liquid distils which readily concretes into a mass

like gum. A part of this liquid descends upon and mixes

with the raspings at the root of the tree, and with earth; a

portion of it acquires consistence on the surface of the mass,

and remains pure. That portion which flows along the surface of the trunk of the tree, and concretes, is also pure. A

mixture is made of the impure part, which is a combination of

wood-dust and earth; this has more odour than the pure styrax,

but is inferior to it in its other properties. This is not commonly known. It is used for incense in large quantities by

superstitious worshippers of the gods.
</p><p>The Selgic iris<note anchored="yes">Pliny, b. xv. c. 7, and b. xii. c. 4.</note> also, and the unguent which is made from

it, are in great esteem. There are few approaches about the

city, and the mountainous country of the Selgeis, which

abounds with precipices and ravines, formed among other

rivers by the Eurymedon<note anchored="yes">Kopru-Su.</note> and the Cestrus,<note anchored="yes">Ak-Su.</note> which descend from the Selgic mountains, and discharge themselves

into the Pamphylian Sea. There are bridges on the roads.

From the strength and security of their position the Selgeis were never at any time, nor on any single occasion, subject to any other people, but enjoyed unmolested the produce

of their country, with the exception of that part situated below them in Pamphylia, and that within the Taurus, for which

they were carrying on a continual warfare with the kings.
</p><p>Their position with respect to the Romans was that they

possessed this tract on certain conditions. They sent ambassadors to Alexander and offered to receive his commands in the

character of friends, but at present they are altogether subject

to the Romans, and are included in what was formerly the

kingdom of Amyntas.

<p>THE people called Mysians, and Phrygians, who live

around the so-called Mysian Olympus, border upon the Bithynians to the south. Each of these nations is divided into

two parts. One is called the Greater Phrygia, of which

Midas was king. A part of it was occupied by the Galatians.

The other is the Lesser, or Phrygia on the Hellespont, or

Phrygia around Olympus, and is also called Epictetus.
</p><p>Mysia is also divided into two parts; Olympic Mysia,

which is continuous with Bithynia, and with the Epictetus,

(which, Artemidorus says, was inhabited by the Mysians beyond the Danube,) and the part around the Caïcus,<note anchored="yes">Bakyr-Tschai.</note> and the

Pergamene<note anchored="yes">The district around Bergama.</note> as far as Teuthrania, and the mouths of the river.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This country, however, as we have frequently observed,

has undergone so many changes, that it is uncertain whether

the district around Sipylus,<note anchored="yes">Sipuli-Dagh.</note> which the ancients called Phrygia,

were a part of the Greater or the Lesser Phrygia, from whence

Tantalus, Pelops, and Niobe were called Phrygians. Whatever the explanation may be, the change is certain. For Pergamene and Elaitis,<note anchored="yes">The district between Bergama and the sea.</note> through which country the Caïcus passes,

and empties itself into the sea, and Teuthrania, situated between these two districts, where Teuthras lived, and Telephus was brought up, lies between the Hellespont, and the

country about Sipylus, and Magnesia, which is at the foot of

the mountain, so that, as I have said, it is difficult

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Lydians also, and the Mæones, whom Homer calls

Meones, are in some way confounded with these people

and with one another; some authors say that they are the

same, others that they are different, nations. Add to this that

some writers regard the Mysians as Thracians, others as Lydians, according to an ancient tradition, which has been preserved by Xanthus the Lydian, and by Menecrates of Elæa,

who assign as the origin of the name Mysians, that the

Lydians call the beech-tree (Oxya) Mysos, which grows in

later Mysians, and received their appellation from the Mysos,

or beech-tree growing in that country. The language also is

an evidence of this. It is a mixture of Lydian and Phrygian

words, for they lived some time in the neighbourhood of

Olympus. But when the Phrygians passed over from Thrace,

and put to death the chief of Troy and of the country near

it, they settled here, but the Mysians established themselves

above the sources of the Caïcus near Lydia.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The confusion which has existed among the nations in

this district, and even the fertility of the country within the

Halys, particularly near the sea, have contributed to the invention of fables of this sort. The richness of the country

provoked attacks, from various quarters, and at all times, of

tribes who came from the opposite coast, or neighbouring

people contended with one another for the possession of it.

Inroads and migrations took place chiefly about the period

of the Trojan war, and subsequently to that time, Barbarians

as well as Greeks showing an eagerness to get possession of

the territory of other nations. This disposition, however,

showed itself before the time of the Trojan war; for there

existed then tribes of Pelasgi, Caucones, and Leleges, who are

said to have wandered, anciently, over various parts of Europe.

The poet represents them as assisting the Trojans, but not as

coming from the opposite coast. The accounts respecting the

Phrygians and the Mysians are more ancient than the Trojan

times.
</p><p>Two tribes bearing the name of Lycians, lead us to suppose

that they are the same race; either the Trojan Lycians sent

colonies to the Carians, or the Carian Lycians to the Trojans.

Perhaps the same may be the case with the Cilicians, for they

also are divided into two tribes; but we have not the same

evidence that the present Cilicians existed before the Trojan

times. Telephus may be supposed to have come with his

mother from Arcadia; by her marriage with Teuthras, (who

had received them as his guests,) Telephus was admitted into the



<pb n="328"/>



family of Teuthras, was reputed to be his son, and succeeded

to the kingdom of the Mysians.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p><q direct="unspecified">The Carians, who were formerly islanders, and Leleges,</q> it is said, <q direct="unspecified">settled on the continent with the assistance

Sarpedon from Miletus in Crete. They settled the colony

of Termilmæ in the present Lycia, but, according to Herodotus,<note anchored="yes">Herod. i. 173; vii. 92.</note>

these people were a colony from Crete under the conduct of

Sarpedon, brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, who gave the

name of Termilæ to the people formerly called Milyæ, and

still more anciently Solymi; when, however, Lycus the son of

Pandion arrived, he called them Lycii after his own name.</q>

This account shows that the Solymi and Lycians were the

same people, but the poet distinguishes them. He represents

Bellerophon setting out from Lycia, and

<p>That the common prize, proposed to be obtained by the

conquerors, was the fertile country which I am describing, is

confirmed by many circumstances which happened both before and after the Trojan times. When even the Amazons

ventured to invade it, Priam and Bellerophon are said to have

undertaken an expedition against these women. Anciently

there were cities which bore the names of the Amazons. In

the Ilian plain there is a hill



<quote><q direct="unspecified">which men call Batieia, but the immortals, the tomb of the bounding

who, according to historians, was one of the Amazons, and

to be <foreign lang="greek">eu\ska/rqmoi</foreign> on account of their speed; and she was called

<foreign lang="greek">polu\skarmos</foreign> from the rapidity with which she drove the

chariot. Myrina therefore, the place, was named after the

Amazon. In the same manner the neighbouring islands

were invaded on account of their fertility; among which were

Rhodes and Cos. That they were inhabited before the Trojan times clearly appears from the testimony of Homer.<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 655, 677.</note>



<pb n="329"/>



<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the Trojan times, the migrations of Greeks and

of Treres, the inroads of Cimmerians and Lydians, afterwards of Persians and Macedonians, and lastly of Galatians, threw everything into confusion. An obscurity arose

not from these changes only, but from the disagreement between authors in their narration of the same events, and in

their description of the same persons; for they called Trojans

Phrygians, like the Tragic poets; and Lycians Carians, and

similarly in other instances. The Trojans who, from a small

beginning, increased so much in power that they became kings

of kings, furnished a motive to the poet and his interpreters, for determining what country ought to be called Troy.

For the poet calls by the common name of Trojans all their

auxiliaries, as he calls their enemies Danai and Achæi. But

certainly we should not give the name of Troy to Paphlagonia, or to Caria, or to Lycia, which borders upon it. I

mean when the poet says,

<l>the Trojans advanced with the clashing of armour and shouts,<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. iii.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. iii.</bibl></cit>

ed for the protection of robbers, who, being able to maintain

themselves there for any length of time, often set themselves

up as tyrants, as Cleon a captain of a band of robbers did in

my recollection.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Cleon was a native of the village Gordium, which he

afterwards enlarged, and erected into a city, giving it the

name of Juliopolis. His first retreat and head-quarters was

a place called Callydium, one of the strongest holds. He was

of service to Antony in attacking the soldiers who collected

money for Labienus, at the time that the latter occupied Asia,

and thus hindered the preparations which he was making for

his defence. In the Actian war he separated himself from

Antony and attached himself to the generals of Cæsar; he

was rewarded above his deserts, for in addition to what he received from Antony he obtained power from Cæsar, and exchanged the character of a freebooter for that of a petty

prince. He was priest of Jupiter Abrettenus, the Mysian

god, and a portion of the Morena was subject to him, which,

like Abrettena, is Mysian. He finally obtained the priesthood of Comana in Pontus, and went to take possession of it,

but died within a month after his arrival. He was carried

off by an acute disease, occasioned either by excessive repletion,

or, according to the account of those employed about the

temple, inflicted by the anger of the goddess. The story is

this. Within the circuit of the sacred enclosure is the dwelling

of the priest and priestess. Besides other sacred observances

relative to the temple, the purity of this enclosure is an

especial object of vigilance, by abstinence from eating swine's

flesh. The whole city, indeed, is bound to abstain from this

food, and swine are not permitted to enter it. Cleon, however,

immediately upon his arrival displayed his lawless disposition

and character by violating this custom, as if he had come

there not as a priest, but a polluter of sacred things.

<p>Cyzicus is an island<note anchored="yes">According to Pliny, b. v. c. 32, it was united to the mainland by

Alexander.</note> in the Propontis, joined to the continent by two bridges. It is exceedingly fertile. It is about

500 stadia in circumference. There is a city of the same

name near the bridges, with two close harbours, and more

than two hundred docks for vessels. One part of the city is

in a plain, the other near the mountain which is called

Arcton-oros (or Bear-mountain). Above this is another

mountain, the Dindymus, with one peak, having on it a temple

founded by the Argonauts in honour of Dindymene, mother of

the gods. This city rivals in size, beauty, and in the excellent administration of affairs, both in peace and war, the

cities which hold the first rank in Asia. It appears to be

embellished in a manner similar to Rhodes, Massalia,<note anchored="yes">Marseilles.</note> and

ancient Carthage. I omit many details. There are three

architects, to whom is intrusted the care of the public edifices

and engines. The city has also three store-houses, one for

arms, one for engines, and one for corn. The Chalcidic earth

mixed with the corn prevents it from spoiling. The utility

of preserving it in this manner was proved in the Mithridatic

war. The king attacked the city unexpectedly with an army of

<date value="150">150</date>,000 men and a large body of cavalry, and made himself

master of the opposite hill, which is called the hill of Adrasteia, and of the suburb. He afterwards transferred his camp

to the neck of land above the city, blockaded it by land, and

attacked it by sea with four hundred ships. The Cyziceni

resisted all these attempts, and were even nearly capturing

the king in a subterraneous passage, by working a countermine. He was, however, apprized of it, and escaped by retreating in time out of the excavation. Lucullus, the Roman

general, was able, though late, to send succours into the city

by night. Famine also came to the aid of the Cyziceni by

spreading among this large army. The king did not foresee

this, and after losing great numbers of his men went away.

The Romans respected the city, and to this present time it en-

joys freedom. A large territory belongs to it, some part of

which it has held from the earliest times; the rest was a gift

of the Romans. Of the Troad they possess the parts beyond

the Æsepus, namely, those about Zeleia and the plain of Adrasteia; a part of the lake Dascylitis belongs to them, the other part

belongs to the Byzantines. They also possess a large district near

the Dolionis, and the Mygdonis, extending as far as the lake

Miletopolitis, and the Apolloniatis. Through these countries

runs the river Rhyndacus, which has its source in the Azanitis.

The former lies entirely in the plain, the other is on a hill,

and occupied by a Roman colony. This was founded by the

Magnetes, who live near the Mæander. The Romans liberated

them from the dominion of the kings, when they delivered up

the rest of Asia within the Taurus to Eumenes. In this place

was established a priesthood of Men Arcæus, having attached

to it a multitude of sacred attendants, and tracts of sacred

territory. It was abolished after the death of Amyntas by

those who were sent to settle the succession to his kingdom.

with olives, about 60 stadia in extent. Beyond is Docimia, a

village, and the quarry of the Synnadic marble. This is the

name given to it by the Romans, but the people of the country

call it Docimite and Docimæan. At first the quarry produced

small masses, but at present, through the extravagance of the

Romans, pillars are obtained, consisting of a single stone and

of great size, approaching the alabastrite marble in variety

of colours; although the distant carriage of such heavy loads

to the sea is difficult, yet both pillars and slabs of surprising

magnitude and beauty are conveyed to Rome.

<p>Apameia is a large mart of Asia, properly so called,

and second in rank to Ephesus, for it is the common staple for

merchandise brought from Italy and from Greece. It is

built upon the mouth of the river Marsyas, which runs through

the middle of it, and has its commencement above the city;

being carried down to the suburb with a strong and precipitous current, it enters the Mæander,<note anchored="yes">Mender Tschai.</note> which receives also another river, the Orgas, and traverses a level tract with a gentle

and unruffled stream. Here the Meander becomes a large

river, and flows for some time through Phrygia; it then

separates Caria and Lydia at the plain, as it is called, of the

Meander, running in a direction excessively tortuous, so that

from the course of this river all windings are called Mæanders.

Towards its termination it runs through the part of Caria

occupied by the Ionians; the mouths by which it empties itself are between Miletus and Priene.<note anchored="yes">Samsun.</note> It rises in a hill called

Celæmæ, on which was a city of the same name. Antiochus

Soter transferred the inhabitants to the present Apameia, and

of Artabazus. She was given in marriage to Seleucus Nicator. Here is laid the scene of the fable of Olympus and

Marsyas, and of the contest between Marsyas and Apollo.

Above is situated a lake<note anchored="yes">The lake above Celænæ bore the name of Aulocrene or Pipe Fountain, probably from the reeds which grew there. Pliny, b. v. c. 29.</note> on which grows a reed, which is

spring the Marsyas and the Mæander.

<p>Laodiceia,<note anchored="yes">Urumluk.</note> formerly a small town, has increased in our

time, and in that of our ancestors, although it received great

injury when it was besieged by Mithridates Eupator; the

fertility however of the soil and the prosperity of some of its

citizens have aggrandized it. First, Hiero embellished the city

with many offerings, and bequeathed to the people more than

2000 talents; then Zeno the rhetorician, and his son Polemo,

were an ornament and support to it; the latter was thought

by Antony, and afterwards by Augustus Cæsar, worthy even

of the rank of king in consequence of his valiant and upright

conduct.
</p><p>The country around Laodiceia breeds excellent sheep, remarkable not only for the softness of their wool, in which they

surpass the Milesian flocks, but for their dark or raven colour. The Laodiceans derive a large revenue from them, as

the Colosseni do from their flocks, of a colour of the same

name.
</p><p>Here the Caprus and the Lycus, a large river, enter the

Mæander. From the Lycus, a considerable river, Laodiceia has

the name of Laodiceia on the Lycus. Above the city is the

mountain Cadmus, from which the Lycus issues, and another

river of the same name as the mountain. The greater part of

its course is under-ground; it then emerges, and unites with

other rivers, showing that the country abounds with caverns

and is liable to earthquakes. For of all countries Laodiceia is very subject to earthquakes, as also the neighbouring

district Carura.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Carura<note anchored="yes">The place is identified by the hot springs about 12 miles from Denizli or Jenidscheh.</note> is the boundary of Phrygia and Caria. It is



<pb n="335"/>



a village, where there are inns for the reception of travellers,

and springs of boiling water, some of which rise in the river

Mæander, and others on its banks. There is a story, that a

pimp had lodgings in the inns for a great company of women,

and that during the night he and all the women were overwhelmed by an earthquake and disappeared. Nearly the

whole of the country about the Mæander, as far as the inland

parts, is subject to earthquakes, and is undermined by fire and

water. For all this cavernous condition of the country, beginning from the plains, extends to the Charonia; it exists likewise in Hierapolis, and in Acharaca in the district Nysæis, also

in the plain of Magnesia, and in Myus. The soil is dry and

easily reduced to powder, full of salts, and very inflammable.

This perhaps is the reason why the course of the Mæander is

winding, for the stream is diverted in many places from its

direction, and brings down a great quantity of alluvial soil,

some part of which it deposits in various places along the

shore, and forcing the rest forwards occasions it to drift into

the open sea. It has made, for example, Priene, which was

formerly upon the sea, an inland city, by the deposition of

banks of alluvial earth along an extent of 40 stadia.

the places between the Mæander and the Lydians are all of

this nature, as well on account of the number of lakes and

rivers, as the caverns, which are to be found in many parts of

the country. The waters of the lake between Laodiceia and

Apameia, although like a sea, emit a muddy smell, as if they

had come through a subterraneous channel. It is said that

actions are brought against the Mæander for transferring land

from one place to another by sweeping away the angles of the

windings, and a fine is levied out of the toll, which is paid at

the ferries.

to be excused, but encouraged, for the reader should not impute the fault of prolixity to us, but to those whose curiosity

and desire of information respecting the celebrated places of

antiquity is to be gratified. The prolixity is greater than it

would be otherwise, from the great number of nations, both

Greeks and Barbarians, who have occupied the country, and

from the disagreement among writers, who do not relate the

same things of the same persons and places, nor even do they

express themselves with clearness. Among these in particular

is Homer, who suggests occasions for conjecture in the greatest part of his local descriptions. We are therefore to examine what the poet and other writers advance, premising a

summary description of the nature of the places.

<p>The coast of the Propontis extends from Cyzicene and

and Sestos.<note anchored="yes">The ruins of Abydos are on the eastern side of the Hellespont, near a

about Ilium, and Tenedos and Alexandreia Troas.<note anchored="yes">Eski Stamboul, or Old Constantinople.</note> Above

all these is the mountain Ida, extending as far as Lectum.

From Lectum to the river Caïcus<note anchored="yes">Bakir-Tschai, or Germasti.</note> and the Canæ mountains

as they are called is the district comprising Assus,<note anchored="yes">Beiram-koi, or Asso, or Adschane.</note> Adramyttium,<note anchored="yes">Edremid or Adramytti.</note> Atarneus,<note anchored="yes">Dikeli-koi.</note> Pitane,<note anchored="yes">Tschandarlik.</note> and the Elaïtic bay, opposite to all

Ionia begins, and Æolis terminates. Such then is the nature

of the country.
</p><p>The poet implies that it was the Trojans chiefly who were

divided into eight or even nine bodies of people, each forming a petty princedom, who had under their sway the places

about Æsepus, and those about the territory of the present

Cyzicene, as far as the river Caïcus. The troops of auxiliaries

are reckoned among the allies.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The writers subsequent to Homer do not assign the

same boundaries, but introduce other names, and a greater

number of territorial divisions. The Greek colonies were the

cause of this; the Ionian migration produced less change,

for it was further distant from the Troad, but the Æolian

colonists occasioned it throughout, for they were dispersed

over the whole of the country from Cyzicene as far as

the Caïcus, and occupied besides the district between the

Caïcus and the river Hermus. It is said that the Æolian

preceded the Ionian migration four generations, but it was attended with delays, and the settlement of the colonies took up

a longer time. Orestes was the leader of the colonists, and

died in Arcadia. He was preceded by his son Penthilus,

who advanced as far as Thrace, sixty years<note anchored="yes">The return of the Heracleidæ having taken place, according to Thu-

Thucydides, in the same chapter, and in the space of a few lines, speaks of

the return of the Bœotians to their own country, as having taken place

sixty years after the capture of Troy; and of the return of the Heracleidæ

to the Peloponnesus, as having taken place eighty years after the same

event; it is probable that Strabo, who followed Thucydides, substituted,

through inattention, one number for another.</note> after the Trojan

war, about the time of the return of the Heracleidæ to Peloponnesus. Then Archelaus the son of Penthilus conducted

the Æolian colonies across the sea to the present Cyzicene,

near Dascylium. Gras his youngest son proceeded as far as

the river Granicus, and, being provided with better means,

transported the greater part of those who composed the expedition to Lesbos, and took possession of it.
</p><p>On the other side, Cleuas, the son of Dorus, and Malaus,

who were descendants of Agamemnon, assembled a body of

men for an expedition about the same time as Penthilus, but

the band of Penthilus passed over from Thrace into Asia before them; while the rest consumed much time near Locris,

and the mountain Phricius. At last however they crossed the

sea, and founded Cyme, to which they gave the name of Phriconis, from Phricius, the Locrian mountain.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Æolians then were dispersed over the whole country, which we have said the poet calls the Trojan country.

Later writers give this name to the whole, and others to a part,

of Æolis; and so, with respect to Troja, some writers understand the whole, others only a part, of that country, not entirely agreeing with one another in anything.
</p><p>According to Homer, the commencement of the Troad is at

different writers assign different limits to this country.

Charon of Lampsacus diminishes its extent by three hundred

stadia more, by reckoning its commencement from Practius,

for this is the distance between Parium and Practius, but

protracts it to Adramyttium. It begins, according to Scylax

of Caryanda, at Abydos. There is the same diversity of

which the present Gargara, an Æolian city, has its name.

Between Zeleia and Lectum, proceeding from the Propontis, are

<p>On doubling Lectum a large bay opens,<note anchored="yes">The Gulf of Edremid or Jalea, the ancient Elea.</note> formed by

Mount Ida, which recedes from Lectum, and by Canæ, the

promontory opposite to Lectum on the other side. Some persons call it the Bay of Ida, others the Bay of Adramyttium.

On this bay are situated the cities of the Æolians, extending, as we have said, to the mouths of the Hermus. I have

mentioned also in a former part of my work, that in sailing

from Byzantium in a straight line towards the south, we first

arrive at Sestos and Abydos through the middle of the Propontis; then at the sea-coast of Asia as far as Caria. The

readers of this work ought to attend to the following observation; although we mention certain bays on this coast, they

must understand the promontories also which form them,

situated on the same meridian.<note anchored="yes">The meridian, according to our author's system, passing through Constantinople, Rhodes, Alexandria, Syene, and Meröe.</note>

<p>Those who have paid particular attention to this subject conjecture, from the expressions of the poet, that all

this coast was subject to the Trojans, when it was divided

into nine dynasties, but that at the time of the war it was

under the sway of Priam, and called Troja. This appears

from the detail. Achilles and his army perceiving, at the beginning of the war, that the inhabitants of Ilium were defended by walls, carried on the war beyond them, made a circuit, and took the places about the country;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">I sacked with my ships twelve cities, and eleven in the fruitful land of

<pb n="343"/>



By Troja he means the continent which he had ravaged.

Among other places which had been plundered, was the

country opposite Lesbos,—that about Thebe, Lyrnessus, and

Pedasus belonging to the Leleges, and the territory also of

Eurypylus, the son of Telephus;

<p>Such was the state of the country at that time. Afterwards changes of various kinds ensued. Phrygians occupied

the country about Cyzicus as far as Practius; Thracians, the

country about Abydos; and Bebryces and Dryopes, before the

time of both these nations. The next tract of country was

occupied by Treres, who were also Thracians; the plain of

Thebe, by Lydians, who were then called Mæonians, and by

the survivors of the Mysians, who were formerly governed by

Telephus and Teuthoras.
</p><p>Since then the poet unites together Æolis and Troja, and

since the Æolians occupied all the country from the Hermus

not do wrong in combining in one description Æolis, properly

so called, (extending from the Hermus to Lectum,) and the

tract which follows, as far as the Æsepus; distinguishing them

again in speaking of them separately, and comparing what

is said of them by Homer and by other writers with their present state.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>According to Homer, the Troad begins from the city

Cyzicus and the river Æsepus. He speaks of it in this

manner:

Ida, who drink the dark waters of Æsepus, these were led by Pandarus,

These people he calls also Lycians. They had the name of

Aphneii, it is thought, from the lake Aphnitis, for this is the

name of the lake Dascylitis.

the Æsepus discharges itself.
</p><p>The poet then immediately gives in detail the parts of the

sea-coast which follow the Æsepus;

These places lie below Zeleia, and are occupied by Cyziceni,

and Priapeni as far as the sea-coast. The river Tarsius<note anchored="yes">Karadere.</note>

runs near Zeleia; it is crossed twenty times on the same road,

like the Heptaporus, mentioned by the poet, which is crossed

seven times. The river flowing from Nicomedia to Nicæa is

crossed four-and-twenty times; the river which flows from

Pholoe to Eleia, several times; [that flowing from * * * * to

<p>Above the mouth of the Æsepus about * * stadia is a

hill on which is seen the sepulchre of Memnon, the son of

Tithonus. Near it is the village of Memnon. Between the

Æsepus and Priapus flows the Granicus, but for the most

part it flows through the plain of Adrasteia, where Alexander

defeated in a great battle the satraps of Dareius, and obtained

possession of all the country within the Taurus and the Euphrates.
</p><p>On the banks of the Granicus was the city Sidene, with a

</p><p>Upon the confines of Cyzicene and Priapene is Harpagia, a

away by force. Others say that it was at the promontory

Dardanium, near Dardanus.

<p>Priapus is a city on the sea, with a harbour. Some

say that it was built by Milesians, who, about the same time,

founded Abydos and Proconnesus; others, that it was built

by Cyziceni. It has its name from Priapus,<note anchored="yes">Peor Apis, or Baal Peor?</note> who is worshipped there; either because his worship was transferred

thither from Orneæ near Corinth, or the inhabitants were

disposed to worship him because the god was said to be the

son of Bacchus and a nymph, for their country abounds with

vines, as also the country on their confines, namely, the territory

of the Pariani and of the Lampsaceni. It was for this reason

that Xerxes assigned Lampsacus<note anchored="yes">Lapsaki or Lampsaki.</note> to Themistocles to supply

him with wine.
</p><p>It was in later times that Priapus was considered as a god.

Hesiod for instance knew nothing of Priapus, and he resembles the Athenian gods Orthane, Conisalus, Tychon, and

others such as these.

<p>This district was called Adrasteia, and the plain of

Adrasteia, according to the custom of giving two names to the

same place, as Thebe, and the plain of Thebe; Mygdonia,

and the plain of Mygdonia.
</p><p>Callisthenes says that Adrasteia had its name from King

Adrastus, who first built the temple of Nemesis. The city

Adrasteia is situated between Priapus and Parium, with a

plain of the same name below it, in which there was an oracle

of the Actæan Apollo and Artemis near the sea-shore.<note anchored="yes">The reading is very doubtful.</note> On

the demolition of the temple, all the furniture and the stonework were transported to Parium, where an altar, the workmanship of Hermocreon, remarkable for its size and beauty,

was erected, but the oracle, as well as that at Zeleia, was

abolished. No temple either of Adrasteia or Nemesis exists.

But there is a temple of Adrasteia near Cyzicus. Antimachus,

however, says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">There is a great goddess Nemesis, who has received all these things

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The city of Parium lies upon the sea, with a harbour

larger than that of Priapus, and has been augmented from the

latter city; for the Pariani paid court to the Attalic kings,

to whom Priapene was subject, and, by their permission, appropriated to themselves a large part of that territory.
</p><p>It is here the story is related that the Ophiogeneis have

persons bitten by serpents by touching them without intermission, after the manner of the enchanters. They first

transfer to themselves the livid colour occasioned by the bite,

and then cause the inflammation and pain to subside. According to the fable, the founder of the race of Ophiogeneis, a

hero, was transformed from a serpent into a man. He was

perhaps one of the African Psylli. The power continued in

the race for some time.

Others say that it was a hill forty stadia from Lampsacus, on

which was a temple sacred to the mother of the gods, surnamed Tereia.

<p>Lampsacus, situated on the sea, is a considerable city

Colonæ also is a colony of Milesians. It is situated above

Lampsacus, in the interior of the territory Lampsacene.

There is another Colonæ situated upon the exterior Hellespontic Sea, at the distance of 140 stadia from Ilium; the

birth-place, it is said, of Cycnus. Anaximenes mentions a

Colonæ in the Erythræan territory, in Phocis, and in Thessaly. Iliocolone is in the Parian district. In Lampsacene is

a place well planted with vines, called Gergithium, and there

was a city Gergitha, founded by the Gergithi in the Cymæan

Abydos and Lampsacus; the words, therefore,

Dardanus called Gyges. Abydos is situated upon the mouth

of the Propontis and the Hellespont, and is at an equal distance from Lampsacus and Ilium, about 170 stadia. At Abydos is the Hepta Stadium, (or strait of seven stadia,) the shores

of which Xerxes united by a bridge. It separates Europe

from Asia. The extremity of Europe is called Cherronesus,

from its figure; it forms the straits at the Zeugma (or Junction)<note anchored="yes">A bridge of boats which could be unfixed at pleasure for the passage

proximity to Abydos was placed under the command of the

same governor, at a time when the same limits were not assigned to the governments and to the continents. Sestos and

Abydos are distant from each other, from harbour to harbour,

about 30 stadia. The Zeugma is a little beyond the cities;

on the side of the Propontis, beyond Abydos, and on the opposite side, beyond Sestos. There is a place near Sestos,

called Apobathra, where the raft was fastened. Sestos lies

nearer the Propontis, and above the current which issues from

it; whence the passage is more easy from Sestos by deviating

a little towards the tower of Hero, when, letting the vessel go

at liberty, the stream assists in effecting the crossing to the

other side. In crossing from Abydos to the other side persons

must sail out in the contrary direction, to the distance of about

eight stadia towards a tower which is opposite Sestos; they

must then take an oblique course, and the current will not be

entirely against them.
</p><p>After the Trojan war, Abydos was inhabited by Thracians,

then by Milesians. When the cities on the Propontis were

burnt by Dareius, father of' Xerxes, Abydos shared in the

calamity. Being informed, after his return from Scythia,

that the Nomades were preparing to cross over to attack him,

in revenge for the treatment which they had experienced, he

set fire to these cities, apprehending that they would assist in

transporting the Scythian army across the strait.

<p>Plato conjectures that, after the deluges, three kinds

of communities were established; the first on the heights of

the mountains, consisting of a simple and savage race, who

had taken refuge there through dread of the waters, which

overflowed the plains; the second, at the toot of the mountains, who regained courage by degrees, as the plains began

to dry; the third, in the plains. But a fourth, and perhaps

a fifth, or more communities might be supposed to be

formed, the last of which might be on the sea-coast, and

in the islands, after all fear of deluge was dissipated. For

as men approached the sea with a greater or less degree

of courage, we should have greater variety in forms of

government, diversity also in manners and habits, accord-

ing as a simple and savage people assumed the milder cha-

racter of the second kind of community. There is, however, a distinction to be observed even among these, as of

rustic, half rustic, and of civilized people. Among these

finally arose a gradual change, and an assumption of names,

applied to polished and high character, the result of an improved moral condition produced by a change of situation

and mode of life. Plato says that the poet describes these

differences, alleging as an example of the first form of society

the mode of life among the Cyclops, who subsisted on the

fruits of the earth growing spontaneously, and who occupied

certain caves in the heights of mountains;

the ancient city, and have furnished a subject of discussion to

those who form their conjectures from the poetry of Homer;

but it does not seem to be the city meant by the poet. Other

writers also relate, that the city had frequently changed its

<p>The present city of Ilium was once, it is said, a village,

containing a small and plain temple of Minerva; that Alexander, after<note anchored="yes">According to Arrian and Plutarch, it was before his victory.</note> his victory at the Granicus, came up, and decorated the temple with offerings, gave it the title of city, and

ordered those who had the management of such things to improve it with new buildings; he declared it free and exempt

from tribute. Afterwards, when he had destroyed the Persian

empire, he sent a letter, expressed in kind terms, in which he

promised the Ilienses to make theirs a great city, to build a

temple of great magnificence, and to institute sacred games.
</p><p>After the death of Alexander, it was Lysimachus who

took the greatest interest in the welfare of the place; built

a temple, and surrounded the city with a wall of about 40

stadia in extent. He settled here the inhabitants of the ancient cities around, which were in a dilapidated state. It was

at this time that he directed his attention to Alexandreia,

founded by Antigonus, and surnamed Antigonia, which was

altered (into Alexandreia). For it appeared to be an act of

pious duty in the successors of Alexander first to found cities

which should bear his name, and afterwards those which should

be called after their own. Alexandreia continued to exist, and

became a large place; at present it has received a Roman

colony, and is reckoned among celebrated cities.

command of Fimbrias. They took it by siege in the Mithridatic war. Fimbrias was sent as quæstor, with the consul

Valerius Flaccus, who was appointed to carry on the war

against Mithridates. But having excited a sedition, and put

the consul to death in Bithynia, he placed himself at the head

of the army and advanced towards Ilium, where the inhabit-

ants refused to admit him into the city, as they regarded him

as a robber. He had recourse to force, and took the city on the

eleventh day. When he was boasting that he had taken a

city on the eleventh day, which Agamemnon had reduced with

conciliated the Ilienses by extensive repairs of their city. In

them a district, and guaranteed their liberty with exemption

from imposts, and they continue at present to enjoy these advantages. They maintain by this evidence that the ancient

creek the 12 stadia must be measured which Strabo reckons from the

Port of the Achæans to New Ilium. These 12 stadia, estimated at 700 to

a degree, (like the generality of other measures adopted by Strabo in this

district,) are equal to 977 toises, and conduct in a straight line to the

western point of the mountain Tchiblak, where there are remains of

edge of the table-land of Tchiblak, in a spot where ruins of a temple and

other edifices are seen. Thus there is nothing to prevent our taking this

place for the site of the town of the Ilienses, and this is the opinion of

many modern travellers. But did this town occupy the same ground as

Let us, however, dismiss this subject, for the discussion leads

to the refutation of fables only, and probably there may be

reasons unknown to us which induced the Ilienses to worship

some of these persons, and not others. The poet seems, in

speaking of Hercules, to represent the city as small, since he

was also formerly a city Cybrene. Demetrius (of Scepsis)

called the Scamander. This opinion, lately renewed by Major Rennell,

presents great and even insurmountable difficulties when we endeavour to

explain on this basis the principal circumstances of the Iliad. It must be

remembered that in the time of Demetrius the remembrance of the position of ancient Troy was entirely lost, and that this author constantly

so great a body of men, both inhabitants and auxiliaries; for

the wall, Homer says, was constructed at a late period; or perhaps no wall was built and the erection and destruction of it,

as Aristotle says, are due to the invention of the poet;—a want

of spirit on the part of the Trojans, who, after the wall was

built, attacked that, and the Naustathmus, and the vessels

themselves, but had not the courage before there was a wall

</p><p>Nor is the course of Hector round the city at all a probable

circumstance, for the present city will not admit of a circuit

round it on account of the continuous ridge of hill, but the

ancient city did allow such a course round it.<note anchored="yes">M. Lechevalier, who extends Ilium and its citadel Pergamus to the

highest summit of the mountain Bounar-bachi, acknowledges that the

nature of the ground would prevent the course of Hector and Achilles

taking place round this position, in consequence of the rivers and the precipices which surround it on the S. E. To meet the objection which

these facts would give rise to, M. Lechevalier interprets the expressions

of Homer in a manner never thought of by the ancient grammarians,

although they contorted the text in every possible manner, to bend it to

their peculiar opinions. Would it not be more easy to believe that at

the time of the siege of Troy this city was no longer on the summit of

the mountain, nor so near its ancient acropolis as it was at first; and that

the inhabitants moved under the reign of Ilus, as Plato says, and as Homer leads us to conclude, to the entrance of the plain and to the lower

rising grounds of Ida? The level ground on the top mountain which

rises above Bounar-bachi, and on which it has been attempted to trace the

contour of the walls of ancient Ilium and of its citadel, is more than 3200

toises in circumference.

<p>But it is difficult to conceive how, at so distant a period and among a

people half savage, a space of ground so large and without water could

be entirely occupied by a town, whose power scarcely extended beyond

25 leagues. On the other hand, as the exterior circuit of this mountain

is more than 5500 toises, it is not to be conceived how Homer, so exact

in his description of places, should have represented Achilles and Hector,

already fatigued by a long-continued battle, as making an uninterrupted

course of about seven leagues round this mountain, before commencing

in single combat. It appears to me therefore that the Troy of Homer

must have covered a much less space of ground than is generally supposed, and according to all appearances this space was bounded by a

hillock, on which is now the village of Bounar-bachi. This hillock is

about 700 or 800 toises in circumference; it is isolated from the rest of the

mountain; and warriors in pursuing one another could easily make the

circuit. This would not prevent Pergamus from being the citadel of

Ilium, but it was separated from it by an esplanade, which served as a

means of communication between the town and the fortress.—<emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></p></note>

<p>No trace of the ancient city remains. This might be

expected, for the cities around were devastated, but not entirely destroyed, whereas when Troy was overthrown from its

foundation all the stones were removed for the reparation of

the other cities. Archæanax of Mitylene is said to have fortified Sigeium with the stones brought from Troy. Sigeium

was taken possession of by the Athenians, who sent Phryno,

the victor in the Olympic games, at the time the Lesbians

advanced a claim to nearly the whole Troad. They had in-

deed founded most of the settlements, some of which exist at

present, and others have disappeared. Pittacus of Mitylene,

one of the seven wise men, sailed to the Troad against Phryno,

the Athenian general, and was defeated in a pitched battle.

(It was at this time that the poet Alcæus, as he himself says,

when in danger in some battle, threw away his arms and fled.

He charged a messenger with injunctions to inform those at

home that Alcæus was safe, but that he did not bring

away his arms. These were dedicated by the Athenians as

an offering in the temple of Minerva Glaucopis.)<note anchored="yes">This paragraph, according to Kramer is probably an interpolation.</note> Upon

Phryno's proposal to meet in single combat, Pittacus advanced with his fishing gear,<note anchored="yes">Herod. viii. c. 85.</note> enclosed his adversary in a

him with a short sword. The war however still continuing,

Periander was chosen arbitrator by both parties, and put an

end to it.

<p>Demetrius accuses Timæus of falsehood, for saying

that Periander built a wall round the Achilleium out of the

stones brought from Ilium as a protection against the attacks

of the Athenians, and with a view to assist Pittacus; whereas

this place was fortified by the Mitylenæans against Sigeium,

but not with stones from Ilium, nor by Periander. For how

should they choose an enemy in arms to be arbitrator?
</p><p>The Achilleium is a place which contains the monument of

Achilles, and is a small settlement. It was destroyed, as also

Sigeium, by the Ilienses on account of the refractory disposition of its inhabitants. For all the sea-coast as far as Dardanus was afterwards, and is at present, subject to them.

This however is not told by Homer. Nor was Homer acquainted with the violation of Cassandra,<note anchored="yes">Poets and mythologists subsequent to Homer supposed Cassandra,

the daughter of Priam, to have been violated by Ajax, the Locrian; that

as a punishment for his crime this hero perished by shipwreck on his return from Troy, and that three years afterwards Locris was visited by

a famine, which occasioned great destruction to the inhabitants. The

oracle consulted on the occasion of this calamity advised the Locrians to

send annually to Minerva of Ilium two young women chosen by lot.

They obeyed and continued to send them for 1000 years, until the time of

the sacred war.</note> but says that she

was a virgin about that time:

He does not mention any force having been used, nor does

he attribute the death of Ajax by shipwreck to the wrath of

Minerva, nor to any similar cause, but says, in general terms,

that he was an object of hatred to Minerva, (for she was incensed against all who had profaned her temple,) and that

Ajax died by the agency of Neptune for his boasting speeches.

<p>Ida is thought to be appropriately described by Homer,



<pb n="369"/>



as abounding with springs on account of the multitude of

rivers which issue from it, particularly where Dardania as

far as Scepsis lies at its foot, and the places about Ilium.
</p><p>Demetrius, who was acquainted with these places, (for he

was a native,) thus speaks of them: <q direct="unspecified">There is a height of

Ida called Cotylus; it is situated about 120 stadia above

Scepsis, and from it flow the Scamander, the Granicus, and

the Æsepus;<note anchored="yes">Modern maps place the Cotylus, and consequently the sources of the

river which Demetrius calls Scamander, at more than 30,000 toises, or

nearly eleven leagues, to the S. E. of the entrance of the Hellespont,

when the source of the Scamander should be near Troy; and Troy itself,

according to the measurement adopted by Demetrius, ought not to be

more than 3400 toises, or a league and a quarter, from the sea. There is

therefore a manifest contradiction, and it appears, as I have already remarked, that the river called Scamander by Demetrius, is not the river so

called by Homer, but the Simoïs of the <emph rend="ital">poet.—Gossellin.</emph>

<p>Modern travellers accuse Demetrius with having confounded the Scamander with the Simoïs. The Simoïs they say rises in Cotylus, (Kasdagh,) as also the Granicus, (Oustrola,) and the Æsepus, (Satal-dere,)

but the sources of the Scamander are below, and to the W. of Ida, near

the village called by the Turks Bounar-bachi, which signifies the head of

the source. If it is an error, Demetrius is not alone responsible for it,

as Hellenicus (Schol in Iliad xxi. 242) also says that the Scamander

had its source in Mount Ida itself. Both probably rested on the authority of Homer, who places the source of the Scamander in Ida. They did

not, however, observe that Homer employs the expression <foreign lang="greek">a)p' )Idai/wn</foreign>

<foreign lang="greek">o)re/wn</foreign> in a more extensive sense.—<emph rend="ital">Du Theil.</emph></p></note> the two last, being the contributions of many

smaller sources, fall into the Propontis, but the Scamander,

which has but a single source, flows towards the west. All

these sources are in the neighbourhood of each other, and are

comprised within a circuit of 20 stadia. The termination of

the Æsepus is farthest distant from its commencement,

namely, about 500 stadia.</q>
</p><p>We may, however, ask why the poet says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">They came to the fair fountains, whence burst forth two streams of the

eddying Scamander, one flowing with water warm,</q><note anchored="yes">Il xxii. 147.</note></quote>



that is, hot; he proceeds, however,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">around issues vapour as though caused by fire—the other gushes out in

the summer, cold like hail, or frozen as snow,</q></quote>



for no warm springs are now found in that spot, nor is the

source of the Scamander there, but in the mountain, and

there is one source instead of two.<note anchored="yes">We owe to the researches of M. de Choiseul Gouffier, published

without his knowledge in <date value="1793">1793</date>, an acquaintance with these two springs,

which present nearly the same phenomena as described by Homer.

These springs have since been seen by many travellers; they are situated

at the foot of a small hill on which is Bounar-bachi, and about 6500

toises in a straight line from the mouth of the Menderé. The stream which

flows from them never fails, and after having run for some time parallel

to the Menderé, it turns suddenly to throw itself into the Archipelago,

near the middle of the interval which separates the ruins of Alexandria-

Troas from the cape Koum-kale, but still leaving traces of a bed through

which it formerly flowed to join the Menderé. We are now convinced

that this little river is the Scamander of Homer, that the present Menderé is the Simoïs of that poet, and that the ancient Ilium, which was

near the sources of the Scamander, must have been situated on the

heights of Bounar-bachi.

<p>In the time of Homer these two rivers united together and discharged

themselves into the sea by the same mouth: but the course of the Scamander has been changed for a long time, since, according to Pliny, (v.

c. 33,)a part of its waters spread themselves over a marsh, and the remainder flowed unto the Ægæan Sea, between Alexandria-Troas and

Sigeum. This ancient author therefore gave to the little river (which

he called Palæscamander, the old Scamander) exactly the same course

which the stream Bounar-bachi still follows. This change of direction

in the course of the river appears to me to have been anterior to the time

of Demetrius of Scepsis, for this alone can explain his error. For, no

longer finding a stream which runs on the left of the present Menderé,

and which might represent the Scamander, he thought proper to transfer

this latter name to the Simoïs, and to look for the site of the Ilium of

Homer, as also of the plain which was the scene of the combats described by the poet, on the right of this river. Thence he is persuaded

that the town of the Ilienses occupied the same site as the ancient Ilium,

and that the stream of the Tschiblak was the Simoïs.
</p><p>I must remark that the Menderé is a torrent, the waters of which fail

during a great part of the year, whilst the stream of the Bounar-bachi

always continues to flow. This advantage is probably the reason why it

preserved the name of Scamander to the sea, although it ran into the bed

of the Simoïs and was far inferior to this torrent in the length of its course.

Hence it may be perceived how the name of Scamander, now changed

into that of Menderé, has remained attached to this ancient mouth, how

ultimately it was given to the whole course of the Simoïs, and how Demetrius of Scepsis was led into error by the change in the course of the

true Scamander, and by the transfer of its name to the Simois.—Voyage

close to Lectum. But at present Alexandreia is continuous

with the Achæium; the inhabitants of those small towns, and

of many other strongholds, were embodied in Alexandreia.

Among the latter were Cebrene and Neandria. The territory

Alexandreia is now situated was called Sigia.

Smintheus was not confined to the town of Chrysa alone; it was common

to all the continent of the Troad and to the adjacent islands; it extended

along the whole coast to the island of Rhodes, as Strabo afterwards informs

us. He has already told us that there was a temple of Apollo Smintheus

in the island of Tenedos. Coins of this island exist, bearing the effigy of

the god with a rat under the chin. The town of Hamaxitus, on the continent, had also its temple of Apollo Smintheus, where was not only to be

seen the picture of a rat near the tripod of the god, but also tame rats,

maintained at the public expense.</note> They are

</p><p>The Teucri, who came from Crete, (of whom Callinus, the

elegiac poet, gave the first history, and he was followed by

many others,) were directed by an oracle to settle wherever

the earth-born inhabitants should attack them, which, it is

said, occurred to them near Hamaxitus, for in the night-time

great multitudes of field-mice came out and devoured all arms

or utensils which were made of leather; the colony therefore

settled there. These people also called the mountain Ida,

after the name of the mountain in Crete.

But Heracleides of Pontus says, that the mice, which

swarmed near the temple, were considered as sacred, and the

statue is represented as standing upon a mouse.
</p><p>Others say, that a certain Teucer came from Attica, who

belonged to the Demus of Troes, which is now called Xypeteon, but that no Teucri came from Crete. They adduce as

a proof of the intermixture of Trojans with Athenians, that

an Ericthonius was a founder of both people.

called Satnioeis, but a river, on which the city is placed. The

city is at present deserted. The poet mentions the river;

Later writers called it Satioeis, and some writers Saphnioeis.

It is a great winter torrent, which the poet, by mentioning it,

made remarkable. These places are continuous with the

<p>Palescepsis is situated above Cebrene towards the

Strabo perceived the absurdity of such an etymology. Others derived

(skepsis,) <emph rend="ital">a pretext,</emph> because it was on this part of the chain of Ida that

Rhea, on the birth of Jupiter, substituted for him a stone clothed as an

infant, and presented it to be devoured by Saturn in place of her child.

This etymology is conformable to analogy, although founded on a ridi-

culous fable.</note> either for some other reason or because it was

within view of the places around, if we may be allowed to

derive words then in use among Barbarians from the Greek

language. Afterwards the inhabitants were transferred to

the present Scepsis, 60 stadia lower down, by Scamandrius,

the son of Hector, and by Ascanius, the son of Æneas; these

two families reigned, it is said, a long time at Scepsis. They

changed the form of government to an oligarchy; afterwards

the Milesians united with the Scepsians, and formed a democracy.<note anchored="yes">B. xiii. c. i. § 6.</note> The descendants of these families had nevertheless the name of kings, and held certain dignities. Antigonus incorporated the Scepsians with the inhabitants of

Alexandreia (Troas); Lysimachus dissolved this union, and

they returned to their own country.

<milestone n="53" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Scepsian (Demetrius) supposes that Scepsis was

the palace of Æneas, situated between the dominion of Æneas

and Lyrnessus, where, it is said, he took refuge when pursued by Achilles.



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Remember you not,</q> says Achilles, <q direct="unspecified">how I chased you when alone and

</p><p>Present traditions respecting Æneas do not agree with the

story respecting the first founders of Scepsis. For it is said

that he was spared on account of his hatred to Priam:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">he ever bore hatred to Priam, for never had Priam bestowed any

honour upon him for his valour.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xiii. 460.</note></quote>

his four sons, together with the surviving Heneti, are said to

have escaped into Thrace, and thence into Henetica on the Adriatic;<note anchored="yes">See note<seg rend="super">4</seg>, vol. i. p. 76.</note> but Æneas, with his father Anchises and his son Ascanius, are said to have collected a large body of people, and

to have set sail. Some writers say that he settled about the

Macedonian Olympus; according toothers he founded Capuæ,<note anchored="yes">Some assert that Capys, the father of Anchises, was the founder of

Capua or Capya in Italy. The town in Arcadia was afterwards called

Caphya or Caphyæ.</note>

near Mantineia in Arcadia, and that he took the name of the

city from Capys. There is another account, that he disembarked at Ægesta<note anchored="yes">Segesta.</note> in Sicily, with Elymus, a Trojan, and

took possession of Eryx<note anchored="yes">Trapani.</note> and Lilybæus,<note anchored="yes">Cape Boë.</note> and called the rivers

about Ægesta Scamander and Simoïs; that from Sicily he

went to Latium, and settled there in obedience to an oracle

enjoining him to remain wherever he should eat his table.

This happened in Latium, near Lavinium, when a large cake

of bread which was set down instead of, and for want of, a

table, was eaten together with the meat that was laid upon it.
</p><p>Homer does not agree either with these writers or with

what is said respecting the founders of Scepsis. For he represents Æneas as remaining at Troy, succeeding to the kingdom, and delivering the succession to his children's children

after the extinction of the race of Priam:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">the son of Saturn hated the family of Priam: henceforward Æneas

shall reign over the Trojans, and his children's children to late generations.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xx. 306.</note></quote>


</p><p>In this manner not even the succession of Scamandrius

could be maintained. He disagrees still more with those

writers who speak of his wanderings as far as Italy, and

make him end his days in that country. Some write the

verse thus:

<p>The Socratic philosophers, Erastus, Coriscus, and Neleus, the son of Coriscus, a disciple of Aristotle, and Theophrastus, were natives of Scepsis. Neleus succeeded to the

possession of the library of Theophrastus, which included that

of Aristotle; for Aristotle gave his library, and left his school,

to Theophrastus. Aristotle<note anchored="yes">This statement is not in contradiction with those (A then. b. i. c. 3)

who assert that Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens, and Polycrates, tyrant of

Samos, were the first who formed libraries. The libraries of these two

princes, who lived six centuries before our time, were probably confined

to half a dozen poets, and it may be supposed that the care Pisistratus

took to collect the poems of Homer did not extend to poets posterior to

his time. But in the time of Aristotle there existed many poems, a

great number of oratorical discourses, historical works, and various

treatises of philosophy.</note> was the first person with whom

we are acquainted who made a collection of books, and suggested to the kings of Ægypt the formation of a library.

Theophrastus left his library to Neleus, who carried it to

Scepsis, and bequeathed it to some ignorant persons who kept

the books locked up, lying in disorder. When the Scepsians

understood that the Attalic kings, on whom the city was dependent, were in eager search for books, with which they intended to furnish the library at Pergamus, they hid theirs in

an excavation under-ground; at length, but not before they had

been injured by damp and worms, the descendants of Neleus

sold the books of Aristotle and Theophrastus for a large sum

of money to Apellicon of Teos. Apellicon<note anchored="yes">Apellicon proclaimed himself a philosopher of the school of Aristotle.

From what Athenæus, b. v., says of him, he appears to have used his

great wealth for the purposes of ostentation rather than of employing it

for the benefit of others. He was sent by Aristion, (or Athenion, as

Athenæus calls him,) tyrant of Athens, to Delos, at the head of ten thousand soldiers, to remove the treasures of the temple. He was defeated

by the Romans, and having lost his whole army, escaped with difficulty.</note> was rather a

lover of books than a philosopher; when therefore he attempted to restore the parts which had been eaten and corroded by

worms, he made alterations in the original text and introduced

them into new copies; he moreover supplied the defective parts

unskilfully, and published the books full of errors. It was the

misfortune of the ancient Peripatetics, those after Theophrastus, that being wholly unprovided with the books of Aristotle, with the exception of a few only, and those chiefly of

the exoteric<note anchored="yes">This name was given to books intended to be seen and read by every

only communicated to those of his own school. The books which contained these doctrines were called, by way of distinction, <emph rend="ital">esoteric.</emph> Such

at least is the opinion of those who admit of the existence of a secret doctrine, and a public doctrine, in the philosophy of Aristotle. This passage

of Strabo however seems to favour those who maintained a different

opinion, namely, that this celebrated distinction of <emph rend="ital">exoteric</emph> and <emph rend="ital">esoteric</emph>

doctrines, which is peculiar to the works of Aristotle, is not founded on

any essential difference of doctrine, but rather on a difference of method,

so that the word <emph rend="ital">esoteric</emph> was applied to works where the opinions of the

philosopher were set forth in a manner to be understood by all intelligent

readers, whether of his own school or strangers; and <emph rend="ital">esoteric</emph> to those

works where his opinions were thoroughly discussed, and in a scientific

to the principles of the system, and merely occupied themselves in elaborate discussions on common places. Their successors however, from the time that these books were published, philosophized, and propounded the doctrine of Aristotle

more successfully than their predecessors, but were under the

necessity of advancing a great deal as probable only, on account of the multitude of errors contained in the copies.
</p><p>Even Rome contributed to this increase of errors; for immediately on the death of Apellicon, Sylla, who captured

Athens, seized the library of Apellicon. When it was

brought to Rome, Tyrannion,<note anchored="yes">Tyrannion was a native of Amisus, whose lectures he attended (b. xii.

c. iii. § 16). He is often quoted among the commentators of Homer.

It was he also who gave copies of the works of Aristotle to Andronicus

admirer of Aristotle, courted the superintendent of the library

and obtained the use of it. Some vendors of books, also,

employed bad scribes and neglected to compare the copies

with the original. This happens in the case of other books

which are copied for sale both here and at Alexandreia.
</p><p>This may suffice on this subject.

<milestone n="55" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Demetrius the grammarian, whom we have frequently

mentioned, was a native of Scepsis. He composed a comment on the catalogue of the Trojan forces. He was contemporary with Crates and Aristarchus. He was succeeded

by Metrodorus,<note anchored="yes">Metrodorus was not only a fellow-countryman of Demetrius, who was

one of the richest and most distinguished citizens of Scepsis, but also his

contemporary and protegé. A small treatise of Metrodorus is cited, entitled <foreign lang="greek">peo|i\ a)leiptikh=s,</foreign> which may mean <q direct="unspecified">on anointing with oil,</q> or

<q direct="unspecified">on oil used in the public exercises.</q> It seems however very probable

that the treatise on the Troad, (<foreign lang="greek">to|wi+ka\,</foreign>) which Athenæus attributes to

another Metrodorus of Chios, was the work of this Metrodorus of Scepsis. The place of his birth, which was in the Troad, might have suggested,

as it did to his patron, the idea of treating a subject liable to discussion,

and to endeavour to throw light upon it by the words of Homer. Add to

this that Strabo quotes also Metrodorus on the subject of the Amazons,

whose history appears so closely connected with the Trojan war that all

who have touched on the one, have also treated of the other. Pliny quotes

also a Metrodorus on the subject of the serpents of the river Rhyndacus,

near the Troad. It is also a question whether Metrodorus was one of

those who occupied themselves with mnemonics, or the art of increasing

and strengthening the memory. According to Plutarch, Metrodorus

was the victim of Mithridates. Tigranes, who had placed the philosopher in his power, more from inadvertence than intentionally, so much

regretted his death that he celebrated magnificent obsequies to his

memory.</note> who changed from being a philosopher to

engage in public affairs. His writings are for the most part

in the style of the rhetoricians. He employed a new and

striking kind of phraseology. Although he was poor, yet, in

consequence of the reputation which he had acquired, he

married a rich wife at Chalcedon, and acquired the surname

of the Chalcedonian. He paid great court to Mithridates

Eupator, whom he accompanied with his wife on a voyage to

Pontus, and received from him distinguished honours. He

was appointed to preside over a tribunal where the party

condemned by the judge had no power of appeal to the king.

His prosperity however was not lasting, for he incurred the

enmity of some very unjust persons, and deserted from the

king at the very time that he was despatched on an embassy

to Tigranes the Armenian. Tigranes sent him back much

against his inclination to Eupator, who was then flying from

his hereditary kingdom. Metrodorus died on the road, either

in consequence of orders from the king, or by natural disease,

for both causes of his death are stated.

There is found at Andeira a stone, which when burnt becomes

with the addition of copper it becomes the compound called

</p><p>Cleanthes, the Stoic philosopher, was a native of this place.

He succeeded to the school of Zeno of Citium, and left it to

Chrysippus of Soli. Here also Aristotle resided for some

time, on account of his relationship to Hermeas the tyrant.

Hermeas was an eunuch, servant of a money-changer. When

he was at Athens he was the hearer both of Plato and of

Aristotle. On his return he became the associate in the

tyranny of his master, who attacked the places near Atarneus and Assus. He afterwards succeeded his master, sent

for both Aristotle and Xenocrates, and treated them with

kindness. He even gave his niece in marriage to Aristotle.

But Memnon of Rhodes, who was at that time general in the

service of the Persians, invited to his house Hermeas, under

the mask of friendship, and—on pretence of business. He

seized Hermeas, and sent him to the king, who ordered him

to be hanged. The philosophers, avoiding places in possession of the Persians, escaped by flight.

The Leleges were therefore a different people from the Carians, and lived between the people subject to Æneas and the

Cilicians, as they are called by the poet. After being plundered by Achilles, they removed to Caria, and occupied the

country about the present Halicarnassus.

<p>Pedasus, the city which they abandoned, is no longer

in existence. But in the interior of the country belonging to

Pedasa, and the territory has even now the name of Pedasis.

It is said that this district contained eight cities, occupied by

the Leleges, who were formerly so populous a nation as to

possess Caria as far as Myndus, Bargylia, and a great part of

Pisidia. In later times, when they united with the Carians in

the poet cannot mean Thebe, for that belonged to Eetion, but

Lyrnessus, for both cities lay in what was afterwards called

the plain of Thebe, which, on account of its fertility, was a

subject of contest among the Mysians and Lydians formerly,

and latterly among the Greeks who had migrated from Æolis

and Lesbos. At present Adramytteni possess the greater

part of it; there are Thebe and Lyrnessus, a strong place,

but both are deserted. One is situated at the distance of 60

stadia from Adramyttium on one side, and the other 88 stadia

on the other side.

<milestone n="62" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the Adramyttene district are Chrysa and Cilla.

There is at present near Thebe a place called Cilla, in which

is a temple of Apollo Cillæus. Beside it runs a river, which

comes from Mount Ida. These places are near Antandria.

The Cillæum in Lesbos has its name from this Cilla. There

is also amountain Cillæum between Gargara and Antandrus.

Dæs of Colonæ says that the temple of Apollo Cillæus was

founded at Colonæ by the Æolians, who came by sea from

Greece. At Chrysa also it is said that there is a Cillæan

Apollo, but it is uncertain whether it is the same as Apollo

Smintheus, or a different statue.

63. Chrysa is a small town on the sea-coast with a harbour.

Near and above it is Thebe. Here was the temple of

Apollo Smintheus, and here Chryseis lived. The place at present is entirely abandoned. To the present Chrysa, near Hamaxitus, was transferred the temple of the Cilicians, one party

of whom went to Pamphylia, the other to Hamaxitus. Those

who are not well acquainted with ancient histories say that

Chryses and Chryseis lived there, and that Homer mentions

the place. But there is no harbour at this place, yet Homer

says,



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>but when they entered the deep harbour,—</l></lg></quote>

Nor is it near Thebe, but it is near it, according to Homer, for

he says, that Chryseis was taken away from thence.

of the Alexandreia, (Troas,) nor a temple of Apollo Cillæus,

But it is in the plain of Thebe that they are seen near together. The voyage from the Cilician Chrysa to the Naustathmus (or naval station) is about 700 stadia, and occupies a

day, which is as much as Ulysses seems to have completed;

for immediately upon leaving the vessel he offers sacrifice to

the god, and being overtaken by the evening, remains there.

In the morning he sets sail. It is scarcely a third of the

above-mentioned distance from Hamaxitus, so that Ulysses

could have performed his sacrifice and have returned to the

Naustathmus the same day. There is also a monument of

Cillus, a large mound, near the temple of Apollo Cillæus.

He is said to have been the charioteer of Pelops, and to

have had the chief command in these parts. Perhaps the

country Cilicia had its name from him, or he had his from the

country.

Writers defend the derivation of titles from insignificant objects by examples of this kind; as from the parnopes, which

the Œtæsans call cornopes, Hercules had a surname, and was

worshipped under the title of Hercules Cornopion, because he

had delivered them from locusts. So the Erythræans, who

live near the river Melius, worship Hercules Ipoctonus, because he destroyed the ipes, or worms, which are destructive

to vines; for this pest is found everywhere except in the

country of the Erythræans. The Rhodians have in the island

a temple of Apollo Erythibius, so called from erysibe, (mildew,)

and which they call erythibe. Among the Æolians in Asia

one of their months is called Pornopion, for this name the

Bœotians give to parnopes, (locusts,) and a sacrifice is performed to Apollo Pornopion.

<p>The country about Adramyttium is Mysia. It was

once subject to Lydians, and there are now Pylæ Lydiæ (or

the Lydian Gates) at Adramyttium, the city having been

founded, it is said, by Lydians.
</p><p>Astyra also, the village near Adramyttium, is said to belong to Mysia. It was once a small city, in which was the

temple of Artemis Astyrene, situated in a grove. The Antandrians, in whose neighbourhood it is more immediately

situated, preside over it with great solemnity. It is distant

20 stadia from the ancient Chrysa, which also has a temple in

a grove. There too is the Rampart of Achilles. At the distance of 50 stadia in the interior is Thebe, uninhabited, which

the poet says was situated below the woody Placus; but

there is neither a place called Placus nor Plax there, nor a

wood above it, although it is near Ida.
</p><p>Thebe is distant from Astyra 70, and from Andeira 60

<p>At 100 stadia farther is Cane, the promontory opposite to Lectum, and forming the gulf of Adramyttium, of

which the Elaitic Gulf is a part. Canoe is a small city of the

Locrians who came from Cynus; it is situated in the Canæan

territory, opposite the most southerly extremities of Lesbos.

This territory extends to the Arginusæ, and the promontory

above, which some call Æga, or the goat. The second syllable however must be pronounced long, Aigan, like Actan

and Archan, for this was the name of the whole mountain,

which at present is called Cane, or Canæ.<note anchored="yes">It is difficult to clear up this passage <foreign lang="greek">h(\n AIGA tine\s o)noma/zousin</foreign>

which name Artemidorus actually gives to this promontory. But as our

language has no termination of cases, the passage requires some explanation. If the Greeks desired to express in the nominative case the position of the promontory with respect to the island of Lesbos, they would

say, according to Artemidorus, <emph rend="ital">The cape Æx</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">Ai+c</foreign>) <emph rend="ital">is in front of Lesbos;</emph>

according to Strabo, <emph rend="ital">The cape Æga</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">Ai)ga=</foreign>) <emph rend="ital">is in front of Lesbos.</emph> The

first, Æx, signifies <emph rend="ital">a goat,</emph> as Artemidorus intended; the second, Æga,

in the Doric dialect (for Æge, <foreign lang="greek">Ai)gh=</foreign>) means a goat's skin. If they desired

to employ the word in the accusative, they said, according to Artemidorus, <emph rend="ital">We have doubled Cape Æga</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">Ai=ga</foreign>); according to Strabo, <emph rend="ital">We have</emph>

<emph rend="ital">doubled Cape Ægan</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">Ai=ga</foreign>). The matter is clear thus far, but what follows, <foreign lang="greek">dei= de\ mako|ws</foreign> * * * <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)kta=n kai\ a)rxa=n</foreign> is difficult to explain.

The two last words are Doric genitive plurals, the first for <foreign lang="greek">a)ktw=n</foreign> <emph rend="ital">shores,</emph>

the second for <foreign lang="greek">a)rxw=n,</foreign> <emph rend="ital">beginnings;</emph> and yet one would expect to find

examples of accusatives in the singular number, as <foreign lang="greek">a)kta\n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)o|za\n;</foreign>

the difference of accent is here of no importance, for the last syllables of

these accusatives are long, as Strabo wishes to make the last syllable

long of Ægan (<foreign lang="greek">Ai)ga=n</foreign>). If he had required examples agreeing with this

last word in quantity, accent, and case, he might have cited sycan,

(<foreign lang="greek">suka=n,</foreign> a fig-tree,) or some other word of this form. It might be supposed that <foreign lang="greek">Akta=n</foreign> was here taken in the acceptation [<foreign lang="greek">a)kte/hn, a)kth=n,</foreign>

It inclines indeed towards the Ægnæan Sea, from which it has

the name (Ega), but afterwards the promontory itself was

called Æga, the name which Sappho gives it, and then Cane

69. Between Elæa, Pitane, Atarneus, and Pergamum on

this side the Caïcus, is Teuthrania, distant from none of

these places above 70 stadia. Teuthras is said to have been

king of the Cilicians and Mysians. According to Euripides,

Auge, with her son Telephus, was enclosed in a chest and

thrown into the sea, by command of her father Aleus, who

discovered that she had been violated by Hercules. By the

care of Minerva the chest crossed the sea, and was cast ashore

at the mouth of the Caïcus. Teuthras took up the mother

and her son, married the former, and treated the latter as his

own child. This is a fable, but another concurrence of circumstances is wanting to explain how the daughter of the

Arcadian became the wife of the king of the Mysians, and

how her son succeeded to the throne of the Mysians. It is

however believed that Teuthras and Telephus governed the

country lying about Teuthrania and the Caïcus, but the

poet mentions a few particulars only of this history:



<quote><q direct="unspecified">as when he slew the son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylns, and many of

his companions, the Ceæi, were killed around him for the sake of the

gifts of women.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. xi. 521.</note></quote>



Homer here rather proposes an enigma than a clear meaning. For we do not know who the Cetæi were, nor what people we are to understand by this name, nor what is meant by

the words, <q direct="unspecified">for the sake of the gifts of women.</q><note anchored="yes">Eurypylus, son of Telephus, being invited by Priam to come to his

assistance, answered that he could not do so without the permission of

his mother, Astyoche. Priam by rich presents obtained from her this

permission. There are other explanations equally uncertain. Bryant

asserts that the Cetæi were pirates, and exacted young women as tribute

from the people whom they attacked.</note> Gram-

marians adduce and compare with this other trifling stories,

but they indulge in invetion rather than solve the difficulty.

<milestone n="70" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Let us dismiss this doubtful matter, and turn to what

is more certain; for instance, according to Homer, Eurypylus

appears to have been king of the places about the Caïcus, so

that perhaps a part of the Cilicians were his subjects, and

that there were not only two but three dynasties among that

people.
</p><p>This opinion is supported by the circumstance that in the

Elaïtis there is a small river, like a winter torrent, of the

name of Ceteium. This falls into another like it, then again

into another, but all discharge themselves into the Caïcus.

The Caïcus does not flow from Ida, as Bacchylides says, nor

does Euripides say correctly that Marsyas



<quote><lg>

<l>inhabited the famous Celænæ, at the extremity of Ida,</l></lg></quote>



for Celænæ is at a great distance from Ida, and so are the

sources of the Caïcus, for they are to be seen in the plain.
</p><p>There is a mountain, Temnum, which separates this and

the plain of Asia; it lies in the interior above the plain of

Thebe. A river, Mysius, flows from Temnum and enters

the Caïcus below its source. Hence some persons suppose

that Æschylus refers to it in the beginning of the prologue

to the play of the Myrmidons,

them from their danger by killing

Contemporary with these persons flourished Sappho, an extraordinary woman; for at no period within memory has any

woman been known at all to be compared to her in poetry.
</p><p>At this period Mitylene was ruled by many tyrants, in consequence of the dissensions among the citizens. These dissensions are the subject of the poems of Alcæus called Stasiotica (the Seditions). One of these tyrants was Pittacus:

Alcæus inveighed against him as well as against Myrsilus,

Melanchrus the Cleanactidæ, and some others; nor was he

changes. Pittacus himself employed monarchical power to

dissolve the despotism of the many, but, having done this, he

restored the independence of the city.

the author of the Perfect Orator, the Life of Alexander the Great, the

Praise of Cæsar, the Praise of Brutus, and the Annals of Samos. Pliny

mentions a sculptor of the name of Lesbocles, whose name seems to indicate his origin from Lesbos. Athenæus also names a sculptor from

Mitylele called Lesbothemis. Strabo is probably the only person who

makes mention of Crinagoras. Theophanes is known as an historian, and

especially as the friend of Pompey, whom however he advised to retire to

Egypt. The philosopher Lesbonarx, lather of Potamo, was a native of

Mitylene.</note> The latter was versed in political

affairs, and became the friend of Pompey the Great, chiefly

on account of his accomplishments and assistance he afforded

in directing to a successful issue all his enterprises. Hence,

partly by means of Pompey, partly by his own exertions, he

became an ornament to his country, and rendered himself the

most illustrious of all the Grecians. He left a son, Mark

(Macer?) Pompey, whom Augustus Cæsar appointed prefect

of Asia, and who is now reckoned among the number of

the chief friends of Tiberius.

<p>SINCE there subsisted so great an affinity among the

Leleges and Cilicians with the Trojans, the reason is asked,

why these people are not included in Homer's Catalogue. Perhaps it is that, on account of the loss of their leaders and the

devastation of the cities, the few Cilicians that were left

placed themselves under the command of Hector. For Eetion

and his sons are said to have been killed before the Catalogue

is mentioned;



<quote><lg>

He has passed them over in the Catalogue, not considering

the body of people large enough to have a place in it; or he

comprised them among the people under the command of

Hector, as being allied to one another. For Lycaon, the

brother of Hector, says,

world to live but a short time; of Altes, king of the war-loving Leleges.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. xxi. 84.</note></quote>


</p><p>Such is the reasoning, from probability, which this subject

admits.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We reason from probability when we endeavour to determine by the words of the poet the exact bounds of the

territory of the Cilicians, Pelasgi, and of the people situated

between them, namely, the Ceteii, who were under the command of Eurypylus.
</p><p>We have said of the Cilicians and of the people under the

command of Eurypylus what can be said about them, and that

they are bounded by the country near the Caïcus.
</p><p>It is agreeable to probability to place the Pelasgi next to

these people, according to the words of Homer and other histories. Homer says,



<quote><q direct="unspecified">Hippothous led the tribes of the Pelasgi, who throw the spear, who inhabited the fertile Larisa; their leaders were Hippothous and Pylæus, a

son of Mars, both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, son of Teutamis.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 840.</note></quote>


</p><p>He here represents the numbers of Pelasgi as considerable,

for he does not speak of them as a tribe, but <q direct="unspecified">tribes,</q> and

specifies the place of their settlement, Larisa. There are

many places of the name of Larisa, but we must understand

some one of those near the Troad, and perhaps we might not

be wrong in supposing it to be that near Cyme; for of three

places of the name of Larisa, that near Hamaxitus is quite in

sight of Ilium and very near it, at the distance of about 200

stadia, so that Hippothous could not be said consistently with

probability to fall, in the contest about Patroclus,



<pb n="396"/>



<cit><quote><lg>

<l>far from Larisa<note anchored="yes"><bibl>Il. xvii. 301.</bibl></note></l></lg></quote><bibl>Il. xvii. 301.</bibl></cit>



at least from this Larisa, but rather from the Larisa near

Cyme, for there are about 1000 stadia between them. The

third Larisa is a village in the Ephesian district in the plain

of the Caÿster; which, it is said, was formerly a city containing a temple of Apollo Larisæus, and situated nearer to

Mount Tmolus than to Ephesus. It is distant from Ephesus

180 stadia, so that it might be placed rather under the government of the Mæonians. The Ephesians, having afterwards

acquired more power, deprived the Mæonians, whom we now

call Lydians, of a large part of their territory; but not even

this, but the other rather, would be the Larisa of the Pelasgi.

F o w e have no strong evidence that the Larisa in the plain

of Caÿster was in existence at that time, nor even of the existence of Ephesus. But all the Æolian history, relating to a

period a little subsequent to the Trojan times, proves the existence of the Larisa near Cyme.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is said that the people who set out from Phricium, a

Locrian mountain above Thermopylæ, settled on the spot

where Cyme is now situated; and finding the Pelasgi, who

had been great sufferers in the Trojan war, yet still in possession of Larisa, distant about 70 stadia from Cyme, erected as a

defence against them what is at present called Neon-teichos,

(or the New Wall,) 30 stadia from Larisa. They took Larisa,<note anchored="yes">Kramer adopts Coraÿ's correction of <foreign lang="greek">e(lo/ntas</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)lqo/ntas,</foreign> although

founded Cyme, and transferred to it as settlers the surviving

Pelasgi. Cyme is called Cyme Phriconis from the Locrian

mountain, and Larisa also (Phriconis): it is now deserted.
</p><p>That the Pelasgi were a great nation, history, it is said,

furnishes other evidence. For Menecrates of Elæa, in his

work on the foundation of cities, says, that the whole of the

present Ionian coast, beginning from Mycale and the neighbouring islands, were formerly inhabited by Pelasgi. But

the Lesbians say, that they were commanded by Pylæus, who

is called by the poet the chief of the Pelasgi, and that it was

from him that the mountain in their country had the name of

Pylæmem.
</p><p>The Chians also say, that the Pelasgi from Thessaly were



<pb n="397"/>



their founders. The Pelasgi, however, were a nation disposed

to wander, ready to remove from settlement to settlement, and

experienced both a great increase and a sudden diminution of

strength and numbers, particularly at the time of the Æolian

and Ionian migrations to Asia.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Something peculiar took place among the Larisæans in

the plain of the Cayster, in the Phriconis, and in Thessaly. All

of them occupied a country, the soil of which has been accumulated by rivers, by the Caÿster,<note anchored="yes">Kara-su, or Kutschuk-Meinder.</note> the Hermus,<note anchored="yes">Sarabat.</note> and the

Peneus.<note anchored="yes">Salambria.</note>
</p><p>At Larisa Phriconis Piasus is said to receive great honours. He was chief of the Pelasgi, and enamoured, it is

said, of his daughter Larisa, whom he violated, and was punished for the outrage. She discovered him leaning over a

cask of wine, seized him by his legs, lifted him up, and dropped him down into the vessel. These are ancient accounts.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>To the present Æolian cities we must add Ægæ and

Temnus, the birth-place of Hermagoras, who wrote a book on

the Art of Rhetoric.
</p><p>These cities are on the mountainous country which is above

the district of Cyme, and that of the Phocæans and Smyrnæans,

beside which flows the Hermus.
</p><p>Not far from these cities is Magnesia under Sipylus, made

a free city by a decree of the Romans. The late earthquakes

have injured this place. To the opposite parts, which incline

towards the Caïcus to Cyme from Larisa, in passing to which

the river Hermus is crossed, are 70 stadia; thence to Myrina

40 stadia; thence to Grynium 40 stadia, and thence to Elæa.

But, according to Artemidorus, next to Cyme is Adæ; then,

at the distance of 40 stadia, a promontory, which is called

Hydra, and forms the Elaïtic Gulf with the opposite promontory Harmatus. The breadth of the entrance is about 80

stadia, including the winding of the bays. Myrina, situated at

60 stadia, is an Æolian city with a harbour, then the harbour

of Achæans, where are altars of the twelve gods; next is

Grynium, a small city [of the Myrinæans], a temple of Apollo,

an ancient oracle, and a costly fane of white marble. To

Myrina are 40 stadia; then 70 stadia to Elæa, which has a

harbour and a station for vessels of the Attalic kings, founded



<pb n="398"/>



by Menestheus and the Athenians who accompanied him in

the expedition against Ilium.
</p><p>The places about Pitane, and Atarneus, and others in this

quarter, which follow Elæa, have been already described.

<p>Cyme is the largest and best of the Æolian cities.

This and Lesbos may be considered the capitals of the other

cities, about 30 in number, of which not a few exist no longer.

The inhabitants of Cyme are ridiculed for their stupidity, for,

according to some writers, it is said of them that they only

began to let the tolls of the harbour three hundred years after

the foundation of their city, and that before this time the town

had never received any revenue of the kind; hence the report

that it was late before they perceived that they inhabited a

city lying on the sea.
</p><p>There is another story, that, having borrowed money in the

name of the state, they pledged their porticos as security for

the payment of it. Afterwards, the money not having been

repaid on the appointed day, they were prohibited from walking in them. The creditors, through shame, gave notice by

the crier whenever it rained, that the inhabitants might take

shelter under the porticos. As the crier called out, <q direct="unspecified">Go

under the porticos,</q> a report prevailed that the Cymæans did

not perceive that they were to go under the porticos when it

rained unless they had notice from the public crier.<note anchored="yes">In spite of the improbability of these anecdotes, there must have

been something real in the dulness of the Cymæans; for Cymæan was

employed by the Greeks as a word synonymous with stupid. Cæsar,

among the Romans, (Plutarch, Cæsar,) adopted this name in the same

sense. This stupidity gave occasion to a proverb, <foreign lang="greek">o)/nos ei)s kumai/ous,</foreign> an

ass among the Cymæans, which was founded on the following story.

The first time an ass appeared among the Cymæans, the inhabitants, who

were unacquainted with the beast, deserted the town with such precipitation that it might be said they were escaping from an earthquake.</note>
</p><p>Ephorus, a man indisputably of high repute, a disciple of

Isocrates the orator, was a native of this city. He was an

historian, and wrote the book on Inventions.
</p><p>Hesiod the poet, who long preceded Ephorus, was a native

of this place, for he himself says, that his father Dius left

Cyme in Æolis and migrated to the Bœotians;



<quote><q direct="unspecified">he dwelt near Helicon in Ascra, a village wretched in winter, in summer oppressive, and not pleasant at any season.</q></quote>



<pb n="399"/>


</p><p>It is not generally admitted that Homer was from Cyme, for

many dispute about him.
</p><p>The name of the city was derived from an Amazon, as that

of Myrina was the name of an Amazon, buried under the

Batieia in the plain of Troy;

<p>PERGAMUM<note anchored="yes">Bergamo.</note> has a kind of supremacy among these places.

It is a city of note, and flourished during a long period under

the Attalic kings; and here we shall begin our description,

premising a short account of her kings, their origin, and the

end of their career.
</p><p>Pergamum was the treasure-hold of Lysimachus, the son

of Agathocles, and one of the successors of Alexander. It is

situated on the very summit of the mountain which terminates in a sharp peak like a pine-cone. Phileterus of Tyana

was intrusted with the custody of this strong-hold, and of the

treasure, which amounted to nine thousand talents. He

became an eunuch in childhood by compression, for it happened that a great body of people being assembled to see a

funeral, the nurse who was carrying Philetærus, then an infant, in her arms, was entangled in the crowd, and pressed

upon to such a degree that the child was mutilated.
</p><p>He was therefore an eunuch, but having been well educated he was thought worthy of this trust. He continued for



<pb n="400"/>



some time well affected to Lysimachus, but upon a disagree

ment with Arsinoë, the wife of Lysimachus, who had falsely

accused him, he caused the place to revolt, and suited his

political conduct to the times, perceiving them to be favourable to change. Lysimachus, overwhelmed with domestic

troubles, was compelled to put to death Agathocles his son.

Seleucus Nicator invaded his country and destroyed his

power, but was himself treacherously slain by Ptolemy

Ceraunus.
</p><p>During these disorders the eunuch remained in the fortress,

continually employing the policy of promises and other courtesies with those who were the strongest and nearest to

himself. He thus continued master of the strong-hold for

twenty years.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He had two brothers, the elder of whom was Eumenes,

the younger Attalus. Eumenes had a son of the same name,

who succeeded to the possession of Pergamum, and was then

sovereign of the places around, so that he overcame in a battle near Sardes<note anchored="yes">Sart.</note> Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, and died

after a reign of two-and-twenty years.
</p><p>Attalus, the son of Attalus and Antiochis, daughter of

Achæus, succeeded to the kingdom. He was the first person

who was proclaimed king after a victory, which he obtained

in a great battle with the Galatians. He became an ally of

the Romans, and, in conjunction with the Rhodian fleet,

assisted them in the war against Philip. He died in old age,

having reigned forty-three years. He left four sons by

Apollonis, a woman of Cyzicus,—Eumenes, Attalus, Philetærus,

and Athenæus. The younger sons continued in a private

station, but Eumenes, the elder, was king. He was an ally

of the Romans in the war with Antiochus the Great, and with

Perseus; he received from the Romans all the country within

the Taurus which had belonged to Antiochus. Before this

time there were not under the power of Pergamum many places

which reached to the sea at the Elaïtic and the Adramyttene Gulfs. Eumenes embellished the city, he ornamented

the Nicephorium<note anchored="yes">A building raised in commemoration of a victory. It was destroyed

and as regent of the kingdom, his brother Attalus, who died

an old man after a reign of twenty years, having performed

many glorious actions. He assisted Demetrius, the son of

Seleucus, in the war against Alexander, the son of Antiochus,

and was the ally of the Romans in the war against the

Pseudo-Philip. In an expedition into Thrace he defeated

and took prisoner Diegylis, king of the Cæni.<note anchored="yes">Diegylis, king of the Cæni, a Thracian people, was the father-in-law

<p>The celebrated men in our times, natives of Pergamum,

were Mithridates, the son of Menodotus and the daughter of

Adobogion; he was of the family of the Tetrarchs of Galatia.

Adobogion, it is said, had been the concubine of Mithridates

the king; the relatives therefore gave to the child the name

of Mithridates, pretending that he was the king's son.
</p><p>This prince became so great a friend of Divus Cæsar, that he

was promoted to the honour of Tetrarch (of Galatia) out of

regard to his mother's family; he was appointed also king of

Bosporus and of other places. He was overthrown by

Asander, who put to death Pharnaces the king and obtained

possession of the Bosporus. He had a great reputation as

well as Apollodorus the rhetorician, who composed a work

on the Art of Rhetoric, and was the head of the Apollodorian

sect of philosophers, whatever that may be; for many

opinions have prevailed, the merits of which are beyond our

power to decide upon, among which are those of the sects

of Apollodorus and Theodorus.
</p><p>But the friendship of Augustus Cæsar, whom he instructed

in oratory, was the principal cause of the elevation of Apollodorus. He had a celebrated scholar Dionysius, surnamed

Atticus, his fellow-citizen, who was an able teacher of philosophy, an historian, and composer of orations.

<p>Proceeding from the plain and the city towards the

east, we meet with Apollonia, a city on an elevated site. To

the south is a mountainous ridge, which having crossed on

the road to Sardes, we find on the left hand the city Thyateira, a colony of the Macedonians, which some authors say

is the last city belonging to the Mysians. On the right hand

is Apollonis, 300 stadia from Pergamum, and the same distance

from Sardes. It has its name from Apollonis of Cyzicus

(wife of Attalus). Next are the plains of Hermus and Sardes. The country to the north of Pergamum is principally

occupied by Mysians; it lies on the right hand of the people

called Abaïtæ, on whose borders is the Epictetus, extending

the elegiac poet, testifies, and that it was last captured in the

time of Cyrus and Crœsus. When Callinus says that the

incursion of the Cimmerians when they took Sardes was

directed against the Esioneis, the Scepsian (Demetrius) supposes the Asioneis to be called by him Esioneis, according to.

the Ionian dialect; for perhaps Meonia, he says, was called

Asia, as Homer describes the country,

The city, on account of the fertility of the country, was afterwards restored, so as to be a considerable place, and was inferior to none of its neighbours; lately it has lost a great

part of its buildings by earthquakes. But Sardes, and many

other cities which participated in this calamity about the same

time, have been repaired by the provident care and beneficence

of Tiberius the present emperor.

<p>The distinguished natives of Sardes were two orators of

the same name and family, the Diodori; the elder of whom was

called Zonas, who had pleaded the cause of Asia in many suits.

At the time of the invasion of Mithridates the king, he was

accused of occasioning the revolt of the cities from him, but

in his defence he cleared himself of the charge.
</p><p>The younger Diodorus was my friend; there exist of his

historical writings, odes, and poems of other kinds, which very

much resemble the style of the ancients.

but whether of Sardes I do not know.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the Lydians are the Mysians, and a city Philadelphia, subject to constant earthquakes. The walls of the

houses are incessantly opening, and sometimes one, sometimes

another, part of the city is experiencing some damage. The

majority of people (for few persons live in the city) pass their

lives in the country, employing themselves in agriculture, and

cultivate a good soil. Yet it is surprising that there should

be even a few persons so much attached to a place where

their dwellings are insecure; but one may marvel more at

those who founded the city.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next is the tract of country called the Catacecaumene,

extending 500 stadia in length, and in breadth 400. It is

uncertain whether it should be called Mysia or Meonia, for

it has both names. The whole country is devoid of trees, excepting vines, from which is obtained the Catacecaumenite

wine; it is not inferior in quality to any of the kinds in repute. The surface of the plains is covered with ashes, but the

hilly and rocky part is black, as if it were the effect of combustion. This, as some persons imagine, was the effect of

thunder-bolts and of fiery tempests, nor do they hesitate to

make it the scene of the fable of Typhon. Xanthus even says

that a certain Arimus was king of these parts. But it is

unreasonable to suppose that so large a tract of country was

all at once consumed; it is more natural to suppose that the

effect was produced by fire generated in the soil, the sources

of which are now exhausted. Here are to be seen three pits,

which are called Physæ, or breathing holes, situated at the

distance of 40 stadia from each other. Above are rugged

hills, which probably consist of masses of matter thrown up

by blasts of air (from the pits).
</p><p>That ground of this kind should be well adapted to vines,

may be conceived from the nature of the country Catana,<note anchored="yes">Catania.</note>

which was a mass of cinders, but which now produces excellent wine, and in large quantity.
</p><p>Some persons, in allusion to such countries as these, wittily

observe that Bacchus is properly called Pyrigenes, or fire-born.

12. The places situated next to these towards the south,

and extending to Mount Taurus, are so intermixed, that parts

of Phrygia, Lydia, Caria, and Mysia running into one another

are difficult to be distinguished. The Romans have contributed not a little to produce this confusion, by not dividing

the people according to tribes, but following another principle

have arranged them according to jurisdictions, in which they

have appointed days for holding courts and administering

justice.
</p><p>The Tmolus is a well compacted mass of mountain,<note anchored="yes">The range of mountains on the south of the Caÿster, bearing various

names.</note> of

moderate circumference, and its boundaries are within Lydia

itself. The Mesogis begins, according to Theopompus, from

Celænæ,<note anchored="yes">Celænæ was the citadel of Apameia Cibotus, Afium-Kara hissar.</note> and extends on the opposite side as far as Mycale,<note anchored="yes">Cape Sta. Maria</note>

so that Phrygians occupy one part, towards Celænæ and

Apameia; Mysians and Lydians another; Carians and Ionians

a third part.
</p><p>So also the rivers, and particularly the Mæander, are the

actual boundaries of some nations, but take their course

through the middle of others, rendering accurate distinction

between them difficult.
</p><p>The same may be said of plains, which are found on each

side of a mountainous range and on each side of a river. Our

attention however is not required to obtain the same degree of

accuracy as a surveyor, but only to give such descriptions as

have been transmitted to us by our predecessors.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Contiguous on the east to the plain of Caÿster, which

lies between the Mesogis and Tmolus, is the plain Cilbianum.

It is extensive, well inhabited, and fertile. Then follows the

Hyrcanian plain, a name given by the Persians, who brought

colonists from Hyrcania (the plain of Cyrus, in like manner

had its name from the Persians). Next is the Peltine plain,

belonging to the Phrygians, and the Cillanian and the Tabenian plains, the latter of which contains small towns, inhabited

by a mixed population of Phrygians, with a portion of Pisidians. The plains have their names from the towns.

yond the Mæander, extending as far as the Cibyratis and

Cabalis, we meet with cities. Near the Mesogis, opposite

Laodicea,<note anchored="yes">Eski-hissar.</note> is Hierapolis,<note anchored="yes">Pambuk-kalessi.</note> where are hot springs, and the Plutonium, both of which have some singular properties. The

water of the springs is so easily consolidated and becomes

stone, that if it is conducted through water-courses dams are

formed consisting of a single piece of stone.
</p><p>The Plutonium, situated below a small brow of the overhanging mountain, is an opening of sufficient size to admit a

man, but there is a descent to a great depth. In front is a

quadrilateral railing, about half a plethrum in circumference.

This space is filled with a cloudy and dark vapour, so dense

that the bottom can scarcely be discerned. To those who approach round the railing the air is innoxious, for in calm

weather it is free from the cloud which then continues within

the enclosure. But animals which enter within the railing

die instantly. Even bulls, when brought within it, fall down

and are taken out dead. We have ourselves thrown in sparrows, which immediately fell down lifeless. The Galli,<note anchored="yes">They were the priests of Cybele, and so called from a river of Phrygia.</note> who

are eunuchs, enter the enclosure with impunity, approach

even the opening or mouth, bend down over it, and descend

into it to a certain depth, restraining their breath as much as

possible, for we perceived by their countenance signs of some

suffocating feeling. This exemption may be common to all

eunuchs; or it may be confined to the eunuchs employed about

the temple; or it may be the effect of divine care, as is probable in the case of persons inspired by the deity; or it may

perhaps be procured by those who are in possession of certain

antidotes.
</p><p>The conversion of water into stone is said to be the property of certain rivers in Laodiceia, although the water is fit

for the purpose of drinking. The water at Hierapolis is peculiarly adapted for the dyeing of wool. Substances dyed with

<q direct="unspecified">the roots,</q><note anchored="yes">Madder-root.</note> rival in colour those dyed with the coccus, or

the marine purple. There is such an abundance of water,

that there are natural baths in every part of the city.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Hierapolis are the parts beyond the Mæander.

Those about Laodiceia and Aphrodisias,<note anchored="yes">Geira.</note> and those extending to Carura, have been already described. The places which

succeed are Antioch<note anchored="yes">Jenedscheh.</note> on the Mæander, now belonging to

Caria, on the west; on the south are Cibyra the Great,<note anchored="yes">Chorsum.</note> Sinda,<note anchored="yes">Dekoī.</note>

and Cabalis, as far as Mount Taurus and Lycia.
</p><p>Antioch is a city of moderate size situated on the banks

of the Mæander, at the side towards Phrygia. There is a

bridge over the river. A large tract of country, all of which

is fertile, on each side of the river, belongs to the city. It

produces in the greatest abundance the fig of Antioch, as it is

called, which is dried. It is also called Triphyllus. This

place also is subject to shocks of earthquakes.
</p><p>A native of this city was Diotrephes, a celebrated sophist;

his disciple was Hybreas, the greatest orator of our times.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Cabaleis, it is said, were Solymi. The hill situated above the Termessian fortress is called Solymus, and the

Termessians themselves Solymi. Near these places is the

rampart of Bellerophon and the sepulchre of Peisander his son,

who fell in the battle against the Solymi. This account agrees

with the words of the poet. Of Bellerophon he speaks thus,

Termessus is a Pisidian city situated very near and immediately above Cibyra.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Cibyratæ are said to be descendants of the Lydians

who occupied the territory Cabalis. The city was afterwards in

the possession of the Pisidians, a bordering nation, who occupied

it, and transferred it to another place, very strongly fortified,

the circuit of which was about 100 stadia. It flourished in consequence of the excellence of its laws. The villages belonging

to it extended from Pisidia, and the bordering territory Milyas,

as far as Lycia and the country opposite to Rhodes. Upon the

Œnoanda,<note anchored="yes">Urludscha.</note> the confederation was called Tetrapolis; each city

had one vote, except Cibyra, which had two, for it could equip

30,000 foot soldiers and 2000 horse. It was always governed

by tyrants, but they ruled with moderation. The tyrannical

government terminated in the time of Moagetes. It was

overthrown by Murena, who annexed Balbura and Bubon to

the Lycians. Nevertheless the Cibyratic district is reckoned

among the largest jurisdictions in Asia.
</p><p>The Cibyratæ used four languages, the Pisidic, that of the

<argument>
<p>SUMMARY.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Book contains an account of the Cyclades islands and the

region opposite to them, Pamphylia, Isauria, Lycia, Pisidia, Cilicia as far

as Seleucia of Syria, and that part of Asia properly called Ionia.</p></argument>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<p>THERE remain to be described Ionia, Caria, and the

sea-coast beyond the Taurus, which is occupied by Lycians,

Pamphylians, and Cilicians.<note anchored="yes">That is, the maritime parts of Asia Minor, from Cape Coloni opposite

Mitilini to Bajas, the ancient Issus. The coast of Ionia comprehended

between Cape Coloni and the Mæander (Bojuk Mender Tschai) forms

part of the modern pachalics, Saruchan and Soghla; Caria and Lycia are

contained in the pachalic, Mentesche; Pamphylia and Lycia in those of

Teke and Itsch-ili. Mount Taurus had its beginning at the promontory

Trogilium, now Cape Samsoun, or Santa Maria opposite Samos.</note> We shall thus finish the description of the whole circuit of the peninsula, the isthmus of

which, we have said, consists of the tract between the Euxine

and the Sea of Issus.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The navigation around Ionia along the coast is about

3430 stadia. It is a considerable distance, on account of the

gulfs, and of the peninsular form for the most, part of the

country, but the length in a straight line is not great. The

distance, for example, from Ephesus to Smyrna is a journey

in a straight line of 320 stadia; to Metropolis<note anchored="yes">Jenikoi.</note> is 120 stadia,

and the remainder to Smyrna; but this distance by sea is

little less than 2200 stadia. The extent of the Ionian coast

is reckoned from Poseidium,<note anchored="yes">Cape Arbora.</note> belonging to the Milesians,



<pb n="2"/>



and the boundaries of Caria, as far as Phocæa,<note anchored="yes">Karadscha-Fokia.</note> and the river



Hermus.<note anchored="yes">Gedis-Tschai.</note>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>According to Pherecydes, Miletus, Myus,<note anchored="yes">Derekoi.</note> Mycale, and

Ephesus, on this coast, were formerly occupied by Carians;

the part of the coast next in order, as far as Phocæa, and

Chios, and Samos, of which Ancæus was king, were occupied

by Leleges, but both nations were expelled by the Ionians,

and took refuge in the remaining parts of Caria.
</p><p>Pherecydes says that the leader of the Ionian, which was

posterior to the Æolian migration, was Androclus, a legitimate son of Codrus king of the Athenians, and that he was

the founder of Ephesus, hence it was that it became the seat

of the royal palace of the Ionian princes. Even at present

the descendants of that race are called kings, and receive certain honours, as the chief seat at the public games, a purple

robe as a symbol of royal descent, a staff instead of a sceptre,

and the superintendence of the sacrifices in honour of the

Eleusinian Ceres.
</p><p>Neleus, of a Pylian family, founded Miletus. The Messenians and Pylians pretend that there is some affinity between

them; in reference to which later poets say that even Nestor

was a Messenian, and that many Pylians accompanied Melanthus, the father of Codrus, to Athens, and that all this

people sent out the colony in common with the Ionians. There

is also to be seen on the promontory Poseidium an altar erected by Neleus.
</p><p>Myus was founded by Cydrelus, a spurious son of Codrus;

Lebedos<note anchored="yes">Lebedigli, Lebeditzhissar.</note> by Andropompus, who took possession of a place

called Artis; Colophon by Andræmon, a Pylian, as Mimnermus mentions in his poem of Nanno;<note anchored="yes">A portion of this poem by Mimnermus is quoted in Athenæus, b. xi.

39, p. 748 of the translation, Bohn's Class. Library.</note> Priene by Æpytus,

son of Neleus; and afterwards by Philotas, who brought a

colony from Thebes; Teos by Athamas, its first founder,

whence Anacreon calls the city Athamantis, but at the time

of the Ionian migration of the colony it received settlers from

Nauclus, a spurious son of Codrus, and after this from Apœcus

and Damasus, who were Athenians, and from Geres, a Bœotian; Erythræ was founded by Cnopus, who also was a spu-



<pb n="3"/>



rious son of Codrus; Phocæa by Athenians, who accompanied

Philogenes; Clazomenæ by Paralus; Chios by Egertius, who

brought with him a mixed body of colonists; Samos by Tembrion, and afterwards by Procles.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These are the twelve Ionian cities. At a subsequent

period Smyrna also was added to the Ionian association at

the instance of the Ephesians, for anciently they inhabited the

same city, at which time Ephesus was called Smyrna. Callinus somewhere gives it this name, and calls the Ephesians

Smyrnæans in the address to Jupiter:

<quote><q direct="unspecified">And pity the Smyrnæans;</q></quote>

and in another passage,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">remember now, if ever, the beautiful thighs of the oxen [which the

Smyrnæans burnt in sacrifice].</q></quote>

Smyrna was an Amazon, who got possession of Ephesus;

from her the inhabitants and the city had their name, in the

same manner as some Ephesians were called Sisyrbitæ from

Sisyrba; and a certain spot in Ephesus was called Smyrna,

as Hipponax testifies:

<quote><q direct="unspecified">He lived in Smyrna, at the back of the city between Tracheia and Lepre Acta.</q></quote>

The mountain Prion was called Lepre Acta; it overhangs the

present city, and has on it a portion of the wall. Even now

the farms at the back of the Prion retain the name in the

term Opistholepria. The country along the foot of the mountain about Coressus was called Tracheia. The city was anciently built about the Athenaeum, which is now beyond the

city, at the (fountain) Hypelæus. Smyrna therefore was situated near the present gymnasium, at the back of the present

city, but between Tracheia and Lepre Acta. The Smyrnæans, upon quitting the Ephesians, marched to the place where

Smyrna now stood, and which was in the possession of Leleges. They expelled these people and founded the ancient

Smyrna, which is distant from the present city about 20 stadia.

They were themselves afterwards expelled by Æolians, and

took refuge at Colophon; they then returned with a body of

men from the latter place, and recovered their own city,

Smyrna. Mimnermus relates this in his poem of Nanno, and

says of Smyrna, that it was always a subject of contention;



<pb n="4"/>



<quote><q direct="unspecified">after leaving Pylus, the lofty city of Neleus, we came in our voyage to

the long wished-for Asia, and settled at Colophon, and hastening thence

from the river Astëeis, by the will of the gods we took Æolian Smyrna.</q></quote>
</p><p>So much then on this subject.
</p><p>We must, however, again describe each place in particular,

beginning with the principal cities, from which the first settlements originated, I mean Miletus and Ephesus, for these

are superior to all others, and the most celebrated.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next after the Poseidium of the Milesians, at the distance of 18<note anchored="yes">Pliny, v. 29, says the distance is 20 stadia.</note> stadia from the sea-coast, is the oracle of Apollo

Didymeus among the Branchidæ. This, as well as the other

temples, except that at Ephesus, was burnt by the order of

Xerxes.<note anchored="yes">The Branchidæ were descendants of Branchus, who himself was descended from Macæreus, who killed Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. According to Herodotus, the temple was burnt by order of Darius, Herod. v.

36; vi. 19.</note> The Branchidæ delivered up the treasures of the

god to the Persian king, and accompanied him in his flight, in

order to avoid the punishment of sacrilege and treachery.
</p><p>The Milesians afterwards built a temple, which exceeded

in size all others, but it remained without a roof on account

of its magnitude. The circuit of the sacred enclosure contained within it a village with a magnificent grove, which also

extended beyond it; other sacred enclosures contain the oracle, and what belongs to the worship of the god.
</p><p>Here is laid the scene of the fable of Branchus, and Apollo's

offerings, the productions of ancient art.
</p><p>Thence to the city the journey is not long either by land

or sea.<note anchored="yes">Pliny, v. 29, says that the distance is 180 stadia.</note>

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Ephorus relates that Miletus was first founded and fortified by the Cretans on the spot above the sea-coast where

at present the ancient Miletus is situated, and that Sarpedon

conducted thither settlers from the Miletus in Crete,<note anchored="yes">According to Pausanias, vii. 2, a friend of Sarpedon, named Miletus,

conducted the colony from Crete, founded Miletus, and gave his name to

it. Before his arrival the place bore the name of Anactoria, and more

anciently Lelegis.</note> and gave

it the same name; that Leleges were the former occupiers of

the country, and that afterwards Neleus built the present city.

</p><p>The present city has four harbours, one of which will admit a fleet of ships.<note anchored="yes">More than 80, according to Pliny, v. 29.</note> The citizens have achieved many great

deeds, but the most important is the number of colonies which

they established. The whole Euxine, for instance, and the

Propontis, and many other places, are peopled with their

settlers.
</p><p>Anaximenes of Lampsacus says, that the Milesians colonized

both the island Icarus and Lerus, and Limnæ on the Hellespont, in the Chersonesus; in Asia, Abydus, Arisba, and

Pæsus; on the island of the Cyziceni, Artace and Cyzicus;

in the interior of the Troad, Scepsis. We have mentioned, in

our particular description of places, other cities which this

writer has omitted.
</p><p>Both the Milesians and Delians invoke Apollo Ulius, as

dispensing health and curing diseases; for <foreign lang="greek">ou)/lein</foreign><note anchored="yes">To be well.</note> is to be in

good qualities of the air; pestilential diseases, also, and sudden

death are attributed to these deities.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Illustrious persons, natives of Miletus, were Thales, one

of the seven wise men, the first person who introduced among

the Greeks physiology and mathematics; his disciple Anaximander, and Anaximenes the disciple of Anaximander.

Besides these, Hecatæus the historian;<note anchored="yes">Coraÿ, who is followed by Groskurd, supposes the words <q direct="unspecified">and Cadmus</q> to be here omitted. Kramer considers this correction to be very

doubtful; see b. i. c. ii. § 6.</note> and of our time,

Æschines the orator, who was banished for having spoken

with two great freedom before Pompey the Great, and died

in exile.
</p><p>Miletus shut her gates against Alexander, and experienced

the misfortune of being taken by storm, which was also the fate

of Halicarnassus; long before this time it was captured by the

Persians. Callisthenes relates, that Phrynichus the tragic

writer was fined a thousand drachmæ by the Athenians for

<p>Next follows the Gulf of Latmus, on which is situated

<q direct="unspecified">Heracleia under Latmus,</q><note anchored="yes">Bafi.</note> as it is called, a small town

with a shelter for vessels. It formerly had the same name as

the mountain above, which Hecatæus thinks was the same

as that called by the poet<note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 868.</note> the mountain of the Phtheiri,

for he says that the mountain of the Phtheiri was situated

below Latmus; but some say that it was Grium, as being

parallel to Latmus, and extending from the Milesian territory towards the east, through Caria, as far as Euromus and

Chalcetores. However, the mountain rises up in sight of<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)n u(/yei,</foreign> according to Groskurd's emendation, in place of <foreign lang="greek">e)n o)/ysi.</foreign></note> the city.
</p><p>At a little distance further, after crossing a small river near

Latmus, there is seen in a cave the sepulchre of Endymion.

Then from Heracleia to Pyrrha, a small city, is about 100

stadia by sea, but a little more from Miletus to Heracleia, if

we include the winding of the bays.

Cadme, because Philotus, its second founder, was a Bœotian.

<p>The tyrannies were at their height in the time of Polycrates and his brother Syloson. The former was distinguished

for his good fortune, and the possession of such a degree of

the sea his ring, which was of great value both on account of

the stone and the engraving, a short time afterwards a

fisherman caught the fish which had swallowed it, and on

cutting the fish open, the ring was discovered. When the

king of Egypt was informed of this, he declared, it is said,

with a prophetic spirit, that Polycrates, who had been elevated

to such a height of prosperity, would soon end his life unfortunately; and this was actually the case, for he was taken by

the Persian satrap by stratagem, and crucified. Anacreon, the

lyric poet, was his contemporary, and all his poetry abounds

with the praises of Polycrates.
</p><p>It is said that in his time Pythagoras, observing the growing tyranny, left the city, and travelled to Egypt and Babylon, with a view to acquire knowledge. On his return from

<p>The city of Ephesus was inhabited both by Carians and

Leleges. After Androclus had expelled the greatest part of

the inhabitants, he settled his companions about the Athenæum,

of the Coressus. It was thus inhabited till the time of Crœsus. Afterwards, the inhabitants descended from the mountainous district, and settled about the present temple, and

continued there to the time of Alexander. Then Lysimachus

built a wall round the present temple, and, perceiving the in-

heavy storm of rain which he saw approaching, and obstructed

the drains so as to inundate the city, and the inhabitants were

glad to leave it for another place.

<p>Chersiphron<note anchored="yes">Chersiphron was of Gnossus in Crete. The ground being marshy on

They collected for this purpose the ornaments of the women,

contributions from private property, and the money arising

from the sale of pillars of the former temple. Evidence of

these things is to be found in the decrees of that time. Artemidorus says, that Timæus of Tauromenium, in consequence of

his ignorance of these decrees, and being otherwise a calumniator and detractor, (whence he had the name of Epitimæus,

or Reviler,) avers that the Ephesians restored the temple by

means of the treasure deposited there by the Persians. But

at that time no treasure was deposited, and if any had been

deposited there, it must have been consumed together with the

temple: after the conflagration, when the roof was destroyed,

who would wish to have a deposit lying there, with the sacred

enclosure exposed to the air?
</p><p>Besides, Artemidorus says, that Alexander promised to defray the expense of its restoration, both what had been and

what would be incurred, on condition that the work should be

attributed to him in the inscription, but the Ephesians refused to accede to this ; much less, then, would they be disposed to acquire fame by sacrilege and spoliation. He praises

</p><p>The temple was formerly, and is at present, a place of refuge, but the limits of the sanctity of this asylum have been

frequently altered; Alexander extended them to the distance

of a stadium. Mithridates discharged an arrow from the

angle of the roof, and supposed that it fell a little beyond the

distance of a stadium. Antonius doubled this distance, and

included within the range of the sanctuary a certain portion

of the city. This was attended with much evil, as it placed

the city in the power of criminals and malefactors. On this

deep water for the entrance of large vessels of burden, if a

mole were thrown up before the mouth of the river, which

was very wide, gave orders for the construction of a mole ; but

the contrary effect took place, for the mud, being confined

what we are able to judge by comparing Strabo with what is found in

Athenæus, (b. xiv. §14, p. 990, of Bohn's Classical Library,) Simodia

was designated by the name of Hilarodia, (joyous song,) and obtained the

name Simodia from one Simus, or Simon, who excelled in the art. The

Lysiodi and Magodi, or Lysodia and Magodia, were the same thing, according to some writers. Under these systems decency appears to have

Pluto and Proserpine, and the Charonium, a cave which

overhangs the grove, and possesses some singular physical

properties. The sick, it is said, who have confidence in the

cures performed by these deities, resort thither, and live in

the village near the cave, among experienced priests, who

sleep at night in the open air, on behoof of the sick, and direct

the modes of cure by their dreams. The priests invoke the

gods to cure the sick, and frequently take them into the

cave, where, as in a den, they are placed to remain in

quiet without food for several days. Sometimes the sick

themselves observe their own dreams, but apply to these persons, in their character of priests and guardians of the mysteries, to interpret them, and to counsel what is to be done.

To others the place is interdicted and fatal.

as far as Spain, and there founded Rhodus, which the people

of Marseilles afterwards occupied; they founded Parthenope<note anchored="yes">Naples.</note>

<p>Halicarnasus suffered, when it was taken by storm by

Alexander. Hecatomnus, who was then king of the Carians,

had three sons, Mausolus, Hidrieus, and Pixodarus, and two

daughters. Mausolus, the eldest son, married Artemisia, the

eldest daughter; Hidrieus, the second son, married Ada,

the other sister. Mausolus came to the throne, and, dying

without children, left the kingdom to his wife, by whom the

above-mentioned sepulchre was erected. She pined away for

grief at the loss of her husband. Hidrieus succeeded her; lie

died a natural death, and was succeeded by his wife Ada.

She was ejected by Pixodarus, the surviving son of Hecatomnus. Having espoused the party of the Persians, Pixodarus

sent for a satrap to share the kingdom with him. After the

death of Pixodarus, the satrap became master of Halicarnasus.

But upon the arrival of Alexander, he sustained a siege. His

wife was Ada, daughter of Pixodarus, and Aphneïs, a woman

of Cappadocia. But Ada, the daughter of Hecatomnus, whom

Pixodarus ejected, entreated Alexander, and endeavoured to

prevail upon him to reïnstate her in the kingdom of which

she had been deprived; she promised (in return) her assistance in reducing to obedience the parts of the country which

had revolted; for the persons who were in possession of them

were her relations and subjects. She also delivered up Alinda,

where she herself resided. Alexander granted her request,

and proclaimed her queen, after the city was taken, but not

the acropolis, which was doubly fortified. He assigned to

Ada the siege of the acropolis, which was taken in a short

time afterwards, the besiegers having attacked it with fury

and exasperation at the resistance of the besieged.

<p>The city of the Coans was formerly called Astypalæa,

and was built in another place, but is at present on the sea-coast. Afterwards, on account of a sedition, they migrated

to the present city, near Scandarium, and changed the name to

that of the island, Cos. The city is not large, but beautifully

built, and a most pleasing sight to mariners who are sailing

by the coast. The island is about 550 stadia in circumference.

The whole of it is fertile, and produces, like Chios and Lesbos,

excellent wine. It has, towards the south, the promontory

Laceter,<note anchored="yes">Ca e Kephala</note> from which to Nicyrus is 60 stadia, and near Laceter

stadia from the city. The promontory Laceter adds to the

length of the navigation 35 stadia. In the suburb is the celebrated temple Asclepieium, full of votive offerings, among

which is the Antigonus of Apelles. It formerly contained

the Venus Anadyomene, (Venus emerging from the sea,) but

that is now at Rome, dedicated to divus Cæsar by Augustus,

<p>Mylasa is situated in a very fertile plain; a mountain,

containing a very beautiful marble quarry, overhangs the

in abundance and near at hand, particularly for the construction of temples and other public edifices; consequently, no

city is embellished more beautifully than this with porticos

and temples. It is a subject of surprise, however, that persons should be guilty of the absurdity of building the city at

the foot of a perpendicular and lofty precipice. One of the

governors of the province is reported to have said, when he

expressed his astonishment at this circumstance, <q direct="unspecified">If the

founder of the city had no fear, he had no shame.</q>
</p><p>The Mylasians have two temples, one of Jupiter called

Osogo, and another of Jupiter Labrandenus. The former is

in the city. Labranda is a village on the mountain, near the

passage across it from Alabanda to Mylasa, at a distance from

the city. At Labranda is an ancient temple of Jupiter, and

a statue of Jupiter Stratius, who is worshipped by the neighbouring people and by the inhabitants of Mylasa. There is

a paved road for a distance of about 60 stadia from the temple

to the city; it is called the Sacred Way, along which the sacred

things are carried in procession. The most distinguished

citizens are always the priests, and hold office during life.

These temples belong peculiarly to the city. There is a third

temple of the Carian Jupiter, common to all the Carians, in

the use of which the Lydians, also, and Mysians participate,

as being brethren.
</p><p>Mylasa is said to have been anciently a village, but the

The city approaches nearest to the sea at Physcus, which is

their naval arsenal.

<p>Mylasa has produced in our time illustrious men, who

were at once orators and demagogues, Euthydemus and

Hybreas. Euthydemus inherited from his ancestors great

wealth and reputation. He possessed commanding eloquence,

and was regarded as a person of eminence, not only in his

own country, but was thought worthy of the highest honours

even in Asia. The father of Hybreas, as he used to relate

the circumstance in his school, and as it was confirmed by his

fellow-citizens, left him a mule which carried wood, and a

mule driver. He was maintained for a short time by their

labour, and was enabled to attend the lectures of Diotrephes

of Antioch. On his return he held the office of superintendent

of the market. But here being harassed, and gaining but

little profit, he applied himself to the affairs of the state, and

to attend to the business of the forum. He quickly advanced

himself, and became an object of admiration, even during the

lifetime of Euthydemus, and still more after his death, as the

leading person in the city. Euthydemus possessed great

power, and used it for the benefit of the city, so that if some

of his acts were rather tyrannical, this character was lost in

their public utility.
</p><p>The saying of Hybreas, at the conclusion of an harangue to

the people, is applauded: <q direct="unspecified">Euthydemus, you are an evil necessary to the city; for we can live neither with thee nor without

</p><p>Hybreas, although he had acquired great power, and had

the reputation of being both a good citizen and an excellent

orator, was defeated in his political opposition to Labienus.

For the citizens, unarmed, and disposed to peace, surrendered

to Labienus, who attacked them with a body of troops and with

Parthian auxiliaries, the Parthians being at that time masters

of Asia. But Zeno of Laodiceia and Hybreas, both of them

orators, did not surrender, but caused their own cities to revolt. Hybreas provoked Labienus, an irritable and vain young

man, by saying, when the youth announced himself emperor

of the Parthians, <q direct="unspecified">Then I shall call myself emperor of the

Carians.</q> Upon this Labienus marched against the city,

having with him cohorts drafted from the Roman soldiery

stationed in Asia. He did not however take Hybreas prisoner,

who had retreated to Rhodes, but plundered and destroyed

his house, which contained costly furniture, and treated the

whole city in the same manner. After Labienus had left

Asia, Hybreas returned, and restored his own affairs and those

of the city to their former state.

the greatest number of villages have the precedency in voting,

<p>Among the various accounts which are circulated respecting the Carians, the most generally received is that the

Carians, then called Leleges, were governed by Minos, and

occupied the islands. Then removing to the continent, they

obtained possession of a large tract of sea-coast and of the

interior, by driving out the former occupiers, who were, for

the most part, Leleges and Pelasgi. The Greeks again,

Ionians and Dorians, deprived the Carians of a portion of the

country.
</p><p>As proofs of their eager pursuit of war, the handles of

shields, badges, and crests, all of which are called Carian, are

alleged. Anacreon says,

it does not appear why, when he was acquainted with so

many barbarous nations, he mentions the Carians alone as

using a barbarous language, but does not call any people Barbarians. Nor is Thucydides right, who says that none were

called Barbarians, because as yet the Greeks were not distinguished by any one name as opposed to some other. But

Homer himself refutes this position that the Greeks were not

distinguished by this name:

and in another place—

But if there was no such term as Barbarian, how could he

properly speak of people as Barbarophonoi (i. e. speaking a

barbarous language)?
</p><p>Neither is Thucydides nor Apollonius the grammarian

right, because the Greeks, and particularly the Ionians, applied to the Carians a common term in a peculiar and vituperative sense, in consequence of their hatred of them for their

animosity and continual hostile incursions. Under these circumstances he might call them Barbarians. But we ask, why

does he call them Barbarophonoi, but not once Barbarians?

Because, replies Apollonius, the plural number does not fall in

with the metre; this is the reason why Homer does not call

I suppose that the word <q direct="unspecified">barbarian</q> was at first invented to

designate a mode of pronunciation which was embarrassed,

harsh, and rough; as we use the words battarizein, traulizein, psellizein,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">battao|izein, to|aulizein, yelli/zein.</foreign></note> to express the same thing. For we are naturally very much disposed to denote certain sounds by names

expressive of those sounds, and characteristic of their nature;

and hence invented terms abound, expressive of the sounds

which they designate, as kelaryzein, clange, psophos, boe,

krotos,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kelao|u/zein, klaggh\, yo/fos, boh\, ko|o/tos.</foreign></note> most of which words are at present used in an appropriate sense.
</p><p>As those who pronounce their words with a thick enunciation are called Barbarians, so foreigners, I mean those who

were not Greeks, were observed to pronounce their words in

this manner. The term Barbarians was therefore applied

peculiarly to these people, at first by way of reproach, as

having a thick and harsh enunciation; afterwards the term

was used improperly, and applied as a common gentile term

in contradistinction to the Greeks. For after a long intimacy

and intercourse had subsisted with the Barbarians, it no

longer appeared that this peculiarity arose from any thickness of enunciation, or a natural defect in the organs of the

voice, but from the peculiarities of their languages.
</p><p>But there was in our language a bad and what might be

called a barbarous utterance, as when any person speaking

Greek should not pronounce it correctly, but should pronounce

the words like the Barbarians, who, when beginning to learn

the Greek language, are not able to pronounce it perfectly,

as neither are we able to pronounce perfectly their languages.
</p><p>This was peculiarly the case with the Carians. For other

nations had not much intercourse with the Greeks, nor were

disposed to adopt the Grecian manner of life, nor to learn our

language, with the exception of persons who by accident

and singly had associated with a few Greeks; but the Carians

were dispersed over the whole of Greece, as mercenary soldiers. Then the barbarous pronunciation was frequently met

with among them, from their military expeditions into Greece;

and afterwards it spread much more, from the time that they

occupied the islands together with the Greeks: not even when



<pb n="43"/>



driven thence into Asia, could they live apart from Greeks,

when the Ionians and Dorians arrived there.
</p><p>Hence arose the expression, <q direct="unspecified">to barbarize,</q> for we are accustomed to apply this term to those whose pronunciation of

the Greek language is vicious, and not to those who pronounce it like the Carians.
</p><p>We are then to understand the expressions, <q direct="unspecified">barbarous

speaking</q> and <q direct="unspecified">barbarous speakers,</q> of persons whose pronunciation of the Greek language is faulty. The word <q direct="unspecified">to

barbarize</q> was formed after the word <q direct="unspecified">to Carize,</q> and transferred into the books which teach the Greek language; thus

also the word <q direct="unspecified">to solœcize</q> was formed, derived either from

Soli or some other source.

Scylax, the Rhodians possessed only the peninsula immediately in face of

their island. As a reward for their assistance in the Antiochian war, the

Romans gave them a part of Lycia, and all Caria as far as the Mæander.

By having adopted a less prudent policy in the second Macedonic war,

they lost it all, including Caunus, the chief town of Peræa. It was not

long, however, before it was restored to them, together with the small

islands near Rhodes; and from this time Peræa retained the limits which

are parts of the peninsula, the isthmus of which we said was

the road from Issus as far as Amisus,<note anchored="yes">Samsun.</note> or, according to some

The country beyond the Taurus consists of the narrow line

of sea-coast extending from Lycia to the places about Soli,

the present Pompeiopolis. Then the sea-coast near the Bay

of Issus, beginning from Soli and Tarsus, spreads out into

plains.
</p><p>The description of this coast will complete the account of

<p>After Dedala of the Rhodians there is a mountain of

Lycia, of the same name, Dedala, and here the whole Lycian

coast begins, and extends <date value="1720">1720</date> stadia. This maritime tract

is rugged, and difficult to be approached, but has very good

harbours, and is inhabited by a people who are not inclined

to acts of violence. The country is similar in nature to that

of Pamphylia and Cilicia Tracheia. But the former used

the places of shelter for vessels for piratical purposes themselves, or afforded to pirates a market for their plunder and

stations for their vessels.

building ships. They sold their prisoners, whom they admitted were freemen, by notice through the public crier.
</p><p>But the Lycians continued to live as good citizens, and with

so much restraint upon themselves, that although the Pamphylians had succeeded in obtaining the sovereignty of the

sea as far as Italy, yet they were never influenced by the desire of base gain, and persevered in administering the affairs

of the state according to the laws of the Lycian body.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are three and twenty cities in this body, which

have votes. They assemble from each city at a general congress, and select what city they please for their place of meeting. Each of the largest cities commands three votes, those

of intermediate importance two, and the rest one vote. They

contribute in the same proportion to taxes and other public

charges. The six largest cities, according to Artemidorus,

are Xanthus,<note anchored="yes">Gunik.</note> Patara,<note anchored="yes">Patera.</note> Pinara,<note anchored="yes">Minara.</note> Olympus, Myra, Tlos,<note anchored="yes">Duvar.</note> which

the administration of justice. Formerly they deliberated

about war and peace, and alliances, but this is not now permitted, as these things are under the control of the Romans.

It is only done by their consent, or when it may be for their

own advantage.
</p><p>Thus judges and magistrates are elected according to the

proportion of the number of votes belonging to each city.<note anchored="yes">Gillies, in his translation of Aristotle, makes use of this example of

the Lycians to prove that representative government was not unknown

to the ancients. The deputies sent from the twenty-three cities formed a

parliament. The taxes and public charges imposed on the several towns

were in proportion to the number of representatives sent from each city.

—<emph rend="ital">Gillies,</emph> vol. ii. p. 64, &amp;c.</note>

It was the fortune of these people, who lived under such an

excellent government, to retain their liberty under the Romans, and the laws and institutions of their ancestors; to see

also the entire extirpation of the pirates, first by Servilius

Isauricus, at the time that he demolished Isaura, and afterwards by Pompey the Great, who burnt more than <date value="1300">1300</date> vessels, and destroyed their haunts and retreats. Of the survivors

in these contests he transferred some to Soli, which he called

Pompeiopolis; others to Dyme, which had a deficient population, and is now occupied by a Roman colony.

revolt from her kings, and carried on war against them with

various success. Antiochus, the son of Demetrius, obliged

him to shut himself up in one of the fortresses, and there he

killed himself.
</p><p>Tryphon was the cause of originating among the Cilicians

a piratical confederacy. They were induced also to do this

the attacks of invaders.
</p><p>The exportation of slaves was the chief cause of inducing

them to commit criminal acts, for this traffic was attended

with very great profit, and the slaves were easily taken. Delos was at no great distance, a large and rich mart, capable of

receiving and transporting, when sold, the same day, ten

thousand slaves; so that hence arose a proverbial saying,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">Merchant, come into port, discharge your freight—everything is sold.</q></quote>

The Romans, having acquired wealth after the destruction of

Carthage and Corinth, employed great numbers of domestic

slaves, and were the cause of this traffic. The pirates, observing the facility with which slaves could be procured, issued

forth in numbers from all quarters, committing robbery and

dealing in slaves.
</p><p>The kings of Cyprus and of Egypt, who were enemies

of the Syrians, favoured their marauding enterprises; the

Rhodians were no less hostile to the Syrians, and therefore

afforded the latter no protection. The pirates, therefore, under

the pretence of trading in slaves, continued without intermission their invasions and robbery.

</p><p>The Romans were subsequently compelled to reduce the

friendship with Murena, with whom he fled, and with whom

he was captured, on the discovery of the conspiracy against

Augustus Cæsar; but he established his innocence, and was

set at liberty by Cæsar. When he returned from Rome, he

abounding with shrubs of the evergreen and cultivated kind.

There are interspersed spots which produce the saffron.

There is also a cave in which rises a river of pure and transparent water. Immediately at its source the river buries itself

<p>After Corycus, is the island Elæussa,<note anchored="yes">A sandy plain now connects Elæussa with the coast.—<emph rend="ital">Leake.</emph></note> lying very near

the continent. Here Archelaus resided, and built a palace,

after having become master of the whole of Cilicia Tracheiotis,

except Seleucia, as Augustus had been before, and as at a still

earlier period it was held by Cleopatra. For as the country

was well adapted by nature for robbery both by sea and land,

(by land, on account of the extent of the mountains, and the

nations situated beyond them, who occupy plains, and large

tracts of cultivated country easy to be overrun; by sea, on

account of the supply of timber for ship-building, the harbours, fortresses, and places of retreat,) for all these reasons

the Romans thought it preferable that the country should be

under the government of kings, than be subject to Roman

governors sent to administer justice, but who would not always

be on the spot, nor attended by an army. In this manner

Archelaus obtained possession of Cilicia Tracheia, in addition

to Cappadocia. Its boundaries between Soli and Elæussa

situated Olbe a city, which has a temple of Jupiter, founded

by Ajax, son of Teucer. The priest of this temple was master

of the Tracheiotis. Subsequently many tyrants seized upon

the country, and it became the retreat of robbers. After their

extermination, the country was called, even to our times, the

dominion of Teucer; and the priesthood, the priesthood of

Teucer; indeed, most of the priests had the name of Teucer,

or of Ajax. Aba, the daughter of Xenophanes, one of the

tyrants, entered into this family by marriage, and obtained

possession of the government. Her father had previously administered it as guardian, but Antony and Cleopatra afterwards conferred it upon Aba, as a favour, being ultimately

prevailed upon to do so by her entreaties and attentions.

She was afterwards dispossessed, but the government remained in the hands of the descendants of her family.
</p><p>Next to Anchiale are the mouths of the Cydnus<note anchored="yes">Mesarlyk-tschai.</note> at the

Rhegma, (the Rent,) as it is called. It is a place like a lake,

<p>The whole of the sea-coast, beginning from the part

immediately makes a bend to the south to Phœnicia. The

remainder towards the west terminates at the pillars (of Hercules).<note anchored="yes">Strabo means to say, that the coast, from the part opposite Rhodes,

</p><p>The actual isthmus of the peninsula, which we have described, is that which extends from Tarsus and the mouth of the

Cydnus. To Issus, and the sea near it, there is no shorter

road from Amisus than that leading through Tarsus, nor

from Tarsus to Issus is there any nearer than that leading to

Cydnus; so that it is clear, that, in reality, this is the isthmus.

Yet it is pretended that the isthmus extending as far as the

<p>The Stoic philosophers Antipater, Archedemus, and

Nestor were natives of Tarsus: and besides these, the two

Athenodori, one of whom, Cordylion, lived with Marcus Cato,

and died at his house; the other, the son of Sandon, called

Cananites, from some village, was the preceptor of Cæsar,<note anchored="yes">Augustus.</note> who

conferred on him great honours. In his old age he returned

to his native country, where he dissolved the form of government existing there, which was unjustly administered by

various persons, and among them by Boëthus, a bad poet and

a bad citizen, who had acquired great power by courting the

favour of the people. Antony contributed to increase his importance by having in the first instance commended a poem

which he had composed on the victory at Philippi; his influence was still augmented by the facility which he possessed

(and it is very general among the inhabitants of Tarsus) of

discoursing at great length, and without preparation, upon

any given subject. Antony also had promised the people of

Tarsus to establish a gymnasium; he appointed Boëthus chief

director of it, and intrusted to him the expenditure of the

funds. He was detected in secreting, among other things, even

the oil, and when charged with this offence by his accusers

in the presence of Antony, he deprecated his anger by this,

among other remarks in his speech, that as Homer had sung

the praises of <q direct="unspecified">Achilles, Agamemnon, and Ulysses, so have I

sung yours. I therefore ought not to be brought before

you on such a charge.</q> The accuser answered, <q direct="unspecified">Homer did

Antony by courteous offices, and continued to plunder the city

until the death of his protector.
</p><p>Athenodorus found the city in this state, and for some time

attempted to control Boëthus and his accomplices by argument; but finding that they continued to commit all kinds of

injustice, he exerted the power given to him by Cæsar, condemned them to banishment, and expelled them. They had

previously caused to be written upon the walls, <q direct="unspecified">Action for

however, in contempt for his good manners, having a lax

rehearsed poems, chiefly of the tragic kind, upon any subject

that was proposed. The grammarians of Tarsus, whose writings we have, were Artemidorus and Diodorus. But the best

writer of tragedy, among those enumerated in <q direct="unspecified">The Pleiad,</q>

of Apollo, and Mantus, about whom many fables are related.

I have mentioned them in speaking of Calchas, and of the

contest between Calchas and Mopsus respecting their skill in

divination. Some persons, as Sophocles, transfer the scene

of this contest to Sicily, which, after the custom of tragic

poets, they call Pamphylia, as they call Lycia, Caria, and

Troy and Lydia, Phrygia. Sophocles, among other writers,

says that Calchas died there. According to the fable, the

contest did not relate to skill in divination only, but also to

sovereignty. For it is said, that Mopsus and Amphilochus,

on their return from Troy, founded Mallus; that Amphilochus afterwards went to Argos, and being dissatisfied with

the state of affairs there, returned to Mallus, where, being excluded from a share in the government, he engaged with

Mopsus in single combat. Both were killed, but their sepulchres are not in sight of each other. They are shown at

<p>Since the Cilicians of the Troad, whom Homer mentions, are situated at a great distance from the Cilicians without the Taurus, some writers declare that the leaders of the

as those in the Troad; other authors are of a contrary opinion,

and (considering the Cilicians of the Troad as descendants of

those from beyond the Taurus) point to an Aleian plain (in

support of their hypothesis).

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Having described the parts of the before-mentioned

Chersonesus without the Taurus, I must add these particulars.
</p><p>Apollodorus, in his work on the catalogue of the ships

mentioned in Homer, relates, that all the allies of the Trojans,

who came from Asia, inhabited, according to the poet, the

peninsula of which at its narrowest part is the isthmus between the innermost recess of the bay at Sinope and Issus.

The exterior sides (of this peninsula), which is of a triangular shape, are unequal. Of these, one extends from Cilicia

to Chelidoniæ, (islands,) another thence to the mouth of the

Euxine, and the third from the mouth of the Euxine to

Sinope.
</p><p>The assertion that the allies were only those who occupied

the peninsula may be proved to be erroneous by the same

arguments by which we before showed that those who lived

within the Halys were not the only allies. For the places

about Pharnacia, where we said the Halizoni lived, are situated without the Halys, and also without the isthmus, for they



<pb n="62"/>



are without the line drawn from Sinope to Issus;<note anchored="yes">Groskurd is desirous of reading Tarsus for Issus. See above, c. v.

§ 11. But Strabo is here considering the two opinions held respecting

the isthmus.</note> and not

only without this line, but also without the true line of the isthmus drawn from Amisus to Issus; for Apollodorus incorrectly

describes the isthmus and the line of its direction, substituting one line for another (the line drawn from Sinope to Issus

for the line drawn from Amisus to Issus).
</p><p>But the greatest absurdity is this, that after having said

that the peninsula was of a triangular shape, he speaks of

three <emph rend="ital">exterior</emph> sides. For in speaking of <emph rend="ital">exterior</emph> sides, he

seems to except the line of the isthmus itself, considering it

still a side, although not an <emph rend="ital">exterior</emph> side, from its not being

upon the sea. But if this line were so shortened that the extremities of the (<emph rend="ital">exterior</emph>) sides falling upon Issus and Sinope

nearly coincided, the peninsula might in that case be said to

be of a triangular shape; but as his own line (from Sinope to

Issus) is 3000 stadia in length, it would be ignorance, and not

a knowledge of chorography, to call such a four-sided figure

a triangle. Yet he published a work on Chorography, in the

metre of comedy, (Iambic metre,) entitled <q direct="unspecified">The Circuit of

the Earth.</q>
</p><p>He is still liable to the same charge of ignorance, even if

we should suppose the isthmus to be contracted to its least

dimensions, and follow writers who erroneously estimate the

distance at one-half of the sum, namely <date value="1500">1500</date> stadia, to which

it is reduced by Artemidorus; but even this would not by

any means reduce the thus contracted space to the figure of a

triangle.
</p><p>Besides, Artemidorus has not correctly described the exterior sides; one side, he says, extends from Issus to the Chelidoniæ islands, although the whole Lycian coast, and the country opposite to Rhodes as far as Physcus, lies in a straight

line with, and is a continuation of it; the continent then

makes a bend at Physcus, and forms the commencement of

the second or western side, extending to the Propontis and

Byzantium.

<p>Ephorus had said that this peninsula was inhabited by

sixteen tribes, three of which were Grecian, and the rest barbarous, with the exception of the mixed nations; he placed



<pb n="63"/>



on the sea-coast Cilicians, Pamphylians, Lycians, Bithynians,

Paphlagonians, Mariandyni, Troes, and Carians; and in the

interior, Pisidians, Mysians, Chalybes, Phrygians, and Milyæ.<note anchored="yes">Scymnus of Chios counts fifteen nations who occupied this peninsula,

namely, three Greek and twelve barbarian. The latter were Cilicians,

Lycians, Carians, Maryandini, Paphlagonians, Pamphylians, Chalybes,

Cappadocians, Pisidians, Lydians, Mysians, and Phrygians. In this list

the Bithynians, Trojans, and Milyæ are not mentioned; but in it are found

the Cappadocians and Lydians—two nations whom, according to Strabo,

Ephorus has not mentioned. This discrepancy is the more remarkable

as Scymnus must have taken the list from Ephorus himself.</note>

Apollodorus, when discussing this position, says there is a

seventeenth tribe, the Galatians, who are more recent than

the time of Ephorus; that of the sixteen tribes mentioned, the

Greeks were not settled (in the peninsula) at the period of

the Trojan war, and that time has produced great intermixture

and confusion among the barbarous nations. Homer, he continues, recites in his Catalogue the Troes, and those now called

Paphlagonians, Mysians, Phrygians, Carians, Lycians, Meionians, instead of Lydians and other unknown people, as Halizoni and Caucones; nations besides not mentioned in the

Catalogue but elsewhere, as Ceteii, Solymi, the Cilicians from

the plain of Thebe, and Leleges. But the Pamphylians,

Bithynians, Mariandyni, Pisidians, and Chalybes, Milyæ, and

Cappadocians are nowhere mentioned by the poet; some because

they did not then inhabit these places, and some because they

were surrounded by other tribes, as Idrieis and Termilæ by

Carians, Doliones and Bebryces by Phrygians.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But Apollodorus does not seem to have carefully examined the statements of Ephorus, for he confounds and misrepresents the words of Homer. He ought first to have inquired of Ephorus why he placed the Chalybes within the

peninsula, who were situated at a great distance from Sinope,

and Amisus towards the east. Those who describe the isthmus of this peninsula to be on the line drawn from Issus to

the Euxine, lay down this line as a sort of meridian line,

which some suppose to pass through Sinope, others through

Amisus; but no one through the Chalybes, for such a line

would be altogether an oblique line. For the meridian passing through the Chalybes, drawn through the Lesser Armenia,

and the Euphrates, would comprise (on the east) the whole of

Cappadocia, Commagene, Mount Amanus, and the Bay of Issus.



<pb n="64"/>



But if we should grant (to Ephorus) that this oblique line is

the direction of the isthmus, most of these places, Cappadocia

in particular, would be included, and (the kingdom of) Pontus, properly so called, which is a part of Cappadocia on the

Euxine; so that if we were to admit the Chalybes to be a

part of the peninsula, with more reason we ought to admit the

Cataonians, the two nations of Cappadocians, and the Lycaonians, whom even he himself has omitted. But why has he

placed in the interior the Chalybes, whom the poet, as we

have shown, calls Halizoni? It would have been better to

divide them, and to place one portion of them on the sea-coast,

and another in the inland parts. The same division ought to

be made of the Cappadocians and Cilicians. But Ephorus

does not even mention the former, and speaks only of the

Cilicians on the sea-coast. The subjects, then, of Antipater of

Derbe, the Homonadeis, and many other tribes contiguous

to the Pisidians,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">men, who know not the sea, nor have ever eaten food seasoned with

salt,</q><note anchored="yes">Od. xi. 122.</note></quote>

where are they to be placed? Nor does he say whether the

Lydians and the Meonians are two nations or the same nation, or whether they live separately by themselves or are

comprehended in another tribe. For it was impossible for

Ephorus to be ignorant of so celebrated a nation, and does he

not, by passing it over in silence, appear to omit a most important fact?

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But who are <q direct="unspecified">the mixed nations</q>? For we cannot

say that he either named or omitted others, besides those already mentioned, whom we should call mixed nations. Nor,

indeed, should we say that they were a part of those nations

whom he has either mentioned or omitted. For if they were

a mixed people, still the majority constituted them either

Greeks or Barbarians. We know nothing of a third mixed

people.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But how (according to Ephorus) are there three tribes

of Greeks who inhabit the peninsula? Is it because anciently the Athenians and Ionians were the same people? In that

case the Dorians and the Æolians should be considered as the

same nation, and then there would be (only) two tribes (and

not three, inhabiting the peninsula). But if, following modern



<pb n="65"/>



practice, we are to distinguish nations according to dialects,

there will be four nations, as there are four dialects. But

this peninsula is inhabited, especially if we adopt the division

by Ephorus, not only by Ionians, but also by Athenians, as

we have shown in the account of each particular place.
</p><p>It was worth while to controvert the positions of Ephorus,

Apollodorus however disregards all this, and adds a seventeenth to the sixteen nations, namely, the Galatians; although

it is well to mention this, yet it is not required in a discussion

of what Ephorus relates or omits; Apollodorus has assigned

as the reason of' the omission, that all these nations settled

in the peninsula subsequently to the time of Ephorus.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Passing then to Homer, Apollodorus is correct in saying that there was a great intermixture and confusion among

the barbarous nations, from the Trojan war to the present time,

on account of the changes which had taken place; for some

nations had an accession of others, some were extinct or dispersed, or had coalesced together.
</p><p>But he is mistaken in assigning two reasons why the poet

does not mention some nations, namely, either because the

place was not then occupied by the particular people, or because they were comprehended in another tribe. Neither of

these reasons could induce him to be silent respecting Cappadocia or Cataonia, or Lycaonia itself, for we have nothing of

the kind in history relating to these countries. It is ridiculous to be anxious to find excuses why Homer has omitted to

speak of Cappadocia [Cataonia] and Lycaonia, and not to

inform us why Ephorus omitted them, particularly as the proposed object of Apollodorus was to examine and discuss the

opinions of Ephorus; and to tell us why Homer mentions

Mæonians instead of Lydians, and also not to remark that

Ephorus has not omitted to mention either Lydians or Mæonians.<note anchored="yes">Apollodorus, like Scymnus, had probably found the Lydians mentioned in the list of Ephorus, as also the Cappadocians.</note>

<milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Apollodorus remarks, that Homer mentions certain unknown nations, and he is right in specifying Caucones, Solymi,

Ceteii, Leleges, and the Cilicians from the plain of Thebe;

but the Halizones are a fiction of his own, or rather of those

who, not knowing who the Halizones were, frequently altered

the mode of writing the name, and invented the existence of



<pb n="66"/>



mines of silver and of many other mines, all of which are

abandoned.
</p><p>With this vain intention they collected the stories related

by the Scepsian, (Demetrius,) and taken from Callisthenes

and other writers, who did not clear them from false notions

respecting the Halizones; for example, the wealth of Tantalus and of the Pelopidæ was derived, it is said, from the mines

about Phrygia and Sipylus; that of Cadmus from the mines

about Thrace and Mount Pangæum; that of Priam from the

gold mines at Astyra, near Abydos (of which at present there

are small remains, yet there is a large quantity of matter ejected, and the excavations are proofs of former workings); that

of Midas from the mines about Mount Bermium; that of

Gyges, Alyattes, and Crœsus, from the mines in Lydia and

the small deserted city between Atarneus and Pergamum,

where are the sites of exhausted mines.<note anchored="yes">Kramer says that he is unable to decide how this corrupt passage

should be restored. The translation follows the conjectures of Coraÿ.</note>

<milestone n="29" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We may impute another fault to Apollodorus, that

although he frequently censures modern writers for introducing new readings at variance with the meaning of Homer,

yet in this instance he not only neglects his own advice, but

actually unites together places which are not so represented

(by Homer).
</p><p>(For example), Xanthus the Lydian says, that after the

Trojan times the Phrygians came from Europe (into Asia)

and the left (western) side of the Euxine, and that their leader Scamandrius conducted them from the Berecynti and Ascania. Apollodorus adds, that Homer mentions the same

Ascania as Xanthus,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">Phorcys and the divine Ascanius led the Phrygians from the distant

Ascania.</q><note anchored="yes">Il. ii. 862.</note></quote>

If this be so, the migration (from Europe to Asia) must be

later than the Trojan war; but in the Trojan war the auxiliaries mentioned by the poet came from the opposite continent,

from the Berecynti and Ascania. Who then were the Phrygians,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">who were then encamped on the banks of the Sangarius,</q></quote>

when Priam says,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">And I joined them with these troops as an auxiliary</q>?<note anchored="yes">Il. iii. 187.</note></quote>



<pb n="67"/>



And how came Priam to send for the Phrygians from among

the Berecynti, between whom and himself no compact existed,

and pass over the people who were contiguous to him, and

whose ally he formerly had been?
</p><p>Apollodorus, after having spoken of the Phrygians in this

manner, introduces an account concerning the Mysians which

contradicts this. He says that there is a village of Mysia

called Ascania, near a lake of the same name,<note anchored="yes">Isnik.</note> out of which

issues the river Ascanius, mentioned by Euphorion:<note anchored="yes">Euphorion acquired celebrity as a voluminous writer. Vossius, i. 16,

gives a catalogue of his works. According to Suidas, he was born in

Chalcis, in Negropont, at the time Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was defeated

by the Romans. He acquired a considerable fortune by his writings and

by his connexion with persons of eminent rank. He was invited to the

court of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, who intrusted him with the

care of his library. According to Sallust, (Life of Tiberius,) he was one of

the poets whom Tiberius took as his model in writing Greek verse. Fecit

The district, he says, about Cyzicus, on the road to Miletopolis, is called Dolionis and Mysia.
</p><p>If this is the case, and if it is confirmed by existing places

and by the poets, what prevented Homer, when he mentioned

this Ascania, from mentioning the Ascania also of which

Xanthus speaks?

Mysia and Phrygia, and shall here conclude the discussion.

<p>IT remains for me to describe the island Cyprus, which

adjoins this peninsula on the south. I have already said, that

the sea comprised between Egypt, Phœnice, Syria, and the

remainder of the coast as far as that opposite to Rhodes, con-

sists, so to say, of the Egyptian and Pamphylian seas and

the sea along the Bay of Issus.
</p><p>In this sea lies the island Cyprus, having its northern side

approaching to Cilicia Tracheia, and here also it approaches

nearest to the continent; on the east it is washed by the Bay

of Issus, on the west by the Pamphylian sea, and on the

south by that of Egypt. The latter sea is confluent on the

west with the Libyan and Carpathian seas. On its southern

and eastern parts is Egypt, and the succeeding tract of coast

as far as Seleucia and Issus. On the north is Cyprus, and

the Pamphylian sea.
</p><p>The Pamphylian sea is bounded on the north by the extremities of Cilicia Tracheia, of Pamphylia, and of Lycia as far

as the territory opposite to Rhodes; on the west, by the island

of Rhodes; on the east, by the part of Cyprus near Paphos,

and the Acamas; on the south, it unites with the Egyptian

sea.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The circumference of Cyprus is 3420 stadia, including

the winding of the bays. Its length from Cleides<note anchored="yes">The Clides, off Cape Andrea.</note> to the

Acamas,<note anchored="yes">Cape Arnauti.</note> to a traveller on land proceeding from east to west,

is <date value="1400">1400</date> stadia.
</p><p>The Cleides are two small islands lying in front of Cyprus

on the eastern side, at the distance of 700 stadia from the

Pyramus.<note anchored="yes">Dschehan-Tschai.</note>
</p><p>The Acamas is a promontory with two paps, and upon it

is a large forest. It is situated at the western part of the

island, but extends towards the north, approaching very near

Selinus in Cilicia Tracheia, for the passage across is only

1000 stadia; to Side in Pamphylia the passage is <date value="1600">1600</date> stadia,

and to the Chelidoniæ (islands) <date value="1900">1900</date> stadia.
</p><p>The figure of the whole island is oblong, and in some places

on the sides, which define its breadth, there are isthmuses.
</p><p>We shall describe the several parts of the island briefly, beginning from the point nearest to the continent.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We have said before, that opposite to Anemyrium, a

promontory of Cilicia Tracheia, is the extremity of Cyprus,

namely, the promontory of Crommyon,<note anchored="yes">Kormakiti.</note> at the distance of 350

stadia.
</p><p>From the cape, keeping the island on the right hand, and

the continent on the left, the voyage to the Cleides in a straight

line towards north and east is a distance of 700 stadia.
</p><p>In the interval is the city Lapathus,<note anchored="yes">Lapito.</note> with a harbour and

dockyards; it was founded by Laconians and Praxander.

Opposite to it was Nagidus. Then follows Aphrodisium;<note anchored="yes">Near Artemisi.</note>

here the island is narrow, for over the mountains to Salamis<note anchored="yes">To the north of Tamagousta.</note>

are 70 stadia. Next is the sea-beach of the Achæans; here

Teucer, the founder of Salamis in Cyprus, being it is said

banished by his father Telamon, first disembarked. Then

follows the city Carpasia,<note anchored="yes">Carpas.</note> with a harbour. It is situated opposite to the promontory Sarpedon.<note anchored="yes">Lissan el Cape, in Cilicia.</note> From Carpasia there is

a transit across the isthmus of 30 stadia to the Carpasian

islands and the southern sea; next are a promontory and a

mountain. The name of the promontory is Olympus, and

upon it is a temple of Venus Acræa, not to be approached

nor seen by women.
</p><p>Near and in front lie the Cleides, and many other islands;

next are the Carpasian islands, and after these Salamis, the

birth-place of Aristus the historian; then Arsinoë, a city with

a harbour; next Leucolla, another harbour; then the promontory Pedalium, above which is a hill, rugged, lofty, and

table-shaped, sacred to Venus; to this hill from Cleides are

680 stadia. Then to Citium<note anchored="yes">Near the present Larnaka.</note> the navigation along the coast

is for the greater part difficult and among bays. Citium has

a close harbour. It is the birth-place of Zeno, the chief of

the Stoic sect, and of Apollonius the physician. Thence to

Berytus are <date value="1500">1500</date> stadia. Next is the city Amathus,<note anchored="yes">Limasol.</note> and

between Citium and Berytus, a small city called Palæa, and

a pap-shaped mountain, Olympus; then follows Curias,<note anchored="yes">Cape Gata</note> a

promontory of a peninsular form, to which from Throni<note anchored="yes">Cape Greg</note> are

700 stadia; then the city Curium,<note anchored="yes">Piscopia.</note> with a harbour, founded

by Argives.

Curias, and adds,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">That it was a cause of vast surprise to men to think how we scoured

For it is possible (by doubling the cape) to sail round from

Corycus to the beach of Curias, but not with the assistance of

the west wind, nor by keeping the island on the right, but on'

the left hand; and there is no (direct) passage across.
</p><p>At Curium is the commencement of the voyage towards the

west in the direction of Rhodes; then immediately follows a

promontory, whence those who touch with their hands the

altar of Apollo are precipitated. Next are Treta,<note anchored="yes">Capo Bianco.</note> Boosura,<note anchored="yes">Bisur.</note>

and Palepaphus, situated about 10 stadia from the sea, with a

harbour and an ancient temple of the Paphian Venus; then

follows Zephyria,<note anchored="yes">Point Zephyro.</note> a promontory with an anchorage, and another Arsinoë, which also has an anchorage, a temple, and a

grove. At a little distance from the sea is Hierocepis.<note anchored="yes">Jeroskipo.</note> Next

is Paphos, founded by Agapenor, with a harbour and temples,

which are fine buildings. It is distant from Palæpaphus 60

stadia by land. Along this road the annual sacred processions

are conducted, when a great concourse both of men and women

resort thither from other cities. Some writers say, that from

Paphos to Alexandreia are 3600 stadia. Next after Paphos

is the Acamas; then after the Acamas the voyage is easterly

to Arsinoë a city, and to the grove of Jupiter; then Soli<note anchored="yes">Solea.</note> a

city, where there is a harbour, a river, and a temple of Venus

and Isis. It was founded by Phalerus and Acamas, who

were Athenians. The inhabitants are called Solii. Stasanor,

one of the companions of Alexander, was a native of Soli, and

was honoured with a chief command. Above Soli in the interior is Limenia a city, then follows the promontory of Crommyon.

<p>But why should we be surprised at poets, and those particularly who study modes of expression only, when we compare them with Damastes? The latter gives the length of the

island from north to south, from Hierocepia, as he says, to

Cleides.
</p><p>Nor does even Eratosthenes give it exactly. For, when



<pb n="71"/>



he censures Damastes, he says that Hierocepia is not on the

north, but on the south. Yet neither is it on the south, but

on the west, since it lies on the western side, where are situated

Paphos and Acamas.
</p><p>Such then is the position of Cyprus.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is not inferior in fertility to any one of the islands,

for it produces good wine and oil, and sufficient corn to supply the wants of the inhabitants. At Tamassus there are

abundant mines of copper, in which the calcanthus is found,

and rust of copper, useful for its medicinal properties.
</p><p>Eratosthenes says, that anciently the plains abounded with

timber, and were covered with forests, which prevented cultivation; the mines were of some service towards clearing the

surface, for trees were cut down to smelt the copper and silver.

Besides this, timber was required for the construction of fleets,

as the sea was now navigated with security and by a large

naval force; but when even these means were insufficient to

check the growth of timber in the forests, permission was

given to such as were able and inclined, to cut down the trees

and to hold the land thus cleared as their own property, free

from all payments.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Formerly the Cyprian cities were governed by tyrants,

but from the time that the Ptolemaic kings were masters of

Egypt, Cyprus also came into their power, the Romans frequently affording them assistance. But when the last Ptolemy

that was king, brother of the father of Cleopatra, the queen of

Egypt in our time, had conducted himself in a disorderly

manner, and was ungrateful to his benefactors, he was deposed, and the Romans took possession of the island, which

became a Prætorian province by itself.
</p><p>The chief author of the deposition of the king was Pub.

Claudius Pulcher, who having fallen into the hands of the

Cilician pirates, at that time at the height of their power, and

a ransom being demanded of him, despatched a message to

the king, entreating him to send it for his release. The king

sent a ransom, but of so small an amount, that the pirates

disdained to accept it, and returned it, but they dismissed

Pulcher without any payment. After his escape, he remembered what he owed to both parties; and when he became

tribune of the people, he had sufficient influence to have Mar-

cus Cato sent to deprive the king of the possession of Cyprus.

The latter put himself to death before the arrival of Cato,

who, coming soon afterwards, took possession of Cyprus,

sold the king's property, and conveyed the money to the public

treasury of the Romans.
</p><p>From this time the island became, as it is at present, a

Prætorian province. During a short intervening period Antony had given it to Cleopatra and her sister Arsinoë, but

upon his death all his arrangements were annulled.

<p>The reader must receive the account of this country with

indulgence, for it lies at a very great distance, and few persons

of our nation have seen it; those also who have visited it have

seen only some portions of it; the greater part of what they

relate is from report, and even what they saw, they became

acquainted with during their passage through the country with

an army, and in great haste. For this reason they do not

agree in their accounts of the same things, although they write

about them as if they had examined them with the greatest

care and attention. Some of these writers were fellow-soldiers

and fellow-travellers, as those who belonged to the army which,

under the command of Alexander, conquered Asia; yet they

frequently contradict each other. If, then, they differ so much

respecting things which they had seen, what must we think of

what they relate from report?

when he mentions the Greeks who occasioned the revolt of

Seleucus Nicator, says, that when they became powerful they

invaded India. He adds no discoveries to what was previously known, and even asserts, in contradiction to others, that

the Bactrians had subjected to their dominion a larger portion of India than the Macedonians; for Eucratidas (one of

these kings) had a thousand cities subject to his authority.

But other writers affirm that the Macedonians conquered nine

nations situated between the Hydaspes<note anchored="yes">Behul or Jelum.</note> and the Hypanis,<note anchored="yes">Beas.</note>

and obtained possession of five hundred cities, not one of

which was less than Cos Meropis,<note anchored="yes">The island Cos, or Stanco, one of the earlier names of which was

<p>If, then, we set aside these stories, and direct our attention to accounts of the country prior to the expedition of

</p><p>According to Nearchus, Alexander was ambitious of conducting his army through Gedrosia,<note anchored="yes">Mekran.</note> when he heard that Semiramis and Cyrus had undertaken expeditions against India

(through this country), although both had abandoned the enterprise, the former escaping with twenty, and Cyrus with

seven men only. For he considered that it would be a glorious

achievement for him to lead a conquering army safe through

the same nations and countries where Semiramis and Cyrus

had suffered such disasters. Alexander, therefore, believed

these stories.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But how can we place any just confidence in the accounts



<pb n="75"/>



of India derived from such expeditions as those of Cyrus and

Semiramis? Megasthenes concurs in this opinion; he advises

persons not to credit the ancient histories of India, for, except

the expeditions of Hercules, of Bacchus, and the later invasion

of Alexander, no army was ever sent out of their country by

the Indians, nor did any foreign enemy ever invade or conquer

it. Sesostris the Egyptian (he says), and Tearco the Ethiopian, advanced as far as Europe; and Nabocodrosor, who

was more celebrated among the Chaldæans than Hercules

among the Greeks, penetrated even as far as the Pillars,<note anchored="yes">It is evident that the name Pillars misled Megasthenes or the writers

from whom he borrowed the facts; for it is impossible to suppose that

Tearcho, who reigned in Arabia, or that Nabuchodonosor, who reigned at

Babylon, ever conducted an army across the desert and through the whole

breadth of Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar, to which place nothing invited them, and the existence of which, as well as that of the neighbouring

countries, must have been unknown. The Egyptians, Arabians, and Babylonians directed their invasions towards the north, to Palestine, Syria,

Mesopotamia, Armenia, Iberia, and Colchis. This was the line of march

followed by Sesostris.

<p>Ptolemy indicates the existence of <q direct="unspecified">Pillars,</q> which he calls <q direct="unspecified">the Pillars of Alexander,</q> above Albania and Iberia, at the commencement of

the Asiatic Sarmatia. But as it is known that Alexander never penetrated

into these regions, it is clear that the title <q direct="unspecified">of Alexander</q> was added by

the Greeks to the names of mountains, which separated a country partly

civilized from that entirely occupied by hordes of savages. Everything

therefore seems to show, that these Pillars near Iberia in Asia, and not

the Pillars of Hercules in Europe, formed the boundary of the expeditions

of Sesostris, Tearcho, and Nabuchodonosor.—<emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></p></note>

which Tearco also reached; Sesostris conducted an army

from Iberia to Thrace and Pontus; Idanthyrsus the Scythian

overran Asia as far as Egypt; but not one of these persons

proceeded as far as India, and Semiramis died before her intended enterprise was undertaken. The Persians had sent for

the Hydraces<note anchored="yes">As the Oxydraci are here meant, Groskurd adopts this name in the text.

recent than the memorials of Troy, an invention of those who

composed the Heracleia (or exploits of Hercules,) whether it

were Peisander or some one else who composed it. But

the ancient wooden statues do not represent Hercules in that

everything that approaches nearest to probability. I have

</p><p>It appeared from the former discussion, that in the summary

given by Eratosthenes, in the third book of his Geography,

is contained the most credible account of the country considered as India at the time of its invasion by Alexander.
</p><p>At that period the Indus was the boundary of' India and of

Ariana,<note anchored="yes">Under the name of Ariana, the ancients comprehended almost all the

countries situated between the Indus and the meridian of the Caspian

Gates. This large space was afterwards divided by them according to the

common to the eastern and southern coast, and which projects

beyond the rest of that coast equally on the east and south.
</p><p>The western side, from the Caucasian mountains to the

Southern Sea, is estimated at 13,000 stadia, along the river

Indus to its mouth; wherefore the eastern side opposite, with

the addition of the 3000 stadia of the promontory, will be 16,000

stadia in extent. This is both the smallest and greatest

breadth of India.<note anchored="yes">The extremity of India, of which Eratosthenes speaks, is Cape Comorin, which he placed farther to the east than the mouth of the Ganges.</note> The length is reckoned from west to east.

The part of this extending (from the Indus) as far as Palibothra<note anchored="yes">Patelputer or Pataliputra near Patna, see b. ii. ch. i. § 9.</note> we may describe more confidently; for it has been

measured by Schœni,<note anchored="yes">The reading is <foreign lang="greek">sxoini/ois,</foreign> which Coraÿ changes to <foreign lang="greek">sxoi/nois,</foreign> Schœni:

The extent of the parts beyond depends upon conjecture

derived from the ascent of vessels from the sea by the Ganges

to Palibothra. This may be estimated at 6000 stadia.
</p><p>The whole, on the shortest computation, will amount to 16,000

stadia, according to Eratosthenes, who says that he took it

place to place),<note anchored="yes">Athenæus (b. xi. ch. 103, page 800, Bohn's Classical Library) speaks

distance, and depended on the nature of the country and the capability of

<p>From what has been said, we may perceive how the

opinions of the other writers differ from one another. Ctesias

says that India is not less than the rest of Asia; Onesicritus

regards it as the third part of the habitable world; Nearchus

says that it is a march of four months through the plain only.

The computations of Megasthenes and Deïmachus are more

moderate, for they estimate the distance from the Southern

Sea to Caucasus<note anchored="yes">The Indian Caucasus.</note> at above 20,000 stadia. Deïmachus says

that in some places it exceeds 30,000 stadia.
</p><p>We have replied to these writers in the early part of this

work.<note anchored="yes">Book ii. ch. i. § 3.</note> At present it is sufficient to say that these opinions

are in favour of the writers who, in describing India, solicit

indulgence if they do not advance anything with confidence.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The whole of India is watered by rivers, some of which

empty themselves into the two largest, the Indus and the

Ganges; others discharge themselves into the sea by their

own mouths. But all of them have their sources in the Caucasus. At their commencement their course is towards the

south; some of them continue to flow in the same direction,

particularly those which unite with the Indus; others turn to

the east, as the Ganges. This, the largest of the Indian rivers,

descends from the mountainous country, and when it reaches

the plains, turns to the east, then flowing past Palibothra, a

very large city, proceeds onwards to the sea in that quarter,

and discharges its waters by a single mouth. The Indus falls

into the Southern Sea, and empties itself by two mouths, encompassing the country called Patalene, which resembles the

Delta of Egypt.
</p><p>By the exhalation of vapours from such vast rivers, and by



<pb n="81"/>



the Etesian winds, India, as Eratosthenes affirms, is watered

by summer rains, and the plains are overflowed. During the

rainy season flax,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">li/non,</foreign> probably the <foreign lang="greek">li/non to\ a)po\ dendo|e/wn,</foreign> or cotton, of Arrian.</note> millet, sesamum, rice, and bosmorum<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">bo/smoo|on.</foreign> § 18.</note> are

sowed; and in the winter season, wheat, barley, pulse, and

other esculent fruits of the earth with which we are not acquainted. Nearly the same animals are bred in India as in

Ethiopia and Egypt, and the rivers of India produce all the

animals of those countries, except the hippopotamus, although

Onesicritus asserts that even this animal is found in them.

<milestone n="15" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Onesicritus, for example, says of Taprobane, that its

magnitude is 5000 stadia, without distinction of length or

breadth, and that it is distant twenty days' sail from the continent, but that it was a voyage performed with difficulty and

danger by vessels with sails ill constructed, and built with

prows at each end, but without holds and keels;<note anchored="yes">The text is, as Coraÿ observes, obscure, if not corrupt. The proposed emendations of Coraÿ and Kramer are followed.</note> that

there are other islands between this and India, but that Taprobane lies farthest to the south; that there are found in the

sea, about the island, animals of the cetaceous kind, in form

like oxen, horses, and other land-animals.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Nearchus, speaking of the accretion of earth form-



<pb n="82"/>



ed by the rivers, adduces these instances. The plains of

Hermes, Caÿster, Mæander, and Caïcus have these names,

because they have been formed by the soil which has been

carried over the plains by the rivers; or rather they were

produced by the fine and soft soil brought down from the

mountains; whence the plains are, as it were, the offspring

of the rivers, and it is rightly said, that the plains belong to

the rivers. What is said by Herodotus<note anchored="yes">Herod. ii. 5.</note> of the Nile, and of the

land about it, may be applied to this country, namely, that it

is the gift of the Nile. Hence Nearchus thinks that the Nile

had properly the synonym of Egypt.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus, however, says, that rain and snow fall

only on the mountains and the country immediately below

them, and that the plains experience neither one nor the

other, but are overflowed only by the rise of the waters of

the rivers; that the mountains are covered with snow in the

winter; that the rains set in at the commencement of spring,

and continue to increase; that at the time of the blowing of

the Etesian winds they pour down impetuously, without intermission, night and day till the rising of Arcturus,<note anchored="yes">At the beginning of autumn.</note> and that

the rivers, filled by the melting of the snow and by the rains,

irrigate the flat grounds.
</p><p>These things, he says, were observed by himself and by

others on their journey into India from the Paropamisadæ.

This was after the setting of the Pleiades,<note anchored="yes">At the beginning of winter.</note> and during their

stay in the mountainous country in the territory of the Hypasii, and in that of Assacanus during the winter. At the

beginning of spring they descended into the plains to a large

city called Taxila,<note anchored="yes">Taxila seems to have been situated at some distance to the east of

Attock.</note> thence they proceeded to the Hydaspes

and the country of Porus. During the winter they saw no

rain, but only snow. The first rain which fell was at Taxila.

After their descent to the Hydaspes and the conquest of

Porus, their progress was eastwards to the Hypanis, and

thence again to the Hydaspes. At this time it rained continually, and particularly during the blowing of the Etesian

winds, but at the rising of Arcturus the rains ceased. They

remained at the Hydaspes while the ships were constructing,



<pb n="83"/>



and began their voyage not many days before the setting of

the Pleiades, and were occupied during the whole autumn,

winter, and the ensuing spring and summer, in sailing down

the river, and arrived at Patalene<note anchored="yes">At the delta formed by the Indus.</note> about the rising of the

Dog-Star;<note anchored="yes">Towards the end of summer.</note> during the passage down the river, which lasted

ten months, they did not experience rain at any place, not

even when the Etesian winds were at their height, when the

rivers were full and the plains overflowed; the sea could not

be navigated on account of the blowing of contrary winds, but

no land breezes succeeded.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Nearchus gives the same account, but does not agree

with Aristobulus respecting the rains in summer, but says

that the plains are watered by rain in the summer, and that

they are without rain in winter. Both writers, however,

speak of the rise of the rivers. Nearchus says, that the men

encamped upon the Acesines<note anchored="yes">The Chenab.</note> were obliged to change their

situation for another more elevated, and that this was at the

time of the rise of the river, and of the summer solstice.
</p><p>Aristobulus gives even the measure of the height to which

the river rises, namely, forty cubits, of which twenty would

fill the channel beyond its previous depth up to the margin,

and the other twenty are the measure of the water when it

overflows the plains.
</p><p>They agree also in saying that the cities placed upon

mounds become islands, as in Egypt and Ethiopia, and that

the inundation ceases after the rising of Arcturus, when the

waters recede. They add, that the ground when half dried is

sowed, after having been prepared by the commonest labourer,

yet the plant comes to perfection, and the produce is good.

The rice, according to Aristobulus, stands in water in an

enclosure. It is sowed in beds. The plant is four cubits in

height, with many ears, and yields a large produce. The

harvest is about the time of the setting of the Pleiades, and

the grain is beaten out like barley. It grows in Bactriana,

Babylonia, Susis, and in the Lower Syria. Megillus says

that it is sowed before the rains, but does not require irrigation or transplantation, being supplied with water from tanks.
</p><p>The bosmorum, according to Onesicritus, is a kind of

corn smaller than wheat, and grows in places situated be-



<pb n="84"/>



tween rivers. After it is threshed out, it is roasted; the

threshers being previously bound by an oath not to carry

it away unroasted from the threshing floor; a precaution to

prevent the exportation of the seed.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus, when comparing the circumstances in

which this country resembles, and those in which it differs

from, Egypt and Ethiopia, and observing that the swelling of

the Nile is occasioned by rains in the south, and of the Indian

rivers by rains from the north, inquires why the intermediate

places have no rain; for it does not rain in the Thebais as far

as Syene, nor at the places near Meroe, nor in the parts of

India from Patalene to the Hydaspes. But the country

situated above these parts,<note anchored="yes">The district between Moultan and the mountains.</note> in which both rain and snow

occur, is cultivated by the husbandman in the same manner

as the country without India; for the rain and the snow supply the ground with moisture.
</p><p>It is probable from what he relates that the country is subject to shocks of earthquakes, that the ground is loose and

hollow by excess of moisture, and easily splits into fissures,

whence even the course of rivers is altered.
</p><p>He says that when he was despatched upon some business

into the country, he saw a tract of land deserted, which contained more than a thousand cities with their dependent villages; the Indus, having left its proper channel, was diverted

into another, on the left hand, much deeper, and precipitated

itself into it like a cataract, so that it no longer watered the

country by the (usual) inundation on the right hand, from

which it had receded, and this was elevated above the level,

not only of the new channel of the river, but above that of

the (new) inundation.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The account of Onesicritus confirms the facts of the

rising of the rivers and of the absence of land breezes. He

says that the sea-shore is swampy, particularly near the

mouths of rivers, on account of the mud, tides, and the force

of the winds blowing from the sea.
</p><p>Megasthenes also indicates the fertility of India by the

circumstance of the soil producing fruits and grain twice a

year. Eratosthenes relates the same facts, for he speaks of a

winter and a summer sowing, and of the rain at the same



<pb n="85"/>



seasons. For there is no year, according to him, which is

without rain at both those periods, whence ensues great

abundance, the ground never failing to bear crops.
</p><p>An abundance of fruit is produced by trees; and the roots

of plants, particularly of large reeds, possess a sweetness,

which they have by nature and by coction; for the water,

both from rains and rivers, is warmed by the sun's rays.

The meaning of Eratosthenes seems to be this, that what

among other nations is called the ripening of fruits and juices,

is called among these <emph rend="ital">coction,</emph> and which contributes as much

to produce an agreeable flavour as the coction by fire. To

this is attributed the flexibility of the branches of trees, from

which wheels of carriages are made, and to the same cause is

imputed the growth upon some trees of wool.<note anchored="yes">Herod. ii. 86. Velleraque ut folüs depectant tenuia Seres? Virg.

Geor. ii. 121.</note> Nearchus

says that their fine clothes were made of this wool, and that

the Macedonians used it for mattresses and the stuffing of

saddles. The Serica<note anchored="yes">Cloth of silk.</note> also are of a similar kind, and are made

of dry byssus, which is obtained from some sort of bark of

plants. He says that reeds<note anchored="yes">The sugar-cane.</note> yield honey, although there are

no bees, and that there is a tree from the fruit of which honey

is procured, but that the fruit eaten fresh causes intoxication.

<milestone n="21" unit="section"/></p>
<p>India produces many singular trees. There is one whose

branches incline downwards, and whose leaves are not less in

size than a shield. Onesicritus, describing minutely the

country of Musicanus, which he says is the most southerly

part<note anchored="yes">C. i. § 33.</note> of India, relates, that there are some large trees the

branches of which extend to the length even of twelve cubits.

They then grow downwards, as though bent (by force), till

they touch the earth, where they penetrate and take root like

layers. They next shoot upwards and form a trunk. They

again grow as we have described, bending downwards, and

implanting one layer after another, and in the above order,

so that one tree forms a long shady roof, like a tent, supported

by many pillars. In speaking of the size of the trees, he says

their trunks could scarcely be clasped by five men.<note anchored="yes">The Banyan tree.</note>
</p><p>Aristobulus also, where he mentions the Acesines, and its

confluence with the Hyarotis, speaks of trees with their

boughs bent downwards and of a size that fifty, but, accord-



<pb n="86"/>



ing to Onesicritus, four hundred horsemen might take shelter

at mid-day beneath the shade of a single tree.
</p><p>Aristobulus mentions another tree, not large, bearing great

pods, like the bean, ten fingers in length, full of honey,<note anchored="yes">Probably the Caroubba (Lotus Zizyphus), but it does not produce

the effect here mentioned.</note> and

says that those who eat it do not easily escape with life. But

the accounts of all these writers about the size of the trees

have been exceeded by those who assert that there has been

seen, beyond the Hyarotis,<note anchored="yes">The Ravee.</note> a tree which casts a shade at noon

of five stadia.
</p><p>Aristobulus says of the wool-bearing trees, that the flower

pod contains a kernel, which is taken out, and the remainder

is combed like wool.

<milestone n="22" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the country of Musicanus there grows, he says,

spontaneously grain resembling wheat, and a vine that produces wine, whereas other authors affirm that there is no

wine in India. Hence, according to Anacharsis, they had no

pipes, nor any musical instruments, except cymbals, drums,

and crotala, which were used by jugglers.
</p><p>Both Aristobulus and other writers relate that India produces many medicinal plants and roots, both of a salutary

and noxious quality, and plants yielding a variety of colours.

He adds, that, by a law, any person discovering a deadly

substance is punished with death unless he also discover an

antidote; in case he discovers an antidote, he is rewarded by

the king.
</p><p>Southern India, like Arabia and Ethiopia, produces cinnamon, nard, and other aromatics. It resembles these countries as

regards the effect of the sun's rays, but it surpasses them in having a copious supply of water, whence the atmosphere is humid,

and on this account more conducive to fertility and fecundity;

and this applies to the earth and to the water, hence those

animals which inhabit both one and the other are of a larger

size than are found in other countries. The Nile contributes

to fecundity more than other rivers, and among other animals

of large bulk, produces the amphibious kind. The Egyptian

women also sometimes have four children at a birth, and

Aristotle says that one woman had seven children at one

birth.<note anchored="yes">Arist. Hist. An vii. 4, who speaks however of five only.</note> He calls the Nile most fecundating and nutritive, on



<pb n="87"/>



account of the moderate coction effected by the sun's rays,

which leave behind the nutritious part of substances, and

evaporate that which is superfluous.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is perhaps owing to this cause that the water of the

Nile boils, as he says, with one half of the heat which other

water requires. In proportion however, he says, as the water

of the Nile traverses in a straight line, a long and narrow

tract of country, passing through a variety of climates and

of atmosphere, while the Indian rivers are poured forth into

wider and more extensive plains, their course being delayed

a long time in the same climate, in the same degree the

waters of India are more nutritious than those of the Nile;

they produce larger animals of the cetaceous kind, and in

greater number (than the Nile), and the water which descends from the clouds has already undergone the process of

coction.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>This would not be admitted by the followers of Aristobulus, who say that the plains are not watered by rain. Onesicritus, however, thinks that rain-water is the cause of the

peculiar properties of animals, and alleges in proof, that the

colour of foreign herds which drink of it is changed to that

of the native animals.
</p><p>This is a just remark; but it is not proper to attribute to

the power of the water merely the cause of the black complexion and the woolly hair of the Ethiopians, and yet he

censures Theodectes, who refers these peculiarities to the

effects of the sun, in these words,

<quote><l>Near these approaching with his radiant car,
</l><l>The sun their skins with dusky tint doth dye,
</l><l>And sooty hue; and with unvarying forms
</l><l>Of fire, crisps their tufted hair.</l></quote>

There may be reason in this, for he says that the sun does

not approach nearer to the Ethiopians than to other nations,

but shines more perpendicularly, and that on this account the

heat is greater; indeed, it cannot be correctly said that the

sun approaches near to the Ethiopians, for he is at an equal

distance from all nations. Nor is the heat the cause of the

black complexion, particularly of children in the womb, who

are out of the reach of the sun. Their opinion is to be preferred, who attribute these effects to the sun and to intense

solar heat, causing a great deficiency of moisture on the sur-



<pb n="88"/>



face of the skin. Hence we say it is that the Indians have

not woolly hair, nor is their colour so intensely<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">peplhsme/nws.</foreign> <emph rend="ital">Coraÿ.</emph></note> dark, because

they live in a humid atmosphere.
</p><p>With respect to children in the womb, they resemble their

parents (in colour) according to a seminal disposition and constitution, on the same principle that hereditary diseases, and

other likenesses, are explained.
</p><p>The equal distance of the sun from all nations (according to

Onesicritus) is an argument addressed to the senses, and not

to reason. But it is not an argument addressed to the senses

generally, but in the meaning that the earth bears the proportion of a point to the sun, for we may understand such a

meaning of an argument addressed to the senses, by which

we estimate heat to be more or less, as it is near or at a distance, in which cases it is not the same; and in this meaning,

not in that of Onesicritus, the sun is said to be near the

Ethiopians.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is admitted by those who maintain the resemblance of

India to Egypt and Ethiopia, that the plains which are not

overflowed do not produce anything for want of water.
</p><p>Nearchus says, that the old question respecting the rise of

the Nile is answered by the case of the Indian rivers, namely,

that it is the effect of summer rains; when Alexander saw

crocodiles in the Hydaspes, and Egyptian beans in the Acesines, he thought that he had discovered the sources of the

Nile, and was about to equip a fleet with the intention of sailing by this river to Egypt; but he found out shortly after-

wards that his design could not be accomplished,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">for in midway were vast rivers, fearful waters, and first the ocean,</q><note anchored="yes">Od. ii. 157.</note></quote>

into which all the Indian rivers discharge themselves; then

Ariana, the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, all Arabia and Troglodytica.
</p><p>The above is what has been said on the subject of winds

and rains, the rising of rivers, and the inundation of plains.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We must describe these rivers in detail, with the particulars, which are useful for the purposes of geography, and

which have been handed down to us by historians.
</p><p>Besides this, rivers, being a kind of physical boundaries of

every part of the present work. But the Nile and the rivers

in India have a superiority above the rest, because the country could not be inhabited without them. By means of the

rivers it is open to navigation and capable of cultivation, when

otherwise it would not be accessible, nor could it be occupied

by inhabitants.
</p><p>We shall speak of the rivers deserving notice, which flow

into the Indus, and of the countries which they traverse; with

regard to the rest we know some particulars, but are ignorant

of more. Alexander, who discovered the greatest portion of

this country, first of all resolved it to be more expedient to

pursue and destroy those who had treacherously killed Darius, and were meditating the revolt of Bactriana. He approached India therefore through Ariana, which he left on

the right hand, and crossed the Paropamisus to the northern

parts, and to Bactriana.<note anchored="yes">That is to say, he crossed the Paropamisus, or Mount Ghergistan,

from the western frontier of Cabul, by the pass of Bamian, to enter the

district of Balk.</note> Having conquered all the country

subject to the Persians, and many other places besides, he

then entertained the desire of possessing India, of which he

had received many, although indistinct, accounts.
</p><p>He therefore returned, crossing over the same mountains by

other and shorter roads, having India on the left hand; he

then immediately turned towards it, and towards its western

boundaries and the rivers Cophes and Choaspes.<note anchored="yes">The Attock.</note> The latter

river empties itself into the Cophes,<note anchored="yes">The river of Cabul.</note> near Plemyrium, after

passing by another city Gorys, in its course through Bandobene and Gandaritis.<note anchored="yes">The Gandaræ were a widely extended people of Indian or Arianian

origin, who occupied a district extending more or less from the upper part

of the Punjab to the neighbourhood of Candahar, and variously called

Gandaris and Gandaritis. See Prof. Wilson's <emph rend="ital">Ariana Antiqua.</emph></note>
</p><p>He was informed that the mountainous and northern parts

were the most habitable and fertile, but that the southern

part was either without water, or liable to be overflowed by

rivers at one time, or entirely burnt up at another, more fit to

be the haunts of wild beasts than the dwellings of men. He

resolved therefore to get possession of that part of India first

which had been well spoken of, considering at the same time

that the rivers which it was necessary to pass, and which flowed



<pb n="90"/>



transversely through the country which he intended to attack,

would be crossed with more facility near their sources. He

heard also that many of the rivers united and formed one

stream, and that this more frequently occurred the farther they

advanced into the country, so that from want of boats it would

be more difficult to traverse. Being apprehensive of this obstruction, he crossed the Cophes, and conquered the whole of

the mountainous country situated towards the east.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to the Cophes was the Indus, then the Hydaspes,

prevented from proceeding farther, partly from regard to some

oracles, and partly compelled by his army, which was exhausted by toil and fatigue, but whose principal distress arose

from their constant exposure to rain. Hence we became acquainted with the eastern parts of India on this side the

Hypanis, and whatever parts besides which have been described by those who, after Alexander, advanced beyond the

Hypanis to the Ganges and Palibothra.

<p>Between the Indus and the Hydaspes is Taxila, a large

city, and governed by good laws. The neighbouring country

is crowded with inhabitants and very fertile, and here unites

with the plains. The people and their king Taxiles received

Alexander with kindness, and obtained in return more presents than they had offered to Alexander; so that the Macedonians became jealous, and observed, that it seemed as if

Alexander had found none on whom he could confer favours

before he passed the Indus. Some writers say that this

country is larger than Egypt.

reported, kept two serpents, one of 80, and the other, according to Onesicritus, of 140 cubits in length. This writer

may as well be called the master fabulist as the master pilot

of Alexander. For all those who accompanied Alexander

preferred the marvellous to the true, but this writer seems to

have surpassed all in his description of prodigies. Some things,

however, he relates which are probable and worthy of record,

and will not be passed over in silence even by one who does

not believe their correctness.

does not contradict our author; for, as Vincent observes, the modern

Lahore represents the capital of the second Porus, whom Strabo will mention immediately; and the Lahore situate between the Hydaspes (the

Behut or Jelum) and the Acesines (the Chenab), the exact position of

which is unknown, was that of the first Porus. Probably these two districts, in which the two cities were situated, formed a single district only,

one part of which was occupied and governed by Porus the uncle, and the

other by Porus the nephew. It is probable, also, that these two princes

took their name from the country itself, Lahore, as the prince of Taxila

was called Taxiles, and the prince of Palibothra, Palibothrus.</note> an extensive and fertile district, containing nearly

three hundred cities. Here also is the forest in the neighbourhood of the Emodi mountains in which Alexander cut

down a large quantity of fir, pine, cedar, and a variety of other

trees fit for ship-building, and brought the timber down the

Hydaspes. With this he constructed a fleet on the Hydaspes,

near the cities, which he built on each side of the river where

he had crossed it and conquered Porus. One of these cities

</p><p>In the forest before mentioned it is said there is a vast

number of monkeys,<note anchored="yes">Cercopitheces.</note> and as large as they are numerous. On

one occasion the Macedonians, seeing a body of them standing

in array opposite to them, on some bare eminences, (for this

animal is not less intelligent than the elephant,) and presenting the appearance of an army, prepared to attack them as

real enemies, but being informed by Taxiles, who was then

with the king, of the real fact, they desisted.
</p><p>The chase of this animal is conducted in two different

manners. It is an imitative creature, and takes refuge up

among the trees. The hunters, when they perceive a monkey

seated on a tree, place in sight a basin containing water,

with which they wash their own eyes; then, instead of water,

they put a basin of bird-lime, go away, and lie in wait at a

distance. The animal leaps down, and besmears itself with

the bird-lime, and when it winks, the eyelids are fastened together; the hunters then come upon it, and take it.
</p><p>The other method of capturing them is as follows: the

hunters dress themselves in bags like trowsers, and go away,

leaving behind them others which are downy, with the inside smeared over with bird-lime. The monkeys put them on,

and are easily taken.

<p>Some writers place Cathaia<note anchored="yes">Hence the Cathay of the Chinese and Modern Europe.</note> and the country of Sopeithes, one of the nomarchs, in the tract between the rivers

(Hydaspes and Acesines); some, on the other side of the

Acesines and of the Hyarotis, on the confines of the territory of the other Porus, the nephew of Porus who was taken

prisoner by Alexander, and call the country subject to him

Gandaris.
</p><p>A very singular usage is related of the high estimation

in which the inhabitants of Cathaia hold the quality of



<pb n="93"/>



beauty, which they extend to horses and dogs. According

to Onesicritus, they elect the handsomest person as king.

The child (selected), two months after birth, undergoes a public

inspection, and is examined. They determine whether it has

the amount of beauty required by law, and whether it is

worthy to be permitted to live. The presiding magistrate

then pronounces whether it is to be allowed to live, or whether

it is to be put to death.
</p><p>They dye their heads with various and the most florid

colours, for the purpose of improving their appearance. This

custom prevails elsewhere among many of the Indians, who

pay great attention to their hair and dress; and the country

produces colours of great beauty. In other respects the

people are frugal, but are fond of ornament.
</p><p>A peculiar custom is related of the Cathæi. The bride and

the husband are respectively the choice of each other, and the

wives burn themselves with their deceased husbands. The

reason assigned for this practice is, that the women sometimes

fell in love with young men, and deserted or poisoned their

husbands. This law was therefore established in order to

check the practice of administering poison; but neither the

existence nor the origin of the law are probable facts.
</p><p>It is said, that in the territory of Sopeithes there is a mountain composed of fossile salt, sufficient for the whole of India.

Valuable mines also both of gold and silver are situated, it is

said, not far off among other mountains, according to the testimony of Gorgus, the miner (of Alexander). The Indians,

unacquainted with mining and smelting, are ignorant of their

own wealth, and therefore traffic with greater simplicity.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The dogs in the territory of Sopeithes are said to possess remarkable courage: Alexander received from Sopeithes

a present of one hundred and fifty of them. To prove them,

two were set at a lion; when these were mastered, two others

were set on; when the battle became equal, Sopeithes ordered a man to seize one of the dogs by the leg, and to drag

him away; or to cut off his leg, if he still held on. Alexander

at first refused his consent to the dog's leg being cut off, as

he wished to save the dog. But on Sopeithes saying, <q direct="unspecified">I will

give you four in the place of it,</q> Alexander consented; and

he saw the dog permit his leg to be cut off by a slow incision,

rather than loose his hold.

<p>The direction of the march, as far as the Hydaspes,

was for the most part towards the south. After that, to

the Hypanis, it was more towards the east. The whole of

it, however, was much nearer to the country lying at the foot

of the mountains than to the plains. Alexander therefore,

when he returned from the Hypanis to the Hydaspes and

the station of his vessels, prepared his fleet, and set sail on

the Hydaspes.

</p><p>Alexander's intention was to relinquish the march towards

the parts situated to the east, first, because he was prevented

from crossing the Hypanis; next, because he learnt by experience the falsehood of the reports previously received, to

the effect that the plains were burnt up with fire, and more

fit for the haunts of wild beasts than for the habitation of

man. He therefore set out in this direction, relinquishing

the other track; so that these parts became better known

</p><p>The following are their peculiarities : to have a kind of Lacedæmonian common meal, where they eat in public. Their food

consists of what is taken in the chase. They make no use of

gold nor silver, although they have mines of these metals. Instead of slaves, they employed youths in the flower of their age,

as the Cretans employ the Aphamiotæ, and the Lacedæmonians

the Helots. They study no science with attention but that

of medicine; for they consider the excessive pursuit of some

arts, as that of war, and the like, to be committing evil.

There is no process at law but against murder and outrage,

for it is not in a person's own power to escape either one or

the other; but as contracts are in the power of each individual,

he must endure the wrong, if good faith is violated by another;

for a man should be cautious whom he trusts, and not disturb

ditch, which serves the purpose of defence and of a sewer for

the city. The people in whose country the city is situated

are the most distinguished of all the tribes, and are called

Prasii. The king, besides his family name, has the surname

<p>All the country on the other side of the Hypanis is

allowed to be very fertile, but we have no accurate knowledge of it. Either through ignorance or from its remote

situation, everything relative to it is exaggerated or partakes

of the wonderful. As, for example, the stories of myrmeces

(or ants),<note anchored="yes">Herodotus iii. 102. The marmot?</note> which dig up gold; of animals and men with

peculiar shapes, and possessing extraordinary faculties; of

the longevity of the Seres, whose lives exceed the age of two

government, consisting of five hundred counsellors, each of

whom furnishes the state with an elephant.
</p><p>According to Megasthenes, the largest tigers are found

among the Prasii, almost twice the size of lions, and of such

strength that a tame one led by four persons seized a mule

by its hinder leg, overpowered it, and dragged it to him. The

monkeys are larger than the largest dogs; they are of a white

colour, except the face, which is black. The contrary is observed in other places. Their tails are more than two cubits

in length. They are very tame, and not of a mischievous

disposition. They neither attack people, nor steal.

<p>In the mountainous country is a river, the Silas, on the

that no bird can sustain its flight in them. Vapours also,

which ascend (from some substances), attract and absorb, as it

were, whatever is flying over them; as amber attracts straw,

and the magnet iron, and perhaps there may be in water

a similar power.
</p><p>As these matters belong to physics and to the question of

floating bodies, these must be referred to them. At present

we must proceed to what follows, and to the subjects more

nearly relating to geography.

<milestone n="39" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is said that the Indians are divided into seven

castes. The first in rank, but the smallest in number, are

the philosophers. Persons who intend to offer sacrifice, or

to perform any sacred rite, have the services of these persons

on their private account; but the kings employ them in a

public capacity at the time of the Great Assembly, as it is

called, where at the beginning of the new year all the philosophers repair to the king at the gate, and anything useful

which they have committed to writing, or observed, tending

to improve the productions of the earth or animals, or of

advantage to the government of the state, is then publicly

declared.
</p><p>Whoever has been detected in giving false information

thrice is enjoined silence by law during the rest of his life;

but he who has made correct observations is exempted from all

contributions and tribute.

<milestone n="40" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The second caste is that of husbandmen, who constitute-

the majority of natives, and are a most mild and gentle people, as they are exempted from military service, and cultivate



<pb n="99"/>



their land free from alarm; they do not resort to cities, either

to transact private business, or take part in public tumults

It therefore frequently happens that at the same time, and in

the same part of the country, one body of men are in battle

array, and engaged in contests with the enemy, while others

are ploughing or digging in security, having these soldiers

to protect them. The whole of the territory belongs to the

king. They cultivate it on the terms of receiving as wages a

fourth part of the produce.

<milestone n="41" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The third caste consists of shepherds and hunters, who

alone are permitted to hunt, to breed cattle, to sell and to let

out for hire beasts of burden. In return for freeing the

country from wild beasts and birds, which infest sown fields,

they receive an allowance of corn from the king. They lead

a wandering life, and dwell in tents. No private person is

allowed to keep a horse or an elephant. The possession of

either one or the other is a royal privilege, and persons are

appointed to take care of them.

<milestone n="42" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The manner of hunting the elephant is as follows:

Round a bare spot a ditch is dug, of about four or five stadia

in extent, and at the place of entrance a very narrow bridge

is constructed. Into the enclosure three or four of the tamest

female elephants are driven. The men themselves lie in wait

under cover of concealed huts. The wild elephants do not

approach the females by day, but at night they enter the

enclosure one by one; when they have passed the entrance,

the men secretly close it. They then introduce the strongest

of the tame combatants, the drivers of which engage with the

wild animals, and also wear them out by famine; when the

latter are exhausted by fatigue, the boldest of the drivers gets

down unobserved, and creeps under the belly of his own

elephant. From this position he creeps beneath the belly of

the wild elephant, and ties his legs together; when this is done,

a signal is given to the tame elephants to beat those which are

tied by the legs, till they fall to the ground. After they have

fallen down, they fasten the wild and tame elephants together

by the neck with thongs of raw cow-hide, and, in order that

they may not be able to shake off those who are attempting

to mount them, cuts are made round the neck, and thongs of

leather are put into these incisions, so that they submit to their

bonds through pain, and so remain quiet. Among the ele-



<pb n="100"/>



phants which are taken, those are rejected which are too old

or too young for service; the remainder are led away to the

stables. They tie their feet one to another, and their necks

to a pillar firmly fastened in the ground, and tame them by

hunger. They recruit their strength afterwards with green

cane and grass. They then teach them to obey; some by

words; others they pacify by tunes, accompanied with the

beating of a drum. Few are difficult to be tamed; for they

are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, so as to approximate to the character of a rational animal. Some have

taken up their drivers, who have fallen on the ground lifeless,

and carried them safe out of battle. Others have fought, and

protected their drivers, who have crept between their fore-legs.

If they have killed any of their feeders or masters in anger,

they feel their loss so much that they refuse their food through

grief, and sometimes die of hunger.

<milestone n="43" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They copulate like horses, and produce young chiefly

in the spring. It is the season for the male, when he is in heat

and is ferocious. At this period he discharges some fatty

matter through an opening in the temples. It is the season

also for the females, when this same passage is open, Eighteen months is the longest, and sixteen the shortest period

that they go with young. The dam suckles her young six

years, Many of them live as long as men who attain to the

greatest longevity, some even to the protracted age of two

</p><p>They are subject to many diseases, which are difficult to be

cured. A remedy for diseases of the eye is to bathe them

with cow's milk. For complaints in general, they drink dark

wine. In cases of wounds, they drink butter; for it draws

flesh.
</p><p>Onesicritus says, that they live three hundred years, and

rarely five hundred; and that they go with young ten years.

He and other writers say, that they are larger and stronger

than the African elephants. They will pull down with their

trunks battlements, and uproot trees, standing erect upon their

bind feet.
</p><p>According to Nearchus, traps are laid in the hunting

grounds, at certain places where roads meet; the wild elephants are forced into the 'oils by the tame elephants, which

are stronger, and guided by a driver. They become so tame

and docile, that they learn even to throw a stone at a mark,

to use military weapons, and to be excellent swimmers. A

possession, and they are driven without bridles.<note anchored="yes">The passage is corrupt.

<p>This writer says that he saw skins of the myrmeces (or

ants), which dig up gold, as large as the skins of leopards.

Megasthenes, however, speaking of the myrmeces, says,

among the Derdæ a populous nation of the Indians, living

towards the east, and among the mountains, there was a mountain plain of about 3000 stadia in circumference; that below

this plain were mines containing gold, which the myrmeces, in

size not less than foxes, dig up. They are excessively fleet,

and subsist on what they catch. In winter they dig holes,

and pile up the earth in heaps, like moles, at the mouths of

the openings.
</p><p>The gold-dust which they obtain requires little preparation

by fire. The neighbouring people go after it by stealth, with

beasts of burden; for if it is done openly, the myrmeces fight

furiously, pursuing those that run away, and if they seize

them, kill them and the beasts. In order to prevent discovery,

they place in various parts pieces of the flesh of wild beasts,

and when the myrmeces are dispersed in various directions.

they take away the gold-dust, and, not being acquainted with

the mode of smelting it, dispose of it in its rude state at any

price to merchants.

<p>Having mentioned what Megasthenes and other writers

relate of the hunters and the beasts of prey, we must add the

following particulars.
</p><p>Nearchus is surprised at the multitude and the noxious

nature of the tribe of reptiles. They retreat from the plains

to the settlements, which are not covered with water at the

period of inundations, and fill the houses. For this reason

the inhabitants raise their beds at some height from the



<pb n="102"/>



ground, and are sometimes compelled to abandon their dwellings, when they are infested by great multitudes of these

animals; and, if a great proportion of these multitudes were

not destroyed by the waters, the country would be a desert.

Both the minuteness of some animals and the excessive magnitude of others are causes of danger; the former, because it

is difficult to guard against their attacks; the latter, on account

of their strength, for snakes are to be seen of sixteen cubits in

length. Charmers go about the country, and are supposed to

cure wounds made by serpents. This seems to comprise

nearly their whole art of medicine, for disease is not frequent

among them, which is owing to their frugal manner of life, and

to the absence of wine; whenever diseases do occur, they are

</p><p>Aristobulus says, that he saw no animals of these pretended

magnitudes, except a snake, which was nine cubits and a span

in length. And I myself saw one in Egypt, nearly of the

same size, which was brought from India. He says also, that

he saw many serpents of a much inferior size, and asps and

large scorpions. None of these, however, are so noxious as

the slender small serpents, a span long, which are found concealed in tents, in vessels, and in hedges. Persons wounded

by them bleed from every pore, suffering great pain, and die,

unless they have immediate assistance; but this assistance is

easily obtained, by means of the virtues of the Indian roots

and drugs.

</p><p>So much then on the subject of the wild animals of India.

We shall return to Megasthenes, and resume our account

where we digressed.

<milestone n="46" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the hunters and the shepherds, follows the fourth

caste, which consists, he says, of those who work at trades,

retail wares, and who are employed in bodily labour. Some

of these pay taxes, and perform certain stated services. But

the armour-makers and ship-builders receive wages and provisions from the king, for whom only they work. The general-in-chief furnishes the soldiers with arms, and the admiral

lets out ships for hire to those who undertake voyages and

traffic as merchants.

<milestone n="47" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The fifth caste consists of fighting men, who pass the

time not employed in the field in idleness and drinking, and

are maintained at the charge of the king. They are ready

whenever they are wanted to march on an expedition, for they

bring nothing of their own with them, except their bodies.

<milestone n="48" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The sixth caste is that of the Ephori, or inspectors.

They are intrusted with the superintendence of all that is

going on, and it is their duty to report privately to the king.

The city inspectors employ as their coadjutors the city courtesans; and the inspectors of the camp, the women who follow

it. The best and the most faithful persons are appointed to the

office of inspector.

<milestone n="49" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The seventh caste consists of counsellors and assessors of

the king. To these persons belong the offices of state, tribunals of justice, and the whole administration of affairs.
</p><p>It is not permitted to contract marriage with a person of

another caste, nor to change from one profession or trade to

another, nor for the same person to undertake several, except

he is of the caste of philosophers, when permission is given,

on account of his superior qualifications.

<milestone n="50" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of the magistrates, some have the charge of the market,

others of the city, others of the soldiery. Some have the care

of the rivers, measure the land, as in Egypt, and inspect the

closed reservoirs, from which water is distributed by canals, so

that all may have an equal use of it. These persons have

charge also of the hunters, and have the power of rewarding

or punishing those who merit either. They collect the taxes,

and superintend the occupations connected with land, as woodcutters, carpenters, workers in brass, and miners. They



<pb n="104"/>



superintend the public roads, and place a pillar at every ten

stadia, to indicate the by-ways and distances.

<milestone n="51" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Those who have charge of the city are divided into six

bodies of five each. The first has the inspection of everything

relating to the mechanical arts; the second entertain strangers, assign lodgings, observe their mode of life, by means of

attendants whom they attach to them, escort them out of the

country on their departure; if they die, take charge of their

property, have the care of them when sick, and when they

die, bury them.
</p><p>The third class consists of those who inquire at what time

and in what manner births and deaths take place, which is

done with a view to tax (on these occasions), and in order that

the deaths and births of persons both of good and bad character should not be concealed.
</p><p>The fourth division consists of those who are occupied in

sales and exchanges; they have the charge of measures, and

of the sale of the products in season, by a signal. The same

person is not allowed to exchange various kinds of articles,

except he pays a double tax.
</p><p>The fifth division presides over works of artisans, and disposes of articles by public notice. The new are sold apart

from the old, and there is a fine imposed for mixing them

together. The sixth and last comprises those who collect

the tenth of the price of the articles sold. Death is the punishment for committing a fraud with regard to the tax.
</p><p>These are the peculiar duties performed by each class, but

in their collective capacity they have the charge both of

their own peculiar province and of civil affairs, the repairs of

public works, prices<note anchored="yes">Groskurd proposes <foreign lang="greek">teixw=n,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">walls,</q> in place of, <foreign lang="greek">timw=n,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">prices.</q></note> of articles, of markets, harbours, and

temples.

<milestone n="52" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to the magistrates of the city is a third body of governors, who have the care of military affairs. This class also

consists of six divisions, each composed of five persons. One

division is associated with the chief naval superintendent,

another with the person who has the charge of the bullock-teams, by which military engines are transported, of provisions

both for the men and beasts, and other requisites for the army.

They furnish attendants, who beat a drum, and carry gongs;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">Kw/dwn,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">a bell,</q> or gong, or trumpet?</note>



<pb n="105"/>



and besides these, grooms, mechanists, and their assistants.

They despatch by the sound of the gong the foragers for grass,

and insure expedition and security by rewards and punishments. The third division has the care of the infantry; the

fourth, of the horses; the fifth, of the chariots; the sixth, of the

elephants. There are royal stables for the horses and elephants. There is also a royal magazine of arms; for the

soldier returns his arms to the armoury, and the horse and

elephant to the stables. They use the elephants without

bridles. The chariots are drawn on the march by oxen. The

horses are led by a halter, in order that their legs may not be

chafed and inflamed, nor their spirit damped, by drawing

chariots. Besides the charioteer, there are two persons who

fight by his side in the chariot. With the elephant are four

persons, the driver and three bowmen, who discharge arrows

from his back.

<milestone n="53" unit="section"/></p>
<p>All the Indians are frugal in their mode of life, and

especially in camp. They do not tolerate useless and undisciplined multitudes, and consequently observe good order. Theft

is very rare among them. Megasthenes, who was in the camp

of Sandrocottus, which consisted of 400,000 men, did not

witness on any day thefts reported, which exceeded the sum

of two hundred drachmae, and this among a people who have

no written laws, who are ignorant even of writing, and regulate

everything by memory. They are, however, happy on account

of their simple manners and frugal way of life. They never

drink wine, but at sacrifices. Their beverage is made from

rice instead of barley, and their food consists for the most part

of rice pottage. The simplicity of their laws and contracts

appears from their not having many law-suits. They have no

suits respecting pledges and deposits, nor do they require

witnesses or seals, but make their deposits, and confide in one

another. Their houses and property are unguarded. These

things denote temperance and sobriety; others no one would

approve, as their eating always alone, and their not having

all of them one common hour for their meals, but each taking

it as he likes. The contrary custom is more agreeable to the

habits of social and civil life.

<milestone n="54" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As an exercise of the body they prefer friction in

various ways, but particularly by making use of smooth sticks

of ebony, which they pass over the surface of the body.



<pb n="106"/>


</p><p>Their sepulchres are plain, and the tumuli of earth low.
</p><p>In contrast to their parsimony in other things, they indulge

in ornament. They wear dresses worked with gold and

precious stones, and flowered (variegated) robes, and are attended by persons following them with umbrellas; for as they

highly esteem beauty, everything is attended to, which can

improve their looks.
</p><p>They respect alike truth and virtue; therefore they do not

assign any privilege to the old, unless they possess superior

wisdom.
</p><p>They marry many wives, who are purchased from their

parents, and give in exchange for them a yoke of oxen. Some

marry wives to possess obedient attendants, others with a

view to pleasure and numerous offspring, and the wives prostitute themselves, unless chastity is enforced by compulsion.
</p><p>No one wears a garland when sacrificing, or burning incense, or pouring out a libation. They do not stab, but

strangle the victim, that nothing mutilated, but that which is

entire, may be offered to the Deity.
</p><p>A person convicted of bearing false testimony suffers a

mutilation of his extremities. He who has maimed another

not only undergoes in return the loss of the same limb,

but his hand also is cut off. If he has caused a workman to

lose his hand or his eye, he is put to death.
</p><p>Megasthenes says, that none of the Indians employ slaves.

But, according to Onesicritus, this is peculiar to the people in

the territory of Musicanus. He speaks of this as an excellent

rule, and mentions many others to be found in that country,

as the effects of a government by good laws.

<milestone n="55" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The care of the king's person is committed to women,

who are also purchased of their parents. The body-guard,

and the rest of the military, are stationed without the gates.

A woman, who puts to death a king when drunk, is rewarded

by becoming the wife of his successor. The sons succeed the

father. The king may not sleep during the day-time, and at

night he is obliged from time to time to change his bed, from

dread of treachery.
</p><p>The king leaves his palace in time of war; he leaves it also

when he goes to sit in his court as a judge. He remains

there all day thus occupied, not suffering himself to be interrupted even though the time arrives for attending to his per-



<pb n="107"/>



son. This attention to his person consists of friction with

pieces of wood, and he continues to listen to the cause, while

the friction is performed by four attendants who surround him.
</p><p>Another occasion of leaving his palace is to offer sacrifice.
</p><p>The third is a sort of Bacchanalian departure to the chace.

Crowds of women surround him, and on the outside (of these)

are spear-men. The road is set off with ropes; a man, or

even a woman, who passes within the ropes is put to death.
</p><p>The king is preceded by drums and gongs. He hunts in

the enclosures, and discharges his arrows from a high seat.

Near him stand two or three armed women. When hunting

in the open ground, he shoots his arrows from an elephant;

of the women some are in chariots, some on horses, and others

on elephants; they are provided with all kinds of weapons, as

if they were going on a military expedition.

<milestone n="56" unit="section"/></p>
<p>These customs when compared with ours are very

strange, but the following are still more extraordinary. According to Megasthenes, the nations who inhabit the Caucasus

have commerce with women in public; and eat the bodies

of their relatives; the monkeys climb precipices, and roll

down large stones upon their pursuers; most of the animals

which are tame in our country are wild in theirs; the horses

have a single horn, with heads like those of deer; reeds

which grow to the height of thirty orguiæ,<note anchored="yes">The orguia was equal to four cubits, or six feet one inch.</note> others which

grow on the ground, fifty orguiæ in length, and in thickness

some are three and others six cubits in diameter.

<milestone n="57" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He then deviates into fables, and says that there are

men of five, and even three spans in height, some of whom are

without nostrils, with only two breathing orifices above the

mouth. Those of three spans in height wage war with the

cranes (described by Homer) and with the partridges, which

are as large as geese; these people collect and destroy the

eggs of the cranes which lay their eggs there; and nowhere

else are the eggs or the young cranes to be found; frequently a crane escapes from this country with a brazen point

of a weapon in its body, wounded by these people.
</p><p>Similar to this is the account of the Enotocoitæ,<note anchored="yes">Men who slept on their ears. See b. i. c. ii. § 35.</note> of the

wild men, and of other monsters. The wild men could not be

brought to Sandrocottus, for they died by abstaining from



<pb n="108"/>



food. Their heels are in front, the instep and toes are

turned backwards. Some have been taken, which had no

mouths, and were tame. They live near the sources of the

Ganges, and are supported by the smell of dressed meat and

the fragrance of fruits and flowers, having instead of mouths

orifices through which they breathe. They are distressed by

strong-smelling substances, and therefore their lives are sustained with difficulty, particularly in a camp.
</p><p>With respect to the other singular animals, the philosophers

informed him of a people called Ocypodæ, so swift of foot

that they leave horses behind them; of Enotocoitæ, or persons having ears hanging down to their feet, so that they lie

and sleep upon them, and so strong as to be able to pluck up

trees and to break the sinew string of a bow; of others (Monommati) who have only one eye, and the ears of a dog, the

eye placed in the middle of the forehead, the hair standing

erect, and the breasts shaggy; of others (Amycteres) without

nostrils, devouring everything, eaters of raw meat, short-lived,

and dying before they arrive at old age; the upper part of

their mouths projects far beyond the lower lip.
</p><p>With respect to the Hyperboreans, who live to the age of

a thousand years, his description is the same as that of Simonides, Pindar, and other mythological writers.
</p><p>The story told by Timagenes of a shower of drops of brass,

which were raked together, is a fable. The account of Megasthenes is more probable, namely, that the rivers bring

down gold-dust, a part of which is paid as a tax to the king;

and this is the case in Iberia (of Armenia).

<milestone n="58" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Speaking of the philosophers, he says, that those who

inhabit the mountains are worshippers of Bacchus, and show

as a proof (of the god having come among them) the wild

vine, which grows in their country only; the ivy, the laurel,

the myrtle, the box-tree, and other evergreens, none of which

are found beyond the Euphrates, except a few in parks, which

are only preserved with great care. To wear robes and turbans, to use perfumes, and to be dressed in dyed and flowered garments, for their kings to be preceded when they

leave their palaces, and appear abroad, by gongs and drums,

are Bacchanalian customs. But the philosophers who live in

the plains worship Hercules.
</p><p>These are fabulous stories, contradicted by many writers,



<pb n="109"/>



particularly what is said of the vine and wine, for a great

part of Armenia, the whole of Mesopotamia and Media, as

far as Persia and Carmania, is beyond the Euphrates, the

greater part of which countries is said to have excellent vines,

and to produce good wine.

<milestone n="59" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Megasthenes divides the philosophers again into two

kinds, the Brachmanes<note anchored="yes">The Brahmins.</note> and the Garmanes.<note anchored="yes">Sarmanes, Clem. Alex. Strom. i. 305.</note> The Brachmanes are held in greater repute, for they agree more exactly

in their opinions. Even from the time of their conception in

the womb they are under the care and guardianship of learned

men, who go to the mother, and seem to perform some incantation for the happiness and welfare of the mother and the

unborn child, but in reality they suggest prudent advice, and

the mothers who listen to them most willingly are thought to be

the most fortunate in their offspring. After the birth of the

children, there is a succession of persons who have the care

of them, and as they advance in years, masters more able and

accomplished succeed.
</p><p>The philosophers live in a grove in front of the city within

a moderate-sized enclosure. Their diet is frugal, and they

lie upon straw pallets and on skins. They abstain from animal food, and from sexual intercourse with women; their

time is occupied in grave discourse, and they communicate

with those who are inclined to listen to them; but the hearer

is not permitted to speak or cough, or even to spit on the

ground; otherwise, he is expelled that very day from their

society, on the ground of having no control over himself. After

living thirty-seven years in this manner, each individual retires to his own possessions, and lives with less restraint,

wearing robes of fine linen, and rings of gold, but without profuseness, upon the hands and in the ears. They eat the flesh of

animals, of those particularly which do not assist man in his

labour, and abstain from hot and seasoned food. They have

as many wives as they please with a view to numerous offspring, for from many wives greater advantages are derived.
</p><p>As they have no slaves, they require more the services,

which are at hand, of their children.
</p><p>The Brachmanes do not communicate their philosophy to

their wives, for fear they should divulge to the profane, if



<pb n="110"/>



they became depraved, anything which ought to be concealed

or lest they should abandon their husbands in case they became good (philosophers) themselves. For no one who despises

alike pleasure and pain, life and death, is willing to be subject to the authority of another; and such is the character of a

virtuous man and a virtuous woman.
</p><p>They discourse much on death, for it is their opinion that

the present life is the state of one conceived in the womb, and

that death to philosophers is birth to a real and a happy life.

They therefore discipline themselves much to prepare for

death, and maintain that nothing which happens to man is

bad or good, for otherwise the same things would not be the

occasion of sorrow to some and of joy to others, opinions being

merely dreams, nor that the same persons could be affected

with sorrow and joy by the same things, on different occasions.
</p><p>With regard to opinions on physical phenomena, they display,

says Megasthenes, great simplicity, their actions being better

than their reasoning, for their belief is chiefly founded on fables.

On many subjects their sentiments are the same as those of the

Greeks. According to the Brachmanes, the world was created,

and is liable to corruption; it is of a spheroïdal figure; the god

who made and governs it pervades the whole of it; the principles of all things are different, but the principle of the

world's formation was water; in addition to the four elements

there is a fifth nature, of which the heavens and the stars are

composed; the earth is situated in the centre of the universe.

Many other peculiar things they say of the principle of generation and of the soul. They invent fables also, after the manner of Plato, on the immortality of the soul, and on the punishments in Hades, and other things of this kind. This is the

account which Megasthenes gives of the Brachmanes.

<milestone n="60" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Of the Garmanes, the most honourable, he says, are the

Hylobii, who live in the forests, and subsist on leaves and

wild fruits: they are clothed with garments made of the bark

of trees,<note anchored="yes">Meineke's conjecture, <foreign lang="greek">e)sqhtou\sfloiw=| dendo|ei/w|.</foreign></note> and abstain from commerce with women and from

wine. The kings hold communication with them by messengers, concerning the causes of things, and through them worship and supplicate the Divinity.



<pb n="111"/>


</p><p>Second in honour to the Hylobii, are the physicians, for

they apply philosophy to the study of the nature of man. They

are of frugal habits, but do not live in the fields, and subsist

upon rice and meal, which every one gives when asked,

and receive them hospitably. They are able to cause persons

to have a numerous offspring, and to have either male or female

children, by means of charms. They cure diseases by diet,

rather than by medicinal remedies. Among the latter, the most

in repute are unguents and cataplasms. All others they suppose partake greatly of a noxious nature.
</p><p>Both this and the other class of persons practise fortitude,

as well in supporting active toil as in enduring suffering, so

that they will continue a whole day in the same posture, without motion.
</p><p>There are enchanters and diviners, versed in the rites and

customs relative to the dead, who go about villages and towns

begging. There are others who are more civilized and better

informed than these, who inculcate the vulgar opinions concerning Hades, which, according to their ideas, tend to piety

and sanctity. Women study philosophy with some of them,

but abstain from sexual intercourse.

<milestone n="61" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus says, that he saw at Taxila two sophists

(wise men), both Brachmanes, the elder had his head shaved,

but the younger wore his hair; both were attended by disciples. When not otherwise engaged, they spent their time in

the market-place. They are honoured as public counsellors,

and have the liberty of taking away, without payment, whatever article they like which is exposed for sale; when any

one accosts them, he pours over them oil of jessamine, in such

profusion that it runs down from their eyes. Of honey and

sesamum, which is exposed for sale in large quantity, they

take enough to make cakes, and are fed without expense.
</p><p>They came up to Alexander's table and took their meal

standing, and they gave an example of their fortitude by retiring to a neighbouring spot, where the elder, falling on the

ground supine, endured the sun and the rain, which had now

set in, it being the commencement of spring. The other stood

on one leg, with a piece of wood three cubits in length raised

in both hands; when one leg was fatigued he changed the

support to the other, and thus continued the whole day. The

younger appeared to possess much more self-command; for,



<pb n="112"/>



after following the king a short distance, he soon returned to

his home. The king sent after him, but he bade the king to

come to him, if he wanted anything of him. The other accompanied the king to the last: during his stay he changed

his dress, and altered his mode of life, and when reproached

for his conduct, answered, that he had completed the forty

years of discipline which he had promised to observe: Alexander made presents to his children.

<milestone n="62" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus relates also some strange and unusual customs of the people of Taxila. Those, who through poverty

are unable to marry their daughters, expose them for sale in

the market-place, in the flower of their age, to the sound of shell

trumpets and drums, with which the war-note is given. A crowd

is thus assembled. First her back, as far as the shoulders, is

uncovered, then the parts in front, for the examination of any

man who comes for this purpose. If she pleases him, he marries her on such conditions as may be determined upon.
</p><p>The dead are thrown out to be devoured by vultures. To

have many wives is a custom common to these and to other

nations. He says, that he had heard, from some persons, of

wives burning themselves voluntarily with their deceased

husbands; and that those women who refused to submit to

this custom were disgraced. The same things have been told

by other writers.<note anchored="yes">According to Diodorus Siculus, xix. 33, an exception was made for women with child, or with a family; but otherwise, if she did not comply with this custom, she was compelled to remain a widow during the rest of her life, and to take no part in sacrifices or other rites, as being an impious person.</note>

<milestone n="63" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Onesicritus says, that he himself was sent to converse

with these wise men. For Alexander heard that they went

about naked, practised constancy and fortitude, and were held

in the highest honour; that, when invited, they did not go to

other persons, but commanded others to come to them, if they

wished to participate in their exercises or their conversation.

Such being their character, Alexander did not consider it to

be consistent with propriety to go to them, nor to compel them

to do anything contrary to their inclination or against the

custom of their country; he therefore despatched Onesicritus

to them.
</p><p>Onesicritus found, at the distance of 20 stadia from the

city, fifteen men standing in different postures, sitting or



<pb n="113"/>



lying down naked, who continued in these positions until the

evening, and then returned to the city. The most difficult

thing to endure was the heat of the sun, which was so powerful,

that no one else could endure without pain to walk on the

ground at mid-day with bare feet.

<milestone n="64" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He conversed with Calanus, one of these sophists, who

accompanied the king to Persia, and died after the custom of

his country, being placed on a pile of [burning] wood. When

Onesicritus came, he was lying upon stones. Onesicritus

approached, accosted him, and told him that he had been sent

by the king, who had heard the fame of his wisdom, and that

he was to give an account of his interview, if there were no

objection, he was ready to listen to his discourse. When Calanus saw his mantle, head-covering, and shoes, he laughed,

and said, <q direct="unspecified">Formerly, there was abundance everywhere of

corn and barley, as there is now of dust; fountains then

flowed with water, milk, honey, wine, and oil, but mankind

by repletion and luxury became proud and insolent. Jupiter,

indignant at this state of things, destroyed all, and appointed

for man a life of toil. On the reappearance of temperance and

other virtues, there was again an abundance of good things.

But at present the condition of mankind approaches satiety

and insolence, and there is danger lest the things which now

exist should disappear.</q>
</p><p>When he had finished, he proposed to Onesicritus, if he

wished to hear his discourse, to strip off his clothes, to lie down

naked by him on the same stones, and in that manner to

listen to him; while he was hesitating what to do, Mandanis,<note anchored="yes">By Arrian and Plutarch he is called Dandamis.</note>

who was the oldest and wisest of the sophists, reproached

Calanus for his insolence, although he censured such insolence

himself. Mandanis called Onesicritus to him, and said, I

commend the king, because, although he governs so large an

empire, he is yet desirous of acquiring wisdom, for he is the

only philosopher in arms that I ever saw; it would be of the

greatest advantage, if those were philosophers who have the

power of persuading the willing and of compelling the unwilling to learn temperance; but I am entitled to indulgence,

if, when conversing by means of three interpreters, who, except the language, know no more than the vulgar, I am not



<pb n="114"/>



able to demonstrate the utility of philosophy. To attempt it

is to expect water to flow pure through mud.

<milestone n="65" unit="section"/></p>
<p><q direct="unspecified">The tendency of his discourse,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">was this, that

the best philosophy was that which liberated the mind from

pleasure and grief; that grief differed from labour, in that

the former was inimical, the latter friendly to men; for that

men exercised their bodies with labour in order to strengthen

the mental powers, by which means they would be able to

put an end to dissensions, and give good counsel to all, to

the public and to individuals; that he certainly should at

present advise Taxiles to receive Alexander as a friend; for

if he entertained a person better than himself, he might be

improved; but if a worse person, he might dispose him to

good.</q>
</p><p>After this Mandanis inquired, whether such doctrines were

taught among the Greeks. Onesicritus answered, that Pythagoras taught a similar doctrine, and enjoined his disciples to

abstain from whatever has life; that Socrates and Diogenes,

whose discourses he had heard, held the same opinions.

Mandanis replied, <q direct="unspecified">that in other respects he thought them

wise, but that in one thing they were mistaken, namely, in

preferring custom to nature, for otherwise they would not be

ashamed of going naked, like himself, and of subsisting on

frugal fare; for the best house was that which required

least repairs.</q> He says also that they employ themselves

much on natural subjects, as prognostics, rain, drought, and

diseases. When they repair to the city, they disperse themselves in the market-places; if they meet any one carrying

figs or bunches of grapes, they take what is offered gratuitously; if it is oil, it is poured over them, and they are

anointed with it. Every wealthy house, even to the women's

apartment, is open to them; when they enter it, they engage in

conversation, and partake of the repast. Disease of the body

they regard as most disgraceful, and he who apprehends it,

after preparing a pyre, destroys himself by fire; he (previously) anoints himself, and sitting down upon it orders it to

be lighted, remaining motionless while he is burning.

<milestone n="66" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Nearchus gives the following account of the Sophists.

The Brachmanes engage in public affairs, and attend the kings

as counsellors; the rest are occupied in the study of nature.



<pb n="115"/>



Calanus belonged to the latter class. Women study philosophy

with them, and all lead an austere life.
</p><p>Of the customs of the other Indians, he says, that their laws,

whether relating to the community or to individuals, are not

committed to writing, and differ altogether from those of other

people. For example, it is the practice among some tribes,

to propose virgins as prizes to the conquerors in a trial of skill

in boxing; wherefore they marry without portions; among

other tribes the ground is cultivated by families and in common; when the produce is collected, each takes a load sufficient for his subsistence during the year; the remainder is

burnt, in order to have a reason for renewing their labour, and

not remaining inactive. Their weapons consist of a bow and

arrows, which are three cubits in length, or a javelin, and a

shield, and a sword three cubits long. Instead of bridles, they

use muzzles,<note anchored="yes">By <foreign lang="greek">fimoi=s,</foreign> probably here is meant a circular segment, or band of iron, furnished with slightly raised points in the inside; it passes over the bone of the nose, and is fastened below by a cord which is continued as a bridle. Such a contrivance is still in use for mules and asses in the East.</note> which differ little from a halter, and the lips are

<p>Nearchus, producing proofs of their skill in works of

art, says, that when they saw sponges in use among the Macedonians, they imitated them by sewing hairs, thin threads, and

strings in wool; after the wool was felted, they drew out the

hairs, threads, and strings, and dyed it with colours. There

quickly appeared also manufactures of brushes for the body,

and of vessels for oil (lecythi). They write, he says, letters

upon cloth, smoothed by being well beaten, although other

authors affirm that they have no knowledge of writing. They

use brass, which is cast, and not wrought; he does not give

the reason of this, although he mentions the strange effect,

namely, if that vessels of this description fall to the ground,

they break like those made of clay.

it is usual to address them, and all persons in authority and

high station, with a prayer.

<p>As an instance of the disagreement among historians,



<pb n="116"/>



we may adduce their (different) accounts of Calanus. They

all agree that he accompanied Alexander, and underwent a

voluntary death by fire in his presence, but they differ as to

the manner and cause of his death. Some give the following

account. Calanus accompanied the king, as the rehearser of

his praises, beyond the boundaries of India, contrary to the

common Indian custom; for the philosophers attend upon

their kings, and act as instructors in the worship of the gods,

in the same manner as the Magi attend the Persian kings.

When he fell sick at Pasargadæ, being then attacked with

disease for the first time in his life, he put himself to death at

the age of seventy-three years, regardless of the entreaties of

the king. A pyre was raised, and a golden couch placed upon it. He laid down upon it, and covering himself up, was

burnt to death.
</p><p>Others say, that a chamber was constructed of wood, which

was filled with the leaves of trees, and a pyre being raised

upon the roof, he was shut up in it, according to his directions,

after the procession, with which he had been accompanied, had

arrived at the spot. He threw himself upon the pyre, and was

consumed like a log of wood, together with the chamber.
</p><p>Megasthenes says, that self-destruction is not a dogma of

the philosophers, and that those who commit this act are accounted fool-hardy; that some, who are by nature harsh,

inflict wounds upon their ,bodies, or cast themselves down

precipices; those who are impatient of pain drown themselves; those who can endure pain strangle themselves; and

those of ardent tempers throw themselves into the fire. Of

this last description was Calanus, who had no control over

himself, and was a slave to the table of Alexander. Calanus

is censured, while Mandanis is applauded. When Alexander's

messengers invited the latter to come to the son of Jove, promising a reward if he would comply, and threatening punishment if he refused, he answered, <q direct="unspecified">Alexander was not the son

the length of the journey. The letter was written in Greek

that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he

highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; that he was willing to

allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he

pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just.

It appears to have comprehended the coast-line of the modern Laristan, Kirman, and Moghostan.

</p><p>The southern side begins from the mouths of the Indus,

and from Patalene, and terminates at Carmania and the

considerable distance to the south. It then makes a bend towards the gulf in the direction of Persia.
</p><p>The Arbies, who have the same name as the river Arbis,<note anchored="yes">The Purali.</note>

are the first inhabitants we meet with in this country. They

are separated by the Arbis from the next tribe, the Oritæ, and

according to Nearchus, occupy a tract of sea-coast of about

1000 stadia in length; this country also is a part of India.

Next are the Oritæ, a people governed by their own laws.

The voyage along the coast belonging to this people extends

<date value="1800">1800</date> stadia, that along the country of the Ichthyophagi, who

follow next, extends 7400 stadia; that along the country of

the Carmani as far as Persia, 3700 stadia. The whole number

of stadia is 13,900.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The greater part of the country inhabited by the

Ichthyophagi is on a level with the sea. No trees, except palms and a kind of thorn, and the tamarisk, grow

there. There is also a scarcity of water, and of food produced by cultivation. Both they and their cattle subsist

upon fish, and are supplied by rain water and wells. The



<pb n="121"/>



flesh of the animals has the smell of fish. Their dwellings

are built with the bones of large whales and shells, the ribs

furnishing beams and supports, and the jaw-bones, door-ways.

The vertebral bones serve as mortars in which fish, which

have been previously dried in the sun, are pounded. Of this,

with the addition of flour, cakes are made; for they have

grinding mills (for corn), although they have no iron. This

however is not so surprising, because it is possible for them

to import it from other parts. But how do they hollow out

the mills again, when worn away? with the same stones, they

say, with which their arrows and javelins, which are hardened

in the fire, are sharpened. Some fish are dressed in ovens,

but the greater part is eaten raw. The fish are taken in nets

made of the bark of the palm.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Above the Ichthyophagi is situated Gedrosia,<note anchored="yes">Mekran.</note> a country

less exposed to the heat of the sun than India, but more so than

the rest of Asia. As it is without fruits and water, except in

summer, it is not much better than the country of the Ichthyophagi. But it produces aromatics, particularly nard and myrrh,

in such quantity, that the army of Alexander used them on

the march for tent coverings and beds; they thus breathed an

air full of odours, and at the same time more salubrious.
</p><p>The summer was purposely chosen for leaving India, for

at that season it rains in Gedrosia, and the rivers and wells

are filled, but in winter they fail. The rain falls in the

higher parts to the north, and near the mountains: when

the rivers swell, the plains near the sea are watered, and the

wells are also filled. Alexander sent persons before him into

the desert country to dig wells and to prepare stations for

himself and his fleet.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Having separated his forces into three divisions, he set out

with one division through Gedrosia, keeping at the utmost from

the sea not more than 500 stadia, in order to secure the coast for

his fleet; but he frequently approached the sea-side, although

the beach was impracticable and rugged. The second division

he sent forward under the command of Craterus through the

interior, with a view of reducing Ariana, and of proceeding to the same places to which he himself was directing his

march. (The third division), the fleet he intrusted to Nearchus and Onesicritus, his master pilot, giving them orders to



<pb n="122"/>



take up convenient positions in following him, and to sail

along the coast parallel to his line of march.
</p><p>5 Nearchus says, that while Alexander was on his march,

he himself commenced his voyage, in the autumn, about the

achronical rising of the Pleiades,<note anchored="yes">By the achronical rising of the Pleiades is meant the rising of this constellation, or its first becoming visible, after sun-set.

favourable. The Barbarians however, taking courage at the

departure of the king, became daring, and attempted to throw

off their subjection, attacked them, and endeavoured to drive

them out of the country. But Craterus set out from the

Hydaspes, and proceeded through the country of the Arachoti

and of the Drangæ into Carmania.
</p><p>Alexander was greatly distressed throughout the whole

march, as his road lay through a barren country. The supplies of provisions which he obtained came from a distance,

and were scanty and unfrequent, so much so that the army

suffered greatly from hunger, the beasts of burden dropped

down, and the baggage was abandoned, both on the march

and in the camp. The army was saved by eating dates and

the marrow of the palm-tree.<note anchored="yes">The pith in the young head-shoot of the palm-tree.</note>
</p><p>Alexander however (says Nearchus), although acquainted

with the hardships of the enterprise, was ambitious of conducting this large army in safety, as a conqueror, through

the same country where, according to the prevailing report,

Semiramis escaped by flight from India with about twenty,

and Cyrus with about seven men.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Besides the want of provisions, the scorching heat was

distressing, as also the deep and burning sand. In some

places there were sand-hills, so that in addition to the difficulty of lifting the legs, as out of a pit, there were ascents

and descents. It was necessary also, on account of the watering places, to make long marches of two, four, and sometimes

even of six hundred stadia, for the most part during the night.

Frequently the encampment was at a distance of 30 stadia

from the watering places, in order that the soldiers might



<pb n="123"/>



not be induced by thirst to drink to excess. For many of

them plunged into the water in their armour, and continued

drinking until they were drowned; when swollen after death

they floated, and corrupted the shallow water of the cisterns.

Others, exhausted by thirst, lay exposed to the sun, in the middle of the road. They then became tremulous, their hands and

their feet shook, and they died like persons seized with cold

and shivering. Some turned out of the road to indulge in

sleep, overcome with drowsiness and fatigue; some were

left behind, and perished, being ignorant of the road, destitute

of everything, and overpowered by heat. Others escaped

after great sufferings. A torrent of water, which fell in the

night time, overwhelmed and destroyed many persons, and

much baggage; a great part even of the royal equipage was

swept away.
</p><p>The guides, through ignorance, deviated so far into the interior, that the sea was no longer in sight. The king, perceiving the danger, immediately set out in search of the coast;

when he had discovered it, and by sinking wells had found

water fit for drinking, he sent for the army: afterwards he

continued his march for seven days near the shore, with a

good supply of water. He then again returned into the interior.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There was a plant resembling the laurel, which if eaten

by the beasts of burden caused them to die of epilepsy, accompanied with foaming at the mouth. A thorn also, the fruit

of which, like gourds, strewed the ground, and was full of a

juice; if drops of it fell into the eyes of any kind of animal

it became completely blind. Many persons were suffocated

by eating unripe dates. Danger also was to be apprehended

from serpents; for on the sand-hills there grew a plant, underneath which they crept and hid themselves. The persons

wounded by them died.
</p><p>The Oritæ, it was said, smeared the points of their arrows,

which were of wood hardened in the fire, with deadly poisons.

When Ptolemy was wounded and in danger of his life a person appeared in a dream to Alexander, and showed him a

root with leaves and branches, which he told him to bruise

and place upon the wound. Alexander awoke from his dream,

and remembering the vision, searched and found the root

growing in abundance, of which both he and others made use;



<pb n="124"/>



when the Barbarians perceived that the antidote for the

poison was discovered, they surrendered to the king. It is

probable, however, that some one acquainted with the plant

informed the king of its virtues, and that the fabulous part of

the story was invented for the purpose of flattery.
</p><p>Having arrived at the palace<note anchored="yes">Called Pura by Arrian.</note> of the Gedrosii on the sixtieth day after leaving the Ori,<note anchored="yes">The Oritæ are no doubt here meant.</note> and allowed his army a short

period of rest, he set out for Carmania.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The position of the southern side of Ariana is thus situated, with reference to the sea-coast, the country of the

Gedrosii and the Oritæ lying near and above it. A great

part of Gedrosia extends into the interior until it touches

upon the Drangæ, Arachoti, and Paropamisadæ, of whom

Eratosthenes speaks in the following manner: we cannot give

a better description. <q direct="unspecified">Ariana,</q> he says, "is bounded on the

</p><p>The breadth of the country is the length of the Indus,

reckoned from the Paropamisus as far as the mouths of that

river, and amounts to 12,000, or according to others to 13,000,

stadia. The length, beginning from the Caspian Gates, as it

is laid down in Asiatic Stathmi,<note anchored="yes">See above, c. i. § 12.</note> is estimated in two different

ways. From the Caspian Gates to Alexandreia among the

Arii<note anchored="yes">Herat.</note> through Parthia is one and the same road. Then a

road leads in a straight line through Bactriana, and over the

pass of the mountain to Ortospana,<note anchored="yes">Candahar.</note> to the meeting of the three

roads from Bactra, which is among the Paropamisadæ. The

other branch turns off a little from Aria towards the south to

Prophthasia in Drangiana; then the remainder leads as far

as the confines of India and of the Indus; so that the road

through the Drangæ and the Arachoti is longer, the whole

amounting to 15,300 stadia. But if we deduct <date value="1300">1300</date> stadia,

we shall have the remainder as the length of the country in a

straight line, namely, 14,000 stadia; for the length of the coast

is not much less, although some persons increase this sum by

adding to the 10,000 stadia Carmania, which is reckoned at

6000 stadia. For they seem to reckon it either together with

the gulfs, or together with the Carmanian coast within the

Persian Gulf. The name also of Ariana is extended so as

to include some part of Persia, Media, and the north of

Bactria and Sogdiana; for these nations speak nearly the

same language.<note anchored="yes">See b. xi. c. viii. § 9.</note>

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The order in which these nations are disposed is as follows. Along the Indus are the Paropamisadæ, above whom

lies the mountain Paropamisus; then towards the south are

the Arachoti; then next to these towards the south, the

Gedroseni, together with other tribes who occupy the sea-coast; the Indus runs parallel along the breadth of these

tracts. The Indians occupy [in part]<note anchored="yes">The text is corrupt: <foreign lang="greek">e)k me/rous</foreign> is probably taken from some other part of the text and here inserted.</note> some of the countries

situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the

Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own. But Seleucus Nicator

gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants.
</p><p>The Arii are situated on the west, by the side of the Paropamisadæ, and the Drangæ<note anchored="yes">The same as Zarangæ; they probably dwelt on the lake Zarah, which undoubtedly retains its Zend name. <emph rend="ital">Wilson's</emph> Ariana.</note> by the Arachoti and Gedrosii.

The Arii are situated by the side of the Drangæ both on

the north and west, and nearly encompass them. Bactriana

adjoins Aria on the north, and the Paropamisadæ, through

whose territory Alexander passed when he crossed the Caucasus on his way to Bactra. Towards the west, next to

the Arii, are the Parthians, and the parts about the Caspian

Gates. Towards the south of Parthia is the desert of Carmania; then follows the remainder of Carmania and Gedrosia.

<p>We shall better understand the position of the places

about the above-mentioned mountainous tract, if we further

examine the route which Alexander took from the Parthian

territory to Bactriana, when he was in pursuit of Bessus.

He came first to Ariana, next to the Drangæ, where he put

to death Philotas, the son of Parmenio, having detected his

traitorous intentions. He despatched persons to Ecbatana<note anchored="yes">Corresponding nearly with the present Hamadan.</note> also

to put the father to death as an accomplice in the conspiracy.

It is said that these persons performed in eleven days, upon

dromedaries, a journey of 30 or 40 days, and executed their

business.

Arachoti, and the above-mentioned mountainous tract. Craterus traversed this country, subjugating those who refused to

submit, and hastened with the greatest expedition to form a

junction with the king. Nearly about the same time both

armies, consisting of infantry, entered Carmania together, and

at a short interval afterwards Nearchus sailed with his fleet

into the Persian Gulf, having undergone great danger and

distress from wandering in his course, and among other causes,

from great whales.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is probable that those who sailed in the expedition

greatly exaggerated many circumstances; yet their statements

prove the sufferings to which they were exposed, and that

their apprehensions were greater than the real danger. That

which alarmed them the most was the magnitude of the

whales, which occasioned great commotion in the sea from

their numbers; their blowing was attended with so great

a darkness, that the sailors could not see where they stood.

But when the pilots informed the sailors, who were terrified

at the sight and ignorant of the cause, that they were animals

which might easily be driven away by the sound of a trumpet,

and by loud noises, Nearchus impelled the vessels with violence in the direction of the impediment, and at the same

time frightened the animals with the sound of trumpets. The

whales dived, and again rose at the prow of the vessels, so as

to give the appearance of a naval combat; but they soon

made off.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Those who now sail to India speak of the size of these

animals and their mode of appearance, but as coming neither

in bodies nor frequently, yet as repulsed by shouts and by

the sound of trumpets. They affirm that they do not approach

the land, but that the bones of those which die, bared of flesh,

are readily thrown up by the waves, and supply the Ichthyophagi with the above-mentioned material for the construction

of their cabins. According to Nearchus, the size of these

animals is three and twenty orguiæ in length.<note anchored="yes">About 140 feet. Arrian says twenty-five orguiæ, or about 150 feet.</note>

</p><p>Nearchus says that he proved the confident belief of the

sailors in the existence of an island situated in the passage,

and destructive to those who anchored near it, to be false.
</p><p>A bark in its course, when it came opposite to this island,

was never afterwards seen, and some men who were sent in

search did not venture to disembark upon the island, but

shouted and called to the crew, when, receiving no answer,

they returned. But as all imputed this disappearance to the

island, Nearchus said that he himself sailed to it, went ashore,

disembarked with a part of his crew, and went round it.

But not discovering any trace of those of whom he was

in search, he abandoned the attempt, and informed his men

that no fault was to be imputed to the island (for otherwise

destruction would have come upon himself and those who

disembarked with him), but that some other cause (and innumerable others were possible) might have occasioned the loss

of the vessel.

<p>Carmania is the last portion of the sea-coast which begins

from the Indus. Its first promontory projects towards the

south into the Great Sea.<note anchored="yes">Groskurd proposes to supply after <q direct="unspecified">Sea</q> words which he thinks are here omitted; upon insufficient grounds, however, according to Kramer.</note> After it has formed the mouth of

the Persian Gulf towards the promontory, which is in sight,

of Arabia Felix, it bends towards the Persian Gulf, and is

continued till it touches Persia.
</p><p>Carmania is large, situated in the interior, and extending

itself between Gedrosia and Persia, but stretches more to the

north than Gedrosia. This is indicated by its fertility, for it

not only produces everything, but the trees are of a large

size, excepting however the olive; it is also watered by rivers.

Gedrosia also differs little from the country of the Ichthyophagi, so that frequently there is no produce from the

ground. They therefore keep the annual produce in store

for several years.
</p><p>Onesicritus says, that a river in Carmania brings down gold-dust; that there are mines of silver, copper, and minium; and

that there are two mountains, one of which contains arsenic,

the other salt.
</p><p>There belongs to it a desert tract, which is contiguous to

Parthia and Parætacene. The produce of the ground is like

that of Persia; and among other productions the vine. The



<pb n="129"/>



Carmanian vine, as we call it, often bears bunches of grapes

of two cubits in size; the seeds are very numerous and very

large; probably the plant grows in its native soil with great

luxuriance.
</p><p>Asses, on account of the scarcity of horses, are generally

made use of even in war. They sacrifice an ass to Mars, who

is the only deity worshipped by them, for they are a warlike

people. No one marries before he has cut off the head of an

enemy and presented it to the king, who deposits the scull in

the royal treasury. The tongue is minced and mixed with

flour, which the king, after tasting it, gives to the person who

brought it, to be eaten by himself and his family. That king

is the most highly respected, to whom the greatest number of

heads are presented.
</p><p>According to Nearchus, most of the customs and the language of the inhabitants of Carmania resemble those of the

Persians and Medes.
</p><p>The passage across the mouth of the Persian Gulf does not

occupy more than one day.

<p>NEXT to Carmania is Persis. A great part of it extends

along the coast of the Gulf, which has its name from the

country, but a much larger portion stretches into the interior,

and particularly in its length, reckoned from the south, and

Carmania to the north, and to the nations of Media.
</p><p>It is of a threefold character, as we regard its natural condition and the quality of the air. First, the coast, extending

for about 4400 or 4300 stadia, is burnt up with heat; it is

sandy, producing little except palm trees, and terminates at

the greatest river in those parts, the name of which is Oroatis.<note anchored="yes">The Arosis of Arrian, now the Tab.</note>

Secondly, the country above the coast produces everything,

and is a plain; it is excellently adapted for the rearing of cattle,

and abounds with rivers and lakes.
</p><p>The third portion lies towards the north, and is bleak and

mountainous. On its borders live the camel-breeders.

The breadth in the

and thence to the borders of Carmania <date value="1600">1600</date> stadia more.
</p><p>The tribes inhabiting this country are those called the Pateischoreis, the Achæmenidæ, and Magi; these last affect a sedate mode of life; the Curtii and Mardi are robbers, the rest

are husbandmen.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Susis also is almost a part of Persis. It lies between Persis and Babylonia, and has a very considerable city, Susa.

For the Persians and Cyrus, after the conquest of the Medes,

perceiving that their own country was situated towards the

extremities, but Susis more towards the interior, nearer also

to Babylon and the other nations, there placed the royal seat of

the empire. They were pleased with its situation on the confines of Persis, and with the importance of the city; besides the

consideration that it had never of itself undertaken any great

enterprise, had always been in subjection to other people, and

constituted a part of a greater body, except, perhaps, anciently

in the heroic times.
</p><p>It is said to have been founded by Tithonus, the father of

Memnon. Its compass was 120 stadia. Its shape was oblong. The Acropolis was called Memnonium. The Susians

have the name also of Cissii. Æschylus<note anchored="yes">Persæ, v. 17 and 118.</note> calls the mother of

Memnon, Cissia. Memnon is said to be buried near Paltus in

Syria, by the river Badas, as Simonides says in his Memnon,

a dithyrambic poem among the Deliaca. The wall of the city,

the temples and palaces, were constructed in the same manner

as those of the Babylonians, of baked brick and asphaltus, as

some writers relate. Polycletus however says, that its circumference was 200 stadia, and that it was without walls.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They embellished the palace at Susa more than the rest,

but they did not hold in less veneration and honour the



<pb n="131"/>



palaces at Persepolis and Pasargadæ.<note anchored="yes">Pasa or Fesa.</note> For in these stronger

and hereditary places were the treasure-house, the riches, and

tombs of the Persians. There was another palace at Gabæ,

in the upper parts of Persia, and another on the sea-coast,

near a place called Taoce.<note anchored="yes">Taug or Taüog, on the river Grâ.</note>
</p><p>This was the state of things during the empire of the Persians. But afterwards different princes occupied different

palaces; some, as was natural, less sumptuous, after the power

of Persis had been reduced first by the Macedonians, and

secondly still more by the Parthians. For although the

Persians have still a kingly government, and a king of their

own, yet their power is very much diminished, and they are

subject to the king of Parthia.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Susa is situated in the interior, upon the river Choaspes,

beyond the bridge; but the territory extends to the sea: and

the sea-coast of this territory, from the borders of the Persian

coast nearly as far as the mouths of the Tigris, is a distance

of about 3000 stadia.
</p><p>The Choaspes flows through Susis, terminating on the same

coast, and has its source in the territory of the Uxii.<note anchored="yes">The Uxii occupied the district of Asciac.</note> For

a rugged and precipitous range of mountains lies between the

Susians and Persis, with narrow defiles, difficult to pass; they

were inhabited by robbers, who constantly exacted payment

even from the kings themselves, at their entrance into Persis

from Susis.
</p><p>Polycletus says, that the Choaspes, and the Eulæus,<note anchored="yes">There seems little doubt that the Karun represents the ancient Eulæus (on which some authors state Susa to have been situated), and the Kerkhah the old Choaspes. See <emph rend="ital">Smith,</emph> art. Choaspes.</note> and the

Tigris also enter a lake, and thence discharge themselves into

the sea; that on the side of the lake is a mart, as the rivers

do not receive the merchandise from the sea, nor convey it

down to the sea, on account of dams in the river, purposely

constructed, and that the goods are transported by land a distance of

800 stadia<note anchored="yes">Groskurd adds 1000 stadia to this amount.</note> to Susa; according to others, the rivers

which flow through Susis discharge themselves by the intermediate

canals of the Euphrates into the single stream of the

Tigris, which on this account has at its mouth the name of

Pasitigris.



<pb n="132"/>



<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>According to Nearchus, the sea-coast of Susis is swampy,

and terminates at the river Euphrates; at its mouth is a village,

which receives the merchandise from Arabia; for the coast

of Arabia approaches close to the mouths of the Euphrates

and the Pasitigris; the whole intermediate space is occupied

by a lake which receives the Tigris; on sailing up the Pasitigris 150 stadia is the bridge of rafts leading to Susa from Persis, and is distant from Susa 60 (600?) stadia; the Pasitigris

is distant from the Oroatis about 2000 stadia; the ascent

through the lake to the mouth of the Tigris is 600 (6000?)

stadia;<note anchored="yes">Quin. Curtius, v. 10. Diod. Sic. xvii. 67.</note> near the mouth stands the Susian village (Aginis),

distant from Susa 500 stadia; the journey by water from the

mouth of the Euphrates, up to Babylon, through a well-inhabited tract

of country, is a distance of more than 3000 stadia.
</p><p>Onesicritus says that all the rivers discharge themselves

into the lake, both the Euphrates and the Tigris; and that

the Euphrates, again issuing from the lake, discharges itself

into the sea by a separate mouth.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are many other narrow defiles in passing out

through the territory of the Uxii, and entering Persis. These

Alexander forced in his march through the country at the

Persian Gates, and at other places, when he was hastening to

see the principal parts of Persis, and the treasure-holds, in

which wealth had been accumulated during the long period

that Asia was tributary to Persis.
</p><p>He crossed many rivers, which flow through the country

and discharge themselves into the Persian Gulf.
</p><p>Next to the Choaspes are the Copratas<note anchored="yes">Ab-Zal.</note> and the Pasitigris,

which has its source in the country of the Uxii. There is

also the river Cyrus, which flows through Cœle Persis,<note anchored="yes">Hollow Persis.</note> as

it is called, near Pasargadæ. The king changed his name,

which was formerly Agradatus, to that of this river. Alexander

crossed the Araxes<note anchored="yes">Bendamir.</note> close to Persepolis. Persepolis

was distinguished for the magnificence of the treasures which

it contained. The Araxes flows out of the Parætacene,<note anchored="yes">The capital of Parætacene is Ispahan.</note> and

receives the Medus,<note anchored="yes">Probably the Ab-Kuren.</note> which has its source in Media. These

rivers run through a very fruitful valley, which, like Perse-



<pb n="133"/>



polis, lies close to Carmania and to the eastern parts of the

country. Alexander burnt the palace at Persepolis, to

avenge the Greeks, whose temples and cities the Persians had

destroyed by fire and sword.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>He next came to Pasargadæ,<note anchored="yes">Pasa or Fesa.</note> which also was an ancient

royal residence. Here he saw in a park the tomb of Cyrus.

It was a small tower, concealed within a thick plantation of

trees, solid below, but above consisting of one story and a

shrine which had a very narrow opening; Aristobulus says, he

entered through this opening, by order of Alexander, and

decorated the tomb. He saw there a golden couch, a table

with cups, a golden coffin, and a large quantity of garments

and dresses ornamented with precious stones. These objects

he saw at his first visit, but on a subsequent visit the place

had been robbed, and everything had been removed except

the couch and the coffin which were only broken. The dead

body had been removed from its place; whence it was evident

that it was the act not of the Satrap,<note anchored="yes">Orxines, Quint. Cur. x. c. 1.</note> but of robbers, who

had left behind what they could not easily carry off. And

this occurred although there was a guard of Magi stationed

about the place, who received for their daily subsistence a

sheep, and every month a horse.<note anchored="yes">For sacrifice to Cyrus. Arrian, vi. c. 29.</note> The remote distance to

which the army of Alexander had advanced, to Bactra and

India, gave occasion to the introduction of many disorderly

acts, and to this among others.
</p><p>Such is the account of Aristobulus, who records the following

inscription on the tomb. "O MAN, I AM CYRUS,<note anchored="yes">Arrian adds, <q direct="unspecified">Son of Cambyses.</q></note> I ESTABLISHED THE

PERSIAN EMPIRE AND WAS KING OF ASIA. GRUDGE ME NOT THEREFORE THIS MONUMENT.
</p><p>Onesicritus however says that the tower had ten stories,

that Cyrus lay in the uppermost, and that there was an inscription in Greek, cut in Persian letters, <q direct="unspecified">I CYRUS, KING OF

KINGS, LIE HERE.</q> And another inscription to the same effect

in the Persian language.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Onesicritus mentions also this inscription on the tomb of

Darius: "I WAS A FRIEND TO MY FRIENDS, I WAS THE FIRST

OF HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS, I EXCELLED AS HUNTER, I COULD

DO EVERYTHING.



<pb n="134"/>


</p><p>Aristus of Salamis, a writer of a much later age than these,

says, that the tower consisted of two stories, and was large;

that it was built at the time the Persians succeeded to the

kingdom (of the Medes); that the tomb was preserved;

that the above-mentioned inscription was in the Greek, and

that there was another to the same purport in the Persian

language.
</p><p>Cyrus held in honour Pasargadæ, because he there conquered, in his last battle, Astyages the Mede, and transferred

to himself the empire of Asia; he raised it to the rank of a city,

and built a palace in memory of his victory.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Alexander transferred everything that was precious in

Persis to Susa, which was itself full of treasures and costly

materials; he did not, however, consider this place, but Babylon, as

the royal residence, and intended to embellish it.

There too his treasure was deposited.
</p><p>They say that, besides the treasures in Babylon and in the

camp of Alexander, which were not included in the sum, the

treasure found at Susa and in Persis was reckoned to amount

to 40,000, and according to some writers to 50,000, talents.

But others say, that the whole treasure, collected from all

quarters, and transported to Ecbatana, amounted to 180,000

talents, and that the 8,000 talents which Darius carried

away with him in his flight from Media became the booty of

those who put him to death.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Alexander preferred Babylon, because he saw that it

far surpassed the other cities in magnitude, and had other

advantages. Although Susis is fertile, it has a glowing and

scorching atmosphere, particularly near the city, as he

(Aristobulus?) says. Lizards and serpents at mid-day in the summer,

when the sun is at its greatest height, cannot cross the

streets of the city quick enough to prevent their being burnt

to death mid-way by the heat. This happens nowhere in

Persis, although it lies more towards the south.
</p><p>Cold water for baths is suddenly heated by exposure to the

sun. Barley spread out in the sun is roasted<note anchored="yes">Groskurd reads, <foreign lang="greek">a(/llesqai,</foreign> hops or jumps up.</note> like barley prepared

in ovens. For this reason earth is laid to the depth of

two cubits upon the roofs of the houses. They are obliged to

construct their houses narrow, on account of the weight placed

upon them, and from want of long beams, but, as large dwell-



<pb n="135"/>



ings are required to obviate the suffocating heat the houses

are long.
</p><p>The beam made of the palm tree has a peculiar property,

for although it retains its solidity, it does not as it grows old

give way downwards, but curves upwards with the weight, and

is a better support to the roof.
</p><p>The cause of the scorching heat is said to be high, overhanging

mountains on the north, which intercept the northern

winds. These, blowing from the tops of the mountains at a

great height, fly over without touching the plains, to the

more southern parts of Susis. There the air is still, particularly

when the Etesian winds cool the other parts of the

country which are burnt up by heat.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Susis is so fertile in grain, that barley and wheat produce,

generally, one hundred, and sometimes two hundred

fold. Hence the furrows are not ploughed close together, for

the roots when crowded impede the sprouting of the plant.
</p><p>The vine did not grow there before the Macedonians planted it,

both there and at Babylon. They do not dig trenches,

but thrust down into the ground iron-headed stakes, which

when drawn out are immediately replaced by the plants.
</p><p>Such is the character of the inland parts. The sea-coast is

marshy and without harbours; hence Nearchus says, that he

met with no native guides, when coasting with his fleet from

India to Babylonia, for nowhere could his vessels put in, nor

was he able to procure persons who could direct him by their

knowledge and experience.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The part of Babylonia formerly called Sitacene, and

afterwards Apolloniatis,<note anchored="yes">Founded probably by the Macedonians.</note> is situated near Susis.
</p><p>Above both, on the north and towards the east, are the Elymæi<note anchored="yes">The Elymæi reached to the Persian Gulf. Ptolem. vi. 1. They appear to have left vestiges of their name in that of a gulf, and a port called Delem.</note>

and the Parætaceni, predatory people relying for security

on their situation in a rugged and mountainous country. The

Parætaceni lie more immediately above the Apolloniatæ, and

therefore annoy them the more. The Elymæi are at war with

this people and with the Susians, and the Uxii with the Elymæi, but

not so constantly at present as might be expected,

on account of the power of the Parthians, to whom all the in-



<pb n="136"/>



habitants of those regions are under subjection. When therefore the

Parthians are quiet, all are tranquil, and their subject

nations. But when, as frequently happens, there is an insurrection,

which has occurred even in our own times, the event

is not the same to all, but different to different people. For

the disturbance has benefited some, but disappointed the expectation

of others.
</p><p>Such is the nature of the countries of Persis and Susiana.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The manners and customs of the Persians are the same

as those of the Susians and the Medes, and many other people; and

they have been described by several writers, yet I

must mention what is suitable to my purpose.
</p><p>The Persians do not erect statues nor altars, but, considering the heaven as Jupiter, sacrifice on a high place.<note anchored="yes">The account of the Persians is taken from Herodotus, i. 131, &amp;c.</note> They

worship the sun also, whom they call Mithras, the moon, Venus,

fire, earth, winds, and water. They sacrifice, having offered

up prayers, in a place free from impurities, and present the

victim crowned.<note anchored="yes">According to Herodotus, the priest who sacrificed was crowded.</note>
</p><p>After the Magus, who directs the sacrifice, has divided the

flesh, each goes away with his share, without setting apart

any portion to the gods; for the god, they say, requires the soul

of the victim, and nothing more. Nevertheless, according to

some writers, they lay a small piece of the caul upon the fire.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But it is to fire and water especially that they offer

sacrifice. They throw upon the fire dry wood without the

bark, and place fat over it; they then pour oil upon it, and

light it below; they do not blow the flame with their breath,

but fan it; those who have blown the flame with their breath,

or thrown any dead thing or dirt upon the fire, are put to

death.
</p><p>They sacrifice to water by going to a lake, river, or fountain; having dug a pit, they slaughter the victim over it,

taking care that none of the pure water near be sprinkled

with blood, and thus be polluted. They then lay the flesh in

order upon myrtle or laurel branches; the Magi touch it with

slender twigs,<note anchored="yes">Roused the sacred fire, as the law bids, Touching the god with consecrated wand. <emph rend="ital">Athenœus</emph> xii. 40, p. 850. Bohn's Classical Library.</note> and make incantations, pouring oil mixed with



<pb n="137"/>



milk and honey, not into the fire, nor into the water, but upon the earth. They continue their incantations for a long

time, holding in the hands a bundle of slender myrtle rods.
</p><p>15 In Cappadocia (for in this country there is a great body

of Magi, called Pyræthi,<note anchored="yes">i. e. <q direct="unspecified">who kindle fire.</q></note> and there are many temples dedicated to the Persian deities) the sacrifice is not performed with

a knife, but the victim is beaten to death with a log of wood,

as with a mallet.
</p><p>The Persians have also certain large shrines, called

Pyrætheia.<note anchored="yes">i. e. places where fire s kindled.</note> In the middle of these is an altar, on which is a

great

quantity of ashes, where the Magi maintain an unextinguished fire. They enter daily, and continue their incantation

for nearly an hour, holding before the fire a bundle of rods,

and wear round their heads high turbans of felt, reaching down

on each side so as to cover the lips and the sides of the cheeks.

The same customs are observed in the temples of Anaitis and

of Omanus. Belonging to these temples are shrines, and a

wooden statue of Omanus is carried in procession. These we

have seen ourselves.<note anchored="yes">B. xi. c. viii. § 4.</note> Other usages, and such as follow, are

related by historians.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Persians never pollute a river with urine, nor wash

nor bathe in it; they never throw a dead body, nor anything

unclean, into it. To whatever god they intend to sacrifice,

they first address a prayer to fire.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>They are governed by hereditary kings. Disobedience

is punished by the head and arms being cut off, and the body

cast forth. They marry many women, and maintain at the

same time a great number of concubines, with a view to a

numerous offspring.
</p><p>The kings propose annual prizes for a numerous family of

children. Children are not brought into the presence of their

parents until they are four years old.
</p><p>Marriages are celebrated at the beginning of the vernal

equinox. The bridegroom passes into the bride-chamber, having previously eaten some fruit, or camel's marrow, but nothing

else during the day.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>From the age of five to twenty-four years they are

taught to use the bow, to throw the javelin, to ride, and to

sometimes with sometimes without, music, the actions of the

gods and of illustrious men.
</p><p>The youths are called to rise before day-break, at the sound

of brazen instruments, and assemble in one spot, as if for arming

themselves or for the chase. They are arranged in companies

of fifty, to each of which one of the king's or a satrap's son

is appointed as leader, who runs, followed at command by the

others, an appointed distance of thirty or forty stadia.
</p><p>They require them to give an account of each lesson, when

they practise loud speaking, and exercise the breath and lungs.

They are taught to endure heat, cold, and rains; to cross torrents, and keep their armour and clothes dry; to pasture

animals, to watch all night in the open air, and to eat wild

</p><p>The dress of the chiefs consists of triple drawers, a double

tunic with sleeves reaching to the knees; the under garment

is white, the upper of a variegated colour. The cloak for

summer is of a purple or violet colour, but for winter of a

variegated colour. The turbans are similar to those of the

Magi; and a deep double shoe. The generality of people

wear a double tunic reaching to the half of the leg. A piece

of fine linen is wrapped round the head. Each person has a

bow and a sling.
</p><p>The entertainments of the Persians are expensive. They

set upon their table entire animals in great number, and of

various kinds. Their couches, drinking-cups, and other articles

are so brilliantly ornamented that they gleam with gold and

silver.

<p>Their consultations on the most important affairs are

carried on while they are drinking, and they consider the resolutions made at that time more to be depended upon than

those made when sober.

rank with themselves, on the road, they approach and kiss

them, but to persons of an inferior station they offer the

cheek, and in that manner receive the kiss. But to persons

of still lower condition they only bend the body.
</p><p>Their mode of burial is to smear the bodies over with wax,

and then to inter them. The Magi are not buried, but the

birds are allowed to devour them. These persons, according

to the usage of the country, espouse even their mothers.

Homer was not acquainted with the empire of the Syrians

nor of the Medes, for otherwise as he mentions the wealth of

Egyptian Thebes and of Phœnicia, he would not have passed

over in silence the wealth of Babylon, of Ninus, and of

Ecbatana.

<p>ASSYRIA is contiguous to Persia and Susiana. This

Medes were overthrown by the Persians, and the Syrians by

the Medes, they mean no other Syrians than those who built

the royal palaces at Babylon and Nineveh; and Ninus, who

built Nineveh in Aturia, was one of these Syrians. His wife,

who succeeded her husband, and founded Babylon, was Semiramis. These sovereigns were masters of Asia. Many other

works of Semiramis, besides those at Babylon, are extant in

almost every part of this continent, as, for example, artificial

mounds, which are called mounds of Semiramis, and walls<note anchored="yes">Probably walls built for the protection of certain districts.

<p>The city Nineveh was destroyed immediately upon the

situated in the plain of Aturia. Aturia borders upon

Arbela and the parts about it<note anchored="yes">Called also Zabus, Zabatus, and Zerbes, new the Great Zab.</note> belong to Babylonia. In the

<pb n="144"/>


</p><p>In Aturia is situated Gaugamela, a village where Darius

was defeated and lost his kingdom. This place is remarkable

for its name, which, when interpreted, signifies the Camel's

House. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, gave it this name, and

assigned (the revenues of) the place for the maintenance of a

camel, which had undergone the greatest possible labour and

fatigue in the journey through the deserts of Scythia, when

carrying baggage and provision for the king. The Macedonians,

observing that this was a mean village, but Arbela a

considerable settlement (founded, as it is said, by Arbelus,

son of Athmoneus), reported that the battle was fought and

the victory obtained near Arbela, which account was transmitted to historians.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Arbela and the mountain Nicatorium<note anchored="yes">Probably a branch of the Karadgeh-dagh.</note> (a name

which Alexander, after the victory at Arbela, superadded), is

the river Caprus,<note anchored="yes">The Little Zab, or Or.</note> situated at the same distance from Arbela

as the Lycus. The country is called Artacene.<note anchored="yes">As the name Artacene occurs nowhere else, Groskurd, following Cellarius (v. Geogr. Ant. i. 771), suspects that here we ought to read Arbelene, and would understand by it the same district which is called Arbelitis by Ptolemy, vi. 1, and by Pliny, H. N. vi. 13, § 16, but as this form of the national name is nowhere to be found, it would appear improper to introduce it into the text. It is more probable, continues Kramer, that Strabo wrote Adiabene, of which Arbelitis was a part, according to Pliny, loco citato.</note> Near Arbela

is the city Demetrias; next is the spring of naphtha, the fires,

the temple of the goddess Anæa,<note anchored="yes">The same, no doubt, as the goddess Anaitis. B. xi. c. viii. § 4, and b. xv. c. iii. §15.</note> Sadracæ, the palace of

Darius, son of Hystaspes, the Cyparisson, or plantation of

Cypresses, and the passage across the Caprus, which is close

to Seleucia and Babylon.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Babylon itself also is situated in a plain. The wall is

385<note anchored="yes">All manuscripts agree in giving this number, but critics agree also in its being an error for 365. The number of stadia in the wall, according to ancient authors, corresponded with the number of days in the year.</note> stadia in circumference, and 32 feet in thickness. The

height of the space between the towers is 50, and of the towers

60 cubits. The roadway upon the walls will allow chariots

with four horses when they meet to pass each other with ease.

Whence, among the seven wonders of the world, are reckoned

this wall and the hanging garden: the shape of the garden



<pb n="145"/>



is a square, and each side of it measures four plethra. It

consists of vaulted terraces, raised one above another, and

resting upon cube-shaped pillars. These are hollow and

filled with earth to allow trees of the largest size to be planted.

The pillars, the vaults, and the terraces are constructed

of baked brick and asphalt.
</p><p>The ascent to the highest story is by stairs, and at their

side are water engines, by means of which persons, appointed

expressly for the purpose, are continually employed in raising

water from the Euphrates into the garden. For the river,

which is a stadium in breadth, flows through the middle of

the city, and the garden is on the side of the river. The

tomb also of Belus is there. At present it is in ruins, having

been demolished, as it is said, by Xerxes. It was a quadrangular pyramid of baked brick, a stadium in height, and each of

the sides a stadium in length. Alexander intended to repair

it. It was a great undertaking, and required a long time for

its completion (for ten thousand men were occupied two

months in clearing away the mound of earth), so that he was

not able to execute what he had attempted, before disease

hurried him rapidly to his end. None of the persons who

succeeded him attended to this undertaking; other works also

were neglected, and the city was dilapidated, partly by the

Persians, partly by time, and, through the indifference of the

Macedonians to things of this kind, particularly after Seleucus

Nicator had fortified Seleucia on the Tigris near Babylon, at

the distance of about 300 stadia.
</p><p>Both this prince and all his successors directed their care to

that city, and transferred to it the seat of empire. At present

it is larger than Babylon; the other is in great part deserted,

so that no one would hesitate to apply to it what one of the

comic writers said of Megalopolitæ in Arcadia,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">The great city is a great desert.</q></quote>

On account of the scarcity of timber, the beams and pillars

of the houses were made of palm wood. They wind ropes of

twisted reed round the pillars, paint them over with colours,

and draw designs upon them; they cover the doors with a

coat of asphaltus. These are lofty, and all the houses are

vaulted on account of the want of timber. For the country

is bare, a great part of it is covered with shrubs, and produces



<pb n="146"/>



nothing but the palm. This tree grows in the greatest abundance in Babylonia. It is found in Susiana also in great quantity, on the Persian coast, and in Carmania.
</p><p>They do not use tiles for their houses, because there are

no great rains. The case is the same in Susiana and in

Sitacene.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In Babylon a residence was set apart for the native

philosophers called Chaldæans, who are chiefly devoted to the

study of astronomy. Some, who are not approved of by the

rest, profess to understand genethlialogy, or the casting of

nativities. There is also a tribe of Chaldæans, who inhabit a

district of Babylonia, in the neighbourhood of the Arabians,

and of the sea called the Persian Sea.<note anchored="yes">That is, at a short distance from the Persian Gulf, a little more to the south than the modern town Basra.</note> There are several

classes of the Chaldæan astronomers. Some have the name

of Orcheni, some Borsippeni, and many others, as if divided

into sects, who disseminate different tenets on the same subjects. The mathematicians make mention of some individuals

among them, as Cidenas, Naburianus, and Sudinus. Seleucus

also of Seleuceia is a Chaldæan, and many other remarkable

men.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Borsippa is a city sacred to Diana and Apollo. Here is

a large linen manufactory. Bats of much larger size than

those in other parts abound in it. They are caught and salted for food.

<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The country of the Babylonians is surrounded on the

east by the Susans, Elymæi, and Parætaceni; on the south by

the Persian Gulf, and the Chaldæans as far as the Arabian

Meseni; on the west by the Arabian Scenitæ as far as Adiabene and Gordyæa; on the north by the Armenians and

Medes as far as the Zagrus, and the nations about that river.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The country is intersected by many rivers, the largest

of which are the Euphrates and the Tigris: next to the

Indian rivers, the rivers in the southern parts of Asia are

said to hold the second place. The Tigris is navigable upwards from

its mouth to Opis,<note anchored="yes">Some extensive ruins near the angle formed by the Adhem (the ancient Physcus) and the Tigris, and the remains of the Nahr-awan canal, are said to mark the site of Opis.</note> and to the present Seleuceia.

Opis is a village and a mart for the surrounding places. The



<pb n="147"/>



Euphrates also is navigable up to Babylon, a distance of more

than 3000 stadia. The Persians, through fear of incursions

from without, and for the purpose of preventing vessels from

ascending these rivers, constructed artificial cataracts. Alexander, on arriving there, destroyed as many of them as he

could, those particularly [on the Tigris from the sea] to Opis.

But he bestowed great care upon the canals; for the Euphrates, at the commencement of summer, overflows; It begins

to fill in the spring, when the snow in Armenia melts: the

ploughed land, therefore, would be covered with water and

be submerged, unless the overflow of the superabundant water

were diverted by trenches and canals, as in Egypt the water

of the Nile is diverted. Hence the origin of canals. Great

labour is requisite for their maintenance, for the soil is deep,

soft, and yielding, so that it would easily be swept away by

the stream; the fields would be laid bare, the canals filled,

and the accumulation of mud would soon obstruct their mouths.

Then, again, the excess of water discharging itself into the

plains near the sea forms lakes, and marshes, and reed-grounds,

supplying the reeds with which all kinds of platted vessels

are woven; some of these vessels are capable of holding water,

when covered over with asphaltus; others are used with the

material in its natural state. Sails are also made of reeds;

these resemble mats or hurdles.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>It is not, perhaps, possible to prevent inundations of

this kind altogether, but it is the duty of good princes to afford all possible assistance. The assistance required is to

prevent excessive overflow by the construction of dams, and

to obviate the filling of rivers, produced by the accumulation

of mud, by cleansing the canals, and removing stoppages at

their mouths. The cleansing of the canals is easily performed,

but the construction of dams requires the labour of numerous

workmen. For the earth being soft and yielding, does not

support the superincumbent mass, which sinks, and is itself

carried away, and thus a difficulty arises in making dams at

the mouth. Expedition is necessary in closing the canals to

prevent all the water flowing out. When the canals dry up

in the summer time, they cause the river to dry up also;

and if the river is low (before the canals are closed), it cannot supply the canals in time with water, of which the country, burnt up and scorched, requires a very large quan-



<pb n="148"/>



tity; for there is no difference, whether the crops are flooded

by an excess or perish by drought and a failure of water.

The navigation up the rivers (a source of many advantages)

is continually obstructed by both the above-mentioned causes,

and it is not possible to remedy this unless the mouths of the

canals were quickly opened and quickly closed, and the canals

were made to contain and preserve a mean between excess

and deficiency of water.

<milestone n="11" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Aristobulus relates that Alexander himself, when he

was sailing up the river, and directing the course of the boat,

inspected the canals, and ordered them to be cleared by his

multitude of followers; he likewise stopped up some of the

mouths, and opened others. He observed that one of these

canals, which took a direction more immediately to the marshes,

and to the lakes in front of Arabia, had a mouth very difficult

to be dealt with, and which could not be easily closed on account of the soft and yielding nature of the soil; he (therefore) opened a new mouth at the distance of 30 stadia, selecting a place with a rocky bottom, and to this the current was

diverted. But in doing this he was taking precautions that

Arabia should not become entirely inaccessible in consequence

of the lakes and marshes, as it was already almost an island

from the quantity of water (which surrounded it). For he

contemplated making himself master of this country; and he

had already provided a fleet and places of rendezvous; and

had built vessels in Phœnicia and at Cyprus, some of which

were in separate pieces, others were in parts, fastened together

by bolts. These, after being conveyed to Thapsacus in seven

distances of a day's march, were then to be transported down

the river to Babylon. He constructed other boats in Babylonia, from cypress trees in the groves and parks, for there is

a scarcity of timber in Babylonia. Among the Cossæi, and

some other tribes, the supply of timber is not great,
</p><p>The pretext for the war, says Aristobulus, was that the

Arabians were the only people who did not send their ambassadors to

Alexander; but the true reason was his ambition to be lord of all.
</p><p>When he was informed that they worshipped two deities

only, Jupiter and Bacchus, who supply what is most requisite

for the subsistence of mankind, he supposed that, after his

conquests, they would worship him as a third, if he permitted



<pb n="149"/>



them to enjoy their former national independence. Thus was

Alexander employed in clearing the canals, and in examining

minutely the sepulchres of the kings, most of which are situated among the lakes.

<milestone n="12" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Eratosthenes, when he is speaking of the lakes near

Arabia, says, that the water, when it cannot find an outlet,

opens passages underground, and is conveyed through these

as far as the Cœle-Syrians,<note anchored="yes">The name Cœle-Syria, or Hollow Syria, which was properly applied to the district between Libanus and Antilibanus, was extended also to that part of Syria which borders upon Egypt and Arabia; and it is in this latter sense that Strabo here speaks of Cœle-Syria. So also Diodorus Siculus, i. § 30, speaks of <q direct="unspecified">Joppa in Cœle-Syria;</q> and Polybius, v. 80, § 2, of <q direct="unspecified">Rhinocolura, the first of the cities in Cœle-Syria;</q> and Josephus, Ant.

into the parts near Rhinocolura<note anchored="yes">El-Arish.</note> and Mount Casius,<note anchored="yes">El-Kas near Sebakit-Bardoil, the ancient lake Serbonis.</note> and

there forms lakes and deep pits.<note anchored="yes">Barathra.</note> But I know not whether

this is probable. For the overflowings of the water of the

Euphrates, which form the lakes and marshes near Arabia,

are near the Persian Sea. But the isthmus which separates

them is neither large nor rocky, so that it was more probable

that the water forced its way in this direction into the sea,

either under the ground, or across the surface, than that it

traversed so dry and parched a soil for more than 6000

stadia; particularly, when we observe, situated mid-way in

this course, Libanus, Antilibanus, and Mount Casius.<note anchored="yes">Strabo has misunderstood the meaning of Eratosthenes, who had said that the excess of the waters of the Euphrates sunk into the ground and reappeared under the form of torrents, which became visible near <q direct="unspecified">Rhinocolura in Cœle-Syria and Mt. Casius,</q> the Casius near Egypt. Our author properly observes that the length and nature of the course contradicts this hypothesis: but, misled by the names Cœle-Syria and Casius, he forgets that the Casius of Egypt and the district bordering upon Egypt, improperly called Cœle-Syria, are here in question; he transfers the first name to Cœle-Syria of Libanus, and the second to Mt. Casius near Seleucia and Antioch, and adds that, according to the notion of Eratosthenes, the waters of the Euphrates would have to traverse Libanus, Antilibanus, and the Casius (of Syria), whilst Eratosthenes has not, and could not, say any such thing. The hypothesis of Eratosthenes could not, indeed, be maintained, but Strabo renders it absurd. The error of our author is the more remarkable, as the name of the city Rhinocolura ought necessarily to have suggested to him the sense in which the words Casius and Cœle Syria should be understood.</note>



<pb n="150"/>


</p><p>Such, then, are the accounts of Eratosthenes and Aristobulus.

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>But Polycleitus says, that the Euphrates does not overflow its banks, because its course is through large plains; that

of the mountains (from which it is supplied), some are distant

2000, and the Cossæan mountains scarcely 1000 stadia, that

they are not very high, nor covered with snow to a great

depth, and therefore do not occasion the snow to melt in great

masses, for the most elevated mountains are in the northern

parts above Ecbatana; towards the south they are divided,

spread out, and are much lower; the Tigris also receives the

greater part of the water [which comes down from them],

and thus overflows its banks.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ ou(/tws plhmmurei=n.</foreign> These words are, as Kramer proposes, transferred from below. There can be no meaning given to them as they stand in the text, which is here corrupt.</note>
</p><p>The last assertion is evidently absurd, because the Tigris

descends into the same plains (as the Euphrates); and the

above-mentioned mountains are not of the same height, the

northern being more elevated, the southern extending in

breadth, but are of a lower altitude. The quantity of snow is

not, however, to be estimated by altitude only, but by aspect.

The same mountain has more snow on the northern than on

the southern side, and the snow continues longer on the former

than on the latter. As the Tigris therefore receives from the

most southern parts of Armenia, which are near Babylon, the

water of the melted snow, of which there is no great quantity,

since it comes from the southern side, it should overflow in a

less degree than the Euphrates, which receives the water

from both parts (northern and southern); and not from a

single mountain only, but from many, as I have mentioned in

the description of Armenia. To this we must add the length

of the river, the large tract of country which it traverses in

the Greater and in the Lesser Armenia, the large space it

takes in its course in passing out of the Lesser Armenia and

Cappadocia, after issuing out of the Taurus in its way to

Thapsacus (forming the boundary between Syria below and

Mesopotamia), and the large remaining portion of country as

far as Babylon and to its mouth, a course in all of 36,000

stadia.

this river overflows at the time of the melting of the snow,

the spring also of asphaltus is filled, and overflows into the

river, where large clods are consolidated, fit for buildings

constructed of baked bricks. Others say that the liquid kind

also is found in Babylonia. With respect to the solid kind, I

have described its great utility in the construction of buildings. They say that boats (of reeds) are woven,<note anchored="yes">Herod. i. 194.</note> which, when

besmeared with asphaltus, are firmly compacted. The liquid

kind, called naphtha, is of a singular nature. When it is

brought near the fire, the fire catches it; and if a body

smeared over with it is brought near the fire, it burns with a

flame, which it is impossible to extinguish, except with a

large quantity of water; with a small quantity it burns more

violently, but it may be smothered and extinguished by mud,

vinegar, alum, and glue. It is said that Alexander, as an

experiment, ordered naphtha to be poured over a boy in a bath,

and a lamp to be brought near his body. The boy became

enveloped in flames, and would have perished if the bystanders had not mastered the fire by pouring upon him a great

quantity of water, and thus saved his life.

<p>In former times the capital of Assyria was Babylon; it

is now called Seleuceia upon the Tigris. Near it is a large

village called Ctesiphon. This the Parthian kings usually

made their winter residence, with a view to spare the Seleucians the burden of furnishing quarters for the Scythian soldiery. In consequence of the power of Parthia, Ctesiphon<note anchored="yes">Al-Madain.</note>

may be considered as a city rather than a village; from its

size it is capable of lodging a great multitude of people; it has

been adorned with public buildings by the Parthians, and has

furnished merchandise, and given rise to arts profitable to its

masters.

Other authors have given a more extended meaning to the name, and applied it to the country on the north of the two rivers Zab, from whence (Amm.

men intending to become husbands. In this manner marriages are contracted.

greatest distance by which they are separated

from each other is that towards the mountains. This distance

may be the same which Eratosthenes mentions, and is reckoned from

Thapsacus,<note anchored="yes">El-der.</note> where there was the (Zeugma) old bridge

of the Euphrates, to the (Zeugma) passage over the Tigris,

pasture or booty begin to be exhausted. The country lying

tribes living on both banks of the river, who occupy not indeed a fertile territory, yet one less sterile than the rest (of

the country), are settled in the midst of their own peculiar

There were in the royal stud more than thirty thousand brood

little in front of the city, from the channel (between the island

The water is obtained by letting down from a boat, which

serves for the purpose, and inverting over the spring (at the

bottom of the sea), a wide-mouthed funnel of lead, the end of

which is contracted to a moderate-sized opening; round this

is fastened a (long) leathern pipe, which we may call the neck,

<p>The Aradii were anciently governed by their own

Afterwards the Persians, Macedonians, and now the Romans

</p><p>The Aradii, together with the other Phœnicians, consented

to become allies of the Syrian kings; but upon the dissension

entered into a treaty, by which they were allowed to receive

persons who quitted the king's dominions, and took refuge

among them, and were not obliged to deliver them up against

their will. They were not, however, to suffer them to embark

and quit the island without the king's permission. From this

they derived great advantages; for those who took refuge

there were not ordinary people, but persons who had held

the highest trusts, and apprehended the worst consequences

(when they fled). They regarded those who received them

with hospitality as their benefactors; they acknowledged

their preservers, and remembered with gratitude the kindness

which they had received, particularly after their return to

their own country. It was thus that the Aradii acquired

possession of a large part of the opposite continent, most of

which they possess even at present, and were otherwise suc-

<p>After Orthosia and the river Eleutherus is Tripolis,

which has its designation from the fact of its consisting of

three cities, Tyre, Sidon, and Aradus. Contiguous to Tripolis

is Theoprosopon,<note anchored="yes">Greego.</note> where the mountain Libanus terminates.

Between them lies a small place called Trieres.

<milestone n="16" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There are two mountains, which form Cœle-Syria, as

it is called, lying nearly parallel to each other; the commencement of the ascent of both these mountains, Libanus

and Antilibanus, is a little way from the sea; Libanus rises

above the sea near Tripolis and Theoprosopon, and Antilibanus, above the sea near Sidon. They terminate somewhere

near the Arabian mountains, which are above the district of

Damascus and the Trachones as they are there called, where

they form fruitful hills. A hollow plain lies between them, the

breadth of which towards the sea is 200 stadia, and the

length from the sea to the interior is about twice that number

of stadia. Rivers flow through it, the largest of which is the

Jordan, which water a country fertile and productive of all

things. It contains also a lake, which produces the aromatic

rush and reed. In it are also marshes. The name of the lake is

Gennesaritis. It produces also balsamum.<note anchored="yes">If the words of the text, <foreign lang="greek">fe/o|ei de/ kai\,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">it produces also,</q> refer to the lake, our author would contradict himself; for below, § 41, he says that Jericho alone produces it. They must therefore be referred to <q direct="unspecified">a hollow plain</q> above; and the fact that they do so arises from the remarkable error of Strabo, in placing Judæa in the valley formed by Libanus and Antilibanus. From the manner in which he expresses himself, it is evident that he supposed the Jordan to flow, and the Lake Gennesaret to be situated, between these two mountains. As to the Lycus (the Nahr el Kelb), Strabo, if he had visited the country, would never have said that the Arabians transported upon it their merchandise. It is evident that he has confused the geography of all these districts, by transferring Judæa, with its lakes and rivers, to Cœle-Syria Proper; and here probably we may find the result of his first error in confounding Cœle-Syria Pro per with Cœle-Syria understood in a wider meaning.

Macras and Macra-pedium. Here Poseidonius says there

was seen a serpent lying dead, which was nearly a plethrum

in length, and of such a bulk and thickness that men on horseback standing on each side of its body could not see one another; the jaws when opened could take in a man on horseback, and the scales of the skin were larger than a shield.

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next to the plain of Macras is that of Massyas, which

also contains some mountainous parts, among which is Chalcis, the acropolis, as it were, of the Massyas. The commencement of this plain is at Laodiceia,<note anchored="yes">Iouschiah.</note> near Libanus. The

Ituræans and Arabians, all of whom are freebooters, occupy

the whole of the mountainous tracts. The husbandmen live

in the plains, and when harassed by the freebooters, they require protection of various kinds. The robbers have strongholds from which they issue forth; those, for example, who

occupy Libanus have high up on the mountain the fortresses

Sinna, Borrhama, and some others like them; lower down,

Botrys and Gigartus, caves also near the sea, and the castle

on the promontory Theoprosopon. Pompey destroyed these

fastnesses, from whence the robbers overran Byblus,<note anchored="yes">Gebail.</note> and

Berytus<note anchored="yes">Beyrout.</note> situated next to it, and which lie between Sidon

the Tyrian purple being in the highest estimation. The shellfish from which it is procured is caught near the coast, and

the Tyrians have in great abundance other requisites for dyeing. The great number of dyeing works renders the city

unpleasant as a place of residence, but the superior skill of

the people in the practice of this art is the source of its

wealth. Their independence was secured to them at a

C., or eighteen years before the Christian era, and deprived the Tyrians and Sidonians of their liberty, in consequence of their seditious conduct. It follows therefore, that if Strabo had travelled in Phœnicia, he must have visited Tyre before the above date, because his account refers to a state of things anterior to the arrival of Augustus in Syria; and in this case the information he gives respecting the state of the neighbouring cities must belong to the same date; but he speaks above (§ 19) of the order reëstablished by Agrippa at Beyrout, which was effected four years after the coming of Augustus into Syria.

Ace.<note anchored="yes">Acre.</note> It was the place of rendezvous for the Persians in

their expeditions against Egypt. Between Ace and Tyre is

a sandy beach, the sand of which is used in making glass.

The sand, it is said, is not fused there, but carried to Sidon to

undergo that process. Some say that the Sidonians have, in

their own country, the vitrifiable sand; according to others,

the sand of every place can be fused. I heard at Alexandria

from the glass-workers, that there is in Egypt a kind of vitrifiable earth, without which expensive works in glass of various colours could not be executed, but in other countries

other mixtures are required; and at Rome, it is reported,

there have been many inventions both for producing various

colours, and for facilitating the manufacture, as for example

in glass wares, where a glass bowl may be purchased for a

copper coin,<note anchored="yes">Letronne estimates this at a penny.</note> and glass is ordinarily used for drinking.

<p>A phenomenon<note anchored="yes">Athenæus, p. 742, Bohn's Class. Library.</note> of the rarest kind is said to have occurred on

the shore between Tyre and Ptolemaïs. The people of

Ptolemaïs had engaged in battle with Sarpedon the general, and

after a signal defeat were left in this place, when a wave from

the sea, like the rising tide, overwhelmed the fugitives; some

were carried out to sea and drowned, others perished in

hollow places; then again the ebb succeeding, uncovered

and displayed to sight the bodies lying in confusion among

dead fish.
</p><p>A similar phenomenon took place at Mount Casium in

Egypt. The ground, to a considerable distance, after a violent

and single shock fell in parts, at once exchanging places; the

elevated parts opposed the access of the sea, and parts which

had subsided admitted it. Another shock occurred, and the

place recovered its ancient position, except that there was an

alteration (in the surface of the ground) in some places, and

none in others. Perhaps such occurrences are connected with

periodical returns the nature of which is unknown to us.

This is said to be the case with the rise of the waters of the

Nile, which exhibits a variety in its effects, but observes (in

general) a certain order, which we do not comprehend.

The repairs of the ancient city, the Tower of Strato, or rather the creation of the new city Cæsarea, took place about eight or nine years B.

beasts and cattle of the field; that the Greeks also were in

error in making images of their gods after the human form.

Law is twofold, divine and human. The ancients regarded

and respected divine, in preference to human, law; in those

times, therefore, the number of persons was very great who

consulted oracles, and, being desirous of obtaining the advice

of Jupiter, hurried to Dodona,

<p>The Lake Sirbonis<note anchored="yes">Strabo here commits the singular error of confounding the Lake Asphaltites, or the Dead Sea, with the Lake Sirbonis. Letronne attempts to explain the origin of the error. According to Josephus, the Peræa, or that part of Judæa which is on the eastern side of the Jordan, between the lake of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, contained a district (the exact position of which is not well known, but which, according to Josephus, could not be far from the Lake Asphaltites) called Silbonitis. The resemblance of this name to Sirbonis probably misled our author.</note> is of great extent. Some say that

it is 1000 stadia in circumference. It stretches along the

coast, to the distance of a little more than 200 stadia. It is

deep, and the water is exceedingly heavy, so that no person

can dive into it; if any one wades into it up to the waist, and

attempts to move forward, he is immediately lifted out of

the water<note anchored="yes">Specific gravity 1ċ211, a degree of density scarcely to be met with in any other natural water. Marcet's Analysis. Philos. Trans. part ii. page 298. <date value="1807">1807</date>.</note> It abounds with asphaltus, which rises, not

however at any regular seasons, in bubbles, like boiling water,

from the middle of the deepest part. The surface is convex,

and presents the appearance of a hillock. Together with the

asphaltus, there ascends a great quantity of sooty vapour, not

perceptible to the eye, which tarnishes copper, silver, and

everything bright—even gold. The neighbouring people know

by the tarnishing of their vessels that the asphaltus is beginning to rise, and they prepare to collect it by means of rafts

composed of reeds. The asphaltus is a clod of earth, liquefied

by heat; the air forces it to the surface, where it spreads itself.

It is again changed into so firm and solid a mass by cold

water, such as the water of the lake, that it requires cutting

or chopping (for use). It floats upon the water, which, as I

have described, does not admit of diving or immersion, but

lifts up the person who goes into it. Those who go on rafts

for the asphaltus cut it in pieces, and take away as much as

they are able to carry.

<milestone n="43" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such are the phenomena. But Posidonius says, that the

people being addicted to magic, and practising incantations,

(by these means) consolidate the asphaltus, pouring upon it

urine and other fetid fluids, and then cut it into pieces.

(Incantations cannot be the cause), but perhaps urine may have

some peculiar power (in effecting the consolidation) in the

the urine of children.
</p><p>It is natural for these phenomena to take place in the middle

of the lake, because the source of the fire is in the centre, and

the greater part of the asphaltus comes from thence. The

bubbling up, however, of the asphaltus is irregular, because the

motion of fire, like that of many other vapours, has no order

perceptible to observers. There are also phenomena of

this kind at Apollonia in Epirus.

a soil like ashes; pitch falling in drops from the rocks;

rivers boiling up, and emitting a fetid odour to a great distance;

dwellings in every direction overthrown; whence we

that thirteen cities<note anchored="yes">Genesis xiv. and Wisdom x. 6: <q direct="unspecified">the fire which fell down on the five cities.</q></note> once existed there, the capital of which

was Sodom, but that a circuit of about 60 stadia around it

escaped uninjured; shocks of earthquakes, however, eruptions

of flames and hot springs, containing asphaltus and sulphur,

caused the lake to burst its bounds, and the rocks took fire;

some of the cities were swallowed up, others were abandoned

by such of the inhabitants as were able to make their escape.

of water. They do not till the land at all, or only to a small

of camels. Above these is a great desert; but the parts lying

still more to the south are occupied by the nations inhabiting

Arabia Felix, as it is called. The northern side of this tract

is formed by the above-mentioned desert, the eastern by the

the great sea lying outside of both the gulfs, the whole of

which is called the Erythræan Sea.<note anchored="yes">The name Erythræan, or Red Sea, was extended to the whole of the Arabian Gulf, to the sea which surrounds Arabia to the south, and to a great part of the Persian Gulf.</note>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Persian Gulf has the name also of the Sea of Persia.

Eratosthenes speaks of it in this manner: "They say that the

mouth is so narrow, that from Harmozi,<note anchored="yes">The cape Harmozi, or Harmozon, is the cape Kuhestek of Carmania, Kerman, situated opposite to the promontory Maceta, so called from the Macæ, an Arabian tribe living in the neighbourhood. This last promontory is now called Mocandon, and is the <q direct="unspecified">Asaborum promontorium</q> of Ptolemy.</note> the promontory of

Carmania, may be seen the promontory at Mace, in Arabia.

From the mouth, the coast on the right hand is circular, and at

first inclines a little from Carmania towards the east, then to

the north, and afterwards to the west as far as Teredon and

the mouth of the Euphrates.<note anchored="yes">For a long period the Euphrates has ceased to discharge itself directly into the Persian Gulf, and now unites with the Tigris above 100 miles from the sea.</note> In an extent of about 10,000

stadia, it comprises the coast of the Carmanians, Persians, and

Susians, and in part of the Babylonians. (Of these we ourselves have before spoken.) Hence directly as far as the

mouth are 10,000 stadia more, according, it is said, to the

computation of Androsthenes of Thasos, who not only had accompanied

Nearchus, but had also alone sailed along the seacoast of Arabia.<note anchored="yes">The reading followed, but not introduced into the text, by Kramer is that suggested by the corrections of Letronne and Groskurd, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ th\n )Ara/bwn parali/an parapleu/santa kaq) au(to/n.</foreign></note>

It is hence evident that this sea is little inferior in size to the

Euxine.
</p><p>"He says that Androsthenes, who had navigated the gulf

with a fleet, relates, that in sailing from Teredon with the

continent on the right hand, an island Icaros<note anchored="yes">Peludje, at the entrance of the Gulf of Gran.</note> is met with,

an oracle of [Diana] Tauropolus.

He also conjectures that the most flourishing period of the town was when the Persians, for political reasons, destroyed the commerce of Babylon, and Gerrha then became the sole depôt for the maritime commerce of India.</note> belonging to Chaldæan exiles from Babylon, who

constructed of salt: as scales of salt separated by the burning

heat of the sun are continually falling off, the houses are

sprinkled with water, and the walls are thus kept firm together. The city is distant 200 stadia from the sea. The

merchants of Gerrha generally carry the Arabian merchandise

and aromatics by land; but Aristobulus says, on the contrary,

that they frequently travel into Babylonia on rafts, and thence

sail up the Euphrates to Thapsacus<note anchored="yes">El-Der.</note> with their cargoes, but

afterwards carry them by land to all parts of the country.

Aradus,<note anchored="yes">Arek.</note> which have temples resembling those of the

Phœnicians. The inhabitants of these islands (if we are to

believe them) say that the islands and cities bearing the same

name as those of the Phœnicians are their own colonies.<note anchored="yes">Besides the islands Tyre and Aradus, there existed even in the time of Alexander, and near the present Cape Gherd, a city called Sidon or Sidodona, which was visited by Nearchus, as may be seen in his Periplus. The Phœnician inhabitants of these places appear to have afterwards removed to the western side of the Persian Gulf, and to the islands Bahrain, to which they gave the names Tylos, or Tyre, and Aradus. The latter name still exists; it was from this place that the Phœnicians moved, to establish themselves on the shores of the Mediterranean, and transferred the name of Sidon, their ancient capital, and those of Tyre and Aradus, to the new cities which they there founded. <emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></note>

was king of the country, and the sea received its name from

him. It is said that Mithropastes, the son of Arsites, satrap

of Phrygia, pointed out these things to them. Mithropastes

himself to those who had come down to the Persian Gulf,

<p>I return to the opinions of Eratosthenes, which he next

delivers respecting Arabia. He is speaking of the northern

and Judæa, to the recess of the Arabian Gulf.
</p><p>From Heroopolis, situated in that recess of the Arabian

Gulf which is on the side of the Nile, to Babylon, towards

Petra of the Nabatæi, are 5600 stadia. The whole tract lies

in the direction of the summer solstice (i. e. east and west), and

passes through the adjacent Arabian tribes, namely Nabatæi,

Chaulotæi, and Agræi. Above these people is Arabia

Felix, stretching out 12,000 stadia towards the south to the

Atlantic Sea.<note anchored="yes">Letronne here proposes to read Erythræan or Ethiopian Sea.</note>

</p><p>The first people, next after the Syrians and Jews, who occupy this

country are husbandmen. These people are succeeded by a barren and

sandy tract, producing a few palms, the

acanthus,<note anchored="yes">Mimosa Nilotica.</note> and tamarisk; water is obtained by digging [wells]

as in Gedrosia. It is inhabited by Arabian Scenitæ, who

breed camels. The extreme parts towards the south, and

opposite to Ethiopia, are watered by summer showers, and

are sowed twice, like the land in India. Its rivers are exhausted in watering plains, and by running into lakes. The

general fertility of the country is very great; among other

products, there is in particular an abundant supply of honey;

except horses,<note anchored="yes">This is remarkable.</note> there are numerous herds of animals, mules

(asses?), and swine; birds also of every kind, except geese and

</p><p>Four of the most populous nations inhabit the extremity of

the above-mentioned country; namely, the Minæi the part

towards the Red Sea, whose largest city is Carna or Carnana.<note anchored="yes">Cam Almanazil.</note>

Next to these are the Sabæans, whose chief city is Mariaba.<note anchored="yes">Mariaba was not the name of a city, but the title of a city acquired by the residence of their sovereigns. <q direct="unspecified">Mariana oppidum,</q> says Pliny, vi. 32, <q direct="unspecified">significat dominos omnium.</q> The capital was called Saba, now Sabbea; and the country in which it is situated is called Sabieh.</note>

The Ichthyophagi inhabit this country. Here it is said is a

Cinnamon country, a distance of about 5000 stadia;<note anchored="yes">This passage has sometimes been mistaken to mean, that the region producing myrrh and cinnamon refers to the southern coast of Arabia.

<p>Artemidorus<note anchored="yes">The long and interesting passage from § 5 to the end of § 20 is taken from Artemidorus, with the exception of a very few facts, which our author has taken from other sources, accompanied by observations of his own. On comparing this fragment of Artemidorus with the extracts of Agatharchides preserved by Photius, and the description of Arabia and Troglodytica which Diodorus Siculus (b. iii. 31) says he derived from Agatharchides, we find an identity, not only in almost all the details, but also in a great number of the expressions. It is, therefore, evident that Artemidorus, for this part of his work, scarcely did anything more than copy Agatharchides. Agatharchides, in his youth, held the situation of secretary or reader to Heraclides Lembus, who (according to Suidas) lived in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor. This king died B. C. <date value="-146">146</date>. He wrote a work on Asia in 10 books, and one on Europe in 49 books; a geographical work on the Erythræan Sea in 5 books; a treatise on the Troglodyæ in 5 books; and other works. He wrote in the Attic dialect. His style, according to Photius, was dignified and perspicuous, and abounded in sententious passages, which inspired a favourable opinion of his judgment. In the composition of his speeches he was an imitator of Thucydides, whom he equalled in dignity, and excelled in clearness. His rhetorical talents also are highly praised by Photius. He was acquainted with the language of the Ethiopians, and appears to have been the first who discovered the true cause of the inundations of the Nile. See Smith, art.

It seems therefore that these two authors, as well as Strabo and Pliny, meant here to speak of one and the same tribe of Ethiopian Gymnetæ, which might have been distinguished by the particular name of Cynegetæ, or Cynegi. <emph rend="ital">Du Theil.</emph></note> who use bows and reed arrows, the points of

which are hardened in the fire. They generally shoot the

numerous herds of wild cattle among them, on the flesh of

which they subsist, and on that of other wild animals. When

they have taken nothing in the chase, they dress dried skins

upon hot coals, and are satisfied with food of this kind. It is

their custom to propose trials of skill in archery for those who

have not attained manhood.

<p>Further still towards the south are the Cynamolgi,<note anchored="yes">Milkers of bitches.</note>

called by the natives Agrii, with long hair and long beards,

who keep a breed of very large dogs for hunting the Indian

cattle which come into their country from the neighbouring

district, driven thither either by wild beasts or by scarcity of

elephants, called <q direct="unspecified">At the Well.</q> The district is inhabited by

the Elephantophagi (or Elephant-eaters), who are occupied in

hunting them. When they descry from the trees a herd of

elephants directing their course through the forest, they do

not [then] attack, but they approach by stealth and hamstring

the hindmost stragglers from the herd. Some kill them with

bows and arrows, the latter being dipped in the gall of serpents. The

shooting with the bow is performed by three

men, two, advancing in front, hold the bow, and one draws

the string. Others remark the trees against which the elephant is

accustomed to rest, and, approaching on the opposite

side, cut the trunk of the tree low down. When the animal

comes and leans against it, the tree and the elephant fall

down together. The elephant is unable to rise, because its

legs are formed of one piece of bone which is inflexible; the

hunters leap down from the trees, kill it, and cut it in pieces.

The Nomades call the hunters Acatharti, or impure.

<p>Above this nation is situated a small tribe the

Struthophagi<note anchored="yes">Agatharchides, as quoted by Diodorus Sic. iii. 27, says expressly that this bird is the ostrich. May it be the cassowary?</note> (or Bird-eaters), in whose country are birds of the

size of deer, which are unable to fly, but run with the swiftness of

the ostrich. Some hunt them with bows and arrows,

others covered with the skins of birds. They hide the right

hand in the neck of the skin, and move it as the birds move

their necks. With the left hand they scatter grain from a

bag suspended to the side; they thus entice the birds, till

they drive them into pits, where the hunters despatch them

with cudgels. The skins are used both as clothes and as

coverings for beds. The Ethiopians called Simi are at war

with these people, and use as weapons the horns of antelopes.

of locusts, which the south-west and west winds, when they

blow violently in the spring-time, drive in bodies into the

country. The inhabitants catch them by throwing into the

ravines materials which cause a great deal of smoke, and

light them gently. The locusts, as they fly across the smoke,

are blinded and fall down. They are pounded with salt,

made into cakes, and eaten as food.
</p><p>Above these people is situated a desert tract with extensive pastures. It was abandoned in consequence of the multitudes of scorpions and tarantulas, called tetragnathi (or fourjawed), which formerly abounded to so great a degree as to

occasion a complete desertion of the place long since by its

inhabitants.

<p>Next to the harbour of Eumenes, as far as Deire and

the straits opposite the six islands,<note anchored="yes">Above, § 4.</note> live the Ichthyophagi, Creophagi, and Colobi, who extend into the interior.
</p><p>Many hunting-grounds for elephants, and obscure cities

and islands, lie in front of the coast.
</p><p>The greater part are Nomades; husbandmen are few in

number. In the country occupied by some of these nations

styrax grows in large quantity. The Icthyophagi, on the

ebbing of the tide, collect fish, which they cast upon

the rocks and dry in the sun. When they have well broiled

them, the bones are piled in heaps, and the flesh trodden with

the feet is made into cakes, which are again exposed to the

sun and used as food. In bad weather, when fish cannot be

procured, the bones of which they have made heaps are pounded, made into cakes and eaten, but they suck the fresh bones.

Some also live upon shell-fish, when they are fattened, which

is done by throwing them into holes and standing pools of

the sea, where they are supplied with small fish, and used as

food when other fish are scarce. They have various kinds of

places for preserving and feeding fish, from whence they

derive their supply.
</p><p>Some of the inhabitants of that part of the coast which is

their families, with songs and rejoicings, to the watering-places, where, throwing themselves on their faces, they drink

as beasts until their stomachs are distended like a drum.

They then return again to the sea-coast. They dwell in

caves or cabins, with roofs consisting of beams and rafters

made of the bones and spines of whales, and covered with

branches of the olive tree.

<milestone n="14" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Chelonophagi (or Turtle-eaters) live under the

cover of shells (of turtles), which are large enough to be used

as boats. Some make of the sea-weed, which is thrown up

in large quantities, lofty and hill-like heaps, which are hollowed out, and underneath which they live. They cast out the

dead, which are carried away by the tide, as food for fish.
</p><p>There are three islands which follow in succession, the

island of Tortoises, the island of Seals, and the island of Hawks.

Along the whole coast there are plantations of palm trees,

olive trees, and laurels, not only within, but in a great part

also without the straits.
</p><p>There is also an island [called the island] of Philip, opposite

to it inland is situated the hunting-ground for elephants, called

the chase of Pythangelus; then follows Arsinoë, a city with a

harbour; after these places is Deire, and beyond them is a

hunting-ground for elephants.
</p><p>From Deire, the next country is that which bears aromatic

plants. The first produces myrrh, and belongs to the Icthyophagi and the Creophagi. It bears also the persea, peach or

Egyptian almond,<note anchored="yes">Pliny, xiii. 17; xv. 13.</note> and the Egyptian fig. Beyond is Licha, a

hunting-ground for elephants. There are also in many places

standing pools of rain-water. When these are dried up, the

elephants, with their trunks and tusks, dig holes and find

water.
</p><p>On this coast there are two very large lakes extending as

far as the promontory Pytholaus.<note anchored="yes">Perhaps Zeila. Strabo is here describing the coast of the modem kingdom of Adel.</note> One of them contains

salt water, and is called a sea; the other, fresh water,

margin grows the papyrus. The ibis is seen in the neighbourhood of this place. The people who live near the promontory of Pytholaus (and beginning from this place) do not

undergo any mutilation in any part of their body. Next is

the country which produces frankincense; it has a promontory and a temple with a grove of poplars. In the inland

parts is a tract along the banks of a river bearing the name of

Isis, and another that of Nilus,<note anchored="yes">The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea indicates on this coast a place called Niloptolemæum, which appears to correspond with the mouth of the river Pedra. <emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></note> both of which produce myrrh

and frankincense. Also a lagoon filled with water from the

mountains; next the watch-post of the Lion, and the port of

Pythangelus. The next tract bears the false cassia. There are

many tracts in succession on the sides of rivers on which frankincense grows, and rivers extending to the cinnamon country.

The river which bounds this tract produces (phlous) rushes<note anchored="yes">Phleus schæoris. <emph rend="ital">Linn.</emph></note>

of Daphnus,<note anchored="yes">Daphnus Parvus of the Periplus of the Erythræan Sea.</note> and a valley called Apollo's, which bears, besides frankincense, myrrh and cinnamon. The latter is more

abundant in places far in the interior.
</p><p>Next is the mountain Elephas,<note anchored="yes">Now Fellis or Fel, which signifies Elephant in Arabic.</note> a mountain projecting into

the sea, and a creek; then follows the large harbour of

Psygmus, a watering-place called that of Cynocephali, and

the last promontory of this coast, Notu-ceras (or the Southern

Horn).<note anchored="yes">I think that there is something here omitted and wanting in the text of Strabo, as he seems to make Artemidorus say, that a little after Mount Elephas we find the Horn, or the Cape of the South; for this last appellation appears to have been applied to Cape Guardafui. But this cape, from the time of Philadelphus, and consequently before the period in which Artemidorus wrote, was known by the name of the Promontory of the Aromatics; this author therefore could not have confounded it with the Southern Horn. I have already come to the conclusion that the Southern Horn corresponds with the Southern Cape of Bandel-caus, where commences the desert coast of Ajan, the ancient Azania, respecting which Artemidorus confesses that he was unable to procure any information. It therefore appears to me, that the description which this author must have given of the coast of Africa, from Mount Elephas to the Southern Horn, and which Strabo should have copied, is now wanting in the text. This omission seems to have been noticed by some copyist, who thought to supply it by naming again, to the south of Mount Elephas, the altars of Pytholaus, Lichas, Pythangelus, and Leon, which Artemidorus had already spoken of, and which navigators meet with on the west, and before arriving at Mount Elephas. <emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></note> After doubling this cape towards the south, we have

Its shape approached very nearly to that of the wild boar, and

particularly the forehead; except the front, which is furnished

with a hooked horn, harder than any bone. It uses it as a weapon, like the wild boar its tusks. It has also two hard welts, like

folds of serpents, encircling the body from the chine to the

belly, one on the withers, the other on the loins. This description is taken from one which I myself saw. Artemidorus adds

to his account of this animal, that it is peculiarly inclined to

dispute with the elephant for the place of pasture ; thrusting

its forehead under the belly [of the elephant] and ripping it

up, unless prevented by the trunk and tusks of his adversary.

<p>Camel-leopards are bred in these parts, but they do not

in any respect resemble leopards, for their variegated skin is

more like the streaked and spotted skin of fallow deer. The

hinder quarters are so very much lower than the fore quarters,

that it seems as if the animal sat upon its rump, which is the

height of an ox; the fore legs are as long as those of the

camel. The neck rises high and straight up, but the head

greatly exceeds in height that of the camel. From this want

of proportion, the speed of the animal is not so great, I think,

as it is described by Artemidorus, according to whom it is

not to be surpassed. It is not however a wild animal, but

rather like a domesticated beast; for it shows no signs of a

savage disposition.
</p><p>This country, continues Artemidorus, produces also sphinxes,<note anchored="yes">Ancient authors, under the name of Sphinx, generally describe the

<p>The mode of life among the Troglodytæ is nomadic.

Each tribe is governed by tyrants. Their wives and children

</p><p>The women carefully paint themselves with antimony.

They wear about their necks shells, as a protection against

fascination by witchcraft. In their quarrels, which are for

pastures, they first push away each other with their hands,

they then use stones, or, if wounds are inflicted, arrows and

daggers. The women put an end to these disputes, by going

into the midst of the combatants and using prayers and en-

</p><p>Their food consists of flesh and bones pounded together,

other methods by the cooks, who are called Acatharti, or

</p><p>They use (as an ointment for the body ?) a mixture of

They deprive themselves of the prepuce,<note anchored="yes">Above, § 5.</note> but some are circumcised like Egyptians. The Ethiopian Megabari have

their clubs armed with iron knobs. They use spears and

shields which are covered with raw hides. The other Ethiopians use bows and lances. Some of the Troglodytæ, when

they bury their dead, bind the body from the neck to the legs

with twigs of the buckthorn. They then immediately throw

stones over the body, at the same time laughing and rejoicing,

until they have covered the face. They then place over it a

ram's horn, and go away.
</p><p>They travel by night; the male cattle have bells fastened

to them, in order to drive away wild beasts with the sound.

They use torches also and arrows in repelling them. They

watch during the night, on account of their flocks, and sing

some peculiar song around their fires.

<p>Having given this account of the Troglodytæ and of

the neighbouring Ethiopians, Artemidorus returns to the

Arabians. Beginning from Poseidium, he first describes

those who border upon the Arabian Gulf, and are opposite to

the Troglodytæ. He says that Poseidium is situated within the

bay of [Heroopolis],<note anchored="yes">The bay of Heroopolis is the modern bay of Suez. In the text

is without water or shade. But there the fertility of the

palm is prodigious. A man and a woman are appointed by

hereditary right to the guardianship of the grove. They

wear skins, and live on dates. They sleep in huts built on

<p>Some of these say, that the sea is red from the colour

arising from reflection either from the sun, which is vertical,

or from the mountains, which are red by being scorched with

intense heat; for the colour, it is supposed, may be produced by

both these causes. Ctesias of Cnidus speaks of a spring

which discharges into the sea a red and ochrous water. Agatharchides, his fellow-citizen, relates, on the authority of a

person of the name of Boxus, of Persian descent, that when a

troop of horses was driven by a lioness in heat as far as the

sea, and had passed over to an island, a Persian of the name

of Erythras constructed a raft, and was the first person who

crossed the sea to it; perceiving the island to be well adapted

for inhabitants, he drove the herd back to Persia, and sent

out colonists both to this and the other islands and to the coast.

He [thus] gave his own name to the sea. But according to

others, it was Erythras the son of Perseus who was the king

of this country.

<p>The Nabatæans and Sabæans, situated above Syria, are

the first people who occupy Arabia Felix. They were frequently in the habit of overrunning this country before the

Romans became masters of it, but at present both they and

the Syrians are subject to the Romans.
</p><p>The capital of the Nabatæans is called Petra. It is situated on a spot which is surrounded and fortified by a smooth

and level rock (petra), which externally is abrupt and

precipitous, but within there are abundant springs of water

both for domestic purposes and for watering gardens. Beyond the enclosure the country is for the most part a desert,

particularly towards Judæa. Through this is the shortest

road to Jericho, a journey of three or four days, and five days

to the Phœnicon (or palm plantation). It is always governed

by a king of the royal race. The king has a minister who is

one of the Companions, and is called Brother. It has excellent laws for the administration of public affairs.
</p><p>Athenodorus, a philosopher, and my friend, who had been

at Petra, used to relate with surprise, that he found many

Romans and also many other strangers residing there. He

observed the strangers frequently engaged in litigation, both

with one another and with the natives; but the natives had

never any dispute amongst themselves, and lived together in

perfect harmony.

Æneas, afterwards called Aretas, took possession of the kingdom of the

Nabatæans. Upon this Syllæus, the late king's minister, went to Rome,

and declared before Augustus that Æneas, or Aretas, had no right to the

kingdom. How this corrupt minister was punished by Augustus may be

seen in Nicolas of Damascus and in Josephus. This Aretas must have

Cæsar despatched this general to explore the nature of these



<pb n="210"/>



places and their inhabitants, as well as those of Ethiopia;

for he observed that Troglodytica, which is contiguous to

Egypt, bordered upon Ethiopia; and that the Arabian Gulf

was extremely narrow, where it separates the Arabians from the

Troglodytæ. It was his intention either to conciliate or subdue the Arabians. He was also influenced by the report,

which had prevailed from all time, that this people were very

wealthy, and exchanged their aromatics and precious stones

for silver and gold, but never expended with foreigners any

part of what they received in exchange. He hoped to acquire either opulent friends, or to overcome opulent enemies.

He was moreover encouraged to undertake this enterprise by

the expectation of assistance from the Nabatæans, who promised to co-operate with him in everything.

<milestone n="23" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Upon these inducements Gallus set out on the expedition. But he was deceived by Syllæus, the [king's] minister

of the Nabatæans, who had promised to be his guide on the

march, and to assist him in the execution of his design. Syllæus was however treacherous throughout; for he neither

guided them by a safe course by sea along the coast, nor by a

safe road for the army, as he promised, but exposed both the

fleet and the army to danger, by directing them where there

was no road, or the road was impracticable, where they were

obliged to make long circuits, or to pass through tracts of

country destitute of everything ; he led the fleet along a

rocky coast without harbours, or to places abounding with

rocks concealed under water, or with shallows. In places of

this description particularly, the flowing and ebbing of the

tide did them the most harm.
</p><p>The first mistake consisted in building long vessels [of war]

at a time when there was no war, nor any likely to occur by

sea. For the Arabians, being mostly engaged in traffic and

commerce, are not a very warlike people even on land, much

less so at sea. Gallus, notwithstanding, built not less than

eighty biremes and triremes and galleys (phaseli) at Cleopatris,<note anchored="yes">Called also Arsinoë, b. xvii. c. i. § 25. It was near Heroopolis, or Suez.</note> near the old canal which leads from the Nile. When

he discovered his mistake, he constructed a hundred and

thirty vessels of burden, in which he embarked with about

ten thousand infantry, collected from Egypt, consisting of

Romans and allies, among whom were five hundred Jews and



<pb n="211"/>



a thousand Nabatæans, under the command of Syllæus. After

enduring great hardships and distress, he arrived on the

fifteenth day at Leuce-Come, a large mart in the territory

of the Nabatæans, with the loss of many of his vessels,

some with all their crews, in consequence of the difficulty of

the navigation, but by no opposition from an enemy. These

misfortunes were occasioned by the perfidy of Syllæus, who

insisted that there was no road for an army by land to

Leuce-Come, to which and from which place the camel-traders travel with ease and in safety from Petra, and back

to Petra, with so large a body of men and camels as to differ

in no respect from an army.

<milestone n="24" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Another cause of the failure of the expedition was the

fact of king Obodas not paying much attention to public

affairs, and especially to those relative to war (as is the custom with all Arabian kings), but placed everything in the

power of Syllæus the minister. His whole conduct in command of the army was perfidious, and his object was, as I

suppose, to examine as a spy the state of the country, and to

destroy, in concert with the Romans, certain cities and tribes;

and when the Romans should be consumed by famine, fatigue,

and disease, and by all the evils which he had treacherously

contrived, to declare himself master of the whole country.
</p><p>Gallus however arrived at Leuce-Come, with the army

labouring under stomacacce and scelotyrbe, diseases of the

country, the former affecting the mouth, the other the legs,

with a kind of paralysis, caused by the water and the plants

[which the soldiers had used in their food]. He was therefore compelled to pass the summer and the winter there, for

the recovery of the sick.
</p><p>Merchandise is conveyed from Leuce-Come to Petra, thence

to Rhinocolura in Phœnicia, near Egypt, and thence to other

nations. But at present the greater part is transported by

the Nile to Alexandreia. It is brought down from Arabia

and India to Myus Hormus, it is then conveyed on camels to

Coptus<note anchored="yes">Koft.</note> of the Thebais, situated on a canal of the Nile, and

to Alexandreia. Gallus, setting out again from Leuce-Come

on his return with his army, and through the treachery of

his guide, traversed such tracts of country, that the army

was obliged to carry water with them upon camels. After a



<pb n="212"/>



march of many days, therefore, he came to the territory of

Aretas, who was related to Obodas. Aretas received him in

a friendly manner, and offered presents. But by the treachery

of Syllæus, Gallus was conducted by a difficult road through

the country ; for he occupied thirty days in passing through it.

It afforded barley, a few palm trees, and butter instead of oil.
</p><p>The next country to which he came belonged to Nomades, and was in great part a complete desert. It was called

Ararene. The king of the country was Sabos. Gallus

spent fifty days in passing through this territory, for want of

roads, and came to a city of the Negrani, and to a fertile

country peacefully disposed. The king had fled, and the city

was taken at the first onset. After a march of six days from

thence, he came to the river. Here the barbarians attacked

the Romans, and lost about ten thousand men; the Romans

lost only two men. For the barbarians were entirely inexperienced in war, and used their weapons unskilfully, which

were bows, spears, swords, and slings; but the greater part

of them wielded a double-edged axe. Immediately afterwards he took the city called Asca, which had been abandoned

by the king. He thence came to a city Athrula, and took it

without resistance; having placed a garrison there, and collected provisions for the march, consisting of corn and dates,

he proceeded to a city Marsiaba, belonging to the nation of

the Rhammanitæ, who were subjects of Ilasarus. He assaulted and besieged it for six days, but raised the siege in consequence of a scarcity of water. He was two days' march from

the aromatic region, as he was informed by his prisoners.

He occupied in his marches a period of six months, in consequence of the treachery of his guides. This he discovered

when he was returning; and although he was late in discovering the design against him, he had time to take another road

back; for he arrived in nine days at Negrana, where the battle

was fought, and thence in eleven days he came to the <q direct="unspecified">Seven

Wells,</q> as the place is called from the fact of their existing

there. Thence he marched through a desert country, and

came to Chaalla a village, and then to another called Malothas, situated on a river. His road then lay through a desert

country, which had only a few watering-places, as far as Egra<note anchored="yes">This name is variously written in manuscripts. If Negra be adopted,

as by Letronne, it's not the same town as the city of the Negrani above mentioned, which was in the interior; but, as Kramer observes, <q direct="unspecified">Mire corrupta est hæc ultima libri pars.</q></note>



<pb n="213"/>



a village. It belongs to the territory of Obodas, and is situated upon the sea. He accomplished on his return the whole

distance in sixty days, in which, on his first journey, he had

consumed six months. From Negra he conducted his army

in eleven days to Myus Hormus; thence across the country

to Coptus, and arrived at Alexandreia with so much of his

army as could be saved. The remainder he lost, not by the

enemy, but by disease, fatigue, famine, and marches through

bad roads ; for seven men only perished in battle. For these

reasons this expedition contributed little in extending our

knowledge of the country. It was however of some small

service.
</p><p>Syllæus, the author of these disasters, was punished for his

treachery at Rome. He affected friendship, but he was convicted of other offences, besides perfidy in this instance, and

was beheaded.

<p>The aromatic country, as I have before said,<note anchored="yes">B. xvi. c. iv. § 2.</note> is divided into four parts. Of aromatics, the frankincense and myrrh

are said to be the produce of trees, but cassia the growth of

bushes; yet some writers say, that the greater part (of the

cassia) is brought from India, and that the best frankincense

is that from Persia.
</p><p>According to another partition of the country, the whole of

Arabia Felix is divided into five kingdoms (or portions), one

of which comprises the fighting men, who fight for all the

rest; another contains the husbandmen, by whom the rest

are supplied with food; another includes those who work at

mechanical trades. One division comprises the myrrh region;

another the frankincense region, although the same tracts

produce cassia, cinnamon, and nard. Trades are not changed

from one family to another, but each workman continues to

exercise that of his father.
</p><p>The greater part of their wine is made from the palm.
</p><p>A man's brothers are held in more respect than his children.

The descendants of the royal family succeed as kings, and are

invested with other governments, according to primogeniture.

Property is common among all the relations. The eldest is

the chief. There is one wife among them all. He who enters



<pb n="214"/>



the house before any of the rest, has intercourse with her,

having placed his staff at the door; for it is a necessary custom,

which every one is compelled to observe, to carry a staff.

The woman however passes the night with the eldest. Hence

the male children are all brothers. They have sexual intercourse also with their mothers. Adultery is punished with

death, but an adulterer must belong to another family.
</p><p>A daughter of one of the kings was of extraordinary

beauty, and had fifteen brothers, who were all in love with

her, and were her unceasing and successive visitors; she,

being at last weary of their importunity, is said to have employed the following device. She procured staves to be made

similar to those of her brothers; when one left the house,

she placed before the door a staff similar to the first, and a

little time afterwards another, and so on in succession, but

making her calculation so that the person who intended to

visit her might not have one similar to that at her door. On

an occasion when the brothers were all of them together at the

market-place, one left it, and came to the door of the house;

seeing the staff there, and conjecturing some one to be in her

apartment, and having left all the other brothers at the marketplace, he suspected the person to be an adulterer ; running

therefore in haste to his father, he brought him with him to

the house, but it was proved that he had falsely accused his

sister.

<milestone n="26" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Nabatæans are prudent, and fond of accumulating

property. The community fine a person who has diminished

his substance, and confer honours on him who has increased

it. They have few slaves, and are served for the most part by

their relations, or by one another, or each person is his own

servant; and this custom extends even to their kings. They

eat their meals in companies consisting of thirteen persons.

Each party is attended by two musicians. But the king

gives many entertainments in great buildings. No one

drinks more than eleven [appointed] cupfuls, from separate

cups, each of gold.
</p><p>The king courts popular favour so much, that he is not

only his own servant, but sometimes he himself ministers to

others. He frequently renders an account [of his administration] before the people, and sometimes an inquiry is made

into his mode of life.

The houses are sumptuous, and of stone. The cities are

without walls, on account of the peace [which prevails among

them]. A great part of the country is fertile, and produces

everything except oil of olives; [instead of it], the oil of

sesamum is used. The sheep have white fleeces, their oxen

are large; but the country produces no horses.<note anchored="yes">See above, § 2.</note> Camels are

the substitute for horses, and perform the [same kind of]

labour. They wear no tunics, but have a girdle about the

loins, and walk abroad in sandals.<note anchored="yes">This reminds us of the prophet Elijah and John the Baptist.</note> The dress of the kings is

the same, but the colour is purple.
</p><p>Some merchandise is altogether imported into the country,

others are not altogether imports, especially as some articles

are native products, as gold and silver, and many of the aromatics; but brass and iron, purple garments, styrax, saffron,

and costus (or white cinnamon), pieces of sculpture, paintings,

statues, are not to be procured in the country.

<p>When the poet says,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">I went to the country of the Ethiopians, Sidonians, and Erembi,</q><note anchored="yes">Od. iv. 84.</note></quote>

it is doubtful, what people he means by Sidonians, whether

those who lived near the Persian Gulf, a colony from which

nation are the Sidonians in our quarter (in the same manner

as historians relate, that some Tyrian islanders are found

there, and Aradii, from whom the Aradii in our country derive their origin), or whether the poet means actually the Sidonians themselves.
</p><p>But there is more doubt about the Erembi, whether we are

to suppose that he means the Troglodytæ, according to the

opinion of those who, by a forced etymology, derive the word

Erembi from <foreign lang="greek">e)/ran e)m&lt;*&gt;ai/nein,</foreign> that is,  <q direct="unspecified">entering into the earth,</q>

or whether he means the Arabians. Zeno the philosopher of

our sect alters the reading in this manner,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">And Sidoni, and Arabes;</q></quote>



<pb n="216"/>



but Poseidonius alters it with a small variation,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">And Sidonii, and Arambi,</q></quote>

as if the poet gave the name Arambi to the present Arabians,

from their being so called by others in his time. He says also,

that the situation of these three nations close to one another

indicates a descent from some common stock, and that on this

account they are called by names having a resemblance to one

another, as Armenii, Aramæi, Arambi. For as we may suppose one nation to have been divided into three (according to

the differences of latitude [in which they lived], which successively became more marked [in proceeding from one to the

other]), so in like manner we may suppose that several names

were adopted in place of one. The proposed change of reading to Eremni is not probable, for that name is more applicable to the Ethiopians. The poet mentions also the Arimi,

whom Poseidonius says are meant here, and not a place in

Syria or Cilicia, or any other country, but Syria itself. For

the Aramæi lived there. Perhaps these are the people whom

the Greeks called Arimæi or Arimi. But the alterations of

names, especially of barbarous nations, are frequent, Thus

Darius was called Darieces; Parysatis, Pharziris; Athara,

Atargata, whom Ctesias again calls Derceto.<note anchored="yes">This subject was discussed in b. i. c. ii. § 34.</note>
</p><p>Alexander might be adduced to bear witness to the wealth

of the Arabians, for he intended, it is said, after his return

from India, to make Arabia the seat of empire. All his

enterprises terminated with his death, which happened suddenly; but certainly one of his projects was to try whether

the Arabians would receive him voluntarily, or resist him by

force of arms; for having found that they did not send ambassadors to him, either before or after his expedition to India,

he was beginning to make preparations for war, as we have

said in a former part of this work.

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>

<milestone n="1" unit="section"/><p>WHEN we were describing Arabia, we included in the

description the gulfs which compress and make it a peninsula,

namely the Gulfs of Arabia and of Persis. We described at

the same time some parts of Egypt, and those of Ethiopia,

inhabited by the Troglodytæ, and by the people situated next

to them, extending to the confines of the Cinnamon country.<note anchored="yes">B. xvi. c. iv, § 2 and § 14.</note>
</p><p>We are now to describe the remaining parts contiguous to

these nations, and situated about the Nile. We shall then

give an account of Africa, which remains to complete this

treatise on Geography.
</p><p><milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And here we must previously adduce the opinions of Eratosthenes.

He says, that the Nile is distant from the Arabian Gulf

towards the west 1000 stadia, and that it resembles (in its

course) the letter N reversed. For after flowing, he says,

about 2700 stadia from Meroë towards the north, it turns

again to the south, and to the winter sunset, continuing its

course for about 3700 stadia, when it is almost in the latitude

of the places about Meroë. Then entering far into Africa,

and having made another bend, it flows towards the north,

a distance of 5300 stadia, to the great cataract;<note anchored="yes">Genadil.</note> and inclining

a little to the east, traverses a distance of <date value="1200">1200</date> stadia to the

smaller cataract at Syene,<note anchored="yes">Assouan.</note> and 5300 stadia more to the sea.<note anchored="yes">Thus Eratosthenes calculated, in following the windings of the Nile,

12,900 stadia, which is 7900 stadia more than he calculated in a straight

line, as he made the distance between the same points (Meroë and Syene,

i. ii. c. v. § 7) to be 5000 stadia. M. Falconer suspects that there is an error in the text; but the error lies further off. I believe that it is attributable to Eratosthenes himself, and that that geographer did nothing more

than convert the days' marches into stadia. According to Pliny, Timosthenes, commander of the fleet of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and consequently

anterior to Eratosthenes, said that from Syene to Meroë was a march of

60 days ; and this statement agrees tolerably well with that of Herodotus,

who calculated 56 days' march between Elephantina and Meroë, besides a

small distance the extent of which he does not state.

<p>Procopius, a learned writer, estimates a day's march at 210 stadia; and

the employment of this value, in the whole course of his history, proves

that it was generally adopted. Now, if we multiply 60 by 210, we shall

have 12,600 stadia, and dividing 12,900 by 60, we have 215 stadia, or

nearly the amount of a day's march according to Procopius. I am therefore of opinion that Eratosthenes did nothing more than multiply 210 or

215 by the number of 60 days, furnished by Timosthenes ; and as the excessive length of 12,900 stadia could not agree with the 5000 stadia, which

he had calculated in a straight line for the same interval, he imagined this

great difference arose from the excessive winding course of the Nile;

consequently he supposed the Nile to change frequently the direction of

its course.
</p><p>This opinion had its influence in the construction of Ptolemy's map,

which presents to us nearly all the inflexions which Eratosthenes imagined; in calculating the intervals of positions assigned by Ptolemy along

the river, we find a total of <date value="1260">1260</date> minutes; and adding about 1/6 for the

small windings, we have a total of <date value="1470">1470</date> minutes, which are equal to

12,400 stadia of the module (700 to the degree) adopted by that geographer.
</p><p>According to this hypothesis, the distance in Strabo will be thus divided:

Setting out from Meroë, the Nile runs,

<table>
<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"></cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">days.</cell></row>

<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"></cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">61ċ1</cell></row></table>

which nearly corresponds with the account of Timosthenes. The number of days corresponds tolerably well with the distance given by the explorers sent by Nero for the discovery of Meroë: they reported the distance to be 873 miles. If we divide this number by 60, we shall have for

the day's mean march 14ċ55 Roman miles, or 11ċ64 geographical miles,

which is in fact the day's mean march, according to Major Rennell. <emph rend="ital">Letronne.</emph>
</p><p>In carefully measuring, upon a large map of Egypt in 47 sheets, the

course of the Nile through all its windings, and with the compass opened

to 1000 metres, I find—

<table>
<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"></cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">metres.</cell></row>
<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">From the middle of Syene to Luxor in the ancient territory of Thebes</cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">218,900</cell></row>

<row role="data"><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"></cell><cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1">1,180,400</cell></row></table>

This measure reduced to mean degrees of the earth equals 637°25′, and

represents 5312 stadia of 500 (to the degree). I certainly did not expect

to find such an agreement between the new and the ancient measures.

The periodic rising of the Nile, I think, must have produced, since the

time of Eratosthenes, some partial changes in the windings of the river;

but we must acknowledge that these changes, for greater or for less, compensate one another on the whole.
</p><p>We observe, moreover, as I have already often observed, that the use

of the stadium of 500 to the degree is anterior to the Alexandrine school;

for at the time of Eratosthenes the stadium of 700 was more particularly

made use of in Egypt. <emph rend="ital">Gossellin.</emph></p></note>

along the eastern side of the island. The other is the Astapus, or, as some call it, Astasobas. But the Astapus<note anchored="yes">Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue river.</note> is said

to be another river, which issues out of some lakes on the south,

and that this river forms nearly the body of the (stream of

the) Nile, which flows in a straight line, and that it is filled by

the summer rains; that above the confluence of the Astaboras and the Nile, at the distance of 700 stadia, is Meroë,

a city having the same name as the island; and that there

is another island above Meroë, occupied by the fugitive

Egyptians, who revolted in the time of Psammitichus,<note anchored="yes">See b. xvi. c. iv. § 8, and Herod. ii. 30, who calls the Sembritæ, Automoloi, that is, persons who had voluntarily quitted their abode.</note> and

are called Sembritæ, or foreigners. Their sovereign is a

queen, but they obey the king of Meroë.
</p><p>The lower parts of the country on each side Meroë, along

the Nile towards the Red Sea, are occupied by Megabari and

Blemmyes, who are subject to the Ethiopians, and border

upon the Egyptians; about the sea are Troglodytæ. The

Troglodytæ, in the latitude of Meroë, are distant ten or twelve

days' journey from the Nile. On the left of the course of the

Nile live Nubæ in Libya, a populous nation. They begin



<pb n="220"/>



from Meroë, and extend as far as the bends (of the river).

They are not subject to the Ethiopians, but live independently,

being distributed into several sovereignties.
</p><p>The extent of Egypt along the sea, from the Pelusiac to the

Canobic mouth, is <date value="1300">1300</date> stadia.
</p><p>Such is the account of Eratosthenes.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We must, however, enter into a further detail of particulars. And first, we must speak of the parts about Egypt,

proceeding from those that are better known to those which

follow next in order.
</p><p>The Nile produces some common effects in this and the

contiguous tract of country, namely, that of the Ethiopians

above it, in watering them at the time of its rise, and leaving

those parts only habitable which have been covered by the

inundation; it intersects the higher lands, and all the tract

elevated above its current on both sides, which however are

uninhabited and a desert, from an absolute want of water.

But the Nile does not traverse the whole of Ethiopia, nor

alone, nor in a straight line, nor a country which is well inhabited. But Egypt it traverses both alone and entirely,

and in a straight line, from the lesser cataract above Syene

and Elephantina, (which are the boundaries of Egypt and

Ethiopia,) to the mouths by which it discharges itself into the

sea. The Ethiopians at present lead for the most part a

wandering life, and are destitute of the means of subsistence,

on account of the barrenness of the soil, the disadvantages of

climate, and their great distance from us.
</p><p>Now the contrary is the case with the Egyptians in all

these respects. For they have lived from the first under a

regular form of government, they were a people of civilized

manners, and were settled in a well-known country; their

institutions have been recorded and mentioned in terms of

praise, for they seemed to have availed themselves of the

fertility of their country in the best possible manner by the

partition of it (and by the classification of persons) which they

adopted, and by their general care.
</p><p>When they had appointed a king, they divided the people

into three classes, into soldiers, husbandmen, and priests. The

latter had the care of everything relating to sacred things (of

the gods), the others of what related to man; some had the



<pb n="221"/>



management of warlike affairs, others attended to the concerns

of peace, the cultivation of the ground, and the practice of the

arts, from which the king derived his revenue.
</p><p>The priests devoted themselves to the study of philosophy

and astronomy, and were companions of the kings.
</p><p>The country was at first divided into nomes.<note anchored="yes">The Nile valley was parcelled out into a number of cantons, varying

in size and number. Each of these cantons was called a nome (<foreign lang="greek">nomo\s</foreign>) by

the Greeks, <q direct="unspecified">præfectura oppidorum</q> by the Romans. Each had its

civil governor, the Nomarch, who collected the crown revenues, and presided in the local capital and chief court of justice. Each nome too had

its separate priesthood, its temple, chief and inferior towns, its magistrates, registration and peculiar creed, ceremonies and customs; and each

was apparently independent of every other nome. At certain seasons,

delegates from the various cantons met in the palace of the Labyrinth, for

consultation on public affairs (b. xvii. c. i. § 37). According to Diodorus,

the nomes date from Sesostris. But they did not originate from that

monarch, but emanated probably from the distinctions of animal worship;

and the extent of the local worship probably determined the boundary of

the nome. Thus in the nome of Thebais, where the ram-headed deity

was worshipped, the sheep was sacred, the goat was eaten and sacrificed:

in that of Mendes, where the goat was worshipped, the sheep was a

victim and an article of food. Again, in the nome of Ombos, divine honours were paid to the crocodile: in that of Tentyra, it was hunted and

abominated: and between Ombos and Tentyra there existed an internecine feud.

<quote><l>Ardet adhuc Ombos et Tentyra: summus utrinque
</l><l>Inde furor vulgo, quod numina vicinorum
</l><l>Odit uterque locus, cum solos credat habendos
</l><l>Esse deos, quos ipse colit. Juv. xv. 35.</l></quote>

<p>The extent and number of the nomes cannot be ascertained. They

probably varied with the political state of Egypt. See <emph rend="ital">Smith,</emph> art.

Ægyptus.</p></note> The

Thebaïs contained ten, the Delta ten, and the intermediate

tract sixteen. But according to some writers, all the nomes

together amounted to the number of chambers in the Labyrinth.

Now these were less than thirty [six]. The nomes were again

divided into other sections. The greater number of the

nomes were distributed into toparchies, and these again

into other sections ; the smallest portions were the arouræ.
</p><p>An exact and minute division of the country was required

by the frequent confusion of boundaries occasioned at the

time of the rise of the Nile, which takes away, adds, and

alters the various shapes of the bounds, and obliterates other

marks by which the property of one person is distinguished



<pb n="222"/>



from that of another. It was consequently necessary to

measure the land repeatedly. Hence it is said geometry

originated here, as the art of keeping accounts and arithmetic

originated with the Phœnicians, in consequence of their

commerce.<note anchored="yes">See b. xvi. c. ii. § 24.</note>
</p><p>As the whole population of the country, so the separate

population in each nome, was divided into three classes ; the

territory also was divided into three equal portions.
</p><p>The attention and care bestowed upon the Nile is so great

as to cause industry to triumph over nature. The ground

by nature, and still more by being supplied with water, produces a great abundance of fruits. By nature also a greater

rise of the river irrigates a larger tract of land; but industry has completely succeeded in rectifying the deficiency of nature, so that in seasons when the rise of the river

has been less than usual, as large a portion of the country

is irrigated by means of canals and embankments, as in

seasons when the rise of the river has been greater.
</p><p>Before the times of Petronius there was the greatest plenty,

and the rise of the river was the greatest when it rose to the

height of fourteen cubits; but when it rose to eight only, a famine

ensued. During the government of Petronius, however, when

the Nile rose twelve cubits only, there was a most abundant

crop; and once when it mounted to eight only, no famine followed. Such then is the nature of this provision for the

physical state of the country. We shall now proceed to the

next particulars.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Nile, when it leaves the boundaries of Ethiopia,

flows in a straight line towards the north, to the tract called

the Delta, then <q direct="unspecified">cloven at the head,</q> (according to the expression of Plato,) makes this point the vertex, as it were, of a

triangle, the sides of which are formed by the streams, which

separate on each side, and extend to the sea, one on the right

hand to Pelusium, the other on the left to Canobus and the

neighbouring Heracleium, as it is called ; the base is the coast

lying between Pelusium and the Heracleium.
</p><p>An island was therefore formed by the sea and by both

streams of the river, which is called Delta from the resemblance of its shape to the letter (<foreign lang="greek">D</foreign>) of that name. The spot at the

vertex of the triangle has the same appellation, because it is



<pb n="223"/>



the beginning of the above-mentioned triangular figure. The

village, also, situated upon it is called Delta.
</p><p>These then are two mouths of the Nile, one of which is

called the Pelusiac, the other the Canobic and Heracleiotic

mouth. Between these are five other outlets, some of which

are considerable, but the greater part are of inferior importance. For many others branch off from the principal streams,

and are distributed over the whole of the island of the Delta,

and form many streams and islands; so that the whole Delta

is accessible to boats, one canal succeeding another, and navigated with so much ease, that some persons make use of

rafts<note anchored="yes">In the text <foreign lang="greek">o)stra/kina poo|qmei=a</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">earthen-ware ferry boats.</q> The

place.
</p><p>The whole island is about 3000 stadia in circumference,

and is called, as also the lower country, with the land on the

opposite sides of the streams, the Delta.
</p><p>But at the time of the rising of the Nile, the whole country

is covered, and resembles a sea, except the inhabited spots,

which are situated upon natural hills or mounds ; and considerable cities and villages appear like islands in the distant

prospect.
</p><p>The water, after having continued on the ground more than

forty days in summer, then subsides by degrees, in the same

manner as it rose. In sixty days the plain is entirely exposed

to view, and dries up. The sooner the land is dry, so much

the sooner the ploughing and sowing are accomplished, and

it dries earlier in those parts where the heat is greater.
</p><p>The country above the Delta is irrigated in the same manner, except that the river flows in a straight line to the distance

of about 4000 stadia in one channel, unless where some island

intervenes, the most considerable of which comprises the

Heracleiotic Nome; or, where it is diverted by a canal into

a large lake, or a tract of country which it is capable of

irrigating, as the lake Mœris and the Arsinoïte Nome, or

where the canals discharge themselves into the Mareotis.



<pb n="224"/>


</p><p>In short, Egypt, from the mountains of Ethiopia to the

vertex of the Delta, is merely a river tract on each side of the

Nile, and rarely if anywhere comprehends in one continued

line a habitable territory of 300 stadia in breadth. It resembles, except the frequent diversions of its course, a bandage

rolled out.<note anchored="yes">In the text <foreign lang="greek">keio|i/a| yuxome/nh| e)pi\ mh=ko,</foreign> which is evidently corrupt.

</p><p>The mountains on each side (of the Nile), which descend

from the parts about Syene to the Egyptian Sea,<note anchored="yes">The Mediterranean.</note> give this

shape to the river tract of which I am speaking, and to the

country. For in proportion as these mountains extend along

that tract, or recede from each other, in the same degree is

the river contracted or expanded, and they impart to the

habitable country its variety of shape. But the country beyond the mountains is in a great measure uninhabited.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The ancients understood more by conjecture than otherwise, but persons in later times learnt by experience as eyewitnesses, that the Nile owes its rise to summer rains, which fall in

great abundance in Upper Ethiopia, particularly in the most distant mountains. On the rains ceasing, the fulness of the river

gradually subsides. This was particularly observed by those

who navigated the Arabian Gulf on their way to the Cinnamon

country, and by those who were sent out to hunt elephants, or

for such other purposes as induced the Ptolemies, kings of

Egypt, to despatch persons in that direction. These sovereigns

had directed their attention to objects of this kind, particularly Ptolemy surnamed Philadelphus, who was a lover of

science, and on account of bodily infirmities always in search

of some new diversion and amusement. But the ancient

kings paid little attention to such inquiries, although both

they and the priests, with whom they passed the greater part

of their lives, professed to be devoted to the study of philosophy. Their ignorance therefore is more surprising, both

on this account and because Sesostris had traversed the whole

of Ethiopia as far as the Cinnamon country, of which expedition monuments exist even to the present day, such as pillars

and inscriptions. Cambyses also, when he was in possession of

Egypt, had advanced with the Egyptians as far even as



<pb n="225"/>



Meroë; and it is said that he gave this name both to the

island and to the city, because his sister, or according to some

writers his wife, Meroë died there. For this reason therefore

he conferred the appellation on the island, and in honour of a

woman. It is surprising how, with such opportunities of obtaining information, the history of these rains should not have

been clearly known to persons living in those times, especially

as the priests registered with the greatest diligence in the sacred

books all extraordinary facts, and preserved records of everything which seemed to contribute to an increase of knowledge. And, if this had been the case, would it be necessary

to inquire what is even still a question, what can possibly be

the reason why rain falls in summer, and not in winter, in

the most southerly parts of the country, but not in the Thebaïs,

nor in the country about Syene ? nor should we have to examine whether the rise of the water of the Nile is occasioned

by rains, nor require such evidence for these facts as Poseidonius adduces. For he says, that Callisthenes asserts that

the cause of the rise of the river is the rain of summer. This

he borrows from Aristotle, who borrowed it from Thrasyalces

the Thasian (one of the ancient writers on physics), Thrasyalces from some other person, and he from Homer, who

calls the Nile <q direct="unspecified">heaven-descended:</q>

<quote><q direct="unspecified">back to Egypt's heaven-descended stream.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. iv. 581.</note></quote>

But I quit this subject, since it has been discussed by many

writers, among whom it will be sufficient to specify two, who

have (each) composed in our times a treatise on the Nile,

Eudorus and Aristo the Peripatetic philosopher. [They differ

little from each other] except in the order and disposition of

the works, for the phraseology and execution is the same in both

writers. (I can speak with some confidence in this matter), for

when at a loss (for manuscripts) for the purpose of comparison

and copy, I collated both authors.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ gouu=n a)poo|u/menos a)ntigo|a/fwn ei)s th\n a)ntibolh\n e)k qate/o|ou qa/teron a)nte/balon.</foreign> Casaubon, who narrates a similar circumstance

which occurred to himself, thus explains the passage: Our author, being

in want of codices to correct imperfections in his own, and to form a complete copy, availed himself of another author whose account was identical,

being either, as he says, the original or a transcript from the first.</note> But which of them surreptitiously substituted the other's account as his own, we may



<pb n="226"/>



go to the temple of Ammon to be informed. Eudorus accused Aristo, but the style is more like that of Aristo.
</p><p>The ancients gave the name of Egypt to that country only

which was inhabited and watered by the Nile, and the extent

they assigned to it was from the neighbourhood of Syene to

the sea. But later writers, to the present time, have included

on the eastern side almost all the tract between the Arabian

Gulf and the Nile (the Æthiopians however do not make

much use of the Red Sea); on the western side, the tract extending to the Auases and the parts of the sea-coast from the

Canobic mouth of the Nile to Catabathmus, and the kingdom

of Cyrenæa. For the kings who succeeded the race of the

Ptolemies had acquired so much power, that they became

masters of Cyrenæa, and even joined Cyprus to Egypt. The

Romans, who succeeded to their dominions, separated Egypt,

and confined it within the old limits.
</p><p>The Egyptians give the name of Auases (Oases) to certain

inhabited tracts, which are surrounded by extensive deserts,

and appear like islands in the sea. They are frequently met

with in Libya, and there are three contiguous to Egypt, and

dependent upon it.
</p><p>This is the account which we have to give of Egypt in

general and summarily. I shall now describe the separate

parts of the country and their advantages.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/></p>
<p>As Alexandreia and its neighbourhood occupy the

greatest and principal portion of the description, I shall begin

with it.
</p><p>In sailing towards the west, the sea-coast from Pelusium

to the Canobic mouth of the Nile is about <date value="1300">1300</date> stadia in extent, and constitutes, as we have said, the base of the Delta.

Thence to the island Pharos are 150 stadia more.
</p><p>Pharos is a small oblong island, and lies quite close to the

continent, forming towards it a harbour with a double entrance.

For the coast abounds with bays, and has two promontories

projecting into the sea. The island is situated between these,

and shuts in the bay, lying lengthways in front of it.
</p><p>Of the extremities of the Pharos, the eastern is nearest to

the continent and to the promontory in that direction, called

Lochias, which is the cause of the entrance to the port being

narrow. Besides the narrowness of the passage, there are

rocks, some under water, others rising above it, which at all

times increase the violence of the waves rolling in upon them



<pb n="227"/>



from the open sea. This extremity itself of the island is a

rock, washed by the sea on all sides, with a tower upon it of

the same name as the island, admirably constructed of white

marble, with several stories. Sostratus of Cnidus, a friend of

the kings, erected it for the safety of mariners, as the inscription imports.<note anchored="yes">The words <q direct="unspecified">Sostratus of Cnidus, son of Dexiphanes, to the gods preservers,</q> are rejected by Kramer as being introduced from the margin.</note> For as the coast on each side is low and

without harbours, with reefs and shallows, an elevated and

conspicuous mark was required to enable navigators coming

in from the open sea to direct their course exactly to the

entrance of the harbour.
</p><p>The western mouth does not afford an easy entrance, but

it does not require the same degree of caution as the other.

It forms also another port, which has the name of Eunostus, or

Happy Return: it lies in front of the artificial and close

harbour. That which has its entrance at the above-mentioned tower of Pharos is the great harbour. These (two)

lie contiguous in the recess called Heptastadium, and are

separated from it by a mound. This mound forms a bridge

from the continent to the island, and extends along its western

side, leaving two passages only through it to the harbour of

Eunostus, which are bridged over. But this work served

not only as a bridge, but as an aqueduct also, when the island

was inhabited. Divus Cæsar devastated the island, in his

war against the people of Alexandreia, when they espoused

the party of the kings. A few sailors live near the tower.
</p><p>The great harbour, in addition to its being well enclosed

by the mound and by nature, is of sufficient depth near the

shore to allow the largest vessel to anchor near the stairs. It

is also divided into several ports.
</p><p>The former kings of Egypt, satisfied with what they possessed, and not desirous of foreign commerce, entertained a

dislike to all mariners, especially the Greeks (who, on account

of the poverty of their own country, ravaged and coveted the

property of other nations), and stationed a guard here, who

had orders to keep off all persons who approached. To the

guard was assigned as a place of residence the spot called

Rhacotis, which is now a part of the city of Alexandreia,

situated above the arsenal. At that time, however, it was a

village. The country about the village was given up to herds-



<pb n="228"/>



men, who were also able (from their numbers) to prevent

strangers from entering the country.
</p><p>When Alexander arrived, and perceived the advantages of

the situation, he determined to build the city on the (natural)

harbour. The prosperity of the place, which ensued, was intimated, it is said, by a presage which occurred while the

plan of the city was tracing. The architects were engaged in

marking out the line of the wall with chalk, and had consumed

it all, when the king arrived; upon which the dispensers of

flour supplied the workmen with a part of the flour, which

was provided for their own use; and this substance was used

in tracing the greater part of the divisions of the streets.

This, they said, was a good omen for the city.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The advantages of the city are of various kinds. The

site is washed by two seas; on the north, by what is called the

Egyptian Sea, and on the south, by the sea of the lake Mareia,

which is also called Mareotis. This lake is filled by many

canals from the Nile, both by those above and those at the

sides, through which a greater quantity of merchandise is

imported than by those communicating with the sea. Hence

the harbour on the lake is richer than the maritime harbour.

The exports by sea from Alexandreia exceed the imports.

This any person may ascertain, either at Alexandreia or

Dicæarchia, by watching the arrival and departure of the

merchant vessels, and observing how much heavier or lighter

their cargoes are when they depart or when they return.
</p><p>In addition to the wealth derived from merchandise landed

at the harbours on each side, on the sea and on the lake, its

fine air is worthy of remark: this results from the city being

on two sides surrounded by water, and from the favourable

effects of the rise of the Nile. For other cities, situated near

lakes, have, during the heats of summer, a heavy and suffocating atmosphere, and lakes at their margins become swampy

by the evaporation occasioned by the sun's heat. When a

large quantity of moisture is exhaled from swamps, a noxious

vapour rises, and is the cause of pestilential disorders. But

at Alexandreia, at the beginning of summer, the Nile, being

full, fills the lake also, and leaves no marshy matter which is

likely to occasion malignant exhalations. At the same period,

the Etesian winds blow from the north, over a large expanse

of sea, and the Alexandrines in consequence pass their summer very pleasantly.



<pb n="229"/>



<milestone n="8" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The shape of the site of the city is that of a chlamys or

military cloak. The sides, which determine the length, are

surrounded by water, and are about thirty stadia in extent;

but the isthmuses, which determine the breadth of the sides,

are each of seven or eight stadia, bounded on one side by the

sea, and on the other by the lake. The whole city is intersected by roads for the passage of horsemen and chariots.

Two of these are very broad, exceeding a plethrum in breadth,

and cut one another at right angles. It contains also very

beautiful public grounds and royal palaces, which occupy a

fourth or even a third part of its whole extent. For as each

of the kings was desirous of adding some embellishment to

the places dedicated to the public use, so, besides the buildings already existing, each of them erected a building at his

own expense; hence the expression of the poet may be here

applied,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">one after the other springs.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. xvii. 266.</note></quote>

All the buildings are connected with one another and with

the harbour, and those also which are beyond it.
</p><p>The Museum is a part of the palaces. It has a public

walk and a place furnished with seats, and a large hall, in

which the men of learning, who belong to the Museum, take

their common meal. This community possesses also property

in common; and a priest, formerly appointed by the kings,

but at present by Cæsar, presides over the Museum.
</p><p>A part belonging to the palaces consists of that called

Sema, an enclosure, which contained the tombs of the kings

and that of Alexander (the Great). For Ptolemy the son of

Lagus took away the body of Alexander from Perdiccas, as

he was conveying it down from Babylon; for Perdiccas had

turned out of his road towards Egypt, incited by ambition

and a desire of making himself master of the country. When

Ptolemy had attacked [and made him prisoner], he intended

to [spare his life and] confine him in a desert island, but

he met with a miserable end at the hand of his own soldiers,

who rushed upon and despatched him by transfixing him with

the long Macedonian spears. The kings who were with him,

Aridæus, and the children of Alexander, and Roxana his

wife, departed to Macedonia. Ptolemy carried away the body



<pb n="230"/>



of Alexander, and deposited it at Alexandreia in the place

where it now lies; not indeed in the same coffin, for the present one is of hyalus (alabaster ?) whereas Ptolemy had deposited it in one of gold: it was plundered by Ptolemy surnamed

Cocce's son and Pareisactus, who came from Syria and was

quickly deposed, so that his plunder was of no service to him.

<milestone n="9" unit="section"/></p>
<p>In the great harbour at the entrance, on the right hand,

are the island and the Pharos tower; on the left are the reef

of rocks and the promontory Lochias, with a palace upon it:

at the entrance, on the left hand, are the inner palaces, which

are continuous with those on the Lochias, and contain numerous painted apartments and groves. Below lies the artificial

and close harbour, appropriated to the use of the kings; and

Antirrhodus a small island, facing the artificial harbour,

with a palace on it, and a small port. It was called Antirrhodus, a rival as it were of Rhodes.
</p><p>Above this is the theatre, then the Poseidium, a kind of

elbow projecting from the Emporium, as it is called, with a

temple of Neptune upon it. To this Antony added a mound,

projecting still further into the middle of the harbour, and

built at the extremity a royal mansion, which he called

Timonium. This was his last act, when, deserted by his

partisans, he retired to Alexandreia after his defeat at Actium, and intended, being forsaken by so many friends, to lead

the [solitary] life of Timon for the rest of his days.
</p><p>Next are the Cæsarium, the Emporium, and the Apostaseis, or magazines: these are followed by docks, extending

to the Heptastadium. This is the description of the great

harbour.

<milestone n="10" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Next after the Heptastadium is the harbour of Eunostus, and above this the artificial harbour, called Cibotus (or

the Ark), which also has docks. At the bottom of this harbour is a navigable canal, extending to the lake Mareotis.

Beyond the canal there still remains a small part of the city.

Then follows the suburb Necropolis, in which are numerous

gardens, burial-places, and buildings for carrying on the process of embalming the dead.
</p><p>On this side the canal is the Sarapium and other ancient

sacred places, which are now abandoned on account of the

erection of the temples at Nicopolis; for [there are situated]

an amphitheatre and a stadium, and there are celebrated



<pb n="231"/>



quinquennial games; but the ancient rites and customs are

neglected.
</p><p>In short, the city of Alexandreia abounds with public and

sacred buildings. The most beautiful of the former is the

Gymnasium, with porticos exceeding a stadium in extent. In

the middle of it are the court of justice and groves. Here

also is a Paneium, an artificial mound of the shape of a fir-cone, resembling a pile of rock, to the top of which there is

an ascent by a spiral path. From the summit may be seen

the whole city lying all around and beneath it.
</p><p>The wide street extends in length along the Gymnasium

from the Necropolis to the Canobic gate. Next is the Hippodromos (or race-course), as it is called, and other buildings<note anchored="yes">Some word, such as <foreign lang="greek">katoiki/ai,</foreign> seems here to be wanting; <foreign lang="greek">o/doi\,</foreign> which

near it, and reaching to the Canobic canal. After passing

through the Hippodromos is the Nicopolis, which contains

buildings fronting the sea not less numerous than a city. It is

30 stadia distant from Alexandreia. Augustus Cæsar distinguished this place, because it was here that he defeated Antony

and his party of adherents. He took the city at the first onset,

and compelled Antony to put himself to death, but Cleopatra to

surrender herself alive. A short time afterwards, however,

she also put an end to her life secretly, in prison, by the bite

of an asp, or (for there are two accounts) by the application

of a poisonous ointment. Thus the empire of the Lagidæ,

which had subsisted many years, was dissolved.

brother, the second Euergetes, who was also called Physcon.

He was succeeded by Ptolemy surnamed Lathurus, Lathurus

by Auletes of our time, who was the father of Cleopatra. All

these kings, after the third Ptolemy, were corrupted by luxury and effeminacy, and the affairs of government were very

badly administered by them; but worst of all by the fourth,

who, besides other deeds of shamelessness, acted the piper;

indeed he gloried so much in the practice, that he scrupled

not to appoint trials of skill in his palace; on which occasions he presented himself as a competitor with other rivals.

He was deposed by the Alexandrines; and of his three daughters, one, the eldest, who was legitimate, they proclaimed

queen; but his two sons, who were infants, were absolutely

excluded from the succession.
</p><p>As a husband for the daughter established on the throne,

the Alexandrines invited one Cybiosactes from Syria, who

pretended to be descended from the Syrian kings. The queen

after a few days, unable to endure his coarseness and vulgarity, rid herself of him by causing him to be strangled. She

afterwards married Archelaus, who also pretended to be the

son of Mithridates Eupator, but he was really the son of that

Archelaus<note anchored="yes">The celebrated general of Mithridates.</note> who carried on war against Sylla, and was afterwards honourably treated by the Romans. He was grandfather of the last king of Cappadocia in our time, and priest

</p><p>It was about this time that Pompey the Great, in his flight

He was treacherously slain by the king's party. When Cæsar

arrived, he put the young prince to death, and sending for

Cleopatra from her place of exile, appointed her queen of

Egypt, declaring also her surviving brother, who was very

young, and herself joint sovereigns.
</p><p>After the death of Cæsar and the battle at Pharsalia, Antony passed over into Asia; he raised Cleopatra to the highest

dignity, made her his wife, and had children by her. He

was present with her at the battle of Actium, and accompanied her in her flight. Augustus Cæsar pursued them, put

an end to their power, and rescued Egypt from misgovernment and revelry.

<p>At present Egypt is a (Roman) province, pays considerable tribute, and is well governed by prudent persons, who

are sent there in succession. The governor thus sent out has

the rank of king. Subordinate to him is the administrator of

justice, who is the supreme judge in many causes. There is

another officer, who is called Idiologus, whose business it is to

inquire into property for which there is no claimant, and

which of right falls to Cæsar. These are accompanied by

Cæsar's freedmen and stewards, who are intrusted with affairs

of more or less importance.
</p><p>Three legions are stationed in Egypt, one in the city, the

rest in the country. Besides these there are also nine Roman

cohorts, three quartered in the city, three on the borders of

Ethiopia in Syene, as a guard to that tract, and three in other

parts of the country. There are also three bodies of cavalry

distributed in convenient posts.
</p><p>Of the native magistrates in the cities, the first is the expounder of the law, who is dressed in scarlet; he receives the

customary honours of the country, and has the care of providing what is necessary for the city. The second is the writer of

records, the third is the chief judge. The fourth is the commander of the night guard. These magistrates existed in the

time of the kings, but in consequence of the bad administration

of affairs by the latter, the prosperity of the city was ruined by

licentiousness. Polybius expresses his indignation at the state

of things when lie was there: he describes the inhabitants of

the city to be composed of three classes; the (first) Egyptians

and natives, acute but indifferent citizens, and meddling with

civil affairs. Tile second, the mercenaries, a numerous and undisciplined body ; for it was an ancient custom to maintain

foreign soldiers, who, from the worthlessness of their sovereigns,

knew better how to govern than to obey. The third were

the Alexandrines, who, for the same reason, were not orderly

citizens;<note anchored="yes">I have adopted the reading, <foreign lang="greek">a)politiko\n,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">not understanding or ill-adapted for the duties of citizens,</q> suggested by Kramer.</note> but still they were better than the mercenaries, for

although they were a mixed race, yet being of Greek origin,

they retained the customs common to the Greeks. But this

class was extinct nearly about the time of Euergetes Physcon,

in whose reign Polybius came to Alexandreia. For Physcon,

being distressed by factions, frequently exposed the multitude

to the attacks of the soldiery, and thus destroyed them. By

such a state of things in the city the words of the poet

(says Polybius) were verified:

<quote><q direct="unspecified">The way to Egypt is long and vexatious.</q><note anchored="yes">Od. iv. 481.</note></quote>

<milestone n="13" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Such then, if not worse, was the condition of the city

under the last kings. The Romans, as far as they were able,

corrected, as I have said, many abuses, and established an

orderly government, by appointing vice-governors, nomarchs,

and ethnarchs, whose business it was to superintend affairs

of minor importance.
</p><p>The greatest advantage which the city possesses arises from

its being the only place in all Egypt well situated by nature

for communication with the sea by its excellent harbour, and

with the land by the river, by means of which everything is

easily transported and collected together into this city, which

is the greatest mart in the habitable world.
</p><p>These may be said to be the superior excellencies of the

city. Cicero, in one of his orations,<note anchored="yes">No longer existing.</note> in speaking of the revenues of Egypt, states that an annual tribute of 12,500 talents

was paid to (Ptolemy) Auletes, the father of Cleopatra. If

then a king, who administered his government in the worst

possible manner, and with the greatest negligence, obtained

so large a revenue, what must we suppose it to be at present,

when affairs are administered with great care, and when the

commerce with India and with Troglodytica has been so

greatly increased ? For formerly not even twenty vessels

ventured to navigate the Arabian Gulf, or advance to the

smallest distance beyond the straits at its mouth; but now

large fleets are despatched as far as India and the extremities

of Ethiopia, from which places the most valuable freights are

brought to Egypt, and are thence exported to other parts, so

that a double amount of custom is collected, arising from imports on the one hand, and from exports on the other. The

most expensive description of goods is charged with the heaviest

impost; for in fact Alexandreia has a monopoly of trade, and is

almost the only receptacle for this kind of merchandise and

place of supply for foreigners. The natural convenience of

the situation is still more apparent to persons travelling through

the country, and particularly along the coast which commences at the Catabathmus; for to this place Egypt extends.

The stalks of the bean are nearly of equal height, and grow to

the length of ten feet. The byblus is a bare stem, with a tuft

on the top. But the bean puts out leaves and flowers in many

parts, and bears a fruit similar to our bean, differing only in

size and taste. The bean-grounds present an agreeable sight,

and afford amusement to those who are disposed to recreate

themselves with convivial feasts. These entertainments take

place in boats with cabins; they enter the thickest part of the

plantation, where they are overshadowed with the leaves,

which are very large, and serve for drinking-cups and dishes,

having a hollow which fits them for the purpose. They are

found in great abundance in the shops in Alexandreia, where

they are used as vessels. One of the sources of land revenue

is the sale of these leaves. Such then is the nature of this

bean.

sleep there themselves on their own account, or others for

them. Some persons record the cures, and others the veracity of the oracles which are delivered there. But remarkable above everything else is the multitude of persons who

resort to the public festivals, and come from Alexandreia by

the canal. For day and night there are crowds of men and

women in boats, singing and dancing, without restraint, and

the Nile. The site of the ancient city is determined not only by the appellation of the modern town Sa-el-Hadjar, which occupies a portion of

its area, but also by mounds of ruin corresponding in extent to the importance of Sais, at least, under the later Pharaohs. The city was artificially raised high above the level of the Delta to be out of the reach of

the inundations of the Nile, and served as a landmark to all who ascended

the arms of the river, from the Mediterranean to Memphis. Its ruins

have been very imperfectly explored, yet traces have been found of the

lake on which the mysteries of Isis were performed, as well as of the temple of Neith (Athene) and the necropolis of the Saïte kings. The wall of

unburnt brick which surrounded the principal buildings of the city was

70 feet thick, and probably, therefore, at least 100 feet high. It enclosed

an area 2325 feet in length by <date value="1960">1960</date> in breadth. Beyond this enclosure

were also two large cemeteries, one for the citizens generally, and the

other reserved for the nobles and priests of the higher orders.

<p>Saïs was one of the sacred cities of Egypt: its principal deities were

Neith, who gave oracles there, and Isis. The mysteries of the latter were

celebrated with unusual pomp on the evening of the Feast of Lamps.

Herodotus (ii. 59) terms this festival the third of the great feasts in the

Egyptian calendar. It was held by night; and every one intending to be

present at the sacrifices was required to light a number of lamps in the

open air around his house. At what season of the year the feast of burning lamps was celebrated, Herodotus knew, but deemed it wrong to tell

(ii. 62); it was, however, probably at either the vernal or autumnal

equinox, since it apparently had reference to one of the capital revolutions in the solar course. An inscription, in the temple of Neith, declared her to be the Mother of the Sun. It ran thus, <q direct="unspecified">I am the things

that have been, and that are, and that will be; no one has uncovered my

skirts; the fruit which I brought forth became the Sun.</q> It is probable.

accordingly, that the kindling of the lamps referred to Neith, as the author

of light. On the same night, apparently, were performed what the Egyptians designated as the <q direct="unspecified">Mysteries of Isis.</q> Sais was one of the supposed places of interment of Osiris, for that is evidently the deity whom

of Philæ, which is situated above Syene and Elephantina.

These people tell this tale, that Isis placed coffins of Osiris in

various places, but that one only contained the body of Osiris,

so that no one knew which of them it was; and that she did

this with the intention of concealing it from Typhon,<note anchored="yes">The evil or destroying genius.</note> who

<p>This is the description of the country from Alexandreia to the vertex of the Delta.
</p><p>Artemidorus says, that the navigation up the river is 28

schœni, which amount to 840 stadia, reckoning the schœnus

at 30 stadia. When we ourselves sailed up the river, schoeni

of different measures were used at different places in giving

the distances, so that sometimes the received schœnus was a

measure of 40 stadia and even more. That the measure of

the schœnus was unsettled among the Egyptians, Artemidorus himself shows in a subsequent place. In reckoning the

distance from Memphis to Thebais, he says that each schœnus

consists of 120 stadia, and from the Thebaïs to Syene of 60

stadia. In sailing up from Pelusium to the same vertex of

the Delta, is a distance, he says, of 25 schœni, or 750 stadia,

and he employs the same measure.
</p><p>On setting out from Pelusium, the first canal met with is

that which fills the lakes, <q direct="unspecified">near the marshes,</q> as they are

called. There are two of these lakes, situated upon the left

hand of the great stream above Pelusium in Arabia. He mentions other lakes also, and canals in the same parts beyond

the Delta.
</p><p>The Sethroïte Nome extends along one of the two lakes.

He reckons this as one of the ten nomes in the Delta. There

are two other canals, which discharge themselves into the

same lakes.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is another canal also, which empties itself into

the Red Sea, or Arabian Gulf, near the city Arsinoë, which

some call Cleopatris.<note anchored="yes">Suez.</note> It flows through the Bitter Lakes, as



<pb n="244"/>



they are called, which were bitter formerly, but when the

above-mentioned canal was cut, the bitter quality was altered

by their junction with the river, and at present they contain

excellent fish, and abound with aquatic birds.
</p><p>The canal was first cut by Sesostris before the Trojan

times, but according to other writers, by the son of<note anchored="yes">Pharaoh Necho, under whom and in the execution of the work

120,000 labourers perished. Herod. ii. 158.</note> Psammitichus, who only began the work, and afterwards died; lastly,

Darius the First succeeded to the completion of the undertaking, but he desisted from continuing the work, when it

was nearly finished, influenced by an erroneous opinion that

the level of the Red Sea was higher than Egypt, and that if

the whole of the intervening isthmus were cut through, the

country would be overflowed by the sea. The Ptolemaic

kings however did cut through it, and placed locks upon the

canal,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kleito\n e)poi/hsan to\n Eu)/ripon,</foreign> <q direct="unspecified">closed the Euripus.</q> Diodorus

Siculus, i. 33, thus speaks of this same work. <q direct="unspecified">Darius the Persian left

the canal unfinished, as he was informed by some persons, that by cutting

through the isthmus he would be the cause of inundating Egypt; for

they pointed out to him that the Red Sea was higher than the level of

Egypt. The second Ptolemy afterwards completed the canal, and in the

most convenient part constructed an artfully contrived barrier, (<foreign lang="greek">dia/fo|ahma,</foreign>) which he could open when he liked for the passage of vessels, and

quickly close again, the operation being easily performed.</q>

<p>The immediate communication therefore between the sea and the canal

was cut off by a lock; and as there must have been two, there would be a

flux and reflux of water between them on the passage of vessels. This

probably suggested to our author the word Euripus, and is to be understood as applying to that portion of the canal included between the locks.

By the word Euripus is generally understood the channel between Negropont and the mainland, which is subject to an ebb and flow of the sea.

The storing up of water, and the distribution of it for the purposes of irrigation, was no doubt well known to the Egyptians. Diodorus, b. i. 19,

ascribes to Osiris the invention. "Osiris confined the Nile by embankments on both sides, so that at the period of its rising it might not inconveniently spread over the country, but that, by gates (<foreign lang="greek">dia\ quo|w=n</foreign>) adapted

for the purpose, the stream might be gently discharged as occasion required.</p></note> so that they sailed, when they pleased, without obstruction into the outer sea, and back again [into the canal].

suburbs, many canals, and lakes are also near. There also

is the Phagroriopolite Nome, and the city Phagroriopolis. The

canal, which empties itself into the Red Sea, begins at the

village Phaccusa, to which the village of Philon is contiguous.

The canal is 100 cubits broad, and its depth sufficient to float

a vessel of large burden. These places are near the apex of

the Delta.

<milestone n="27" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There also are the city Bubastus<note anchored="yes">Bubastis or Artemis, Diana. Herod. ii. 59, 67, 137.</note> and the Bubastite

Nome, and above it the Heliopolite Nome. There too is Heliopolis, situated upon a large mound. It contains a temple

of the sun, and the ox Mneyis, which is kept in a sanctuary,

and is regarded by the inhabitants as a god, as Apis is regarded by the people of Memphis. In front of the mound

are lakes, into which the neighbouring canal discharges itself.

At present the city is entirely deserted. It has an ancient

temple constructed after the Egyptian manner, bearing many

proofs of the madness and sacrilegious acts of Cambyses, who

did very great injury to the temples, partly by fire, partly by

violence, mutilating [in some] cases, and applying fire [in

others]. In this manner he injured the obelisks, two of which,

that were not entirely spoilt, were transported to Rome.<note anchored="yes">Among those no doubt now at Rome.</note>

There are others both here and at Thebes, the present Diospolis, some of which are standing, much corroded by fire,

and others lying on the ground.

<milestone n="28" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The plan of the temples is as follows.
</p><p>At the entrance into the temenus is a paved floor, in

breadth about a plethrum, or even less; its length is three

or four times as great, and in some instances even more. This

part is called Dromos, and is mentioned by Callimachus,

<quote><q direct="unspecified">this is the Dromos, sacred to Anubis.</q></quote>

Throughout the whole length on each side are placed stone

sphinxes, at the distance of 20 cubits or a little more from

each other, so that there is one row of sphinxes on the right

hand, and another on the left. Next after the sphinxes is a

large propylon, then on proceeding further, another propylon,

and then another. Neither the number of the propyla nor of

the sphinxes is determined by any rule. They are different

in different temples, as well as the length and breadth of the

Dromi.



<pb n="246"/>


</p><p>Next to the propyla is the naos, which has a large and

considerable pronaos; the sanctuary in proportion; there is no

statue, at least not in human shape, but a representation of

some of the brute animals. On each side of the pronaos project what are called the wings. These are two walls of equal

height with the naos. At first the distance between them is

a little more than the breadth of the foundation of the naos.<note anchored="yes">This description is illustrated by the remains of the great temple at

Philæ, dedicated to Ammon Osiris.</note>

As you proceed onwards, the [base] lines incline towards one

another till they approach within 50 or 60 cubits. These

walls have large sculptured figures, very much like the Tyrrhenian (Etruscan) and very ancient works among the Greeks.
</p><p>There is also a building with a great number of pillars, as

at Memphis, in the barbaric style; for, except the magnitude

and number and rows of pillars, there is nothing pleasing nor

easily described,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ go|afiko/n.</foreign> These words have been understood by some writers

<p>At Heliopolis we saw large buildings in which the

priests lived. For it is said that anciently this was the

principal residence of the priests, who studied philosophy and

astronomy. But there are no longer either such a body of

persons or such pursuits. No one was pointed out to us on

the spot, as presiding over these studies, but only persons who

performed sacred rites, and who explained to strangers [the

peculiarities of] the temples.
</p><p>A person of the name of Chæremon accompanied the governor, Ælius Gallus, in his journey from Alexandreia into

Egypt, and pretended to some knowledge of this kind, but he

was generally ridiculed for his boasting and ignorance. The

houses of the priests, and the residences of Plato and of Eudoxus, were shown to us. Eudoxus came here with Plato, and,

according to some writers, lived thirteen years in the society of

the priests. For the latter were distinguished for their knowledge of the heavenly bodies, but were mysterious and uncommunicative, yet after a time were prevailed upon by courtesy

to acquaint them with some of the principles of their science,

but the barbarians concealed the greater part of them. They

had, however, communicated the knowledge of the additional



<pb n="247"/>



portions of the day and night, in the space of 365 days, necessary to complete the annual period; and, at that time, the

length of the year was unknown to the Greeks, as were many

other things, until later astronomers received them from the

persons who translated the records of the priests into the

Greek language, and even now derive knowledge from their

writings and from those of the Chaldeans.<note anchored="yes">George (Syncellus, or companion of the Patriarch), a writer of the

eighth century, and who had the reputation of being well versed in history,

says that "Ptolemy Philadelphus collected all the writings of Greeks,

Chaldæans, Egyptians, and Romans, and had such of them as were not

Greek translated into that language, and deposited 100,000 volumes at

Alexandria. M. Letronne is disposed to think that Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, Ptolemy, and others borrowed from these sources.</note>

<milestone n="30" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After Heliopolis is the <q direct="unspecified">Nile above the Delta.</q> The

country on the right hand, as you go up the Nile, is called

Libya, as well as that near Alexandreia and the lake Mareotis;

the country on the left hand is called Arabia. The territory

belonging to Heliopolis is in Arabia, but the city Cercesura is

in Libya, and situated opposite to the observatory of Eudoxus.

For there is shown an observing station in front of Heliopolis,

as there is in front of Cnidus, where Eudoxus marked certain

motions of the heavenly bodies. This is the Letopolite Nome.
</p><p>In sailing up the river we meet with Babylon, a strong

fortress, built by some Babylonians who had taken refuge

there, and had obtained permission from the kings to establish

a settlement in that place. At present it is an encampment

for one of the three legions which garrison Egypt. There is

a mountainous ridge, which extends from the encampment as

far as the Nile. At this ridge are wheels and screws, by

which water is raised from the river, and one hundred and

fifty prisoners are [thus] employed.
</p><p>The pyramids on the other side [of the river] at Memphis

may be clearly discerned from this place, for they are not far

off.

<milestone n="31" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Memphis itself also, the residence of the kings of Egypt,

is near, being only three schœni distant from the Delta. It

contains temples, among which is that of Apis, who is the

same as Osiris. Here the ox Apis is kept in a sort of sanctuary, and is held, as I have said, to be a god. The forehead

and some other small parts of its body are white; the other

parts are black. By these marks the fitness of the successor

is always determined, when the animal to which they pay these

honours dies. In front of the sanctuary is a court, in which

there is another sanctuary for the dam of Apis. . Into this

court the Apis is let loose at times, particularly for the purpose of exhibiting him to strangers. He is seen through a

door in the sanctuary, and he is permitted to be seen also out

of it. After he has frisked about a little in the court, he is

taken back to his own stall.
</p><p>The temple of Apis is near the Hephæsteium (or temple

of Vulcan); the Hephæsteium<note anchored="yes"><q direct="unspecified">Sesoosis (Sesostris) raised two obelisks of hard stone, 120 cubits in

Memphis, in the temple of Vulcan, he erected monolithe images of himself

and his wife, 30 cubits in height, and images of his sons, 20 cubits in

height,</q> in memory of his escape from fire when his brother Armais attempted to burn him with his wife and children. Diod.

of a single stone. It is usual to celebrate bull-fights in this

Dromos; the bulls are bred expressly for this purpose, like

horses. They are let loose, and fight with one another, the

conqueror receiving a prize.
</p><p>At Memphis also there is a temple of Venus, who is accounted a Grecian deity. But some say that it is a temple dedicated to Selene, or the moon.<note anchored="yes">Probably the statue of Venus bore a crescent on the forehead.</note>

<milestone n="32" unit="section"/></p>
<p>There is also a temple of Sarapis, situated in a very sandy

spot, where the sand is accumulated in masses by the wind.

Some of the sphinxes which we saw were buried in this

sand up to the head, and one half only of others was visible.

Hence we may conceive the danger, should any one, in his

way to the temple, be surprised by a [sand] storm.
</p><p>The city is large and populous; it ranks next to Alexandreia,

and, like that place, is inhabited by mixed races of people.

There are lakes in front of the city and of the palaces, which

at present are in ruins and deserted. They are situated upon

an eminence, and extend as far as the lower part of the

city.
</p><p>Close to this place are a grove and a lake.

has said so little concerning them. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus

enter into more particulars, and in general are more exact. Some idea of

the immense labour required may be obtained from considerations such

as follow:—

coast of Guinea. <emph rend="ital">Letronne.</emph></p></note> Three of them are considerable. Two of these are

reckoned among the seven wonders [of the world]. They

are a stadium in height, and of a quadrangular shape. Their

height somewhat exceeds the length of each of the sides.<note anchored="yes">This is a palpable error, and greater than that of Herodotus, who

makes the base equal to the height. The ratio of the height to the base

in the great pyramid was as 0ċ627 to 1; and in the second, as 0ċ640 to

1. Diodorus approaches nearest of all to the truth, as he makes this

ratio to be as 6 to 7 or as 0ċ817 to 1. Strabo should rather have said,

<q direct="unspecified">the sides are rather greater than the height;</q> but all that he says respecting the pyramids is vague and inexact.</note>

One pyramid is a little larger than the other. At a moderate

height in one of the sides<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)n u(/yei me/sws pws mia=s tw=n pleurw=n mia=s</foreign> is adopted, although not introduced into the text, by Kramer; <foreign lang="greek">me/sws pws</foreign> is connected with <foreign lang="greek">e)n u(/yei,</foreign>

when that is removed, there is an oblique passage [leading]

third pyramid, which is much less than the two others, but

constructed at much greater expense; for from the found-



<pb n="250"/>



ation nearly as far as the middle, it is built of black stone.

Mortars are made of this stone, which is brought from a

great distance; for it comes from the mountains of Ethiopia, and being hard and difficult to be worked, the labour

is attended with great expense. It is said to be the tomb

of a courtesan, built by her lovers, and whose name, according to Sappho the poetess, was Doriche. She was the

mistress of her brother Charaxus, who traded to the port of

Naucratis with wine of Lesbos. Others call her Rhodopis.<note anchored="yes">Chembes the Memphite built the largest of the three pyramids, which

are reckoned among the seven most remarkable works in the world. They

are situated by the side of Libya, distant 120 stadia from Memphis, and

45 from the Nile. These works, by their size and by the artifice and labour

employed in their construction, strike the beholder with astonishment and

wonder. The base of the largest, the plan of which is quadrilateral, is

seven plethra on each side; the height is more than six plethra; the pyramid gradually contracts towards the top, of which each side measures six

cubits, and the whole is built of hard stone. Its construction must have

been accompanied with great difficulty, but its permanence will be eternal; for although, it is said, not less than a thousand years have passed

away to our day (some even say more than 3400 years) since they were

built, yet the stones still remain, preserving their original position, and

their whole arrangement uninjured by time. The stone is said to have

come from a great distance in Arabia, and the process of building was

carried on by raising mounds of earth; for at that period no machines had

been invented. But it is most marvellous that although such an immense

undertaking has been completed, and the whole country around is composed of sand, not a single trace remains of the mounds raised, nor of the

fragments of stone broken off by the workmen: indeed the pyramids do

not seem to have been raised by the gradual labour of man, but to have

been placed by some divine hand in a mass, perfectly formed, down upon

the surrounding sands. Some Egyptians undertake to narrate wondrous

stories respecting them, such, for instance, that the mounds above-mentioned were composed of salt and nitre, which melted away upon the

rising of the river, and completely disappeared without the intervention

of human labour. But this cannot be true, for the same number of

hands which constructed the mounds would be able to reduce them again

to their former state ; and 360,000 men, it is said, were employed in the

undertaking. The whole was completed in a little less than twenty years.

<p>On the death of this king, he was succeeded by his brother Chephren,

who reigned 56 years. According to some writers, it was not a brother, but

a son, named Chabryis, who was his successor. But all agree that the successor, whoever he was, desired to imitate his predecessor's conception,

and built the second pyramid, which resembled the first in its artificial

construction, but was inferior to it in size, the sides of the base being

a stadium each in length.
</p><p>On the greater pyramid is an inscription which states the amount expended on herbs and radishes for the workmen, and it informs us that

<date value="1600">1600</date> talents were paid for this purpose.
</p><p>The lesser pyramid bears no inscription, and it has an ascent formed

in it through an opening in one of the sides. But although the kings

built these pyramids for their own tombs, yet it has so happened that

none of them have ever been buried in them. For the population, in

consequence of the misery to which these works exposed them, and of

the cruelty and tyranny of the kings, were incensed against them as the

causes of their sufferings; and moreover threatened to tear their bodies in

pieces, and to cast them out with insult from their place of burial. Every

king therefore, on the approach of death, enjoined his relations to bury

his body secretly in a place undistinguished by marks.
</p><p>These were succeeded by king Mycerinus, (whom some call Mecherinus,) son of the king who built the first pyramid. He designed to build

a third, but died before he accomplished it. Each side of the base of this

pyramid was three plethra in length, and fifteen tiers of the building

were raised of black stone like the Thebaic stone, but the rest was filled

up with a stone resembling that of the other pyramids. This work is inferior to the two former in size, but far surpasses them in artificial construction and in the expensiveness of the stone. On its northern side the

name of Mycerinus is inscribed, as the person who caused it to be built.

He is said to have held in abhorrence the cruelty of his predecessors, and

to have been ambitious of leading a just life, and beneficial to his subjects.

He performed many actions by which he called forth the affection of his

people towards him; and among others he expended a great sum of

money in public causes, rewarding the judges who delivered upright

judgments, which was not commonly the case.
</p><p>There are three other pyramids, the sides of which are two plethra in

length; in workmanship they entirely resemble the others, except in

magnitude. These pyramids, it is said, were built by the three before-mentioned kings in honour of their own wives. These works by universal consent are the most remarkable in Egypt, not only in their ponderous construction, but also in the art displayed. We ought, we are

told, to admire more the architects than the kings, who supplied the means,

for the architects brought their designs to completion by force of mind

and the influence of an honourable ambition, but the kings by the power

of that wealth which was their portion, or by injuries inflicted on others.

There is no agreement whatever, either between the natives of the country or between authors, respecting the pyramids; for some assert that the

kings before mentioned built them, others that they were not the builders, but that Armæus built the first and largest; Amasis, the second;

and Inaro, the third: but this last is said by some to be the burial-place

of Rhodopis, a courtesan, whose lovers were certain governors of nomes,

who from affection towards her undertook this great work, and completed

it at their common charge. Diodorus Siculus, b. . 63, 64.</p></note>

security from molestation, they made a regular settlement of the place, and

called it Babylon, after their native city. Under similar circumstances, it is said, a place received the name of Troy which still exists on the

banks of the Nile. For Menelaus, on his return from Troy with captives,

came to Egypt. The Trojan captives revolted, took up a position, and

carried on a war, until having obtained safety for themselves by treaty,

they founded a city bearing the name of their native place.</q> I am aware

nome planted with large, full-grown olive trees, which bear

fine fruit. If the produce were carefully collected, good oil

might be obtained; but this care is neglected, and although

a large quantity of oil is obtained, yet it has a disagreeable

smell. (The rest of Egypt is without the olive tree, except

the gardens near Alexandreia, which are planted with olive

trees, but do not furnish any oil.) It produces wine in abundance, corn, pulse, and a great variety of other grains. It has

also the remarkable lake Mœris, which in extent is a sea, and

the colour of its waters resembles that of the sea. Its borders

also are like the sea-shore, so that we may make the same

suppositions respecting these as about the country near Ammon. For they are not very far distant from one another

and from Parætonium; and we may conjecture from a multitude of proofs, that as the temple of Ammon was once situated

upon the sea, so this tract of country also bordered on the sea

at some former period. But Lower Egypt and the country

as far as the Lake Sirbonis were sea, and confluent perhaps

with the Red Sea at Heroopolis, and the Ælanitic recess of

the gulf.

<milestone n="36" unit="section"/></p>
<p>We have treated these subjects at length in the First

Book of the Geography. At present we shall make a few

remarks on the operations of nature and of Providence conjointly.—On the operations of nature, that all things converge

to a point, namely, the centre of the whole, and assume a

spherical shape around it. The earth is the densest body, and

nearer the centre than all others: the less dense and next to

it is water; but both land and water are spheres, the first

solid, the second hollow, containing the earth within it.—On

the operations of Providence, that it has exercised a will, is

disposed to variety, and is the artificer of innumerable works.

In the first rank, as greatly surpassing all the rest, is the

generation of animals, of which the most excellent are gods

and men, for whose sake the rest were formed. To the gods

Providence assigned heaven; and the earth to men, the extreme parts of the world; for the extreme parts of the sphere

are the centre and the circumference. But since water encompasses the earth, and man is not an aquatic, but a land-animal, living in the air, and requiring much light, Providence formed many eminences and cavities in the earth, so

that these cavities should receive the whole or a great part of

the water which covers the land beneath it; and that the eminences should rise and conceal the water beneath them, except

so much as was necessary for the use of the human race, the

animals and plants about it.
</p><p>But as all things are in constant motion, and undergo great

changes, (for it is not possible that things of such a nature, so

numerous and vast, could be otherwise regulated in the world,)

we must not suppose the earth or the water always to continue in this state, so as to retain perpetually the same bulk,

without increase or diminution, or that each preserves the

same fixed place, particularly as the reciprocal change of one

into the other is most consonant to nature from their proximity; but that much of the land is changed into water, and

a great portion of water becomes land, just as we observe great

differences in the earth itself. For one kind of earth crumbles

easily, another is solid and rocky, and contains iron; and so

of others. There is also a variety in the quality of water;

for some waters are saline, others sweet and potable, others



<pb n="255"/>



medicinal, and either salutary or noxious, others cold or hot

Is it therefore surprising that some parts of the earth which

are now inhabited should formerly have been occupied by

sea, and that what are now seas should formerly have been

inhabited land ? so also fountains once existing have failed,

and others have burst forth; and similarly in the case of rivers

and lakes: again, mountains and plains have been converted

reciprocally one into the other. On this subject I have spoken

before at length,<note anchored="yes">Book i. c. iii. § 4.</note> and now let this be said:

<milestone n="37" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The lake Mœris, by its magnitude and depth, is able to

sustain the superabundance of water which flows into it at

the time of the rise of the river, without overflowing the inhabited and cultivated parts of the country. On the decrease

of the water of the river, it distributes the excess by the same

canal at each of the mouths; and both the lake and the canal

preserve a remainder, which is used for irrigation. These

are the natural and independent properties of the lake, but in

addition, on both mouths of the canal are placed locks, by

which the engineers store up and distribute the water which

enters or issues from the canal.
</p><p>We have here also the Labyrinth, a work equal to the

Pyramids, and adjoining to it the tomb of the king who constructed the Labyrinth.<note anchored="yes">Herod. ii. 148; Diod. i. 66. See below, § 42.</note> After proceeding beyond the first

entrance of the canal about 30 or 40 stadia, there is a table-shaped plain, with a village and a large palace composed of

as many palaces as there were formerly nomes. There are

an equal number of aulæ, surrounded by pillars, and contiguous to one another, all in one line and forming one building,

like a long wall having the aulæ in front of it. The entrances

into the aulæ are opposite to the wall. In front of the entrances there are long and numerous covered ways, with winding passages communicating with each other, so that no

stranger could find his way into the aulæ or out of them without a guide. The (most) surprising circumstance is that the

roofs of these dwellings consist of a single stone each, and

that the covered ways through their whole range were roofed

in the same manner with single slabs of stone of extraordinary

size, without the intermixture of timber or of any other material.

On ascending the roof,—which is not of great height for it

field, thus composed of stones. Descending again and looking<note anchored="yes">The translator adopts Kramer's suggestion, of reading <foreign lang="greek">ei)sble/ponta</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)kpi/ptonta.</foreign></note>

into the aulæ, these may be seen in a line supported by twenty-seven pillars, each consisting of a single stone. The walls also

are constructed of stones not inferior in size to these.
</p><p>At the end of this building, which occupies more than a

stadium, is the tomb, which is a quadrangular pyramid, each

side of which is about four plethra in length, and of equal

height. The name of the person buried there is Imandes.<note anchored="yes">The founder, according to Diodorus Siculus, was Mendes or Marrus.

B. i 61.</note>

They built, it is said, this number of aulæ, because it was the

custom for all the nomes to assemble there together according to their rank, with their own priests and priestesses, for

the purpose of performing sacrifices and making offerings to

the gods, and of administering justice in matters of great importance. Each of the nomes was conducted to the aula appointed for it.

<milestone n="38" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Sailing along to the distance of 100 stadia, we come to

the city Arsinoë, formerly called Crocodilopolis; for the inhabitants of this nome worship the crocodile. The animal is

accounted sacred, and kept apart by himself in a lake; it is

tame, and gentle to the priests, and is called Suchus. It is

fed with bread, flesh, and wine, which strangers who come

to see it always present. Our host, a distinguished person,

who was our guide in examining what was curious, accompanied us to the lake, and brought from the supper table a

small cake, dressed meat, and a small vessel containing a

mixture of honey and milk. We found the animal lying on

the edge of the lake. The priests went up to it; some of

them opened its mouth, another put the cake into it, then the

meat, and afterwards poured down the honey and milk. The

animal then leaped into the lake, and crossed to the other side.

When another stranger arrived with his offering, the priests

took it, and running round the lake, caught the crocodile, and

gave him what was brought, in the same manner as before.

<p>Next after the Arsinoïte and Heracleotic Nomes, is

the city of Hercules, in which the ichneumon is worshipped,

in opposition to the Arsinoïtes, who worship crocodiles;



<pb n="257"/>



hence the canal and the lake Mœris is full of these animals,

for they venerate them, and are careful to do them no harm:

but the Heracleotæ worship the ichneumon, which is most destructive both to crocodiles and asps. The ichneumons destroy not only the eggs of the latter, but the animals themselves. The ichneumons are protected by a covering of mud,

in which they roll, and then dry themselves in the sun.

They then seize the asps by the head or tail, and dragging

them into the river, so kill them.
</p><p>They lie in wait for the crocodiles, when the latter are

basking in the sun with their mouths open; they then drop

into their jaws, and eating through their intestines and belly,

issue out of the dead body.

do not, however, assign the same reasons for this difference of

<p>Then follows the Hermopolite Castle, a place where is

collected the toll on merchandise brought down from the

Thebaïs. At this place begins the reckoning by schœni of

sixty stadia each, which is continued to Syene and Elephantina. Next is the Thebaïc Keep, and a canal leading to Tanis.

<p>Then follows Ptolemaïs,<note anchored="yes">The ruins are supposed to be at the modem hamlet of Mensieh.</note> the largest city in the Thebais, not inferior to Memphis, with a form of government

we have described, but not composed of many parts. It has

a fountain situated at a great depth. There is a descent to it

through an arched passage built with single stones, of remarkable size and workmanship.
</p><p>There is a canal which leads to this place from the great

river. About the canal is a grove of Egyptian acanthus,

dedicated to Apollo. Abydos seems once to have been a large

city, second to Thebes. At present it is a small town. But

if, as they say, Memnon is called Ismandes by the Egyptians,

the Labyrinth might be a Memnonium, and the work of the

same person who constructed those at Abydos and at Thebes;

for in those places, it is said, are some Memnonia. In the

latitude of Abydos is the first Auasis (Oasis) of the three

which are said to be in Africa. It is distant from Abydos a

journey of seven days through a desert. It is an inhabited

place, well supplied with good water and wine, and sufficiently provided with other articles. The second is that near

the lake Mœris. The third is that at the oracle of Ammon:

these are considerable settlements.

<milestone n="43" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Having before spoken at length of the temple of Ammon,

we wish to add this only, that in ancient times divination in general and oracles were held in greater esteem than at present.

Now they are greatly neglected ; for the Romans are satisfied

with the oracles of the Sibyl, and with Tyrrhenian divination

by the entrails of animals, the flight of birds, and portentous

appearances. Hence the oracle of Ammon, which was

formerly held in great esteem, is now nearly deserted. This



<pb n="259"/>



appears chiefly from the historians who have recorded the

actions of Alexander, adding, indeed, much that has the appearance of flattery, but yet relating what is worthy of credit.

Callisthenes, for instance, says that Alexander was ambitious

of the glory of visiting the oracle, because he knew that

Perseus and Hercules had before performed the journey thither.

He set out from Parætonium, although the south winds were

blowing, and succeeded in his undertaking by vigour and perseverance. When out of his way on the road, he escaped

being overwhelmed in a sand-storm by a fall of rain, and

by the guidance of two crows, which directed his course.

These things are stated by way of flattery, as also what follows: that the priest permitted the king alone to pass into the

temple in his usual dress, whereas the others changed theirs;

that all heard the oracles on the outside of the temple, except

Alexander, who was in the interior of the building; that the

answers were not given, as at Delphi and at Branchidæ, in

words, but chiefly by nods and signs, as in Homer;

<quote><q direct="unspecified">the son of Saturn nodded with his sable brows,</q><note anchored="yes">Il. i. 528.</note></quote>

the prophet imitating Jupiter. This, however, the man told

the king, in express terms, that he was the son of Jupiter.

Callisthenes adds, (after the exaggerating style of tragedy,)

that when Apollo had deserted the oracle among the Branchidæ, on the temple being plundered by the Branchidæ (who

espoused the party of the Persians in the time of Xerxes,) and

the spring had failed, it then re-appeared (on the arrival of

Alexander); that the ambassadors also of the Milesians carried back to Memphis numerous answers of the oracle respecting the descent of Alexander from Jupiter, and the future victory which he should obtain at Arbela, the death of Darius,

and the political changes at Lacedæmon. He says also that

the Erythræan Athenais, who resembled the ancient Erythræan Sibyl, had declared the high descent of Alexander.

Such are the accounts of historians.

<p>At Abydos Osiris is worshipped; but in the temple of

Osiris no singer, nor player on the pipe, nor on the cithara,

is permitted to perform at the commencement of the ceremonies celebrated in honour of the god, as is usual in rites

celebrated in honour of the other gods. Next to Abydos is

the lesser Diospolis,<note anchored="yes">Hu.</note> then the city Tentyra,<note anchored="yes">Dendera.</note> where the crocodile is held in peculiar abhorrence, and is regarded as the

most odious of all animals. For the other Egyptians, although acquainted with its mischievous disposition, and hostility towards the human race, yet worship it, and abstain

from doing it harm. But the people of Tentyra track and

destroy it in every way. Some however, as they say of the

Psyllians of Cyrenæa, possess a certain natural antipathy to

snakes, and the people of Tentyra have the same dislike to crocodiles, yet they suffer no injury from them, but dive and

cross the river when no other person ventures to do so.

When crocodiles were brought to Rome to be exhibited, they

were attended by some of the Tentyritæ. A reservoir

was made for them with a sort of stage on one of the sides,

to form a basking-place for them on coming out of the

water, and these persons went into the water, drew them in a

net to the place, where they might sun themselves and be exhibited, and then dragged them back again to the reservoir.

The people of Tentyra worship Venus. At the back of the fane

of Venus is a temple of Isis ; then follow what are called the

complete the whole year, because there is (annually) an excess

of a part of a day, they form a period from out of whole days

and whole years, the supernumerary portions of which in that

period, when collected together, amount to a day.<note anchored="yes">The meaning of the passage is clear, and can be understood, as critics have already explained, only as implying the intercalation of a 366th

day every fourth year. Some have asserted that Julius Cæsar adopted

this method of intercalating a day from the civil practice of the Alexandrines; others, on the contrary, appear disposed to believe that J.

Cæsar was the first to give an idea of it, according to the advice of Sosigenes. There is truth and error in both these opinions.

<p>On the one hand, it is certain that Strabo, who visited Egypt a short

time after the conquest of the country by the Romans, would not have

omitted to attribute to them the institution of this year, if it really belonged to them. So far from doing so, he says (above, § 29) distinctly,

that this method of intercalation was known and practised by the priests

of Heliopolis and Thebes. Diodorus Siculus, who visited Egypt just at

the time of the first arrival of the Romans, gives the same account as

Strabo. Can we therefore believe that the Egyptians before this period

were ignorant of the bissextile intercalation?
</p><p>On the other hand; it is not less certain that this method of intercalation was only introduced into civil use at Alexandria from the time of

Julius Cæsar: before this period, the incomplete year of 365 days was

adopted throughout the whole of Egypt, as is attested by a host of authorities, and confirmed by the date of the Rosetta stone, which only applies

to this method of reckoning. Hence we see (I.) that Julius Cæsar

really obtained the idea of a fixed year of 365 1/4 days from the Egyptians,

where it was employed for scientific or religious purposes only, whilst the

incomplete year was the vulgar and common year; (II.) that he made

this fixed year the common year, both among the Romans and Alexandrines, who were a people most readily disposed to adopt foreign innovations. It is, however, probable that the rest of Egypt preserved the ancient use of the incomplete year.</p></note> They

solstice, because these places lie under the tropical circle,<note anchored="yes">This was the general opinion of antiquity, and was reproduced by

Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and others; in short, by all the

Alexandrine school.

<p>At the time of Eratosthenes, the obliquity of the ecliptic was 23° 45′ 17″.

Syene was therefore 20′ 6″ from being exactly under the tropic; for 24°

5′ 23″ (latitude of Syene)—23° 45′ 17″ = 20′ 6″. This would be the distance of the centre of the sun from the zenith of Syene; whence it follows

that the northern limb of the sun was about 5′ from it.
</p><p>In the time of Strabo, the obliquity was only 23° 42′ 22″; the difference between the zenith of Syene and the northern limb of the sun was

about 8′.
</p><p>Lastly, about 140 of the vulgar era, the obliquity was reduced to

23° 41′ 7″. Syene was then 24′ 16″ from the tropic, and its zenith was

about 10′ from the northern limb of the sun; when the shadows of gnomons of any tolerable size must have been perceptible, and Syene could

not have been any longer considered as lying under the tropic.
</p><p>As regards the well which served to ascertain the instant of the solstice,

Pliny and Arrian both mention it. The formation of it no doubt belonged to a very remote period. In the time of Strabo, the rays of the sun

could not have reached entirely to the bottom, but the shadow was so

small that it was not sufficient to shake the ancient opinion. In fact,

the angle being about 8′, and supposing the depth to have been 50 feet,

the northern side would have projected a shadow of about 18 lines; the

rest would have remained in fill light, and the reflexion would have

caused the whole circumference of the well to appear illuminated.

level, and thus capable of receiving the river, but terminating

in a precipice, where the water dashes down. On each side

towards the land there is a stream, up which is the chief ascent

for vessels. The boatmen sail up by this stream, and, dropping down to the cataract, are impelled with the boat to the

precipice, the crew and the boats escaping unhurt.
</p><p>A little above the cataract is Philæ, a common settlement, like Elephantina, of Ethiopians and Egyptians, and

equal in size, containing Egyptian temples, where a bird,

which they call hierax, (the hawk,) is worshipped; but it

did not appear to me to resemble in the least the hawks of

our country nor of Egypt, for it was larger, and very different in the marks of its plumage. They said that the bird was

Ethiopian, and is brought from Ethiopia when its predecessor

dies, or before its death. The one shown to us when we were

there was sick and nearly dead.

<p>We came from Syene to Philæ in a waggon, through a

very flat country, a distance of about 100 stadia.<note anchored="yes">The number here given is nearly twice too great. Kramer quotes

G. Parthey (de Philis insula) for correcting the error to 50 stadia, and for

perceiving that it arose from the very frequent substitution in manuscripts

the whole road on each side we could see, in many places,

very high rocks, round, very smooth, and nearly spherical, of

black hard stone, of which mortars are made: each rested

upon a greater stone, and upon this another: they were like

hermæa.<note anchored="yes">Unhewn stones, with a head of Mercury upon them.</note> Sometimes these stones consisted of one mass.

The largest was not less than twelve feet in diameter, and

all of them exceeded this size by one half. We crossed over

whence it resembles woven-work. Standing then in the water,

(at the bottom of the boat,) or sitting upon some little planks,

we easily crossed over, with some alarm indeed, but without

good cause for it, as there is no danger if the boat is not overloaded.

<p>Throughout the whole of Egypt, the palm tree is of a

bad species, and produces no good edible fruit in the places

about the Delta and Alexandreia; yet the best kind is found

in the Thebais. It is a subject of surprise how countries in

the same latitude as Judæa, and bordering upon the Delta and

Alexandreia, should be so different; for Judæa, in addition to

other kinds of date-palms, produces the caryotic, which is not

inferior to the Babylonian. There are, however, two kinds

of dates in the Thebaïs and in Judæa, the caryotic and

another. The Thebaic is firmer, but the flavour is more

agreeable. There is an island remarkable for producing the

best dates, and it also furnishes the largest revenue to the governors. It was appropriated to the kings, and no private

person had any share in the produce; at present it belongs to

the governors.

the river has an unfathomable depth. In the Nile there

<p>Egypt was from the first disposed to peace, from having resources within itself, and because it was difficult of access to strangers. It was also protected on the north by a

harbourless coast and the Egyptian Sea; on the east and

west by the desert mountains of Libya and Arabia, as I have

said before.<note anchored="yes">Above, § 8.</note> The remaining parts towards the south are occupied by Troglodytæ, Blemmyes, Nubæ, and Megabari,

cause frequently, like robbers, they attacked defenceless persons. Neither are the Ethiopians, who extend towards the

south and Meroë, numerous nor collected in a body; for they

inhabit a long, narrow, and winding tract of land on the riverside, such as we have before described; nor are they well

prepared either for war or the pursuit of any other mode of life.
</p><p>At present the whole country is in the same pacific state,

a proof of which is, that the upper country is sufficiently

guarded by three cohorts, and these not complete. Whenever

the Ethiopians have ventured to attack them, it has been at

the risk of danger to their own country. The rest of the

forces in Egypt are neither very numerous, nor did the Romans ever once employ them collected into one army. For

neither are the Egyptians themselves of a warlike disposition,

nor the surrounding nations, although their numbers are very

large.
</p><p>Cornelius Gallus, the first governor of the country appointed by (Augustus) Cæsar, attacked the city Heroopolis, which

had revolted,<note anchored="yes">B. C. 28.</note> and took it with a small body of men. He

suppressed also in a short time an insurrection in the Thebais,

which originated as to the payment of tribute. At a later period

Petronius resisted, with the soldiers about his person, a mob of

myriads of Alexandrines, who attacked him by throwing stones.

He killed some, and compelled the rest to desist.
</p><p>We have before<note anchored="yes">B. xvi. c. 4, § 23.</note> related how Ælius Gallus, when he invaded Arabia with a part of the army stationed in Egypt,

exhibited a proof of the unwarlike disposition of the people;

and if Syllæus had not betrayed him, he would have conquered the whole of Arabia Felix.

<milestone n="54" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The Ethiopians, emboldened in consequence of a part

of the forces in Egypt being drawn off by Ælius Gallus, who

was engaged in war with the Arabs, invaded the Thebais,

and attacked the garrison, consisting of three cohorts, near

Syene; surprised and took Syene, Elephantina, and Philæ,

by a sudden inroad; enslaved the inhabitants, and threw down

the statues of Cæsar. But Petronius, marching with less than

10,000 infantry and 800 horse against an army of 30,000 men,

first compelled them to retreat to Pselchis, an Ethiopian city.

He then sent deputies to demand restitution of what they had

taken, and the reasons which had induced them to begin the



<pb n="268"/>



war. On their alleging that they had been ill treated by the

nomarchs, he answered, that these were not the sovereigns

of the country, but Cæsar. When they desired three days

for consideration, and did nothing which they were bound to

do, Petronius attacked and compelled them to fight. They

soon fled, being badly commanded, and badly armed; for they

carried large shields made of raw hides, and hatchets for offensive weapons; some, however, had pikes, and others swords.

Part of the insurgents were driven into the city, others fled

into the uninhabited country; and such as ventured upon the

passage of the river escaped to a neighbouring island, where

there were not many crocodiles on account of the current.

Among the fugitives, were the generals of Candace, queen of

the Ethiopians in our time, a masculine woman, and who

had lost an eye. Petronius, pursuing them in rafts and ships,

took them all and despatched them immediately to Alexandreia. He then attacked Pselchis<note anchored="yes">The modem hamlet of Dakkeh occupies a portion of the site of ancient Pselchis.</note> and took it. If we add

the number of those who fell in battle to the number of prisoners, few only could have escaped.
</p><p>From Pselchis Petronius went to Premnis,<note anchored="yes">Called Primis by Ptolemy and Pliny. It is placed by the former

beyond Napata, and just above Meroë. Hence it is identified with Ibrim.</note> a strong city,

travelling over the hills of sand, beneath which the army of

Cambyses was overwhelmed by the setting in of a whirlwind.

He took the fortress at the first onset, and afterwards advanced to Napata.<note anchored="yes">There is great difficulty in determining the true position of Napata,

as our author places it much farther north than Pliny; and there is reason for supposing that it is the designation of a royal residence, which

might be moveable, rather than of a fixed locality. Ritter brings Napata

as far north as Primis and the ruins at Ipsambul, while Mannert, Ukert,

and other geographers, believe it to have been Merawe, on the farthest

northern point of the region of Meroë. It is, however, generally placed

at the east extremity of that great bend of the Nile which skirts the desert of Bahiouda, and near Mount Birkel.

<p>Among the ruins which probably cover the site of the ancient Napata

are two lions of red granite, one bearing the name of Amuneph Ill., the

other Amuntuonch. They were brought to England by Lord Prudhoe,

and now stand at the entrance of the Gallery of Antiquities in the British

Museum. See Smith's Diet., art. <emph rend="ital">Napata.</emph></p></note> This was the royal seat of Candace ; and

her son was there, but she herself was in a neighbouring

stronghold. When she sent ambassadors to treat of peace, and



<pb n="269"/>



to offer the restitution of the prisoners brought from Syene,

and the statues, Petronius attacked and took Napata, from

which her son had fled, and then razed it. He made prisoners of

the inhabitants, and returned back again with the booty, as

he judged any farther advance into the country impracticable on account of the roads. He strengthened, however, the

fortifications of Premnis, and having placed a garrison there,

with two years' provisions for four hundred men, returned to

Alexandreia. Some of the prisoners were publicly sold as

booty, and a thousand were sent to Cæsar, who had lately returned from the Cantabrians,<note anchored="yes">The inhabitants of Biscay. See b. iii. c. iii. § 8.</note> others died of various diseases.
</p><p>In the mean time Candace<note anchored="yes">This name was common to the queens of Ethiopia. Acts viii. 27.</note> attacked the garrison with an

army of many thousand men. Petronius came to its assistance, and entering the fortress before the approach of the

enemy, secured the place by many expedients. The enemy

sent ambassadors, but he ordered them to repair to Cæsar:

on their replying, that they did not know who Cæsar was,

nor where they were to find him, Petronius appointed persons

to conduct them to his presence. They arrived at Samos,

where Cæsar was at that time, and from whence he was on

the point of proceeding into Syria, having already despatched

Tiberius into Armenia. The ambassadors obtained all that

they desired, and Cæsar even remitted the tribute which he

had imposed.

subsistence of man. For the mode of life [of the Ethiopians]

is wretched; they are for the most part naked, and wander

from place to place with their flocks. Their flocks and herds

are small in size, whether sheep, goats, or oxen; the dogs

also, though fierce and quarrelsome, are small.<note anchored="yes">Groskurd corrects the text, and translates, <q direct="unspecified">the inhabitants also are

the royal gardens. Some feed even upon grass, the tender

twigs of trees, the lotus, or the roots of reeds. They live also

upon the flesh and blood of animals, milk, and cheese. They

reverence their kings as gods, who are for the most part shut

up in their palaces.
</p><p>Their largest royal seat is the city of Meroë, of the same

name as the island. The shape of the island is said to be

that of a shield. Its size is perhaps exaggerated. Its length

is about 3000, and its breadth 1000 stadia. It is very mountainous, and contains great forests. The inhabitants are

nomades, who are partly hunters and partly husbandmen.

There are also mines of copper, iron, gold, and various kinds

of precious stones. It is surrounded on the side of Libya by

great hills of sand, and on that of Arabia by continuous precipices. In the higher parts on the south, it is bounded by

Strabo has before asserted that Meroë is surrounded by these rivers, and

<p>Above Meroë is Psebo,<note anchored="yes">Tsana.</note> a large lake, containing a well-inhabited island. As the Libyans occupy the western bank

of the Nile, and the Ethiopians the country on the other side

of the river, they thus dispute by turns the possession of the

islands and the banks of the river, one party repulsing the

other, or yielding to the superiority of its opponent.
</p><p>The Ethiopians use bows of wood four cubits long, and

hardened in the fire. The women also are armed, most of

whom wear in the upper lip a copper ring. They wear sheepskins, without wool; for the sheep have hair like goats. Some

go naked, or wear small skins or girdles of well-woven hair

round the loins.
</p><p>They regard as God one being who is immortal, the cause

of all things; another who is mortal, a being without a name,

whose nature is not clearly understood.
</p><p>In general they consider as gods benefactors and royal persons, some of whom are their kings, the common saviours and

guardians of all; others are private persons, esteemed as gods

by those who have individually received benefits from them.
</p><p>Of those who inhabit the torrid region, some are even supposed not to acknowledge any god, and are said to abhor even

the sun, and to apply opprobrious names to him, when they

an end to himself, when they appointed another king in his

place. At last one of their kings abolished this custom, by

going with an armed body to the temple where the golden

shrine is, and slaughtering all the priests.
</p><p>The following custom exists among the Ethiopians. If a

king is mutilated in any part of the body, those who are

most attached to his person, as attendants, mutilate themselves

in the same manner, and even die with him. Hence the

king is guarded with the utmost care. This will suffice on

size. There are two kinds, which differ in colour; one is

like a stork, the other is entirely black. Every street in

Alexandreia is full of them. In some respects they are useful; in others troublesome. They are useful, because they

pick up all sorts of small animals and the offal thrown out

affinity subsisting between them. The crocodiles abstain

from doing any hurt to the chœri, because they are of a

when in spawn; and descends a little before the setting

</p><p>The writers who have divided the habitable world according to continents, divide it unequally. But a threefold division denotes a division into three equal parts. Africa,

however, wants so much of being a third part of the habitable world, that, even if it were united to Europe, it would

not be equal to Asia; perhaps it is even less than Europe;

in resources it is very much inferior, for a great part of the

inland and maritime country is desert. It is spotted over

with small habitable parts, which are scattered about, and

mostly belonging to nomade tribes. Besides the desert state of

the country, its being a nursery of wild beasts is a hindrance

to settlement in parts which could be inhabited. It comprises also a large part of the torrid zone.
</p><p>All the sea-coast in our quarter, situated between the Nile

and the Pillars, particularly that which belonged to the Carthaginians, is fertile and inhabited. And even in this tract,

some spots destitute of water intervene, as those about the

Syrtes, the Marmaridæ, and the Catabathmus.
</p><p>The shape of Africa is that of a right-angled triangle, if we

imagine its figure to be drawn on a plane surface. Its base

is the coast opposite to us, extending from Egypt and the

Nile to Mauretania and the Pillars; at right angles to this

is a side formed by the Nile to Ethiopia, which side we continue to the ocean; the hypothenuse of the right angle is the

whole tract of sea-coast lying between Ethiopia and Mauretania.
</p><p>As the part situated at the vertex of the above-mentioned

figure, and lying almost entirely under the torrid zone, is inaccessible, we speak of it from conjecture, and therefore cannot say what is the greatest breadth of the country. In a

former<note anchored="yes">B. i. c. 4, § 2.</note> part of this work we have said, that the distance proceeding from Alexandreia southwards to Meroë, the royal

seat of the Ethiopians, is about 10,000 stadia; thence in a

straight line to the borders of the torrid zone and the habitable

country, 3000 stadia. The sum, therefore, may be assumed

as the greatest breadth of Africa, which is 13,000 or 14,000

stadia: its length may be a little less than double this sum.

So much then on the subject of Africa in general. I am now

to describe its several parts, beginning from the most celebrated on the west.

<p>Here dwell a people called by the Greeks Maurusii, and by

the Romans and the natives Mauri, a populous and flourishing

African nation, situated opposite to Spain, on the other side

of the strait, at the Pillars of Hercules, which we have frequently mentioned before. On proceeding beyond the strait at

the Pillars, with Africa on the left hand, we come to a mountain which the Greeks call Atlas, and the barbarians Dyris.

Thence projects into the sea a point formed by the foot of the

mountain towards the west of Mauretania, and called the Coteis.<note anchored="yes">Cape Spartel, or Espartel. Ampelusia, vine-clad, was the Greek

name,—a translation of the native name.</note> Near it is a small town, a little above the sea, which the

whole coast continuous with this bay abounds with them.

Subtracting these bays, and the projections of land in the triangular figure which I have described, the continent may rather

be considered as increasing in magnitude in the direction of

south and east. The mountain which extends through the

middle of Mauretania, from the Coteis to the Syrtes, is itself

inhabited, as well as others running parallel to it, first by the

Maurusii, but deep in the interior of the country by the

of Tyrians, now abandoned, which consisted of not less than

three hundred cities, and were destroyed by the Pharusii<note anchored="yes">A people on the west coast of N. Africa, about the situation of whom

Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy are in perfect agreement with one another, if

the thirty days' journey of Strabo between them and Lixus on the west coast

his information or of the text; which latter is not improbable, as numbers in MSS. are so often corrupt. Nor is this mere conjecture, because

Strabo contradicts himself, by asserting in another place (b. xvii. c. 3.

§ 7) that the Pharusii had a great desert between them and Mauretania.

<p>Writers in general are agreed that Mauretania is a fertile country, except a small part which is desert, and is supplied with water by rivers and lakes. It has forests of trees

of vast size, and the soil produces everything. It is this

country which furnishes the Romans with tables, formed of

one piece of wood, of the largest dimensions, and most beautifully variegated. The rivers are said to contain crocodiles

and other kinds of animals similar to those in the Nile. Some

suppose that even the sources of the Nile are near the extremities of Mauretania. In a certain river leeches are bred

seven cubits in length, with gills, pierced through with holes,

through which they respire. This country is also said to

and panthers. It produces weasels (jerboas ?) equal in size and

similar to cats, except that their noses are more prominent;

and multitudes of apes, of which Poseidonius relates, that

when he was sailing from Gades to Italy, and approached the

coast of Africa, he saw a forest low upon the sea-shore full of

these animals, some on the trees, others on the ground, and

some giving suck to their young. He was amused also with

seeing some with large dugs, some bald, others with ruptures,

place where there is drought and excessive heat? But he

himself relates of these same parts what is much more liable

to objection. For he speaks of some tribes of Lotophagi, who

had left their own country, and might have occupied the tract

destitute of water; whose food might be a lotus, a sort of

herb, or root, which would supply the want of drink; that

these people extend as far as the places above Cyrene, and

<p>Poseidonius says, but I do not know whether truly,

that Africa is traversed by few, and those small rivers; yet he

speaks of the same rivers, namely those between Lynx and

Carthage, which Artemidorus describes as numerous and

large. This may be asserted with more truth of the interior

of the country, and he himself assigns the reason of it,

namely, that in the northern parts of Africa (and the same

is said of Ethiopia) there is no rain; in consequence therefore of the drought, pestilence frequently ensues, the lakes

are filled with mud only, and locusts appear in clouds.
</p><p>Poseidonius besides asserts that the eastern parts are moist,

because the sun quickly changes its place after rising; and that

the western parts are dry, because the sun there turns in his

course. Now, drought and moisture depend upon the abundance or scarcity of water, and on the presence or absence of

the sun's rays. But Poseidonius means to speak of the

effects produced by the sun, which all writers determine by

the latitude, north or south; but east and west, as applied to

the residence of men, differ in different places, according to



<pb n="283"/>



the position of each inhabited spot and the change of horizon;

so that it cannot be asserted generally of places indefinite in

number, that those lying to the east are moist, and those to the

west dry: but as applied to the whole earth and such extremes

of it as India and Spain, his expressions (east and west) may

be just; yet what truth or probability is there in his (attempted) explanation (of the causes of drought and moisture)?

for in the continuous and unceasing circuit of the sun, what

turn can there be in his course? The rapidity too of his

passage through every part is equal. Besides, it is contrary to evidence to say, that the extreme parts of Spain or

Mauretania towards the west are drier than all other places,

when at the same time they are situated in a temperate

climate and have water in great abundance. But if we are

to understand the turning of the sun in this way, that there

at the extremities of the habitable world he is above the

earth, how does that tend to produce drought ? for there, and

in other places situated in the same latitude, he leaves them

for an equal portion of the night and returns again and

warms the earth.

acropolis, which they called Byrsa, a hill of tolerable height

with dwellings round it. On the summit was the temple of

Esculapius, which was destroyed when the wife of Asdrubas

burnt herself to death there, on the capture of the city.

Below the Acropolis were the harbours and the Cothon, a

<p>Carthage was founded by Dido, who brought her

people from Tyre. Both this colony and the settlements in

Spain and beyond the Pillars proved so successful to the

Phoenicians, that even to the present day they occupy the

best parts on the continent of Europe and the neighbouring

islands. They obtained possession of the whole of Africa,

with the exception of such parts as could only be held by

nomade tribes. From the power they acquired they raised a

city to rival Rome, and waged three great wars against her.

Their power became most conspicuous in the last war, in which

they were vanquished by Scipio Æmilianus, and their city

was totally destroyed. For at the commencement of this war,

they possessed 300 cities in Africa, and the population of

Carthage amounted to 700,000 inhabitants. After being besieged and compelled to surrender, they delivered up 200,000

complete suits of armour and 3000<note anchored="yes">Letronne corrects this reading to 2000, which is the number given by

Polybius and Arrian.</note> engines for throwing

projectiles, apparently with the intention of abandoning all

hostilities; but having resolved to recommence the war, they

at once began to manufacture arms, and daily deposited in

store 140 finished shields, 300 swords, 500 lances, and 1000

projectiles for the engines, for the use of which the women-servants contributed their hair. In addition to this, although

at this moment they were in possession of only twelve ships,

according to the terms of the treaty concluded in the second

war, and had already taken refuge in a body at the Byrsa,

yet in two months they equipped 120 decked vessels; and, as

the mouth of the Cothon was closed against them, cut another

outlet (to the sea) through which the fleet suddenly made its

appearance. For wood had been collected for a long time,

and a multitude of workmen were constantly employed, who

were maintained at the public expense.

he it was who formed the nomades to civil life, and directed

their attention to husbandry. Instead of robbers he taught

them to be soldiers. A peculiarity existed among these

people; they inhabited a country favoured in everything

except that it abounded with wild beasts; these they neglected

to destroy, and so to cultivate the soil in security; but turning

their arms against each other, abandoned the country to the

beasts of prey. Hence their life was that of wanderers and

of continual change, quite as much as that of those who are

compelled to it by want and barrenness of soil or severity of

climate. An appropriate name was therefore given to the

Masæsylii, for they were called Nomades.<note anchored="yes">By the Romans, Numidæ.</note> Such persons

lying at the entrance of the Little Syrtis.<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Cabes.</note> There are many

small cities in the intervening parts, which are not worthy of

notice. At the entrance of the Syrtis, a long island stretches

parallel to the coast, called Cercinna; it is of considerable

size, with a city of the same name; there is also another

smaller island Cercinnitis.

<milestone n="17" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Close, in the neighbourhood (of these islands), is the

Little Syrtis, which is also called the Syrtis Lotophagitis (or

the lotus-eating Syrtis). The circuit of this gulf is <date value="1600">1600</date>, and

the breadth of the entrance 600 stadia; at each of the promontories which form the entrance and close to the mainland

is an island, one of which, just mentioned, is Cercinna, and the

other Meninx;<note anchored="yes">Jerba or Zerbi. It produced the <q direct="unspecified">lotus-zizyphus</q> or the carob

Homer. Certain tokens (of this) are shown, such as an altar

of Ulysses and the fruit itself. For the tree called the lotus-tree is found in abundance in the island, and the fruit is very

sweet to the taste. There are many small cities in it, one of

which bears the same name as the island. On the coast of

the Syrtis itself are also some small cities. In the recess (of



<pb n="289"/>



the Syrtis) is a very considerable mart for commerce, where a

river discharges itself into the gulf. The effects of the flux

and reflux of the tides extend up to this point, and at the

proper moment the neighbouring inhabitants eagerly rush

(to the shore) to capture the fish (thrown up).

<milestone n="18" unit="section"/></p>
<p>After the Syrtis, follows the lake Zuchis, 400 stadia

(in circuit?), with a narrow entrance, where is situated a city

of the same name, containing factories for purple dyeing and

for salting of all kinds; then follows another lake much

smaller; after this the city Abrotonon<note anchored="yes">Sabrata?</note> and some others.

Close by is Neapolis, which is also called Leptis.<note anchored="yes">Lebida.</note> From

hence the passage across to the Locri Epizephyrii<note anchored="yes">Gerace. See b. vi. c. i. § 7, 8.</note> is a distance of 3600 stadia. Next is the river [Cinyps].<note anchored="yes">The Cinifo or Wadi-Quasam.</note> Afterwards is a walled darn, constructed by the Carthaginians, who

thus bridged over some deep swamps which extend far into

the country. There are some places here without harbours,

although the rest of the coast is provided with them. Next

is a lofty wooded promontory, which is the commencement of

the Great Syrtis, and called Cephalæ (The Heads),<note anchored="yes">Cape Canan or Mesrata</note> from

whence to Carthage is a distance of a little more than 5000

stadia.

<milestone n="19" unit="section"/></p>
<p>Above the sea-coast from Carthage to Cephalæ (on the

one hand) and to the territory of the Masæsyli (on the other)

lies the territory of the Libo-Phœnicians, extending (into the

interior) to the mountainous country of the Gætuli, which

belongs to Africa Proper. Above the Gætuli is the country

of the Garamantes, lying parallel to the former, and from

whence are brought the Carthaginian pebbles (carbuncles). The

Garamantes are said to be distant from the Ethiopians, who

live on the borders of the ocean, nine or ten days' journey,

and from the temple of Ammon fifteen days. Between the

Gætuli and the coast of our sea (the Mediterranean) there

are many plains and many mountains, great lakes and rivers,

some of which sink into the earth and disappear. The inhabitants are simple in their mode of life and in their dress;

they marry numerous wives, and have a numerous offspring;

in other respects they resemble the nomade Arabians. The

necks both of horses and oxen are longer than in other

countries.
</p><p>The breeding of horses is most carefully attended to by

the kings (of the country); so much so, that the number of

colts is yearly calculated at 100,000. Sheep are fed with

milk and flesh, particularly near Ethiopia. These are the

customs of the interior.

<milestone n="20" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The circuit of the Great Syrtis is about 3930 stadia,<note anchored="yes">See b. ii. c. v. § 20.</note>

its depth to the recess is <date value="1500">1500</date> stadia, and its breadth at the

mouth is also nearly the same. The difficulty of navigating

both these and the Lesser Syrtis [arises from the circumstances

of] the soundings in many parts being soft mud. It sometimes happens, on the ebbing and flowing of the tide, that

vessels are carried upon the shallows, settle down, and are seldom recovered. Sailors therefore, in coasting, keep at a

distance (from the shore), and are on their guard, lest they

should be caught by a wind unprepared, and driven into these

gulfs. Yet the daring disposition of man induces him to attempt everything, and particularly the coasting along a

shore. On entering the Great Syrtis on the right, after passing the promontory Cephalæ, is a lake of about 300 stadia in

length, and 70 stadia in breadth, which communicates with

the gulf, and has at its entrance small islands and an anchorage. After the lake follows a place called Aspis, and a harbour, the best of all in the Syrtis. Near this place is the

tower Euphrantas, the boundary between the former territory

of Carthage and Cyrenaïca under Ptolemy (Soter). Then

another place, called Charax,<note anchored="yes">Its position, like that of so many places on the Great Syrtis, can hardly

be determined with certainty. A full discussion of these localities will

be found in Barth's Wanderungen.</note> which the Carthaginians frequented as a place of commerce, with cargoes of wine, and

Carthage by less than 2000 stadia; but it would coincide

with the parallel passing, on one side, through Heroopolis,

which is situated in the recess<note anchored="yes">Gulf of Suez.</note> of the Arabian Gulf, and

passing, on the other, through the interior of the territory of

the Masæsylii and the Mauretanians. The rest of the

Above this length of coast, and extending to the Altars of the

Philæni, are situated an African nation called Nasamones.

The intervening distance (between the recess of the Syrtis

and Berenice) contains but few harbours, and watering-places

are rare.
</p><p>On a promontory called Pseudopenias is situated Berenice,

near a lake Tritonis, in which is to be observed a small island

with a temple of Venus upon it. There also is a lake of the

Hesperides, into which flows a river (called) Lathon. On

this side of Berenice is a small promontory called Boreion<note anchored="yes">Ras-Teyonas.</note>

(or North Cape), which with Cephalæ forms the entrance of

the Syrtis. Berenice lies opposite to the promontories of

Peloponnesus, namely, those called Ichthys<note anchored="yes">Cape Catacolo.</note> and [Chelonatas],<note anchored="yes">Groskurd justly supposes that the name Chelonatas (Cape Tornese)

is here wanting in the text.</note>

and also to the island Zacynthus,<note anchored="yes">Zante.</note> at an interval of 3600

stadia. Marcus Cato marched from this city, round the Syrtis, in thirty days, at the head of an army composed of more

than 10,000 men, separated into divisions on account of the

watering-places; his course lay through deep sand, under

burning heat. After Berenice is a city Taucheira,<note anchored="yes">Tochira.</note> called

also Arsinoë; then Barca,<note anchored="yes">The name has survived to the present day in that of the district of

The position of Barca is accurately described by Scylax, who places its

itself 100 stadia from the sea. It stood on the summit of the terraces

which overlook the west coast of the Greater Syrtis, in a plain now called

El-Merjeh; and the same name is often given to the ruins which mark

been founded by Battus,<note anchored="yes">B. C. <date value="-631">631</date>.</note> whom Callimachus claims to have

been his ancestor. The city flourished from the excellence of

the soil, which is peculiarly adapted for breeding horses, and

the growth of fine crops. It has produced many men of

distinction, who have shown themselves capable of worthily

maintaining the freedom of the place, and firmly resisting the

barbarians of the interior; hence the city was independent in

ancient times, but subsequently<note anchored="yes">B. C. <date value="-330">330</date>.</note> it was attacked [successfully] by the Macedonians, (who had conquered Egypt, and

thus increased their power,) under the command of Thibron

the murderer of Harpalus: having continued for some time

the Romans, and with Crete forms a single province. In

the neighbourhood of Cyrene are Apollonia, Barca, Taucheira,

Berenice, and other small towns close by.

at this, and he moved the senate to send the philosopher home to his school,

Danube, (to the north,) and the tracts on the verge of the

one portion, and the Parthians, or the barbarians beyond them,

the other; on the east and north are Indians, Bactrians, and

Scythians; then (on the south) Arabians and Ethiopians;

but territory is continually being abstracted from these people

by the Romans.
</p><p>Of all these countries some are governed by (native) kings,

but the rest are under the immediate authority of Rome, under

the title of provinces, to which are sent governors and collectors of tribute; there are also some free cities, which from

the first sought the friendship of Rome, or obtained their

freedom as a mark of honour. Subject to her also are some

princes, chiefs of tribes, and priests, who (are permitted) to live

in conformity with their national laws.

<milestone n="25" unit="section"/></p>
<p>The division into provinces has varied at different

periods, but at present it is that established by Augustus

Cæsar; for after the sovereign power had been conferred upon

him by his country for life, and he had become the arbiter of

peace and war, he divided the whole empire into two parts,

one of which he reserved to himself, the other he assigned to

the (Roman) people. The former consisted of such parts as

required military defence, and were barbarian, or bordered

upon nations not as yet subdued, or were barren and uncultivated, which though ill provided with everything else, were

yet well furnished with strongholds. and might thus dispose



<pb n="297"/>



the inhabitants to throw off the yoke and rebel. All the rest,

which were peaceable countries, and easily governed without

the assistance of arms, were given over to the (Roman)

people. Each of these parts was subdivided into several

provinces, which received respectively the titles of <q direct="unspecified">provinces of Cæsar</q> and <q direct="unspecified">provinces of the People.</q>
</p><p>To the former provinces Cæsar appoints governors and

administrators, and divides the (various) countries sometimes

in one way, sometimes in another, directing his political conduct according to circumstances.
</p><p>But the people appoint commanders and consuls to their

own provinces, which are also subject to divers divisions

when expediency requires it.
</p><p>(Augustus Cæsar) in his first organization of (the Empire)

created two consular governments, namely, (1.) the whole of

Africa in possession of the Romans, excepting that part

which was under the authority, first of Juba, but now of his

son Ptolemy; and (2.) Asia within the Halys and Taurus, except

the Galatians and the nations under Amyntas, Bithynia, and

the Propontis. He appointed also ten consular governments

in Europe and in the adjacent islands. Iberia Ulterior

extending to Thessaly, the Ætolians, Acarnanians, and the

Epirotic nations who border upon Macedonia; the eighth

Crete, with Cyrenæa; the ninth Cyprus; the tenth Bithynia,

with the Propontis and some parts of Pontus.

<p>'A cheap, very comely, and altogether desirable edition.'—<emph rend="ital">Westminster Gazette.</emph>

<p>But a few years ago such volumes would have been deemed worthy to be considered

<emph rend="ital">éditions de luxe.</emph> To-day, the low price at which they are offered to the public alone

prevents them being so regarded.'—<emph rend="ital">Studio.</emph>

<p>'Handy in shape and size, wonderfully cheap, beautifully printed from the Cambridge text, and illustrated quaintly yet admirably by Mr. Byam Shaw, we have nothing

but praise for it. No one who wants a good and convenient Shakespeare—without

excursusues, discursuses, or even too many notes—can do better, in our opinion, than

subscribe to this issue: which is saying a good deal in these days of cheap reprints.'—

<emph rend="ital">Vanity Fair.</emph>

<p>'What we like about these elegant booklets is the attention that has been paid to the

paper, as well as to the print and decoration; such stout laid paper will last for ages.

On this account alone, the 'Chiswick' <emph rend="ital">should easily be first</emph> among pocket Shakespeares.'— <emph rend="ital">Pall Mall Gazette.</emph>

<p><B>Dr. MURRAY,</B> <emph rend="ital">Editor of the 'Oxford English Dictionary,'</emph> says:—'In this its

latest form, and with its large Supplement and numerous appendices, it is a wonderful

volume, which well maintains its ground against all rivals on its own lines. The 'definitions,' or more properly, 'explanations of meaning' in 'Webster' have always struck me

as particularly terse and well-put; and it is hard to see how anything better could be

done within the limits.'

<p><B>Professor JOSEPH WRIGHT, M.A., Ph.D., D.C.L., LL.D.,</B> <emph rend="ital">Editor of

the 'English Dialect Dictionary,'</emph> says:—'The new edition of <Q>Webster's International

Dictionary</Q> is undoubtedly the most useful and reliable work of its kind in any country.

No one who has not examined the work carefully would believe that such a vast amount

of lexicographical information could possibly be found within so small a compass.'

<p><B>Rev. JOSEPH WOOD, D.D.,</B> <emph rend="ital">Head Master of Harrow,</emph> says:—'I have always

thought very highly of its merits. Indeed, I consider it to be far the most accurate

English Dictionary in existence, and much more reliable than the <Q>Century.</Q> For

daily and hourly reference, <Q>Webster</Q> seems to me unrivalled.'
