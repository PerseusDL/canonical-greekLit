	<p> We must avoid wetting all sorts of ulcers except with wine, unless the ulcer be situated in a joint. For, the dry is nearer to the sound, and the wet to the unsound, since an ulcer is wet, but a sound part is dry. And it is better to leave the part without a bandage unless a unless a cataplasm be applied. Neither do certain ulcers admit of cataplasms, and this is the case with the recent rather than the old, and with those situated in joints. A spare diet and water agree with all ulcers, and with the more recent rather than the older; and with an ulcer which either is inflamed or is about to be so; and where there is danger of gangrene; and with the ulcers an inflammation in joints; and where there is danger of convulsion; and in wounds of the belly; but most especially in fractures of the head and thigh, or any other member in which a fracture may have occurred. In the case of an ulcer, it is not expedient to stand; more especially if the ulcer be situated in the leg; but neither, also, is it proper to sit or walk. But quiet and rest are particularly expedient. Recent ulcers, both the ulcers themselves and the surrounding parts, will be least exposed to inflammation, if one shall bring them to a suppuration as expeditiously as possible, and if the matter is not prevented from escaping by the mouth of the sore; or, if one should restrain the suppuration, so that only a small and necessary quantity of pus may be formed, and the sore may be kept dry by a medicine which does not create irritation. For the part becomes inflamed when rigor and throbbing supervene; for ulcers then get inflamed when suppuration is about to form. A sore suppurates when the blood is changed and becomes <pb n="p.334"/>  heated; so that becoming putrid, it constitutes the pus of such ulcers. When you seem to require a cataplasm, it is not the ulcer itself to which you must apply the cataplasm, but to the surrounding parts, so that the pus may escape and the hardened parts may become soft. Ulcers formed either from the parts having been cut through by a sharp instrument, or excised, admit of medicaments for bloody wounds (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔναιμα</foreign>), and which will prevent suppuration by being desiccant to a certain degree. But, when the flesh has been contused and roughly cut by the weapon, it is to be so treated that it may suppurate as quickly as possible; for thus the inflammation is less, and it is necessary that the pieces of flesh which are bruised and cut should melt away by becoming putrid, being converted into pus, and that new flesh should then grow up.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg028.perseus-eng2" n="2">
<p>In every recent ulcer, except in the belly, it is expedient to cause blood to flow from it abundantly, and as may seem seasonable; for thus will the wound and the adjacent parts be less attacked with inflammation. And, in like manner, from old ulcers, especially if situated in the leg, in a toe or finger, more than in any other part of the body. For when the blood flows they become drier and less in size, as being thus dried up. It is this (<emph rend="italic"> blood?</emph>) especially which prevents such ulcers from healing, by getting into a state of putrefaction and corruption. But, it is expedient, after the flow of the blood, to bind over the ulcer a thick and soft piece of sponge, rather dry than wet, and to place above the sponge some slender leaves. Oil, and all things of an emollient and oily nature, disagree with such ulcers, unless they are getting nearly well. Neither does oil agree with wounds which have been recently inflicted, nor yet do medicines formed with oil or suet, more especially if the ulcer stands in need of more cleansing. And, in a word, it is in summer and in winter that we are to smear with oil these sores that require such medicines. </p></div>

<p>And when you want to apply a bandage, no plasters are to be used until you have rendered the <pb n="p.335"/> sore dry, and then indeed you may apply them. The ulcer is to be frequently cleaned with a sponge, and then a dry and clean piece of cloth is to be frequently applied to it, and in this way the medicine which it is supposed will agree with it is to be applied, either with or without a bandage.</p></div>

<p>When swelling arises around an. ulcer, and if the ulcer remain free from inflammation, there will be a deposit of matter in process of time. And whatever ulcer gets swelled along with inflammation and does not subside as the other parts subside which became inflamed and swelled at the same time, there is a danger that such an ulcer may not unite. When from a fall, or in any other way, a part has been torn or bruised, and the parts surrounding the ulcer have become swelled, and, having suppurated, matter flows from the swelling by the ulcer, if in such cases a cataplasm be required, it should not be applied to the sore itself, but to the surrounding parts, so that the pus may have free exit, and the indurated parts may be softened. But when the parts are softened as the inflammation ceases, then the parts which are separated are to be <pb n="p.336"/> brought toward one another, binding on sponges and applying them, beginning from the sound parts and advancing to the ulcer by degrees. But plenty of leaves are to be bound above the sponge. When the parts are prevented from coming together by a piece of flesh full of humors, it is to be removed. When the ulcer is deep seated in the flesh, it is swelled up, both from the bandaging and the compression. Such an ulcer should be cut up upon a director (specillum) if possible, at the proper time, so as to admit a free discharge of the matter, and then the proper treatment is to be applied as may be needed. For the most part, in every hollow ulcer which can be seen into which can be seen into direct without being any swelling present, if there be putrefaction in it, or if the flesh be flabby and putrid, such an ulcer, and the parts which surround it, will be seen to be black and somewhat livid. And of corroding ulcers, those which are phagedaenic, spread and corrode most powerfully, and, in this case, the parts surrounding the sore will have a black and sub-livid appearance. </p> </div>

With all these, linseed is to be boiled up and mixed by pounding it as a very fine powder. When there is danger of erysipelas seizing the ulcers, the leaves of woad are to be pounded and applied raw in a cataplasm along with linseed, or the linseed is to be moistened with the juice of strychnos or of woad, and applied as a cataplasm. When the ulcer is clean, but both it and the surrounding parts are inflamed, lentil is to be boiled in wine and finely triturated, and, being mixed with a little oil, it is to be applied as a cataplasm; and the leaves of the hip-tree are to be boiled in water and pounded in a fine powder and made into a cataplasm; and apply below a thin, clean <pb n="p.337"/> piece of cloth wetted in wine and oil; and when you wish to produce contraction, prepare the leaves of the hip-tree like the lentil, and the cress; wine and finely-powdered linseed are to be mixed together.

The applications should all be free from moisture, and the sores should not be wetted when this medicine is applied in the form of liniment. This medicine is to be used for old ulcers, and also for recent wounds of the glans penis, and ulcers on the head and ears. Another medicine for the same ulcers:—The dried gall of an ox, the finest honey, white wine, in which the shavings of the lotus have been boiled, frankincense, of myrrh an equal part, of saffron an equal part, the flowers of copper, in like manner of liquids, the greatest proportion of wine, next of honey, and least of the gall. Another:—Wine, a little cedar honey, of dried things, <pb n="p.338"/> the flowers of copper, myrrh, dried pomegranate rind. Another:—Of the roasted flower of copper half a drachm, of myrrh two half-drachms, of saffron three drachms, of honey a small quantity, to be boiled with wine. Another:—Of frankincense a drachm, of gall a drachm, of saffron three drachms; let each of these be dried and finely levigated, then, having mixed, triturate in a very strong sun, pouring in the juice of an unripe grape, until it become of a gelatinous consistence, for three days; then let them be allowed to macerate in an austere, dark-colored, fragrant wine, which is gradually poured upon them. Another:—Boil the roots of the holmoak in sweet white wine; and when it appears to be properly done, having poured off two parts of the wine, and of the lees of wine as free of water as possible one part; then boil, stirring it, so that it may not be burnt, at a gentle fire, until it appear to have attained the proper consistence. Another:—The other things are to be the same; but, not withstanding, instead of the wine, use the strongest white vinegar, and dip into it wool as greasy as can be procured, and then, moistening it with the lees of oil, boil, and pour in the juice of the wild fig-tree, and add Melian alum, and natron, and the flowers of copper, both toasted. This cleanses the ulcers better than the former, but the other is no less desiccant.

<milestone unit="section" resp="Adams" n="14"/><p rend="align(indent)">Swellings which arise on the feet, either spontaneously or otherwise, when neither the swellings nor the inflammation subside under the use of cataplasms, and although sponges or wool, or anything else be bound upon the sound part; but the swelling and inflammation return of themselves again, an influx of blood <pb n="p.343"/> into the veins is the cause, when not occasioned by a bruise. And the same story applies if this happen in any other part of the body. But blood is to be abstracted, especially the from the veins, which are the seat of the influx, if they be conspicuous; but if not, deeper and more numerous scarifications are to be made in the swellings; and whatever part you scarify, this is to be done with the sharpest and most slender instruments of iron. When you have removed the blood, you must not press hard upon the part with the specillum, lest you produce contusion. Bathe with vinegar, and do not allow a clot of blood to remain between the lips of the wounds, and having spread greasy wool with a medicine for bloody wounds, and having carded the woof and made it soft, bind it on, having wetted it with wine and oil. And let the scarified part be so placed that the determination of the blood may be upward and not downward; and do not wet the part at all, and let the patient be put upon a restricted diet and drink water. If upon loosing the bandages you find the scarifications inflamed, apply a cataplasm of the fruit of the chaste-tree and linseed. But if the scarifications become ulcerated and break into one another, we must be regulated by circumstances, and otherwise apply whatever else appears to be proper. </p> </div>

But the varix itself is to be punctured in many places, as circumstances may indicate. </p> </div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Adams" n="16"/><p rend="align(indent)">When you have opened a vein and abstracted blood, and although the fillet be loosed the bleeding does not stop, the member, whether the arm or leg, is to be put into the reverse position to that from which the blood flows; so that the blood may flow backward, and it is to be allowed to remain in this position for a greater or less space of time. Then bind up the part while matters are so, no clots of blood being allowed to remain in the opening. Then having applied a double compress, and wetted it with wine, apply above it clean wool which has been smeared with <pb n="p.344"/> oil. For, although the flow of blood be violent, it will be stopped in this way. If a thrombus be formed in the opening, it will inflame and suppurate. Venesection is to be practiced when the person has dined more or less freely and drunk, and when somewhat heated, and rather in hot weather than in cold. </p> </div>

<milestone unit="section" resp="Adams" n="17"/><p rend="align(indent)">When in cupping, the blood continues to flow after the cupping-instrument has been removed, and if the flow of blood, or serum be copious, the instrument is to be applied again before the part is healed up, so as to abstract what is left behind. Otherwise coagula of blood will be retained in the incisions and inflammatory ulcers will arise from them. In all such cases the parts are to be bathed with vinegar, after which they are not to be wetted; neither must the person lie upon the scarifications, but they are to be anointed with some of the medicines for bloody wounds. When the cupping instrument is to be applied below the knee, or at the knee, it should be done, if possible, while the man stands erect. </p> </div></div>
