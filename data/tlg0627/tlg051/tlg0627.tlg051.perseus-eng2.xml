	<p rend="align(indent)">Time is that wherein there is opportunity, and opportunity is that wherein there is no great time. Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity. However, knowing this, one must attend in medical practice not primarily to plausible theories,<note>The definition shows that in this passage <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμός</foreign> is a generalisation, like the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψις</foreign> of Epicurus, whose language is borrowed. But whereas <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόληψις</foreign> corresponds to a general <emph rend="italic">term</emph> (<emph rend="italic">e. g.</emph> <q rend="double">man</q>), <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμός</foreign> here seems to mean a general <emph rend="italic">proposition</emph> (<emph rend="italic">e. g.</emph> <q rend="double">man is mortal</q>). Later on it means the use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογισμοί</foreign> in making <foreign xml:lang="grc">συλλογισμοί</foreign>, that is, deduction. <q rend="double">Theory</q> and <q rend="double">theorising</q> are the nearest equivalents I can think of.</note> but to experience combined with reason. For a theory is a composite memory of things apprehended with sense-perception. For the sense-perception, coming first in experience and conveying to the intellect the things subjected to it, is clearly imaged, and the intellect, receiving these things many times, noting the occasion, the time and the manner, stores them up in itself and remembers. Now I approve of theorising also if it lays its foundation in incident, and deduces its conclusions in accordance with phenomena. For if theorising lays its foundation in clear fact, it is found to exist in the domain of intellect, which itself receives from other sources each of its impressions. So we must conceive of our nature as being stirred and instructed under compulsion by the great variety of things; and the intellect, as I have said, taking over from nature the impressions, leads us afterwards into truth. But if it <pb n="p.315"/> begins, not from a clear impression, but from a plausible fiction,<note><emph rend="italic">I. e.,</emph> if the general statement from which we deduce conclusions be a plausible but untrue hypothesis. Conclusions drawn from such hypotheses lead to nowhere.</note> it often induces a grievous and troublesome condition. All who so act are lost in a blind alley. Now no harm would be done if bad practitioners received their due wages. But as it is their innocent patients suffer, for whom the violence of their disorder did not appear sufficient without the addition of their physician’s inexperience. I must now pass on to another subject.</p> </div>		
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="2">
<p rend="align(indent)">But conclusions which are merely verbal cannot bear fruit, only those do which are based on demonstrated fact. For affirmation and talk are deceptive and treacherous. Wherefore one must hold fast to facts in generalisations also,<note>Or, possibly, <q rend="double">even from beginning to end.</q></note> and occupy oneself with facts persistently, if one is to acquire that ready and infallible habit which we call <q rend="double">the art of medicine.</q> For so to do will bestow a very great advantage upon sick folk and medical practitioners. Do not hesitate to inquire of laymen, if thereby there seems likely to result any improvement in treatment. For so I think the whole art has been set forth, by observing some part of the final end in each of many particulars, and then combining all into a single whole. So one must pay attention to generalities in incidents, with help and quietness rather than with professions and the excuses that accompany ill-success.</p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="3">
<p rend="align(indent)">Early determination ofthe patient’s —since only what has actually been administered will benefit; emphatic assertion is of no use—is beneficial but complicated. For it is through many turns and changes that all diseases settle into some sort of permanence.<note>Because changes and turns are common in the early stages, to fix the proper treatment early is a complicated matter.</note></p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="4">
<p rend="align(indent)">This piece of advice also will need our consideration, as it contributes somewhat to the whole. For should you begin by discussing fees, you will suggest to the patient either that you will go away and leave him if no agreement be reached, or that you will neglect him and not prescribe any immediate treatment. So one must not be anxious about fixing a fee. For I consider such a worry to be harmful to a troubled patient, particularly if the disease be acute. For the quickness of the disease, offering no opportunity for turning back,<note><emph rend="italic">I. e.</emph> from missed opportunities that have passed away while haggling over fees. It is possible that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναστροφή</foreign> has here the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναστρέφειν καρίδαν</foreign> in Thucydides II. 49, <q rend="double">to upset.</q> An acute disease is not the time to upset a patient with financial worries.</note> spurs on the good physician not to seek his profit but rather to lay hold on reputation. Therefore it is better to reproach a patient you have saved than to extort money from<note>Or, if Coray’s emendation be adopted, <q rend="double">to tease.</q></note> those who are at death’s door.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="5">
<p rend="align(indent)">And yet some patients ask for what is out of the way and doubtful, through prejudice, deserving indeed to be disregarded, but not to be punished. Wherefore you must reasonably oppose them, as they are embarked upon a stormy sea of change. <pb n="p.319"/> For, in heaven’s name, who that is a brotherly<note>The word so translated is fairly common in the <emph rend="italic">Corpus</emph> in the sense of <q rend="double">related.</q> Here it evidently means <q rend="double">a loyal member of the family of physicians.</q></note> physician practises with such hardness of heart as not at the beginning to conduct a preliminary examination of every illness<note>With Ermerins’ reading, <q rend="double">all the illness.</q></note> and prescribe what will help towards a cure, to heal the patient and not to overlook the reward, to say nothing of the desire that makes a man ready to learn?</p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="6">
<p rend="align(indent)">I urge you not to be too unkind, but to consider carefully your patient’s superabundance or means. Sometimes give your services for nothing, calling to mind a previous benefaction or present satisfaction.<note>Or, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδοκιμίην</foreign>, <q rend="double">your present reputation.</q></note> And if there be an opportunity of serving one who is a stranger in financial straits, give full assistance to all such. For where there is love of man, there is also love of the art. For some patients, though conscious that their condition is perilous, recover their health simply through their contentment with the goodness of the physician. And it is well to superintend the sick to make them well, to care for the healthy to keep them well, but also to care for one’s own self, so as to observe what is seemly.</p> </div>

	<p rend="align(indent)">Now those who are buried in deep ignorance of the art cannot appreciate what has been said. In fact such men will be shown up as ignorant of <pb n="p.321"/> medicine, suddenly exalted yet needing good luck. For should wealthy men gain some remission of their trouble, these quacks win reputation through a double good fortune, and if a relapse occurs they stand upon their dignity, having neglected the irreproachable methods of the art, wherewith a good physician, a <q rend="double">brother of the art</q> as he is called, would be at his best. But he who accomplishes his cures easily without making a mistake would transgress none of these methods through want of power;<note>He is trusted, and so can do as he likes. Therefore want of power to influence a patient never compels him to transgress the medical code.</note> for he is not distrusted on the ground of wickedness. For quacks do not attempt treatment when they see an alarming<note>It is quite uncertain whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλεβονώδεα</foreign> is the correct reading, and equally uncertain what it means if it be correct. Erotian’s note recognises two ancient readings, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλεβονώδεα</foreign>, explained as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μετὰ φλυαρίας καὶ πνευματώδους ταραχῆς ἐκκρινόμενα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλεβονώδεα</foreign>, explained as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μετ’ ἀλγήματος οἰδήματα</foreign>. But the general meaning must be <q rend="double">serious,</q> <q rend="double">alarming.</q></note> condition, and avoid calling in other physicians, because they wickedly hate help. And the patients in their pain drift on a sea of twofold wretchedness for not having intrusted themselves to the end to the fuller treatment that is given by the art. For a remission of a disease affords a sick man much relief. Wherefore wanting a healthy condition they do not wish always to submit to the same treatment, therein being in accord with a physician’s versatility.<note>The reader must suspect that in the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰητροῦ ποικιλίη</foreign> is concealed an allusion to frequent changes of the medical attendant. <q rend="double">Changing their doctor every day.</q> The version in the text means that the patients frequently change their minds as do quacks, or as doctors must be ready to change their treatment at a moment’s notice.</note> For the patients <pb n="p.323"/> are in need through heavy expenditure, worshipping incompetence and showing no gratitude when they meet it;<note>These patients <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπορέουσιν</foreign>, and so can scarcely be the same as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔποροι</foreign> of the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign> should be read before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀχαριστέοντες</foreign>, and the sense would then be, <q rend="double">they become poor by showing gratitude to quacks, when they might be well off by employing qualified men.</q></note> when they have the power to be well off, they exhaust themselves about fees, really wishing to be well for the sake of managing their investments or farms, yet without a thought in these matters to receive anything.<note>The greater part of this chapter is hopeless. There seems to be no connexion between the quack doctors of the first part and the wayward patients of the latter part. I suspect that an incongruous passage has been inserted here by some compiler, just as chapter fourteen was so inserted. Perhaps there are gaps in the text, the filling up of which would clear away the difficulty. Probably there is one after <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵνεκεν</foreign>. If the latter part be not an interpolation, the general meaning seems to be that when patients grow worse under quack treatment, they change their doctor and hire another quack. So they both grow worse and lose money. They really want to get well to look after their business, but do not think of the right way to return to work again, <emph rend="italic">i. e.</emph> of employing a qualified medical man.</note></p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="8">
<p rend="align(indent)">So much for such recommendations. For remission and aggravation of a disease require respectively less or more medical assistance. A physician does not violate etiquette even if, being in difficulties on occasion over a patient and in the dark through inexperience, he should urge the calling in of others, in order to learn by consultation the truth about the case, and in order that there may be fellow-workers to afford abundant help. For when a diseased condition is stubborn and the evil grows, in the perplexity of the moment most things go wrong. So on such occasions one must be bold.<note>Or (reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>) <q rend="double">on such occasions one must not be self-confident.</q></note> For never will I lay it down that the art has been <pb n="p.325"/> condemned in this matter.<note><emph rend="italic">I. e.</emph> that because a consultant is necessary the fault lies with the art of medicine.</note> Physicians who meet in consultation must never quarrel, or jeer at one another. For I will assert upon oath, a physician’s reasoning should never be jealous of another. To be so will be a sign of weakness. Those who act thus lightly are rather those connected with the business of the market-place. Yet it is no mistaken idea to call in a consultant. For in all abundance there is lack.<note>No matter how much help you have you can never have enough.</note></p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="9">
<p rend="align(indent)">With all these things it will appear strong evidence for the reality of the art if a physician, while skilfully treating the patient, does not refrain from exhortations not to worry in mind in the eagerness to reach the hour of recovery. For we physicians take the lead in what is necessary for health. And if he be under orders the patient will not go far astray. For left to themselves patients sink through their painful condition, give up the struggle and depart this life. But he who has taken the sick man in hand, if he display the discoveries of the art, preserving nature, not trying to alter it, will sweep away the present depression or the distrust of the moment. For the healthy condition of a human being is a nature that has naturally attained a movement, not alien but perfectly adapted, having <pb n="p.327"/> produced it by means of breath, warmth and coction of humours, in every way, by complete regimen and by everything combined, unless there be some congenital or early deficiency. Should there be such a thing in a patient who is wasting, try to assimilate to the fundamental nature.<note><emph rend="italic">I. e.</emph> try to bring the patient back to his normal condition.</note> For the wasting, even of long standing, is unnatural.</p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg051.perseus-eng2" n="10">
<p rend="align(indent)">You must also avoid adopting, in order to gain a patient,<note>Apparently, in order to increase your practice by fastidiousness in the matter of dress. But the expression is very strange, and should mean, <q rend="double">in order to effect a cure.</q></note> luxurious headgear and elaborate perfume. For excess of strangeness will win you ill-repute, but a little will be considered in good taste, just as pain in one part is a trifle, while in every part it is serious. Yet I do not forbid your trying to please, for it is not unworthy of a physician’s dignity.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">And if for the sake of a crowded audience you do wish to hold a lecture, your ambition is no laudable one, and at least avoid all citations from the poets, for to quote them argues feeble industry. For I forbid in medical practice an industry not pertinent to the art, and laboriously far-fetched,<note>See p. 308.</note> and which therefore has in itself alone an attractive grace. For you will achieve the empty toil of a drone and a drone’s spoils.<note>See p. 308.</note></p>  </div><pb n="p.329"/>

<p rend="align(indent)">A condition too is desirable free from the late-learner’s faults. For his state accomplishes nothing that is immediate, and its remembrance of what is not before the eyes is but tolerable. So there arises a quarrelsome inefficiency, with headstrong outrage, that has no thought for what is seemly, while definitions, professions, oaths, great as far as the gods invoked are concerned,<note>That is, the oaths frantically appeal to all the great gods.</note> come from the physician in charge of the disease, bewildered laymen being lost in admiration of flowery language spoken in continuous reading and instruction, crowding together even before they are troubled by a disease.<note>The construction and translation are uncertain.

Perhaps it is a Latinism. Cf. <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">pastor ab Amphryso.</q></note> Wherever I may be in charge of a case, with no confidence should I call in such men to help as consultants. For in them comprehension of seemly learning is far to seek. Seeing then that they cannot but be unintelligent, I urge that experience is useful, the learning of opinions coming far after. For who is desirous and ambitious of learning truly subtle diversities of opinion, to the neglect of calm and practised skill?

<p rend="align(indent)">When regimen has been restricted you must <pb n="p.331"/> not suppress for long a long-standing desire of the patient.<note>Too strict a regimen may do harm by the patient’s using up his strength in conquering his appetites. Some such verb as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέχειν</foreign> must be substituted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγχειρεῖν</foreign>.</note> In a chronic disease indulgence too helps to set a man on his feet again, if one pay the necessary attention to one who is blind.<note><emph rend="italic">I. e.</emph> the patient does not know what is good for him.</note> As great fear is to be guarded against, so is excessive joy.
