				           <p>In treating fractures and dislocations, the physician must make the extension as
					straight as possible, for this is the most natural direction. But if it incline
					to either side, it should rather turn to that of pronation, for there is thus
					less harm than if it be toward supination. Those, then, who act in such cases
					without deliberation, for the most part do not fall into any great mistake, for
					the person who is to have his arm bound, presents it in the proper position from
					necessity, but physicians who fancy themselves learned in these matters, are
					they who commit blunders. There is no necessity for much study, then, in order
					to set a broken arm, and in a word, any ordinary physician can perform it; but I
					am under the necessity of giving the longer directions on this subject, because
					I know physicians who have the reputation of being skilled in giving the proper
					positions to the arm in binding it up, while in reality they are only showing
					their own ignorance. But many other things in our art are judged of in this
					manner, for people rather admire what is new, although they do not know whether
					it be proper or not, than what they are accustomed to, and know already to be
					proper; and what is strange, they prefer to what is obvious. I must now state
					what the mistakes of medical men are, which I wish to unteach, and what
					instructions I have to give as to the management of the arm; for what I have to
					say regarding it, will apply to the other bones in the body.</p>

				           <head>Part 2</head>
				           <p>The arm, then, for that is the subject we were treating of, was presented in the
					prone position to be bound, but the physician forced his patient to hold it as
					the archers do when they project the shoulder, and in this position he bound it
					up, thinking within<pb n="p.172"/> himself that he was acting according to
					Nature, and in proof of this he pointed out that all the bones in the fore-arm
					were thus in a straight line, and that the integuments both inside and outside,
					were also in a straight line, and that the flesh and nerves (<hi rend="ital">tendons?</hi>) were thus put in their natural position, and he appealed to
					what happens in archery, as a proof of this. And so saying, and so doing, he is
					looked up to as a sage; and yet he forgets that in all the other arts and
					performances, whether executed by strength or dexterity, what is reckoned the
					natural position is not the same, and that in the same piece of work it may
					happen that the natural position of the right arm is not the same as that of the
					left. For there is one attitude in throwing the javelin, and another in
					slinging, another in casting stones, another in boxing, and another in a state
					of repose. And whatever arts one examines, it will be found that the natural
					position of the arms is not the same in each, but that in every case the arms
					are put into the attitude which suits best with the instrument that is used, and
					the work to be performed. In practicing archery, no doubt this is the best
					attitude of the left arm, for gingly-moid extremity of the humerus being fixed
					in the cavity of the ulna, in this position, throws the bones of the forearm and
					arm into a line, as if they constituted a single bone, and all flexion at the
					joint is prevented in this position. It is no doubt certain that the member is
					thus put into the most unbending and extended position possible, so as not to be
					overcome or yield when the string is drawn by the right arm, and thus will the
					archer be enabled to draw the string farthest, and discharge his arrow with the
					greatest force and rapidity, for arrows thus discharged have the greatest
					swiftness and force, and are carried to the greatest distances. But there is
					nothing in common between the binding up of an arm and archery. Moreover, if
					having thus bound up the arm, the physician direct the patient to keep it thus,
					he will occasion him greater pain than he had from the wound itself; and thus
					also, if the physician order him to bend the arm, neither the bones, the nerves,
					nor the flesh will any longer be in the same condition, but will be arranged
					differently, having overcome the bandaging. What use, then, is there of the
					archer's attitude? <pb n="p.173"/>And these mistakes, the physician, conceited
					in his knowledge, would probably not have committed if he had allowed the
					patient himself to present his arm.</p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 3</head>
				           <p> But another physician putting the arm into the state of supination, gives orders
					to extend the arm thus, and bandages it in this position, reckoning it the one
					according to nature, judging thus from the skin, and also fancying the bones to
					be thus in their natural position, because the bone which protrudes at the
					wrist, where the little finger is, appears to be in a line with the bone from
					which people measure the bone of the fore-arm. These things he brings forward as
					proofs that the parts are in their natural state, and he is supposed to speak
					correctly. But, indeed, if the arm be kept stretched in a supine position, it
					will become very painful, and this fact any one may ascertain by extending his
					own arm in this attitude. And also a weaker man grasping with his hands a
					stronger man whose arm is turned in a supine position, could lead him wherever
					he chose, and neither, if a man held a sword thus in his hand, could he make any
					proper use of it, so constrained is this position. And, moreover, if, when a
					physician has thus bound up the arm, he allow it to remain in the same position,
					the patient will endure greater pain if he walk about, but considerable, even if
					he remain at rest. And thus, too, if he shall bend the arm, the muscles and the
					bones must necessarily assume a different position. But, in addition to other
					mischief, he is ignorant of these facts regarding the position, that the bone
					which protrudes at the wrist, close to the little finger, belongs to the
					fore-arm, whereas the one at the joint, from which people measure the fore-arm,
					is the head of the humerus. He fancies that both these belong to the same bone,
					and many others are of this opinion. The latter, in fact, is the same part as
					that which is called the elbow, upon which we sometimes rest, and when he holds
					the arm thus in a supine position, in the first place the bone appears
					distorted, and in the next place the tendons which extend from the carpus along
					the inner side and from the fingers become distorted while the arm has a supine
					position; for these tendons proceed to the bone of the humerus, from which the
					fore-arm is measured. Such, and so<pb n="p.174"/> many mistakes and marks of
					ignorance are committed, regarding the natural construction of the arm. But if
					one will extend a broken arm as I direct, he will turn the bone, situated at the
					extremity of the little finger, into the straight line, and also the one at the
					elbow, and the tendons which stretch from the carpus to the extremity of the
					humerus will be placed in the straight line; and when the arm is suspended in a
					sling, it will be in the same attitude as that in which it was bound up, and
					will give no pain to the patient when he walks about, nor when he lies reclined,
					and will not become fatigued. The man should be so seated that the prominent
					part of the bone may be turned to the brightest light which is at hand, so that
					the operator in making the extension, may be at no loss to discover if it be
					sufficiently straight. The prominence of a broken bone could not escape being
					detected by the hand of an experienced person, when applied for this purpose,
					and, moreover, the projecting part is particularly painful to the touch.</p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 4</head>
				           <p> In cases of fracture in either of the bones of the forearm, it is easier to
					effect a cure if the upper bone be broken, although it be the thicker one, both
					because the sound bone is situated below, and forms a support to it, and because
					the deformity is more easily concealed, there being a thick mass of flesh on the
					upper side, except near to the wrist. But the lower bone is without a covering
					of flesh, is not easily concealed, and requires stronger extension. If it is not
					this bone, but the other which is broken, a more feeble extension proves
					sufficient, but if both be broken, a more powerful extension is required. In the
					case of a young person I have known the extension made more strong than was
					necessary, but in general the extension made is less than what is required. And
					when they are extended, the physician should apply the palms of the hands, and
					adjust the fractured parts and then having rubbed the parts with cerate, but not
					in large quantity so that the bandages may not come off, it is to be bound up in
					this state, care being taken that the hand be not lower than the elbow, but a
					little higher, so that the blood do not flow toward the extremity, but may be
					determined to the upper part; and then it is to be secured with the bandage,<pb n="p.175"/> the head of which is to be placed at the fracture, and the
					bandage should impart firmness to the parts without occasioning strong
					compression. When you have carried the bandage twice or thrice round at the seat
					of the fracture, it is to be carried upward, so that the afflux of blood into it
					may be stopped, and the bandage should terminate there, and the first bandages
					ought not to be long. The head of the second bandage is also to be placed upon
					the seat of the fracture, and a single round of it being made there, it is then
					to be carried downward, and is not to be applied so tight as the other, and
					there should be greater distances between the turns, so that the bandage may
					prove sufficient to revert to the spot where the other terminated. The bandages
					may be rolled to the left hand or to the right, or to whatever side suits best
					with the position of the fractured arm, or according to the inclination which it
					may have. Afterward we must place along the arm, compresses, smeared with a
					little cerate, for thus they occasion less uneasiness, and are more easily
					arranged. And then we must apply the bandages crossways, sometimes to the right
					hand, and sometimes to the left, for the most part beginning below and
					terminating above, but sometimes commencing above and ending below. The parts
					which are thinly covered with flesh should be wrapped round with compresses, and
					inequalities should be made up, not by a number of folds at once, but by
					degrees. Some slack turns are also to be made around the wrist, to this side and
					to that. These two bandages are sufficient at first.</p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 5</head>
				           <p> And these are the signs that the patient has been well treated and properly
					bandaged: if you ask him if the arm feels tight, and he says it does, but
					moderately so, and especially about the fracture; and this reply he should make
					all along, if the bandage be properly applied. And these are symptoms of the
					bandaging being moderately tight; if for the first day and night he fancies that
					the tightness does not diminish, but rather increases; and if on the next day
					there be a soft swelling in the hand, for this is a sign of moderate
					compression, but at the end of the second day the compression should feel less,
					and on the third day the bandaging should appear loose. And if any of<pb n="p.176"/> these symptoms be wanting, you may conclude that the bandaging
					is slacker than it should be; or if any of these symptoms be in excess, you may
					infer that the compression is more than moderate; and judging from these, you
					will apply the next bandages either slacker or tighter. Having removed the
					bandages on the third day, you must make extension and adjust the fracture, and
					bind it up again; and if the first bandaging was moderately applied, the second
					bandaging should be made somewhat tighter. The heads the bandages should be
					placed on the fractures as in the former case; for, so doing, the humors will be
					driven to the extremities, whereas if you bandage any other part beforehand, the
					humors will he forced from it to the seat of the fracture: it is of much
					importance that this should be properly understood. Thus the bandaging and
					compression should always commence at the seat of the fracture, and everything
					else should be conducted on the same principle, so that the farther you proceed
					from the fracture, the compression should always be the less. The bandages
					should never be actually loose, but should be smoothly put on. At each dressing
					the number of bandages should be increased; and the patient, if asked, should
					answer, that he feels the bandages somewhat tighter than on the former occasion,
					especially about the fracture, and everything else in proportion; and with
					respect to the swelling, the pain, and recovery, everything should proceed as
					after the former dressing. But on the third day the outer bandaging should
					appear looser. Then having removed the bandages, you should bind it up again,
					somewhat tighter than before, and with all the bandages which will be required
					on the occasion, and afterwards one ought to experience the same train of
					symptoms as at the former periods of bandaging.</p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 6</head>
				           <p>When the third day arrives, that is to say, the seventh from the first dressing,
					if properly done, the swelling in the hand should be not very great; and the
					part which has been bandaged should be found more slender and less swelled at
					each time, and on the seventh day the swelling should be quite gone, and the
					broken bones should be more readily moved, and admit of being easily adjusted.
					And if these things be so, you should, <pb n="p.177"/>after setting the
					fracture, apply the bandages so as to suit the splints, and a little more tight
					than formerly, unless there be more pain from the swelling in the hand. When you
					have applied the bandages, you must adjust the splints all around the limb, and
					secure them with strings so loose as just to keep them in their place, without
					the application of the splints contributing at all to the compression of the
					arm. After this the pain and recovery should proceed as in the preceding periods
					of the bandaging. But if, on the third day, the patient say that the bandaging
					is loose, you must then fasten the splints, especially at the fracture, but also
					elsewhere, wherever the bandaging is rather loose than tight. The splint should
					be thickest where the fracture protrudes, but it should not be much more so than
					elsewhere. Particular attention should be paid to the line of the arm
					corresponding to the thumb, so that no splint be laid on it, but upon each side
					of it, nor in the line of the little finger where the bone is prominent at the
					wrist, but on each side of it. And if it be found necessary that splints should
					be applied in these directions at the seat of the fracture, they should be made
					shorter than the others, so as that they may not reach the bones which are
					prominent at the wrist, for otherwise there is danger of ulceration, and of the
					tendons being laid bare. The splints should be adjusted anew every third day, in
					a very gentle manner, always keeping in mind that the object of the splints is
					to maintain the lower bandages in their place, and that they are not needed in
					order to contribute to the compression.</p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="7" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 7</head>
				           <p> If, then, you see that the bones are properly adjusted by the first dressings,
					and that there is no troublesome pruritus in the part, nor any reason to suspect
					ulceration, you may allow the arm to remain bandaged in the splints until after
					the lapse of more than twenty days. The bones of the fore-arm generally get
					consolidated in thirty days altogether; but there is nothing precise in this
					matter, for one constitution differs from another, and one period of life from
					another. When you remove the bandages, you must pour hot water on the arm and
					bind it up again, but somewhat slacker, and with fewer bandages than formerly:
					and again on the third day you undo the bandages, and<pb n="p.178"/> bind it
					still more loosely, and with still fewer bandages. And if, while the arm is
					bound up in the splints, you should at any time suspect that the bones do not
					lie properly, or if anything about the bandages annoys the patient, you should
					loose them at the middle of the time, or a little earlier, and apply them again.
					A diet slightly restricted will be sufficient in those cases in which there was
					no external wound at first, or when the bone does not protrude; but one should
					live rather sparingly until the tenth day, as being now deprived of exercise;
					and tender articles of food should be used, such as moderately loosen the
					bowels; but one should abstain altogether from flesh and wine, and then by
					degrees resume a more nourishing diet. This diet. may be laid down as a just
					rule in the treatment of fractures, both as to how they should be treated, and
					what will be the results of a proper plan of treatment; so that one may know,
					that if things do not turn out thus, there has been some defect or excess in the
					treatment. And in this simple plan of treatment it is necessary to attend also
					to the following directions, which some physicians pay little attention to,
					although, when improperly executed, they are capable of marring the whole
					process of bandaging: for if both the bones be broken, or the lower one only,
					and the patient who has got his arm bandaged keep it slung in a shawl, and that
					the shawl is particularly loose at the fracture, so that the arm is not properly
					suspended at this end or that, in this case the bone must necessarily be found
					distorted upwards; whereas, when both bones are thus broken, if the arm recline
					in the shawl at the wrist and elbow, but the rest of it be not kept up, the bone
					in this case will be distorted to the lower side. The greater part of the arm
					and the wrist of the hand should therefore be equally suspended in a broad soft
					shawl. </p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 8</head>
				           <p> When the arm is broken, if one stretch the fore-arm and adjust it while in this
					position, the muscle of the arm will be bound while extended; but when the
					dressing is over, and the patient bends his arm at the elbow, the muscle of the
					arm will assume a different shape. The following, then, is the most natural plan
					of setting the arm: having got a piece of wood a cubit or somewhat less in
					length, like the handles of spades,<pb n="p.179"/> suspend it by means of a
					chain fastened to its extremities at both ends; and having seated the man on
					some high object, the arm is to be brought over, so that the armpit may rest on
					the piece of wood, and the man can scarcely touch the seat, being almost
					suspended; then having brought another seat, and placed one or more leather
					pillows under the arm, so as to keep it a moderate height while it is bent at a
					right angle, the best plan is to put round the arm a broad and soft skin, or
					broad shawl, and to hang some great weight to it, so as to produce moderate
					extension; or otherwise, while the arm is in the position I have described, a
					strong man is to take hold of it at the elbow and pull it downward. But the
					physician standing erect, must perform the proper manipulation, having the one
					foot on some pretty high object, and adjusting the bone with the palms of his
					hands; and it will readily be adjusted, for the extension is good if properly
					applied. Then let him bind the arm, commencing at the fracture, and do otherwise
					as directed above; let him put the same questions and avail himself of the same
					signs to ascertain whether the arm be moderately tight or not; and every third
					day let him bind it anew and make it tighter; and on the seventh or ninth day
					let him bind it up with splints, and leave it so until after the lapse of more
					than thirty days. And if he suspect that the bone is not lying properly, let him
					remove the bandages in the interval, and having adjusted the arm, let him bind
					it up again. The bone of the arm is generally consolidated in forty days. When
					these are past, the dressing is to be removed, and fewer and slacker bandages
					applied instead of it. The patient is to be kept on a stricter diet, and for a
					longer space of time than in the former case; and we must form our judgment of
					it from the swelling in the hand, looking also to the strength of the patient.
					This also should be known, that the arm is naturally inclined outward; to this
					side, therefore, the distortion usually takes place, if not properly treated;
					but indeed, all the other bones are usually distorted during treatment for
					fracture to that side to which they naturally incline. When, therefore, anything
					of this kind is suspected, the arm is to be encircled in a broad shawl, which is
					to be carried round the <pb n="p.180"/>breast, and when the patient goes to
					rest, a compress of many folds, or some such thing, is to be folded and placed
					between the elbow and the side, for thus the bending of the bone will be
					rectified, but care must be taken lest it be inclined too much inwards. </p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 9</head>
				           <p> The human foot is composed of several small bones like the hand. These bones
					therefore are scarcely ever broken, unless the skin at the same time be wounded
					by some sharp and heavy body. The treatment of such injuries, therefore, will be
					delivered under the head of wounds. But if any bone be moved from its place, or
					a joint of the toes be luxated, or any of the bones of the part called the
					tarsus be displaced, it must be forced back again to its place as described with
					regard to the hand; and is to be treated with cerate, compresses, and bandages,
					like the fractures, with the exception of the splints; and is to be secured
					tightly in the same way, and the bandages renewed on the third day; and the
					patient thus bandaged should return the same answers as in fractures, as to the
					bandages feeling tight or slack. All these bones recover perfectly in twenty
					days, except those that are connected with the bones of the leg, and are in a
					line with them. It is advantageous to lie in bed during the whole of this time;
					but the patients, thinking light of the complaint, have not perseverance to do
					this, and they walk about before they get well; wherefore many of these do not
					make a perfect recovery. And often the pain puts them in mind of the injury; and
					deservedly, for the feet sustain the weight of the whole body. When, therefore,
					they walk about before they are whole, the joints which have been luxated are
					cured incompletely; and, on that account, while walking about, they have pains
					in the leg from time to time. </p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 10</head>
				           <p> But those bones which are connected with the bones of the leg are larger than
					the others, and the cure of them when luxuated is more protracted. The mode of
					treatment then is the same; but we must use more bandages and more splints, and
					the bandage is to be carried round to this side and to that, and pressure is to
					be made as in the other cases, particularly at the seat of the luxation, and the
					first circles of the bandages are <pb n="p.181"/>to be made there. And at each
					time the bandages are taken off, much hot water is to be used, for in all
					injuries at joints the affusion of hot water in large quantity is to be had
					recourse to. And the same symptoms of compression and relaxation should manifest
					themselves in the same times, as in the cases formerly treated of, and the
					subsequent bandagings should be conducted in like manner. These cases get
					completely well for the most part in forty days, if the patients have resolution
					to keep their bed; but if not, they are subjected to the complaints formerly
					described, or still worse. </p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="11" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 11</head>
				           <p> In persons who jumping from any high object pitch upon their heel with great
					force, the bones are separated, and the veins pour forth their contents, owing
					to the contusion of the flesh surrounding the bone, and hence a swelling and
					much pain supervene. For this bone (os calcis) is not a small one, protrudes
					beyond the line of the leg, and is connected with important veins and tendons;
					for the back tendon of the leg is inserted into this bone. Such cases are to be
					treated with cerate, and with compresses and bandages; and hot water is to be
					used in large quantity; and they require many bandages, which ought to be
					particularly good and appropriate. And if the patient happen to have a tender
					skin about the heel, nothing is to be done to it; but if, as some have it, the
					skin be thick and hardened, it is to be pared down smoothly and thinned, but
					without wounding it. It is not everybody who can apply the bandage properly in
					such cases; for if one shall bind the parts, as in other accidents about the
					ankle, sometimes bringing a fold round the foot and sometimes round the tendon,
					these turns leave out the heel, which is the seat of the contusion, and thus
					there is danger that the os calcis may sphacelate; and if this should take
					place, the impediment may endure for life and also in all the other cases of
					sphacelus, not proceeding from such a cause as this; as when, from being
					carelessly allowed to lie in a certain position during confinement to bed, the
					heel becomes black, or when a serious wound has occurred in the leg and it is
					long of healing, and is connected with the heel, or when the same thing happens
					in the thigh, or when in any disease a protracted decubitus takes place<pb n="p.182"/> on the back, in all such cases the sores are inveterate,
					troublesome, and frequently break out again, unless particular attention be paid
					to the cure, along with much rest, as in all the cases attended with sphacelus.
					And cases of sphacelus connected with this cause, in addition to other
					inconveniences, are attended with great danger to the whole body. For they are
					apt to be attended with very acute fevers, of the continual type, accompanied
					with tremblings, hiccup, aberration of intellect, and which prove fatal within a
					few days: and there may be lividities of bloody veins<note>By bloody viens is
						meant veins of a largge size, as Galen explains. Contusions of such
						necessarily produce extravasation and hemorrage, and the other bad
						consequences described by our author.</note>, with nausea, and gangrene from
					pressure; these diseases may occur, besides the sphacelus.<note>That gangrene
						should have often supervened in such a case, as described by our author,
						need not appear surprising. It shows that Hippocrates had a wonderful talent
						for original observation when he was able to detect and describe such a
						case; and it ought to teach our profession a lesson of humility, in
						comparing our present state of knowledge with that of our forefathers, when
						we thus find that the "old man of Cos," twenty-two centuries ago, understood
						the nature of this accident better than many of us did not many years
						since.</note> Those which have been described are the most violent
					contusion; but in general the contusions are mild, and no great care is required
					with regard to the treatment, and yet it must be conducted properly. But when
					the contusion appears to be severe, we must do as described above, making many
					turns of the bandage around the heel, sometimes carrying it to the extremity of
					the foot, sometimes to the middle, and sometimes around the leg; and, in
					addition, all the surrounding parts are to be bandaged in this direction and
					that, as formerly described; and the compression should not be made strong, but
					we should make use of many bandages, and it is better also to administer
					hellebore the same day or on the morrow; and the bandages should be removed on
					the third day and reapplied. And these are the symptoms by which we discover
					whether the case will get worse or not: when the extravasated blood, the
					lividities, and the surrounding parts become red and hard, there is danger of an
					exacerbation. But if there be no fever, we must give emetics, as has been said,
					and administer<pb n="p.183"/> the other remedies which are applicable when the
					fever is not of a continual type; but if continual fever be present, we must not
					give strong medicines, but enjoin abstinence from solid food and soups, and give
					water for drink, and not allow wine but <hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi> (a
					composition from vinegar and honey?). But if the case be not going to get worse,
					the ecchymosed and livid parts, and those surrounding them become greenish and
					not hard; for this is a satisfactory proof in all cases of ecchymosis, that they
					are not to get worse; but when lividity is complicated with hardness, there is
					danger that the part may become blackened. And we must so manage the foot as
					that it may be generally raised a little higher than the rest of the body. Such
					a patient will get well in sixty days if he keep quiet.</p>

				           <p> The leg consists of two bones, of which the one is much more slender than the
					other at one part, but not much more slender at another. These are connected
					together at the foot, and form a common epiphysis, but they are not united
					together along the line of the leg; and at the thigh they are united together
					and form an epiphysis, and this epiphysis has a diaphysis; but the other bone in
					a line with the little toe is a little longer. Such is the nature of the bones
					of the leg.</p>

				           <p> Sometimes the bones connected with the foot are displaced, sometimes both bones
					with their epiphysis; sometimes the whole epiphysis is slightly moved, and
					sometimes the other bone. These cases are less troublesome than the same
					accidents at the wrist, if the patients will have resolution to give them rest.
					The mode of treatment is the same as that of the other, for the reduction is to
					be made, as of the other, by means of extension, but greater force is required,
					as the parts of the body concerned are stronger in this case. But, for the most
					part, two men will be sufficient, by making extension in opposite directions,
					but, not withstanding, if they are not sufficiently strong, it is easy to make
					more powerful extension in the following way: having fixed in the ground either
					the nave of a wheel, or any such object, something soft is to be bound round the
					foot, and then some broad thongs of ox-skin being brought round it, the heads of
					the thongs are to be fastened to a pestle or any other piece of wood, the end of
						<pb n="p.184"/>which is to be inserted into the nave, and it, the pestle, is
					to be pulled away, while other persons make counter-extension by grasping the
					shoulders and the ham. It is also sometimes necessary to secure the upper
					extremity otherwise; this if you desire to effect, fasten deeply in the ground a
					round, smooth piece of wood, and place the upper extremity of the piece of wood
					at the perineum, so that it may prevent the body from yielding to the pulling at
					the foot, and, moreover, to prevent the leg while stretched, from inclining
					downward; some person seated at his side should push back the hip, so that the
					body may not turn round with the pulling, and for this purpose, if you think
					fit, pieces of wood may be fastened about the armpits on each side, and they are
					to be stretched by the hands, and thus secured, while another person takes hold
					of the limb at the knee, and aids in thus making counter-extension. Or thus, if
					you prefer it: having bound other thongs of leather about the limb, either at
					the knee, or around the thigh, and having fastened another nave of a wheel in
					the ground above the head, and adjusted the thongs piece of wood adapted to the
					nave, extension may thus be made in the opposite direction to the feet. Or if
					you choose, it may be done thus: instead of the naves, lay a moderate-sized beam
					under the couch, and then having fastened pieces of wood in this beam, both
					before and behind the head, make counter-extension by means of thongs, or place
					windlasses at this extremity and that, and make extension by means of them.
					There are many other methods of making extension. But the best thing is, for any
					physician who practices in a large city, to have prepared a proper wooden
					machine, with all the mechanical powers applicable in cases of fractures and
					dislocation, either for making extension, or acting as a lever. For this purpose
					it will be sufficient to possess a board in length, breadth, and thickness,
					resembling the quadrangular threshing-boards made of oak.</p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="14" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 14</head>
				           <p> When you have made proper extension, it is easy reduce the joint, for the
					displaced bone is thus raised into a line with the other. And the bones are to
					be adjusted with the palms of the hands, pressing upon the projecting bone with
					the one, and making counter-pressure below the ankle with the other. When<pb n="p.185"/> you have replaced the bones, you must apply the bandages while
					the parts are upon the stretch, if you possibly can; but if prevented by the
					thongs, you must loose them, and make counter-extension until you get the
					bandages applied. The bandage is to be applied in the manner formerly described,
					the heads of the bandages being placed on the projecting part, and the first
					turns made in like manner, and so also with regard to the number of compresses
					and the compression; and turns of the bandages are to be brought frequently
					round on this and on that side of the ankle. But this joint must be bound more
					tight at the first dressing than in the case of the hand. But when you have
					applied the bandage, you must place the bandaged part somewhat higher than the
					rest of the body, and in such a position that the foot may hang as little as
					possible. The attenuation of the body is to be made proportionate to the
					magnitude of the luxation, for one luxation is to be a small, and another to a
					great extent. But in general we must reduce more, and for a longer time, in
					injuries about the legs, than in those about the hands; for the former parts are
					larger and thicker than the latter, and it is necessary that the body should be
					kept in a state of rest, and in a recumbent position. There is nothing to
					prevent or require the limb to be bandaged anew on the third day. And all the
					treatment otherwise is to be conducted in like manner, as in the preceding
					cases. And if the patient have resolution to lie quiet, forty days will be
					sufficient for this purpose, if only the bones be properly reduced, but if he
					will not lie quiet, he will not be able to use the limb with ease, and he will
					find it necessary to wear a bandage for a long time. When the bones are not
					properly replaced, but there has been some defect in this respect, the hip, the
					thigh, and the leg become wasted, and if the dislocation be inward, the external
					part of the thigh is wasted, and <hi rend="ital">vice versa</hi>. But for the
					most part the dislocation is inward. </p>

				           <head>Part 15</head>
				           <p> And when both bones of the leg are broken without a wound of the skin, stronger
					extension is required. We may make extension by some of the methods formerly
					described, provided the bones ride over one another to a considerable degree.
					But extension by men is also sufficient, and for the most part two <pb n="p.186"/>strong men will suffice, by making extension and counterextension. Extension
					must naturally be made straight in a line with the leg and thigh, whether on
					account of a fracture of the bones of the leg or of the thigh. And in both cases
					they are to be bandaged while in a state of extension, for the same position
					does not suit with the leg and the arm. For when the fractured bones of the arm
					or fore-arm are bandaged, the fore-arm is suspended in a sling, and if you bind
					them up while extended, the figures of the fleshy parts will be changed in
					bending the arm at the elbow, for the elbow cannot be kept long extended, since
					persons are not in the custom of keeping the joint long in this form, but in a
					bent position, and persons who have been wounded in the arm, and are still able
					to walk about, require to have the arm bent at the elbow-joint. But the leg,
					both in walking and standing, is habitually extended, either completely or
					nearly so, and is usually in a depending position from its construction, and in
					order that it may bear the weight of the rest of the body. Wherefore it readily
					bears to be extended when necessary, and even when in bed the limb is often in
					this position. And when wounded, necessity subdues the understanding, since the
					patients become incapable of raising themselves up, so that they neither think
					of bending the limb nor of getting up erect, but remain lying in the same
					position. For these reasons, neither the same position nor the same mode of
					bandaging applies to the arm and to the leg. If, then, extension by means of men
					be sufficient, we should not have recourse to any useless contrivances, for it
					is absurd to employ mechanical means when not required; but if extension by men
					be not sufficient, you may use any of the mechanical powers which is suitable.
					When sufficiently extended, it will be easy to adjust the bones and bring them
					into their natural position, by straightening and arranging them with the palms
					of the hand. </p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="16" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 16</head>
				           <p> When the parts are adjusted, you should apply the bandages while the limb is in
					a stretched position, making the first turns to the right or to the left, as may
					be most suitable; and the end of the bandage should be placed over the fracture,
					and the first turns made at that place; and then the bandage should be <pb n="p.187"/>carried up the leg, as described with regard to the other
					fractures. But the bandages should be broader and longer, and more numerous, in
					the case of the leg than in that of the arm. And when it is bandaged it should
					be laid upon some smooth and soft object, so that it may not be distorted to the
					one side or the other, and that there may be no protrusion of the bones either
					forward or backward; for this purpose nothing is more convenient than a cushion,
					or something similar, either of linen or wool, and not hard; it is to be made
					hollow along its middle, and placed below the limb. With regard to the canals
						(<hi rend="ital">gutters?</hi>) usually placed below fractured legs, I am at
					a loss whether to advise that they should be used or not. For they certainly are
					beneficial, but not to the extent which those who use them suppose. For the
					canals do not preserve the leg at rest as they suppose; nor, when the rest of
					the body is turned to the one side or the other, does the canal prevent the leg
					from following, unless the patient himself pay attention; neither does the canal
					prevent the limb from being moved without the body to the one side or the other.
					And a board is an uncomfortable thing to have the limb laid upon, unless
					something soft be placed above it. But it is a very useful thing in making any
					subsequent arrangements of the bed and in going to stool. A limb then may be
					well or ill arranged with or without the canal. But the common people have more
					confidence, and the surgeon is more likely to escape blame, when the canal is
					placed under the limb, although it is not <hi rend="ital">secundum artem</hi>.
					For the limb should by all means lie straight upon some level and soft object,
					since the bandaging must necessarily be overcome by any distortion in the
					placing of the leg, whenever or to whatever extent it may be inclined. The
					patient, when bandaged, should return the same answers as formerly stated, for
					the bandaging should be the same, and the same swellings should arise in the
					extremities, and the slackening of the bandages in like manner, and the new
					bandaging on the third day; and the bandaged part should be found reduced in
					swelling; and the new bandagings should be more tightly put on, and more pieces
					of cloth should be used; and the bandages should be carried loosely about the
					foot, unless the wound be near the <pb n="p.188"/>knee. Extension should be made
					and the bones adjusted at every new bandaging; for, if properly treated, and if
					the swelling progress in a suitable manner, the bandaged limb will have become
					more slender and attenuated, and the bones will be more mobile, and yield more
					readily to extension. On the seventh, the ninth, or the eleventh day, the
					splints should be applied as described in treating of the other fractures.
					Attention should be paid to the position of the splints about the ankles and
					along the tendon of the foot which runs up the leg. The bones of the leg get
					consolidated in forty days, if properly treated. But if you suspect that
					anything is wanting to the proper arrangement of the limb, or dread any
					ulceration, you should loose the bandages in the interval, and having put
					everything right, apply them again.</p>

				           <p> But if the other bone (<hi rend="ital">fibula?</hi>) of the leg be broken, less
					powerful extension is required, and yet it must not be neglected, nor be
					performed slovenly, more especially at the first bandaging. For in all cases of
					fracture this object should be attained then as quickly as possible. For when
					the bandage is applied tight while the bones are not properly arranged, the
					properly arranged, the part becomes more painful. The treatment otherwise is the
					same. </p>

				           <p> Of the bones of the leg, the inner one, called the tibia, is the more
					troublesome to manage, and requires the greater extension; and if the broken
					bones are not properly arranged, it is impossible to conceal the distortion, for
					the bone is exposed and wholly uncovered with flesh; and it is much longer
					before patients can walk on the leg when this bone is broken. But if the outer
					bone be broken, it causes much less trouble, and the deformity, when the bones
					are not properly set, is much more easily concealed, the bone being well covered
					with flesh; and the patients speedily get on foot, for it is the inner bone of
					the leg which supports the most of the weight of the body. For along with the
					thigh, as being in a line with weight thrown upon the thigh, the inner bone has
					more work to sustain; inasmuch as it is the head of the thigh-bone which
					sustains the upper part of the body, and it is on the inner and not on the outer
					side of<pb n="p.189"/> the thigh, being in a line with the tibia; and the other
					half of the body approximates more to this line than to the external one; and at
					the same time the inner bone is larger than the outer, as in the fore-arm the
					bone in the line of the little finger is the slenderer and longer. But in the
					joint of the inferior extremity, the disposition of the longer bone is not
					alike, for the elbow and the ham are bent differently. For these reasons when
					the external bone is broken, the patients can soon walk about; but in fractures
					of the inner, it is a long time before they can walk.</p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="19" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 19</head>
				           <p> When the thigh-bone is broken, particular pains should be taken with regard to
					the extension that it may not be insufficient, for when excessive, no great harm
					results from it. For, if one should bandage a limb while the extremities of the
					bone are separated to a distance from one another by the force of the extension,
					the bandaging will not keep them separate, and so the bones will come together
					again as soon as the persons stretching it let go their hold; for the fleshy
					parts (<hi rend="ital">muscles?</hi>) being thick and strong, are more powerful
					than the bandaging, instead of being less so. In the case then which we are now
					treating of, nothing should be omitted in order that the parts may be properly
					distended and put in a straight line; for it is a great disgrace and an injury
					to exhibit a shortened thigh. For the arm, when shortened, might be concealed,
					and the mistake would not be great; but a shortened thigh-bone would exhibit the
					man maimed. For when the sound limb is placed beside it, being longer than the
					other, it exposes the mistake, and therefore it would be to the advantage of a
					person who would be improperly treated that both his legs should be broken,
					rather than either of them; for in this case the one would be of the same length
					as the other. When, then, proper extension has been made, you must adjust the
					parts with the palms of the hands, and bandage the limb in the manner formerly
					described, placing the hands of the bandages as was directed, and making the
					turns upward. And the patient should return the same answers to the same
					questions as formerly, should be pained and recover in like manner, and should
					have the bandaging<pb n="p.190"/> renewed in the same way; and the application
					of the splints should be the same. The thigh-bone is consolidated in forty
					days.</p>

				           <p> But this also should be known, that the thigh-bone is curved rather to the
					outside than to the inside, and rather forward than backward; when not properly
					treated, then, the distortions are in these directions; and the bone is least
					covered with flesh at the same parts, so that the distortion cannot be
					concealed. If, therefore, you suspect anything of this kind, you should have
					recourse to the mechanical contrivances recommended in distortion of the arm.
					And a few turns of the bandage should be brought round by the hip and the loins,
					so that the groin and the articulation near the perineum may be included in the
					bandage; and moreover, it is expedient that the extremities of the splints
					should not do mischief by being placed on parts not covered with the bandages.
					The splints, in fact, should be carefully kept off the naked parts at both ends;
					and the arrangement of them should be so managed, as that they may not be placed
					on the natural protuberances of the bone at the knee-joint, nor on the tendon
					which is situated there.</p>

				           <p> The swellings which arise in the ham, at the foot, or in any other part from the
					pressure, should be well wrapped in unscoured and carded wool, washed with wine
					and oil, and anointed with cerate, before bandaging; and if the splints give
					pain they should be slackened. You may sooner reduce the swellings, by laying
					aside the splints, and applying plenty of bandages to them, beginning from below
					and rolling upward; for thus the swellings will be most speedily reduced, and
					the humors be propelled to the parts above the former bandages. But this form of
					bandaging must not be used unless there be danger of vesications or blackening
					in the swelling, and nothing of the kind occurs unless the fracture be bound too
					tight, or unless the limb be allowed to hang, or it be rubbed with the hand, or
					some other thing of an irritant nature be applied to the skin. </p>

				           <p> More injury than good results from placing below the thigh a canal which does
					not pass farther down than the ham,<pb n="p.191"/> for it neither prevents the
					body nor the leg from being moved without the thigh. And it creates uneasiness
					by being brought down to the ham, and has a tendency to produce what of all
					things should be avoided, namely, flexion at the knee, for this completely
					disturbs the bandages; and when the thigh and leg are bandaged, if one bend the
					limb at the knee, the muscles necessarily assume another shape, and the broken
					bones are also necessarily moved. Every endeavor then should be made to keep the
					ham extended. But it appears to me, that a canal which embraces the limb from
					the nates to the foot is of use. And moreover, a shawl should be put loosely
					round at the ham, along with the canal, as children are swathed in bed; and
					then, if the thigh-bone gets displaced either upward or to the side, it can be
					more easily kept in position by this means along with the canal. The canal then
					should be made so as to extend all along the limb or not used at all. </p>

				           <p> The extremity of the heel should be particularly attended to, so that it may be
					properly laid, both in fractures of the leg and of the thigh. For if the foot be
					placed in a dependent position, while the rest of the body is supported, the
					limb must present a curved appearance at the forepart of the leg; and if the
					heel be placed higher than is proper, and if the rest of the leg be rather too
					low, the bone at the forepart of the leg must present a hollow, more especially
					if the heel of the patient be naturally large. But all the bones get
					consolidated more slowly, if not laid properly, and if not kept steady in the
					same position, and in this case the callus is more feeble. </p>

				           <p> These things relate to cases in which there is fracture of the bones without
					protrusion of the same or wound of any other kind. In those cases in which the
					bones are simply broken across, and are not comminuted, but protrude, if reduced
					the same day or next, and secured in their place, and if there be no reason to
					anticipate that any splintered bones will come away; and in those in which the
					broken bones do not protrude, nor is the mode of fracture such that there is
					reason to expect the splinters will come out, some physicians heal the sores in
					a way which neither does much good nor harm, by means of a cleansing<pb n="p.192"/> application, applying pitch ointment, or some of the dressings
					for fresh wounds, or anything else which they are accustomed to do, and binding
					above them compresses wetted with wine, or greasy wool, or something else of the
					like nature. And when the wounds become clean and are new healed, they endeavor
					to bind up the limb with plenty of bandages, and keep it straight with treatment
					does some good, and never much harm. The bones, however, can never be equally
					well restored to their place, but the part is a little more swelled than it
					should be; and the limb will be somewhat shortened, provided both bones either
					of the leg or fore-arm have been fractured.</p>

			         <div type="textpart" n="25" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 25</head>
				           <p> There are others who treat such cases at first with bandages, applying them on
					both sides of the seat of the injury, but omit them there, and leave the wound
					uncovered, and afterward they apply to the wound some cleansing medicine, and
					complete the dressing with compresses dipped in wine and greasy wool. This plan
					of treatment is bad, and it is clear that those who adopt this mode of practice
					are guilty of great mistakes in other cases of fracture as well as these. For it
					is a most important consideration to know in what manner the head of the bandage
					should be placed and at what part the greatest pressure should be, and what
					benefits would result from applying the end of the bandage and the pressure at
					the proper place, and what mischiefs would result from applying the head of the
					bandage and the pressure otherwise than at the proper place. Wherefore it has
					been stated in the preceding part of the work what are the results of either;
					and the practice of medicine bears witness to the truth of it, for in a person
					thus bandaged, a swelling must necessarily arise on the wound. For, if even a
					sound piece of skin were bandaged on either side, and a part were left in the
					middle, the part thus left unbandaged would become most swelled, and would
					assume a bad color; how then could it be that a wound would not suffer in like
					manner? The wound then must necessarily become discolored and its lips everted,
					the discharge will be ichorous and without pus, and the bones, which should not
					have got into a state of necrosis, exfoliate; and the wound gets into a
					throbbing and inflamed condition. And they<pb n="p.193"/> are obliged to apply a
					cataplasm on account of the swelling, but this is an unsuitable application to
					parts which are bandaged on both sides, for a useless load is added to the
					throbbing which formerly existed in it. At last they loose the bandages when
					matters get very serious, and conduct the rest of the treatment without
					bandaging; and notwithstanding, if they meet with another case of the same
					description, they treat it in the same manner, for they do not think that the
					application of the bandages on both sides, and the exposure of the wound are the
					cause of what happened, but some other untoward circumstance. Wherefore I would
					not have written so much on this subject, if I had not well known that this mode
					of bandaging is unsuitable, and yet that many conduct the treatment in this way,
					whose mistake it is of vital importance to correct, while what is here said is a
					proof, that what was formerly written as to the circumstances under which
					bandages should be tightly applied to fractures or otherwise has been correctly
					written. </p>
			         </div>
			         <div type="textpart" n="26" subtype="section">
				           <head>Part 26</head>
				           <p> As a general rule it may be said, that in those cases in which a separation of
					bone is not expected, the same treatment should be applied as when the fractures
					are not complicated with an external wound; for the extension, adjustment of the
					bones, and the bandaging, are to be conducted in the same manner. To the wound
					itself a cerate mixed with pitch is to be applied, a thin folded compress is to
					be bound upon it, and the parts around are to be anointed with white cerate. The
					cloths for bandages and the other things should be torn broader than in cases in
					which there is no wound, and the first turn of the bandage should be a good deal
					broader than the wound. For a narrower bandage than the wound binds the wound
					like a girdle, which is not proper, or the first turn should comprehend the
					whole wound, and the bandaging should extend beyond it on both sides. The
					bandage then should be put on in the direction of the wound, and should be not
					quite so tight as when there is no wound, but the bandage should be otherwise
					applied in the manner described above. The bandages should be of a soft
					consistence, and more especially so in such cases than in those not complicated
					with a wound. The number of bandages should not<pb n="p.194"/> be smaller, but
					rather greater than those formerly described. When applied, the patient should
					have the feeling of the parts being properly secured, but not too tight, and in
					particular he should be able to say that they are firm about the wound. And the
					intervals of time during which the parts seem to be properly adjusted, and those
					in which they get loose, should be the same as those formerly described. The
					bandages should be renewed on the third day, and the after treatment conducted
					in the same manner as formerly described, except that in the latter case the
					compression should be somewhat less than in the former. And if matters go on
					properly, the parts about the wound should be found at every dressing always
					more and more free of swelling, and the swelling should have subsided on the
					whole part comprehended by the bandages. And the suppurations will take place
					more speedily than in the case of wounds treated otherwise; and the pieces of
					flesh in the wound which have become black and dead, will sooner separate and
					fall off under this plan of treatment than any other, and the sore will come
					more quickly to cicatrization when thus treated than otherwise. The reason of
					all this is, that the parts in which the wound is situated, and the surrounding
					parts, are kept free of swelling. In all other respects the treatment is to be
					conducted as in cases of fracture without a wound of the integuments. Splints
					should not be applied. On this account the bandages should be more numerous than
					in the former case, both because they must be put on less tight, and because the
					splints are later of being applied. But if you do apply the splints, they should
					not be applied along the wound, and they are to be put on in a loose manner,
					especial care being taken that there may be no great compression from the
					splints. This direction has been formerly given. And the diet should be more
					restricted, and for a longer period, in those cases in which there is a wound at
					the commencement, and when the bones protrude through the skin; and, in a word,
					the greater the wound, the more severe and protracted should the regimen be.

				           <p> The treatment of the sores is the same in those cases of fracture in which there
					was no wound of the skin at first, but<pb n="p.195"/> one has formed in the
					course of treatment, owing to the pressure of the splints occasioned by the
					bandages, or from any other cause. In such cases it is ascertained that there is
					an ulcer, by the pain and the throbbing; and the swelling in the extremities
					becomes harder than usual, and if you apply your finger the redness disappears,
					but speedily returns. If you suspect anything of the kind you must loose the
					dressing, if there be any itching below the under-bandages, or in any other part
					that is bandaged, and used a pitched cerate instead of the other. If there be
					nothing of that, but if the ulcer be found in an irritable state, being very
					black and foul, and the fleshy parts about to suppurate, and the tendons to
					slough away, in these cases no part is to be exposed to the air, nor is anything
					to be apprehended from these suppurations, but the treatment is to be conducted
					in the same manner as in those cases in which there was an external wound at
					first. You must begin to apply the bandages loosely at the swelling in the
					extremities, and then gradually proceed upward with the bandaging, so that it
					may be tight at no place, but particularly firm at the sore, and less so
					elsewhere. The first bandages should be clean and not narrow, and the number of
					bandages should be as great as in those cases in which the splints were used, or
					somewhat fewer. To the sore itself a compress, anointed with white cerate, will
					be sufficient, for if a piece of flesh or nerve (<hi rend="ital">tendon?</hi>)
					become black, it will fall off; for such sores are not to be treated with acrid,
					but with emollient applications, like burns. The bandages are to be renewed
					every third day, and no splints are to be applied, but rest is to be more
					rigidly maintained than in the former cases, along with a restricted diet. It
					should be known, that if any piece of flesh or tendon be to come away, the
					mischief will spread much less, and the parts will much more speedily drop off,
					and the swelling in the surrounding parts will much more completely subside,
					under this treatment, than if any of the cleansing applications be put upon the
					sore. And if any part that is to come away shall fall off, the part will
					incarnate sooner when thus treated than otherwise, and will more speedily
					cicatrize. Such are the good effects of knowing how a bandage can be well and
					moderately applied.<pb n="p.196"/> But a proper position, the other parts of the
					regimen, and suitable bandages cooperate. </p>

				           <p> If you are deceived with regard to a recent wound, supposing there will be no
					exfoliation of the bones, while they are on the eve of coming out of the sore,
					you must not hesitate to adopt this mode of treatment; for no great mischief
					will result, provided you have the necessary dexterity to apply the bandages
					well and without doing any harm. And this is a symptom of an exfoliation of bone
					being about to take place under this mode of treatment; pus runs copiously from
					the sore, and appears striving to make its escape. The bandage must be renewed
					more frequently on account of the discharge, since otherwise fevers come on; if
					the sore and surrounding parts be compressed by the bandages they become wasted.
					Cases complicated with the exfoliation of very small bones, do not require any
					change of treatment, only the bandages should be put on more loosely, so that
					the discharge of pus may not be intercepted, but left free, and the dressings
					are to be frequently renewed until the bone exfoliate, and the splints should
					not be applied until then.</p>

				           <p> Those cases in which the exfoliation of a larger piece of bone is expected,
					whether you discover this at the commencement, or perceive subsequently that it
					is to happen, no longer require the same mode of treatment, only that the
					extension and arrangement of the parts are to be performed in a manner that has
					been described; but having formed double compresses, not less than half a fathom
					in breadth (being guided in this by the nature of the wound), and considerably
					shorter than what would be required to go twice round the part that is wounded,
					but considerably longer than to go once round, and in number what will be
					sufficient, these are to be dipped in a black austere wine; and beginning at the
					middle, as is done in applying the double-headed bandage, you are to wrap the
					part around and proceed crossing the heads in the form of the bandage called
					"ascia." These things are to be done at the wound, and on both sides of it; and
					there must be no compression, but they are to be laid on so as to give support
					to the wound. And on the wound itself is to be applied the pitched cerate, or
					one of the applications<pb n="p.197"/> to recent wounds, or any other medicine
					which will suit with the embrocation. And if it be the summer season, the
					compresses are to be frequently damped with wine; but if the winter season,
					plenty of greasy wool, moistened with wine and oil, should be applied. And a
					goat's skin should be spread below, so as to carry off the fluids which run from
					the wound; these must be guarded against, and it should be kept in mind, that
					parts which remain long in the same position are subject to excoriations which
					are difficult to cure. </p>

				           <p> In such cases as do not admit of bandaging according to any of the methods which
					have been described, or which will be described, great pains should be taken
					that the fractured part of the body be laid in a right position, and attention
					should be paid that it may incline upward rather than downward. But if one would
					wish to do the thing well and dexterously, it is proper to have recourse to some
					mechanical contrivance, in order that the fractured part of the body may undergo
					proper and not violent extension; and this means is particularly applicable in
					fractures of the leg. There are certain physicians who, in all fractures of the
					leg, whether bandages be applied or not, fasten the sole of the foot to the
					couch, or to some other piece of wood which they have fixed in the ground near
					the couch. These persons thus do all sorts of mischief but no good; for it
					contributes nothing to the extension that the foot is thus bound, as the rest of
					the body will no less sink down to the foot, and thus the limb will no longer be
					stretched, neither will it do any good toward keeping the limb in a proper
					position, but will do harm, for when the rest of the body is turned to this side
					or that, the bandaging will not prevent the foot and the bones belonging to it
					from following the rest of the body. For if it had not been bound it would have
					been less distorted, as it would have been the less prevented from following the
					motion of the rest of the body. But one should sew two balls of Egyptian
					leather, such as are worn by persons confined for a length of time in large
					shackles, and the balls should have coats on each side, deeper toward the wound,
					but shorter toward the joints; and the balls should be well stuffed and soft,
					and fit well, the one above the <pb n="p.198"/>ankles, and the other below the
					knee. Sideways it should have below two appendages, either of a single or double
					thong, and short, like loops, the one set being placed on either side of the
					ankle, and the other on the knee. And the other upper ball should have others of
					the same kind in the same line. Then taking four rods, made of the cornel tree,
					of equal length, and of the thickness of a finger, and of such length that when
					bent they will admit of being adjusted to the appendages, care should be taken
					that the extremities of the rods bear not upon the skin, but on the extremities
					of the balls. There should be three sets of rods, or more, one set a little
					longer than another, and another a little shorter and smaller, so that they may
					produce greater or less distention, if required. Either of these sets of rods
					should be placed on this side and that of the ankles. If these things be
					properly contrived, they should occasion a proper and equable extension in a
					straight line, without giving any pain to the wound; for the pressure, if there
					is any, should be thrown at the foot and the thigh. And the rods are
					commodiously arranged on either side of the ankles, so as not to interfere with
					the position of the limb; and the wound is easily examined and easily arranged.
					And, if thought proper, there is nothing to prevent the two upper rods from
					being fastened to one another; and if any light covering be thrown over the
					limb, it will thus be kept off from the wound. If, then, the balls be well made,
					handsome, soft, and newly stitched, and if the extension by the rods be properly
					managed, as has been already described, this is an excellent contrivance; but if
					any of them do not fit properly, it does more harm than good. And all other
					mechanical contrivances should either be properly done, or not be had recourse
					to at all, for it is a disgraceful and awkward thing to use mechanical means in
					an unmechanical way. </p>

				           <p> Moreover, the greater part of physicians treat fractures, both with and without
					an external wound, during the first days, by means of unwashed wool, and there
					does not appear to be anything improper in this. It is very excusable for those
					who are called upon to treat newly-received accidents of this kind, and who have
					no cloth for bandages at hand, to do them up <pb n="p.199"/>with wool; for,
					except cloth for bandages, one could not have anything better than wool in such
					cases; but a good deal should be used for this purpose, and it should be well
					carded and not rough, for in small quantity and of a bad quality it has little
					power. But those who approve of binding up the limb with wool for a day or two,
					and on the third and fourth apply bandages, and make the greatest compression
					and extension at that period, such persons show themselves to be ignorant of the
					most important principles of medicine; for, in a word, at no time is it so
					little proper to disturb all kinds of wounds as on the third and fourth day; and
					all sort of probing should be avoided on these days in whatever other injuries
					are attended with irritation. For, generally, the third and fourth day in most
					cases of wounds, are those which give rise to exacerbations, whether the
					tendency be to inflammation, to a foul condition of the sore, or to fevers. And
					if any piece of information be particularly valuable this is; to which of the
					most important cases in medicine does it not apply? and that not only in wounds
					but in many other diseases, unless one should call all other diseases wounds.
					And this doctrine is not devoid of a certain degree of plausibility, for they
					are allied to one another in many respects. But those who maintain that wool
					should be used until after the first seven days, and then that the parts should
					be extended and adjusted, and secured with bandages, would appear not to be
					equally devoid of proper judgment, for the proper judgment, for the most
					dangerous season for inflammation is then past, and the bones being loose can be
					easily set after the lapse of these days. But still this mode of treatment is
					far inferior to that with bandages from the commencement; for, the latter method
					exhibits the patient on the seventh day free from inflammation, and ready for
					complete bandaging with splints; while the former method is far behind in this
					respect, and is attended with many other bad effects which it would be tedious
					to describe. </p>

				           <p>In those cases of fracture in which the bones protrude and cannot be restored to
					their place, the following mode of reduction may be practiced:- Some small
					pieces of iron are to be prepared like the levers which the cutters of stone
					make use of, one being<pb n="p.200"/> rather broader and another narrower; and
					there should be three of them at least, and still more, so that you may use
					those that suit best; and then, along with extension, we must use these as
					levers, applying the under surface of the piece of iron to the under fragment of
					the bone, and the upper surface to the upper bone; and, in a word, we must
					operate powerfully with the lever as we would do upon a stone or a piece of
					wood. The pieces of iron should be as strong as possible, so that they may not
					bend. This is a powerful assistance, provided the pieces of iron be suitable,
					and one use them properly as levers. Of all the mechanical instruments used by
					men, the most powerful are these three, the axis in peritrochio, the lever, and
					the wedge. Without these, one or all, men could not perform any of their works
					which require great force. Wherefore, reduction with the lever is not to be
					despised, for the bones will be reduced in this way, or not at all. But if the
					upper fragment which rides over the other does not furnish a suitable point of
					support a suitable point of support for the lever, but the protruding part is
					sharp, you must scoop out of the bone what will furnish a proper place for the
					lever to rest on. The lever, along with extension, may be had recourse to on the
					day of the accident, or next day, but by no means on the third, the fourth, and
					the fifth. For if the limb is disturbed on these days, and yet the fractured
					bones not reduced, inflammation will be excited, and this no less if they are
					reduced; for convulsions are more apt to occur if reduction take place, than if
					the attempt should fail. These facts should be well known, for if convulsions
					should come on when reduction is effected, there is little hope of recovery; but
					it is of use to displace the bones again if this can be done with out trouble.
					For it is not at the time when the parts are in a particularly relaxed condition
					that convulsions and tetanus are apt to supervene, but when they are more than
					usually tense. In the case we are now treating of, we should not disturb the
					limb on the aforesaid days, but strive to keep the wound as free from
					inflammation as possible, and especially encourage suppuration in it. But when
					seven days have elapsed, or rather more, if there be no fever, and if the wound
					be not inflamed, then there will be less to prevent an attempt at reduction,<pb n="p.201"/> if you hope to succeed; but otherwise you need not take and give
					trouble in vain.</p>

				           <p> When you have reduced the bones to their place, the modes of treatment, whether
					you expect the bones to exfoliate or not, have been already described. All those
					cases in which an exfoliation of bone is expected, should be treated by the
					method of bandaging with cloths, beginning for the most part at the middle of
					the bandage, as is done with the double-headed bandage; but particular attention
					should be paid to the shape of the wound, so that its lips may gape or be
					distorted as little as possible under the bandage. Sometimes the turns of the
					bandage have to be made to the right, and sometimes to the left, and sometimes a
					double-headed bandage is to be used.</p>

				           <p> It should be known that bones, which it has been found impossible to reduce, as
					well as those which are wholly denuded of flesh, will become detached. In some
					cases the upper part of the bone is laid bare, and in others the flesh dies all
					around; and, from a sore of long standing, certain of the bones become carious,
					and some not, some more, and some less; and in some the small, and in others the
					large bones. From what has been said it will be seen, that it is impossible to
					tell in one word when the bones will separate. Some come away more quickly,
					owing to their smallness, and some from being merely fixed at the point; and
					some, from pieces not separating, but merely exfoliating, become dried up and
					putrid; and besides, different modes of treatment have different effects. For
					the most part, the bones separate most quickly in those cases in which
					suppuration takes place most quickly, and when new flesh is most quickly formed,
					and is particularly sound, for the flesh which grows up below in the wound
					generally elevates the pieces of bone. It will be well if the whole circle of
					the bone separate in forty days; for in some cases it is protracted to sixty
					days, and in some to more; for the more porous pieces of bone separate more
					quickly, but the more solid come away more slowly; but the other smaller
					splinters in much less time, and others otherwise. A portion of bone which
					protrudes should be sawn off for the following reasons: if it cannot be reduced,
					and if it appears<pb n="p.202"/> that only a small piece is required in order
					that it may get back into its place; and if it be such that it can be taken out,
					and if it occasions inconvenience and irritates any part of the flesh, and
					prevents the limb from being properly laid, and if, moreover, it be denuded of
					flesh, such a piece of bone should be taken off. With regard to the others, it
					is not of much consequence whether they be sawed off or not. For it should be
					known for certain, that such bones as are completely deprived of flesh, and have
					become dried, all separate completely. Those which are about to exfoliate should
					not be sawn off. Those that will separate completely must be judged of from the
					symptoms that have been laid down.</p>

				           <p> Such cases are to be treated with compresses and vinous applications, as
					formerly laid down regarding bones which will separate. We must avoid wetting it
					at the beginning with anything cold; for there is danger of febrile rigors, and
					also of convulsions; for convulsions are induced by cold things, and also
					sometimes by wounds. It is proper to know that the members are necessarily
					shortened in those cases in which the bones have been broken, and have healed
					the one across the other, and in those cases in which the whole circle of the
					bone has become detached.</p>

				           <p> Those cases in which the bone of the thigh, or of the arm, protrudes, do not
					easily recover. For the bones are large, and contain much marrow; and many
					important nerves, muscles, and veins are wounded at the same time. And if you
					reduce them, convulsions usually supervene; and, if not reduced, acute bilious
					fevers come on, with singultus and mortification. The chances of recovery are
					not fewer in those cases in which the parts have not been reduced, nor any
					attempts made at reduction. Still more recover in those cases in which the
					lower, than those in which the upper part of the bone protrudes; and some will
					recover when reduction has been made, but very rarely indeed. For modes of
					treatment and peculiarity of constitution make a great difference as to the
					capability of enduring such an injury. And it makes a great difference if the
					bones of the arm and of the thigh protrude to the inside; for there are many and
					important vessels situated there, some of which, if wounded, will prove fatal;
					there are such also on the outside, but of less im-<pb n="p.203"/>portance. In
					wounds of this sort, then, one ought not to be ignorant of the dangers, and
					should prognosticate them in due time. But if you are compelled to have recourse
					to reduction, and hope to succeed, and if the bones do not cross one another
					much, and if the muscles are not contracted (for they usually are contracted),
					the lever in such cases may be advantageously employed.</p>

				           <p> Having effected the reduction, you must give an emollient draught of hellebore
					the same day, provided it has been reduced on the day of the accident, but
					otherwise it should not be attempted. The wound should be treated with the same
					things as are used in fractures of the bones of the head, and nothing cold
					should be applied; the patient should be restricted from food altogether, and if
					naturally of a bilious constitution, he should have for a diet a little fragrant
						<hi rend="ital">oxyglyky</hi> sprinkled on water; but if he is not bilious,
					he should have water for drink; and if fever of the continual type come on, he
					is to be confined to this regimen for fourteen days at least, but if he be free
					of fever, for only seven days, and then you must bring him back by degrees to a
					common diet. To those cases in which the bones have not been reduced, a similar
					course of medicine should be administered, along with the same treatment of the
					sores and regimen; and in like manner the suspended part of the body should not
					be stretched, but should rather be contracted, so as to relax the parts about
					the wound. The separation of the bones is protracted, as also was formerly
					stated. But one should try to escape from such cases, provided one can do so
					honourably, for the hopes of recovery are small, and the dangers many; and if
					the physician do not reduce the fractured bones he will be looked upon as
					unskillful, while by reducing them he will bring the patient nearer to death

				           <p> Luxations and subluxations at the knee are much milder accidents than
					subluxations and luxations at the elbow. For the knee-joint, in proportion to
					its size, is more compact than that of the arm, and has a more even
					conformation, and is <pb n="p.204"/>rounded, while the joint of the arm is
					large, and has many cavities. And in addition, the bones of the leg are nearly
					of the same length, for the external one overtops the other to so small an
					extent as hardly to deserve being mentioned, and therefore affords no great
					resistance, although the external nerve (<hi rend="ital">ligament?</hi>) at the
					ham arises from it; but the bones of the fore-arm are unequal, and the shorter
					is considerably thicker than the other, and the more slender (<hi rend="ital">ulna?</hi>) protrudes, and passes up above the joint, and to it (the <hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) are attached the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) which go downward to the junction of the bones; and the

					the ligaments in the arm than the thick bone (<hi rend="ital">radius?</hi>). The
					configuration then of the articulations, and of the bones of the elbow, is such
					as I have described. Owing to their configuration, the bones at the knee are
					indeed frequently dislocated, but they are easily reduced, for no great
					inflammation follows, nor any constriction of the joint. They are displaced for
					the most part to the inside, sometimes to the outside, and occasionally into the
					ham. The reduction in all these cases is not difficult, but in the dislocations
					inward and outward, the patient should be placed on a low seat, and the thigh
					should be elevated, but not much. Moderate extension for the most part

					arm (<hi rend="ital">humerus?</hi>) from passing over it. In dislocations of
					this kind, extension should be made in the manner described when treating of the
					bandaging of fractured bones of the arm, extension being made upward at the
					armpit, while the parts at the elbow are pushed downward, for in this manner can
					the humerus be most readily raised above its cavity; and when so raised, the
					reduction is easy with the palms of the hand, the one being applied so as to
					make pressure on the protuberant part of the arm, and the other making
					counter-pressure, so as to push the bone of the fore-arm into the joint. This
					method answers with both cases. And perhaps this is the most suitable mode of
					reduction in such a case of dislocation. The parts may be reduced by extension
					in a straight line, but less readily than thus.</p>

				           <p> If the arm be dislocated forward- this rarely happens, indeed, but what would a
					sudden shock not displace? for many other things are removed from their proper
					place, notwith-<pb n="p.206"/>standing a great obstacle,- in such a violent
					displacement the part (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>) which passes above the
					prominent part of the bones is large, and the stretching of the nerves (<hi rend="ital">ligaments?</hi>) is intense; and yet the parts have been so
					dislocated in certain cases. The following is the symptom of such a
					displacement: the arm cannot be bent in the least degree at the elbow, and upon
					feeling the joint the nature of the accident becomes obvious. If, then, it is
					not speedily reduced, strong and violent inflammation, attended with fever, will
					come on, but if one happen to be on the spot at the time it is easily reduced. A
					piece of hard linen cloth (or a piece of hard linen, not very large, rolled up
					in a ball, will be sufficient) is to be placed across the bend of the elbow, and
					the arm is then to be suddenly bent at the elbow, and the hand brought up to the
					shoulder. This mode of reduction is sufficient in such displacements; and
					extension in the straight line can rectify this manner of dislocation, but we
					must use at the same time the palms of the hands, applying the one to the
					projecting part of the humerus at the bend of the arm for the purpose of pushing
					it back, and applying the other below to the sharp extremity of the elbow, to
					make counter-pressure, and incline the parts into the straight line. And one may
					use with advantage in this form of dislocation the method of extension formerly
					described, for the application of the bandages in the case of fracture of the
					arm; but when extension is made, the parts are to be adjusted, as has been also
					described above.</p>

				           <p> But if the arm be dislocated backward (but this very rarely happens, and it is
					the most painful of all, and the most subject to bilious fevers of the continual
					type, which prove fatal in the course of a few days), in such a case the patient
					cannot extend the arm. If you are quickly present, by forcible extension the
					parts may return to their place of their own accord; but if fever have
					previously come on, you must no longer attempt reduction, for the pain will be
					rendered more intense by any such violent attempt. In a word, no joint whatever
					should be reduced during the prevalence of fever, and least of all the
					elbow-joint.</p>

				           <p> There are also other troublesome injuries connected with<pb n="p.207"/> the
					elbow-joint; for example, the thicker bone (<hi rend="ital">radius?</hi>) is
					sometime partially displaced from the other, and the patient can neither perform
					extension nor flexion properly. This accident becomes obvious upon examination
					with the hand at the bend of the arm near the division of the vein that runs up
					the muscle. In such a case it is not easy to reduce the parts to their natural
					state, nor is it easy, in the separation of any two bones united by symphysis,
					to restore them to their natural state, for there will necessarily be a swelling
					at the seat of the diastasis. The method of bandaging a joint has been already
					described in treating of the application of bandages to the ankle. </p>

				           <p> In certain cases the process of the ulna (<hi rend="ital">olecranon?</hi>)
					behind the humerus is broken; sometimes its cartilaginous part, which gives
					origin to the posterior tendon of the arm, and sometimes its fore part, at the
					base of the anterior coronoid process; and when this displacement takes place,
					it is apt to be attended with malignant fever. The joint, however, remains in
					place, for its whole base protrudes at that point. But when the displacement
					takes place where its head overtops the arm, the joint becomes looser if the
					bone be fairly broken across. To speak in general terms, all cases of fractured
					bones are less dangerous than those in which the bones are not broken, but the
					veins and important nerves (<hi rend="ital">tendons?</hi>) situated in these
					places are contused; for the risk of death is more immediate in the latter class
					of cases than in the former, if continual fever come on. But fractures of this
					nature seldom occur.</p>

				           <p> It sometimes happens that the head of the humerus is fractured at its epiphysis;
					and this, although it may appear to be a much more troublesome accident, is in
					fact a much milder one than the other injuries at the joint.</p>

				           <p> The treatment especially befitting each particular dislocation has been
					described; and it has been laid down as a rule, that immediate reduction is of
					the utmost advantage, owing to the rapid manner in which inflammation of the
					tendons supervenes. For even when the luxated parts are immediately reduced, the
					tendons usually become stiffened, and for a considerable time prevent extension
					and flexion from being performed <pb n="p.208"/>to the ordinary extent. All
					these cases are to be treated in a similar way, whether the extremity of the
					articulating bone be snapped off, whether the bones be separated, or whether
					they be dislocated; for they are all to be treated with plenty of bandages,
					compresses, and cerate, like other fractures. The position of the joint in all
					these cases should be the same, as when a fractured arm or fore-arm has been
					bound up. For this is the most common position in all dislocations,
					displacements, and fractures; and it is the most convenient for the subsequent
					movements, whether of extension or flexion, as being the intermediate stage
					between both. And this is the position in which the patient can most
					conveniently carry or suspend his arm in a sling. And besides, if the joint is
					to be stiffened by callus, it were better that this should not take place when
					the arm is extended, for this position will be a great impediment and little
					advantage; if the arm be wholly bent, it will be more useful; but it will be
					much more convenient to have the joint in the intermediate position when it
					becomes ankylosed. So much with regard to position.</p>

				           <head>Part 48</head>
				           <p> In bandaging, the head of the first bandage should be placed at the seat of the
					injury, whether it be a case of fracture, of dislocation, or of diastasis (<hi rend="ital">separation?</hi>), and the first turns should be made there, and
					the bandages should be applied most firmly at that place, and less so on either
					side. The bandaging should comprehend both the arm and the fore-arm, and on both
					should be to a much greater extent than most physicians apply it, so that the
					swelling may be expelled from the seat of the injury to either side. And point
					of the fore-arm should be comprehended in the bandaging, whether the injury be
					in that place or not, in order that the swelling may not collect there. In
					applying bandages, we must avoid as much as possible accumulating many turns of
					the bandage at the bend of the arm. For the principal compression should be at
					the seat of the injury, and the same rules are to be observed, and at the same
					periods, with regard to compression and relaxation, as formerly described
					respecting the treatment of broken bones; and the bandages should be renewed
					every third day; and they should appear<pb n="p.209"/> loose on the third day,
					as in the other case. And splints should be applied at the proper time (for
					there is nothing unsuitable in them, whether the bones be fractured or not,
					provided there is no fever); they should be particularly loose, whether applied
					to the arm or the forearm, but they must not be thick. It is necessary that they
					should be of unequal size, and that the one should ride over the other, whenever
					from the flexion it is judged proper. And the application of the compresses
					should be regulated in the same manner as has been stated with regard to the
					splints; and they should be put on in a somewhat more bulky form at the seat of
					the injury. The periods are to be estimated from the inflammation, and from what
					has been written on them above.</p>
