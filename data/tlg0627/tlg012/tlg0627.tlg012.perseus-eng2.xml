<p rend="align(indent)"> Life is short, and Art long; the crisis fleeting; experience perilous, and decision difficult. The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and externals cooperate. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="2"> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In disorders of the bowels and vomitings, occurring spontaneously, if the matters purged be such as ought to be purged, they do good, and are well borne; but if not, the contrary. And so artificial evacuations, if they consist of such matters as should be evacuated, do good, and are well borne; but if not, the contrary. One, then, ought to look to the country, the season, the age, and the diseases in which they are proper or not.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="3"> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In the athletae, embonpoint, if carried to its utmost limit, is dangerous, for they cannot remain in the same state nor be stationary; and since, then, they can neither remain stationary nor improve, it only remains for them to get worse; for these reasons the embonpoint should be reduced without delay, that the body may again have a commencement of reparation. Neither should the evacuations, in their case, be carried to an extreme, for this also is dangerous, but only to such a point as the personâ€™s constitution can endure. In like manner, medicinal evacuations, if carried to an extreme, are dangerous; and again, a restorative course, if in the extreme, is dangerous.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> A slender restricted diet is always dangerous in chronic diseases, and also in acute diseases, where it is not requisite. And again, a diet brought to the extreme point of attenuation is<pb n="p.300"/> dangerous; and repletion, when in the extreme, is also dangerous. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="5"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In a restricted diet, patients who transgress are thereby more hurt (than in any other?); for every such transgression, whatever it may be, is followed by greater consequences than in a diet somewhat more generous. On this account, a very slender, regulated, and restricted diet is dangerous to persons in health, because they bear transgressions of it more difficultly. For this reason, a slender and restricted diet is generally more dangerous than one a little more liberal. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="6">

<p rend="align(indent)">When the disease is very acute, it is attended with extremely severe symptoms in its first stage; and therefore an extremely attenuating diet must be used. When this is not the case, but it is allowable to give a more generous diet, we may depart as far from the severity of regimen as the disease, by its mildness, is removed from the extreme. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="8">

<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="9"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">We must form a particular judgment of the patient, whether he will support the diet until the acme of the disease, and whether he will sink previously and not support the diet, or the disease will give way previously, and become less acute. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="10"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In those cases, then, which attain their acme speedily, a restricted diet should be enjoined at first; but in those cases which reach their acme later, we must retrench at that period or a little before it; but previously we must allow a more generous diet to support the patient. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="11">

<p rend="align(indent)">The exacerbations and remissions will be indicated by the diseases, the seasons of the year, the reciprocation of the periods, whether they occur every day, every alternate day, or after a longer period, and by the supervening symptoms; as, for example, in pleuritic cases, expectoration, if it occur at the commencement, shortens the attack, but if it appear later, it prolongs the same; <pb n="p.301"/>and in the same manner the urine, and alvine discharges, and sweats, according as they appear along with favorable or unfavorable symptoms, indicate diseases of a short or long duration. </p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Growing bodies have the most innate heat; they therefore require the most food, for otherwise their bodies are wasted. In old persons the heat is feeble, and therefore they require little fuel, as it were, to the flame, for it would be extinguished by much. On this account, also, fevers in old persons are not equally acute, because their bodies are cold. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="aphorism" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg012.perseus-eng2:1" n="15"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In winter and spring the bowels are naturally the hottest, and the sleep most prolonged; at these seasons, then, the most sustenance is to be administered; for as the belly has then most innate heat, it stands in need of most food. The well-known facts with regard to young persons and the athletae prove this. </p> </div>
