<p rend="align(indent)">IN Thasos during autumn, about the time of the equinox to near the setting of the Pleiades,<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπδ</foreign> in expressions denoting time seems in Hippocrates to mean <q rend="double">about</q> or <q rend="double">during.</q> The period is roughly from September 21 to November 8.</note> there were many rains, gently continuous, with southerly winds. Winter southerly,<note>That is, the winds were generally from the south, and such north winds as blew were light.</note> north winds light, droughts; on the whole, the winter was like a spring. Spring southerly and chilly; slight showers. Summer in general cloudy. No rain. Etesian winds few, light and irregular.</p> 
<p>The whole weather proved southerly, with droughts, but early in the spring, as the previous constitution had proved the opposite and northerly, a few patients suffered from ardent fevers, and these very mild, causing hemorrhage in few cases and no deaths. Many had swellings beside one ear, or both ears, in most cases unattended with fever,<note>Or, punctuating after <foreign xml:lang="grc">͂̔ωτα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλείστοισιν</foreign>, <q rend="double">There were swellings beside the ears, in many cases on one side, but in most on both.</q> The epidemio was obviously mumps.</note> so that confinement to bed was unnecessary. In some cases there was slight heat, but in all the swellings subsided without causing harm; in no case was there suppuration such as attends swellings of other origin. This was the character of them:—-flabby, big, spreading, with neither inflammation nor pain; in every case they <pb n="p.149"/> disappeared without a sign.<note>That is, with no symptoms indicative of a crisis.</note> The sufferers were youths, young men, and men in their prime, usually those who frequented the wrestling school and gymnasia. Few women were attacked. Many had dry coughs which brought up nothing when they coughed, but their voices were hoarse. Soon after, though in some cases after some time, painful inflammations occurred either in one testicle or in both, sometimes accompanied with fever, in other cases not. Usually they caused much suffering. In other respects the people had no ailments requiring medical assistance.<note>That is, nobody was ill enough to make a visit to the physician’s surgery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱητρεῖον</foreign>) necessary.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.1" n="2"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Beginning early in the summer, throughout the summer and in winter many of those who had been ailing a long time took to their beds in a state of consumption, while many also who had hitherto been doubtful sufferers at this time showed undoubted symptoms. Some showed the symptoms now for the first time; these were those whose constitution inclined to be consumptive. Many, in fact most of these, died; of those who took to their beds I do not know one who survived even for a short time. Death came more promptly than is usual in consumption, and yet the other complaints, which will be described presently, though longer and attended with fever, were easily supported and did not prove fatal. For consumption was the worst of the diseases that occurred, and alone was responsible for the great mortality.</p> 
<p>In the majority of cases the symptoms were these. Fever with shivering, continuous, acute, not completely intermitting, but of the semitertian type; remitting during one day they were exacerbated on the next, becoming on the whole more acute. Sweats <pb n="p.151"/> were continual, but not all over the body. Severe chill in the extremities, which with difficulty recovered their warmth. Bowels disordered, with bilious, scanty, unmixed, thin, smarting stools, causing the patient to get up often. Urine either thin, colourless,<note>Throughout <emph rend="italic">Epidemics</emph> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂχρως</foreign> may mean, not merely <q rend="double">without colour,</q> but <q rend="double">of bad colour.</q> It certainly has this meaning in <emph rend="italic">Airs Waters Places</emph>, VII, l. ii. See p. 85.</note> unconcocted and scanty, or thick and with a slight deposit, not settling favourably, but with a crude and unfavourable deposit. The patients frequently coughed up small, concocted sputa, brought up little by little with difficulty. Those exhibiting the symptoms in their most violent form showed no concoction at all, but continued spitting crude sputa. In the majority of these cases the throat was throughout painful from the beginning, being red and inflamed. Fluxes slight, thin, pungent. Patients quickly wasted away and grew worse, being throughout averse to all food and experiencing no thirst. Delirium in many cases as death approached. Such were the symptoms of the consumption.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.1" n="3"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But when summer came, and during autumn occurred many continuous but not violent fevers, which attacked persons who were long ailing without suffering distress in any other particular manner; for the bowels were in most cases quite easy, and hurt to no appreciable extent. Urine in most cases of good colour and clear, but thin, and after a time near the crisis it grew concocted. Coughing was slight, and caused no distress. No lack of appetite; in fact it was quite possible even to give food. In general the patients did not sicken, as did the consumptives, <pb n="p.153"/> with shivering fevers, but with slight sweats, the paroxysms being variable and irregular.<note>The words omitted by Kéhlewein mean <q rend="double">not intermitting altogether, but with exacerbations after the manner of tertians.</q></note> The earliest crisis was about the twentieth day; in most cases the crisis was about the fortieth day, though in many it was about the eightieth. In some cases the illness did not end in this way, but in an irregular manner without a crisis. In the majority of these cases the fevers relapsed after a brief interval, and after the relapse a crisis occurred at the end of the same periods as before. The disease in many of these instances was so protracted that it even lasted during the winter.</p> 
<p>Out of all those described in this constitution only the consumptives showed a high mortality-rate; for all the other patients bore up well, and the other fevers did not prove fatal.</p> </div> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1" n="2"> 
<head>SECOND CONSTITUTION</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In Thasos early in autumn occurred unseasonable wintry storms, suddenly with many north and south winds bursting out into rains. These conditions continued until the setting of the Pleiades and during their season. Winter was northerly; many violent and abundant rains; snows; generally there were fine intervals. With all this, however, the cold weather was not exceptionally unseasonable. But immediately after the winter solstice, when the west wind usually begins to blow, there was a return of severe wintry weather, much north wind, snow and <pb n="p.155"/> copious rains continuously, sky stormy and clouded. These conditions lasted on, and did not remit before the equinox. Spring cold, northerly, wet, cloudy. Summer did not turn out excessively hot, the Etesian winds blowing continuously. But soon after, near the rising of Arcturus, there was much rain again, with northerly winds.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="5"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The whole year having been wet, cold and northerly, in the winter the public health in most respects was good, but in early spring many, in fact most, suffered illnesses. Now there began at first inflammations of the eyes, marked by rheum, pain, and unconcocted discharges. Small gummy sores, in many cases causing distress when they broke out; the great majority relapsed, and ceased late on the approach of autumn. In summer and autumn dysenteric diseases, tenesmus and lientery; bilious diarrhœa, with copious, thin, crude, smarting stools; in some cases it was also watery. In many cases there were also painful, bilious defluxions, watery, full of thin particles, purulent and causing strangury. No kidney trouble, but their various symptoms succeeded in various orders. Vomitings of phlegm, bile, and undigested food. Sweats; in all cases much moisture over all the body. These complaints in many cases were unattended with fever, and the sufferers were not confined to bed; but in many others there was fever, as I am going to describe. Those who showed all the symptoms mentioned above were consumptives who suffered pain. When autumn came, and during winter, continuous feversin some few cases ardentday fevers, night fevers, semitertians, exact tertians, quartans, irregular fevers. Each of the fevers mentioned found many victims.</p></div> <pb n="p.157"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="6"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now the ardent fevers attacked the fewest persons, and these were less distressed than any of the other sick. There was no bleeding from the nose, except very slight discharges in a few cases, and no delirium. All the other symptoms were slight. The crises of these diseases were quite regular, generally in seventeen days, counting the days of intermission, and I know of no ardent fever proving fatal at this time, nor of any phrenitis. The tertians were more numerous than the ardent fevers and more painful. But all these had four regular periods from the first onset, had complete crises in seven, and in no case relapsed. But the quartans, while in many instances they began at first with quartan periodicity, yet in not a few they became quartan by an abscession from other fevers or illnesses.<note>There are often mixed infections in malaria. If the quartan be one of these, being the longest it outlasts the others. So the disease appears to have turned into a quartan.</note> They were protracted, as quartans usually are, or even more protracted than usual. Many fell victims to quotidians, night fevers, or irregular fevers, and were ill for a long time, either in bed or walking about. In most of these cases the fevers continued during the season of the Pleiades or even until winter. In many patients, especially children, there were convulsions and slight feverishness from the beginning; sometimes, too, convulsions supervened upon fevers. Mostly these illnesses were protracted, but not dangerous, except for those who from all other causes were predisposed to die.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="7"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But those fevers which were altogether continuous and never intermitted at all, but in all cases <pb n="p.159"/> grew worse after the manner of semitertians, with remission during one day followed by exacerbation during the next, were the most severe of all the fevers which occurred at this time, the longest and the most painful. Beginning mildly, and on the whole increasing always, with exacerbation, and growing worse, they had slight remissions followed quickly after an abatement by more violent exacerbations, generally becoming worse on the critical days. All patients had irregular rigors that followed no fixed law, most rarely and least in the semitertians,<note>I take the pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖτος</foreign> throughout this chapter to refer to the remittent semitertian, or to sufferers from it.</note> but more violent in the other fevers. Copious sweats, least copious in the semitertians; they brought no relief, but on the contrary caused harm. These patients suffered great chill in the extremities, which grew warm again with difficulty. Generally there was sleeplessness, especially with the semitertians, followed afterwards by coma. In all the bowels were disordered and in a bad state, but in the semitertians they were far the worst. In most of them urine either (<emph rend="italic">a</emph>) thin, crude, colourless, after a time becoming slightly concocted with signs of crisis, or (<emph rend="italic">b</emph>) thick enough but turbid, in no way settling or forming sediment, or (<emph rend="italic">c</emph>) with small, bad, crude sediments, these being the worst of all. Coughs attended the fevers, but I cannot say that either harm or good resulted from the coughing on this occasion.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="8"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now the greatest number of these symptoms continued to be protracted, troublesome, very disordered, very irregular, and without any critical signs, both in the case of those who came very near death <pb n="p.161"/> and in the case of those who did not. For even if some patients enjoyed slight intermissions, there followed a quick relapse. A few of them experienced a crisis, the earliest being about the eightieth day, some of the latter having a relapse, so that most of them were still ill in the winter. The greatest number had no crisis before the disease terminated. These symptoms occurred in those who recovered just as much as in those who did not. The illnesses showed a marked absence of crisis and a great variety; the most striking and the worst symptom, which throughout attended the great majority, was a complete loss of appetite, especially in those whose general condition exhibited fatal signs, but in these fevers they did not suffer much from unseasonable thirst. After long intervals, with many pains and with pernicious wasting, there supervened abscessions either too severe to be endured, or too slight to be beneficial, so that there was a speedy return of the original symptoms, and an aggravation of the mischief.<note>That is, the abscessions did not carry off the morbid humours, which spread again throughout the system.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="9"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The symptoms from which these patients suffered were dysenteries and tenesmus, lienteries also and fluxes. Some had dropsies also, either with or without these. Whenever any of these attacked violently they were quickly fatal, or, if mild, they did no good. Slight eruptions, which did not match the extent of the diseases and quickly disappeared again, or swellings by the ears that grew smaller<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">μωλυόμενα</foreign> would mean <q rend="double">remained crude.</q></note> and <pb n="p.163"/> signified nothing, in some cases appearing at the joints, especially the hip-joint, in few instances leaving with signs of crisis, when they quickly re-established themselves in their original state.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="10"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">From all the diseases some died, but the greatest number from these fevers,<note>It is not clear to what <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτων</foreign> refer. Probably <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντων</foreign> refers to all the semitertians, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτων</foreign> to the special type of them described in Chapter IX.</note> especially childrenthose just weaned, older children of eight or ten years, and those approaching puberty. These victims never suffered from the latter symptoms without the first I have described above, but often the first without the latter. The only good sign, the most striking that occurred, which saved very many of those who were in the greatest danger, was when there was a change to strangury, into which abscessions took place. The strangury, too, came mostly to patients of the ages mentioned, though it did happen to many of the others, either without their taking to bed or when they were ill. Rapid and great was the complete change that occurred in their case. For the bowels, even if they were perniciously loose, quickly recovered; their appetite for everything returned, and hereafter the fever abated. But the strangury, even in these cases, was long and painful. Their urine was copious, thick, varied, red, mixed with pus, and passed with pain. But they all survived, and I know of none of these that died.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="11"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In all dangerous cases you should be on the watch for all favourable coctions of the evacuations from all parts, or for fair and critical abscessions. Coctions signify nearness of crisis and sure recovery <pb n="p.165"/> of health, but crude and unconcocted evacuations, which change into bad abscessions, denote absence of crisis, pain, prolonged illness, death, or a return of the same symptoms. But it is by a consideration of other signs that one must decide which of these results will be most likely. Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future; practise these acts. As to diseases, make a habit of two thingsto help, or at least to do no harm. The art has three factors, the disease, the patient, the physician. The physician is the servant of the art. The patient must co-operate with the physician in combating the disease.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.2" n="12"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness combined with pain, occur both without and with fever. Sufferers from phrenitis have convulsions, and eject verdigris-coloured vomit; some die very quickly. But in ardent and the other fevers, those with pain in the neck, heaviness of the temples, dimness of sight, and painless tension of the hypochondrium, bleed from the nose; those with a general heaviness of the head, cardialgia, and nausea, vomit afterwards bile and phlegm. Children for the most part in such cases suffer chiefly from the convulsions. Women have both these symptoms and pains in the womb. Older people, and those whose natural heat is failing, have paralysis or raving or blindness.</p> </div> </div>

<head>THIRD CONSTITUTION</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="13"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In Thasos a little before and at the season of Arcturus many violent rains with northerly winds. About the equinox until the setting of the Pleiades <pb n="p.167"/> slight, southerly rains. Winter northerly, droughts, cold periods, violent winds, snow. About the equinox very severe storms. Spring northerly, droughts, slight rains, periods of cold. About the summer solstice slight showers, periods of great cold until near the Dog Star. After the Dog Star, until Arcturus, hot summer. Great heat, not intermittent but continuous and severe. No rain fell. The Etesian winds blew. About Arcturus southerly rains until the equinox.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="14"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In this constitution during winter began paralyses which attacked many, a few of whom quickly died. In fact, the disease was generally epidemic. In other respects the public health continued good. Early in spring began ardent fevers which continued until the equinox and on to summer. Now those who began to be ill at once, in spring or the beginning of summer, in most cases got well, though a few died; but when autumn and the rains came the cases were dangerous, and more died.</p> 
<p>As to the peculiarities of the ardent fevers, the most likely patients to survive were those who had a proper and copious bleeding from the nose, in fact I do not know of a single case in this constitution that proved fatal when a proper bleeding occurred, For Philiscus and Epaminon and Silenus, who died, had only a slight epistaxis on the fourth and fifth days. Now the majority of the patients had rigors near the <pb n="p.169"/> crisis, especially such as had no epistaxis, but these had sweats also as well as rigors.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="15"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Some had jaundice on the sixth day, but these were benefited by either a purging through the bladder or a disturbance of the bowels or a copious hemorrhage, as was the case with Heraclides, who lay sick at the house of Aristocydes. This patient, however, who had a crisis on the twentieth day, not only bled from the nose, but also experienced disturbance of the bowels and a purging through the bladder. Far otherwise was it with the servant of Phanagoras, who had none of these symptoms, and died. But the great majority had hemorrhage, especially youths and those in the prime of life, and of these the great majority who had no hemorrhage died. Older people had jaundice or disordered bowels, for example Bion, who lay sick at the house of Silenus. Dysenteries also were general in summer, and some too of those who had fallen ill, and also suffered from hemorrhage, finally had dysentery; for example, the slave of Erato and Myllus, after copious hemorrhage, lapsed into dysentery. They recovered.</p> 
<p>This humour,<note>That is, blood.</note> then, especially was in great abundance, since even those who had no hemorrhage near the crisis, but swellings by the ears which disappearedand after their disappearance there was a heaviness along the left flank up to the extremity of the hipafter the crisis had pain and passed thin urine, and then began to suffer slight hemorrhage about the twenty-fourth day, and <pb n="p.171"/> abscessions into hemorrhage occurred. In the case of Antipho, son of Critobulus, the illness ceased and came to a complete crisis about the fortieth day.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="16"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Though many women fell ill, they were fewer than the men and less frequently died. But the great majority had difficult childbirth, and after giving birth they would fall ill, and these especially died, as did the daughter of Telebulus on the sixth day after delivery. Now menstruation appeared during the fevers in most cases, and with many maidens it occurred then for the first time. Some bled from the nose. Sometimes both epistaxis and menstruation appeared together; for example, the maiden daughter of Daitharses had her first menstruation during fever and also a violent discharge from the nose. I know of no woman who died if any of these symptoms showed themselves properly, but all to my knowledge had abortions if they chanced to fall ill when with child.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="17"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Urine in most cases was of good colour, but thin and with slight sediments, and the bowels of most were disordered with thin, bilious excretions. Many after a crisis of the other symptoms ended with dysentery, as did Xenophanes and Critias. I will mention cases in which was passed copious, watery, clear and thin urine, even after a crisis in other respects favourable, and a favourable sediment: Bion, who lay sick at the house of Silenus, Cratis, who lodged with Xenophanes, the slave of Areto, and the wife of Mnesistratus. Afterwards all these suffered from dysentery.</p> 
<p>About the season of Arcturus many had crisis on <pb n="p.173"/> the eleventh day, and these did not suffer even the normal relapses. There were also comatose fevers about this time, usually in children, and of all patients these showed the lowest mortality.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="subsection" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0627.tlg006.perseus-eng4:1.3" n="18"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">About the equinox up to the setting of the Pleiades, and during winter, although the ardent fevers continued, yet cases of phrenitis were most frequent at this time, and most of them were fatal. In summer, too, a few cases had occurred. Now the sufferers from ardent fever, when fatal symptoms attended, showed signs at the beginning. For right from the beginning there was acute fever with slight rigors, sleeplessness, thirst, nausea, slight sweats about the forehead and collar-bones, but in no case general, much delirium, fears, depression, very cold extremities, toes and hands, especially the latter. The exacerbations on the even days; but in most cases the pains were greatest on the fourth day, with sweat for the most part chilly, while the extremities could not now be warmed again, remaining livid and cold; and in these cases the thirst ceased. Their urine was scanty, black, thin, with constipation of the bowels. Nor was there hemorrhage from the nose in any case when these symptoms occurred, but only slight epistaxis. None of these cases suffered relapse, but they died on the sixth day, with sweating. The cases of phrenitis had all the above symptoms, but the crises generally occurred on the eleventh day. Some had their crises on the twentieth day, namely those in whom the phrenitis did not begin at first, or began about the third or fourth day, but <pb n="p.175"/> though these fared tolerably at the beginning, yet the disease assumed an acute form about the seventh day.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Now the number of illnesses was great. And of the patients there died chiefly striplings, young people, people in their prime, the smooth, the fair-skinned, the straight-haired, the black-haired, the black-eyed, those who had lived recklessly and care-lessly, the thin-voiced, the rough-voiced, the lispers, the passionate. Women too died in very great numbers who were of this kind. In this constitution there were four symptoms especially which denoted recovery:—-a proper hemorrhage through the nostrils; copious discharges by the bladder of urine with much sediment of a proper character; disordered bowels with bilious evacuations at the right time; the appearance of dysenteric characteristics. The crisis in many cases did not come with one only of the symptoms described above, but in most cases all symptoms were experienced, and the patients appeared to be more distressed; but all with these symptoms got well. Women and maidens experienced all the above symptoms, but besides, whenever any took place properly, and whenever copious menstruation supervened, there was a crisis therefrom which resulted in recovery; in fact I know of no woman who died when any of these symptoms took place properly. For the daughter of Philo, who died, though she had violent epistaxis, dined rather unseasonably on the seventh day.</p> 
<p>In acute fevers, more especially in ardent fevers, when involuntary weeping occurs, epistaxis is to be <pb n="p.177"/> expected it the patient have no fatal symptoms besides; for when he is in a bad way such weeping portends not hemorrhage but death.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The painful swellings by the ears in fevers in some cases neither subsided nor suppurated when the fever ceased with a crisis. They were cured by bilious diarrhœa, or dysentery, or a sediment of thick urine such as closed the illness of Hermippus of Clazomenæ. The circumstances of the crises, from which too I formed my judgments, were either similar or dissimilar; for example, the two brothers, who fell sick together at the same time, and lay ill near the bungalow of Epigenes. The elder of these had a crisis on the sixth day, the younger on the seventh. Both suffered a relapse together at the same time with an intermission of five days. After the relapse both had a complete crisis together on the seventeenth day. But the great majority had a crisis on the sixth day, with an intermission of six days followed by a crisis on the fifth day after the relapse. Those who had a crisis on the seventh day had an intermission of seven days, with a crisis on the third day after the relapse. Others with a crisis on the seventh had an intermission of three days, with a crisis on the seventh day after the relapse. Some who had a crisis on the sixth day had an intermission of six and a relapse of three, an intermission of one and a relapse of one, followed by a crisis; for example, Euagon the son of Daitharses. Others with a crisis on the sixth had an intermission of seven days, and after the relapse a crisis on the fourth; for example, the daughter of Aglai+das. Now most of those who fell ill in this constitution went through their illness in this manner, and none of <pb n="p.179"/> those who recovered, so far as I know, failed to suffer the relapses which were normal in these cases, but all, so far as I know, recovered if their relapses took place after this fashion. Further, I know of none who suffered a fresh relapse after going through the illness in the manner described above.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">In these diseases most died on the sixth day, as did Epaminondas, Silenus and Philiscus the son of Antagoras. Those who had the swellings by the ears had a crisis on the twentieth day, but these subsided in all cases without suppuration, being diverted to the bladder. There were two cases of suppuration, both fatal, Cratistonax, who lived near the temple of Heracles, and the serving-maid of Scymnus the fuller. When there was a crisis on the seventh day, with an intermission of nine days followed by a relapse, there was a second crisis on the fourth day after the relapsein the case of Pantacles, for example, who lived by the temple of Dionysus. When there was a crisis on the seventh day, with an intermission of six days followed by a relapse, there was a second crisis on the seventh day after the relapsein the case of Phanocritus, for example, who lay sick at the house of Gnathon the fuller.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">During winter, near the time of the winter solstice, and continuing until the equinox, the ardent fevers and the phrenitis still caused many deaths, but their crises changed. Most cases had a crisis on the fifth day from the outset, then intermitted four days, relapsed, had a crisis on the fifth day after the relapse, that is, after thirteen days altogether. Mostly children experienced crises thus, but older people did so too. Some had a crisis <pb n="p.181"/> on the eleventh day, a relapse on the fourteenth, and a complete crisis on the twentieth. But if rigor came on about the twentieth day the crisis came on the fortieth. Most had rigors near the first crisis, and those who had rigors at first near the crisis, had rigors again in the relapses at the time of the crisis. Fewest experienced rigors in the spring, more in summer, more still in autumn, but by far the most during winter. But the hemorrhages tended to cease.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The following were the circumstances attending the diseases, from which I framed my judgments, learning from the common nature of all and the particular nature of the individual, from the disease, the patient, the regimen prescribed and the prescriberfor these make a diagnosis more favourable or less; from the constitution, both as a whole and with respect to the parts, of the weather and of each region; from the custom, mode of life, practices and ages of each patient; from talk, manner, silence, thoughts, sleep or absence of sleep, the nature and time of dreams, pluckings, scratchings, tears; from the exacerbations, stools, urine, sputa, vomit, the antecedents and consequents of each member in the successions of diseases, and the abscessions to a fatal issue or a crisis, sweat, rigor, chill, cough, sneezes, hiccoughs, breathing, belchings, flatulence, silent or noisy, hemorrhages, and hemorrhoids. From these things must we consider what their consequents also will be.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Some fevers are continuous, some have an access during the day and an intermission during the night, or an access during the night and an intermission during the day; there are semitertians, <pb n="p.183"/> tertians, quartans, quintans, septans, nonans. The most acute diseases, the most severe, difficult and fatal, belong to the continuous fevers. The least fatal and least difficult of all, but the longest of all, is the quartan. Not only is it such in itself, but it also ends other, and serious, diseases. In the fever called semitertian, which is more fatal than any other, there occur also acute diseases, while it especially precedes the illness of consumptives, and of those who suffer from other and longer diseases. The nocturnal is not very fatal, but it is long. The diurnal is longer still, and to some it also brings a tendency to consumption. The septan is long but not fatal. The nonan is longer still but not fatal. The exact tertian has a speedy crisis and is not fatal. But the quintan is the worst of all. For if it comes on before consumption or during consumption the patient dies.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Each of these fevers has its modes, its constitutions and its exacerbations. For example, a continuous fever in some cases from the beginning is high and at its worst, leading up to the most severe stage, but about and at the crisis it moderates. In other cases it begins gently and in a suppressed manner, but rises and is exacerbated each day, bursting out violently near the crisis. In some cases it begins mildly, but increases and is exacerbated, reaching its height after a time; then it declines again until the crisis or near the crisis. These characteristics may show themselves in any fever and in any disease. It is necessary also to consider the patient’s mode of life and to take it <pb n="p.185"/> into account when prescribing. Many other important symptoms there are which are akin to these, some of which I have described, while others I shall describe later. These must be duly weighed when considering and deciding who is suffering from one of these diseases in an acute, fatal form, or whether the patient may recover; who has a chronic, fatal illness, or one from which he may recover; who is to be prescribed for or not, what the prescription is to be, the quantity to be given and the time to give it.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">When the exacerbations are on even days, the crises are on even days. But the diseases exacerbated on odd days have their crises on odd days. The first period of diseases with crises on the even days is the fourth day, then the sixth, eighth, tenth, fourteenth, twentieth, twenty-fourth, thirtieth, fortieth, sixtieth, eightieth, hundred and twentieth. Of those with a crisis on the odd days the first period is the third, then the fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, seventeenth, twenty-first, twenty-seventh, thirty-first. Further, one must know that, if the crises be on other days than the above, there will be relapses, and there may also be a fatal issue. So one must be attentive and know that at these times there will be the crises resulting in recovery, or death, or a tendency for better or worse. One must also consider in what periods the crises occur of irregular fevers, of quartans, of quintans, of septans and of nonans.</p> </div> </div> <pb n="p.187"/>

<p rend="align(indent)">Many were attacked by the erysipelas all over the body when the exciting cause was a trivial accident or a very small wound; especially when the patients were about sixty years old and the wound was in the head, however little the neglect might have been. Many even while undergoing treatment suffered from severe inflammations,<note>With Littré’s punctuation the meaning is, <q rend="double">however slight the neglect, and even when a patient was actually undergoing treatment. There were severe inflammations,</q> etc.</note> and the erysipelas would quickly spread widely in all directions. Most of the patients experienced abscessions ending in suppurations. Flesh, sinews and bones <pb n="p.243"/> fell away in large quantities. The flux which formed was not like pus, but was a different sort of putre-faction with a copious and varied flux. If any of these symptoms occurred in the head, there was loss of hair from all the head and from the chin; the bones were bared and fell away, and there were copious fluxes. Fever was sometimes present and sometimes absent. These symptoms were terrifying rather than dangerous. For whenever they resulted in suppuration or some similar coction the cases usually recovered. But whenever the inflammation and the erysipelas disappeared without producing any such abscession, there were many deaths. The course of the disease was the same to whatever part of the body it spread. Many lost the arm and the entire forearm. If the malady settled in the sides there was rotting either before or behind. In some cases the entire thigh was bared, or the shin and the entire foot. But the most dangerous of all such cases were when the pubes and genital organs were attacked. Such were the sores which sprang from an exciting cause. In many cases, however, sores occurred in fevers, before a fever, or supervening on fevers. In some of these also, when an abscession took place through suppuration, or when a seasonable disturbance of the bowels occurred or a passing of favourable urine, this gave rise to a solution; but when none of these events happened, and the symptoms disappeared without a sign, death resulted. It was in the spring that by far the greater number of cases of erysipelas occurred, but they continued throughout the summer and during autumn.</p></div> <pb n="p.245"/>

<p rend="align(indent)">Now the ardent fevers and phrenitis began early in the spring after the cold snaps which occurred, and very many fell sick at that time. These suffered acute and fatal symptoms. The constitution of the ardent fevers that occurred was as follows. At the beginning coma, nausea, shivering, acute fever, no great thirst, no delirium, slight epistaxis. The exacerbations in most cases on even days, and about the time of the exacerbations there was loss of memory with prostration and speechlessness. The feet and hands of these patients were always colder than usual, most especially about the times of exacerbation. Slowly and in no healthy manner they recovered their heat, becoming rational again and conversing. Either the coma held them continuously without sleep, or they were wakeful and in pain. Bowels disordered in the majority of these cases, with crude, thin, copious stools. Urine copious, thin, with no critical or favourable sign, nor did any other critical sign appear in these patients. For there occurred neither favourable hemorrhage <pb n="p.247"/> nor any other of the usual critical abscessions. The manner of their dying varied with the individual; it was usually irregular, at the crises, but in some cases after long loss of speech and in many with sweating. These were the symptoms attending the fatal cases of ardent fever, and the cases of phrenitis were similar. These suffered from no thirst at all, and no case showed the mad delirium that attacked others, but they passed away overpowered by a dull oppression of stupor.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">The bowel troubles in many cases turned out many and harmful. In the first place many were attacked by painful tenesmus, mostly childrenall in fact who were approaching pubertyand most of these died. Many lienteries. Cases of dysentery, but they too<note><emph rend="italic">I. c.</emph> as Galen suggests in his commentary, they were like the lienteries in not causing much pain. Lientery is not particularly painful.</note> were not very painful. Stools bilious, greasy, thin and watery. In many <pb n="p.249"/> cases this condition of the bowels constituted the disease itself, fever being sometimes absent and sometimes present.<note>Littré in a long and obscure note argues that only <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνευ πυρετῶν</foreign> and not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν πυρετοῖσι</foreign> can belong to the preceding phrase, apparently because it is illogical to say that fever was present when the disease consisted merely of unhealthy stools. But the writer does not wish to exclude fever; he merely wishes to exclude from this class of patient tenesmus, lientery and dysentery. The commentary of Galen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλοῖς ῦέ φησιν αὐτὸ τοῦτο γενέσθαι τὸ νόσημα</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτέστι τὸ διαχωρεῖν τὰ τοιαῦτα· καὶ γὰρ καὶ χωρὶς πυρετῶν ἐνίοις τοῦτο γενέσθαι Φησι</foreign>, does not, as Littré supposes, support his contention. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ χωρὶς πυρετῶν ἐνίοις τοῦτο γενέσθαι φησὶ</foreign> implies <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐν πυρετοῖς τοῦτο ἐγένετο</foreign>.</note> Painful tormina and malignant colic. There were evacuations, though the bulk of the contents remained behind.<note>It is hard to separate <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέξοδοι</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πολλῶν</foreign>, yet the sense seems to require it. The next sentence states that these evacuations caused no relief, evidently because they did not clear the trouble from the bowel. Now if <foreign xml:lang="grc">διέξοδοι</foreign> be taken with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πολλῶν</foreign>, the only possible translation is <q rend="double">evacuations of the many contents which were retained there,</q> implying complete evacuation. Galen’s comment (Kéhn XVII, Part I, p. 708) bears out the former interpretation: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς δὲ διεξόδους</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτέστὶ τὰς κενώσεις</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοῖς συμβῆναι</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλῶν ἐνόντων καὶ ἐπισχόντων</foreign> . . . . . <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ διὰ τοῦτο μηδὲ τοὺς πόνους λύειν τὰ διεξιόντα</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς γαρ ὀ͂όν τε λύειν αὐτά</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλῶν ἔτι τῶν ἐπεχομένων όντων</foreign>; It should be noticed that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπισχόντων</foreign> is probably from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσχω</foreign> (Galen’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεχομένων</foreign>) and not from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπέχω</foreign>, although I cannot find a parallel for intransitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσχω</foreign> in this sense.</note> The evacuations did not take away the pains, and yielded with difficulty to the remedies administered. Purgings, in fact, did harm in most cases. Of those in this condition many died rapidly, though a few held out longer. In brief, all patients, whether the disease was prolonged or acute, died chiefly from the bowel complaints. For the bowels carried all off together.<note>The writer has not expressed himself clearly in this chapter, which seems to be the roughest of rough notes. The last two sentences apparently mean:—

It happened that either the fever was higher and the deafness great, or else, though these symptoms were relieved and less severe, yet the pains in the lower parts about the hips grew worse. But from about the eightieth day all the symptoms were relieved without any disappearing. The urine that was passed was of good colour and had greater deposits, while the delirious mutterings were less. About the hundredth day the bowels were disordered with copious, bilious stools, and copious evacuations of this nature were passed for a long time. Then followed painful symptoms of dysentery, with relief of the other symptoms. In brief, the fever disappeared and the deafness ceased.</p>

<p>Apollonius in Abdera was ailing for a long time without being confined to bed.

For there were exacerbations of the fever; the bowels passed practically nothing of the food taken; the urine was thin and scanty. No sleep. Grievous distension; much thirst; coma; painful swelling of the right hypochondrium; extremities all round rather cold; slight delirious mutterings; forgetfulness of every-thing he said; he was not himself. About the <pb n="p.281"/> fourteenth day from his taking to bed, after a rigor, he grew hot; wildly delirious; shouting, distress,<note>Here perhaps not bowel trouble.</note> much rambling, followed by calm; the coma came on at this time. Afterwards the bowels were disordered with copious stools, bilious, uncompounded and crude; urine black, scanty and thin. Great discomfort. The evacuations showed varying symptoms; they were either black, scanty and verdigris-coloured, or else greasy, crude and smarting ; at times they seemed actually to be like milk. About the twenty-fourth day comfortable; in other respects the same, but he had lucid intervals. He remembered nothing since he took to bed.

<p>The respiration of this patient throughout was <pb n="p.285"/> rare and large; took no notice of anything; she constantly wrapped herself up; either much rambling or silence throughout.<note>In many ways this case, though one of the most picturesque, is also one of the most carelessly written. Galen points out that <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ Χπόνον</foreign> is ambiguous, and that its possible meanings are inconsistent with the rest of the description. How can the respiration be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀραιόν</foreign> throughout, when on both the fourteenth and the twentieth days the patient was <foreign xml:lang="grc">βραχύπνοος</foreign>? It is strange that the writer specifies the fourteenth day as the day when the respiration was rare and large, seeing that it had these characteristics throughout. A similar remark applies to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναισθήτως εἰχε πάντων</foreign> of the seventeenth day. Further, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ σιγῶσα</foreign> of the second sentence becomes strangely <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣ λόγοι χολλοὶ ἣ σιγῶσα διὰ τέλεος</foreign> in the last.
