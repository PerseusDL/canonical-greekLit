				<p>I SWEAR by Apollo the physician, and Aesculapius, and Health, and All-heal, and
					all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability and judgment, I will
					keep this Oath and this stipulation- to reckon him who taught me this Art
					equally dear to me as my parents, to share my substance with him, and relieve
					his necessities if required; to look upon his offspring in the same footing as
					my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it,
					without fee or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode
					of instruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those
					of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath according to
					the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow that system of regimen
					which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my
					patients, and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous. I will give
					no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in
					like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With
					purity and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art. I will not cut
					persons laboring under the stone, but will leave this to be done by men who are
					practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them
					for the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of
					mischief and corruption; and, further from the seduction of females or males, of
					freemen and slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional practice or
					not, in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not
					to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be
					kept secret. While I continue to keep this Oath unviolated, may it be granted to
					me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected by all men, in all
					times! But should I trespass and violate this Oath, may the reverse be my lot!
