                          From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing, who hold the great and
                              holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the deep-blue
                              spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos,</l>
            <l n="5">and, when they have washed their tender

            <l n="10">veiled in thick mist, and utter their song with lovely

                              walks on golden sandals, and the daughter of Zeus the aegis-holder
                              bright-eyed Athena, and Phoebus Apollo, and Artemis who delights in

                              shepherding his lambs under holy Helicon, and this word first the

                              false things as though they were true; but we know, when we will, to

                          So said the ready-voiced daughters of great Zeus, and they plucked and
                                   gave</l>
            <l n="30">me a rod, a shoot of

                              to celebrate things that shall be and things that were aforetime; and
                              they bade me sing of the race of the blessed gods that are eternally,
                              but ever to sing of themselves both first and last.</l>
            <l n="35">But why all this about oak or

                              with their songs, telling of things that are and that shall be and
                              that were aforetime with consenting voice. Unwearying flows the sweet
                                   sound</l>
            <l n="40">from their lips, and
                              the house of their father Zeus the loud-thunderer is glad at the
                              lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spreads abroad, and the peaks
                              of snowy <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> resound, and
                              the homes of the immortals. And they, uttering their immortal voice,
                              celebrate in song first of all the revered race of the gods</l>
            <l n="45">from the beginning, those whom Earth
                              and wide Heaven begot, and the gods sprung of these, givers of good
                              things. Then next, the goddesses sing of Zeus, the father of gods and
                              men, as they begin and end their strain, how much he is the most
                              excellent among the gods and supreme in power.</l>
            <l n="50">And again, they chant the race of men and strong

                              daughters of Zeus the aegis-holder.

                          Them in Pieria did Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the
                              hills of Eleuther, bear of union with the father, the son of

            <l n="55">a forgetting of ills

                              entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when a year was
                              passed and the seasons came round as the months waned, and many days
                              were accomplished,</l>

            <l n="65">in delight. And they, uttering through

                              the immortals, uttering their lovely voice. Then went they to
                                   <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, delighting in

            <l n="70">about them as they
                              chanted and a lovely sound rose up beneath their feet as they went to

            <l n="75">These things, then, the Muses sang who dwell on

                              there princes wise in heart, because when the people are being

                              such is the holy gift of the Muses to men. For it is through the Muses
                              and far-shooting Apollo that</l>

                              mouth. For although a man has sorrow and grief in his newly-troubled
                              soul and lives in dread because his heart is distressed, yet, when a
                                   singer,</l>

                              honored above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the
                              earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honor also in starry

                              to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honor comes full easily to him

                              no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the

                              gleam of unwearying fire in a hollow fennel stalk. And Zeus who
                              thunders on high was stung in spirit, and his dear heart was angered

            <l n="570">Forthwith he made an evil thing for

                              the goddess bright-eyed Athena girded and clothed her with silvery
                              raiment, and down from her head</l>
            <l n="575">she spread with her hands an embroidered veil, a wonder to see; and
                              she, Pallas Athena, put about her head lovely garlands, flowers of

            <l n="580">and worked with his own hands as a favor to Zeus his

                              creatures which the land and sea rear up, he put most upon it,
                              wonderful things, like living beings with voices: and great beauty
                              shone out from it.

                              father had given her, to the place where the other gods and men were.
                              And wonder took hold of the deathless gods and mortal men when they

            <l n="600">even so Zeus

                              the good they had: whoever avoids marriage and the sorrows that women
                              cause, and will not wed, reaches deadly old age</l>
            <l n="605">without anyone to tend his years, and though he

                              beyond the will of Zeus: for not even the son of Iapetus, kindly

                          But when first their father was vexed in his heart with Obriareus and

            <l n="620">and great size: and he made them live beneath the

                              with heart-grieving toil, the lordly Titans from high Othrys, but the
                              gods, givers of good, whom rich-haired Rhea bore in union with Cronos,

            <l n="635">So they, with bitter wrath, were

                              and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue
                              of the war hung evenly balanced. But when he had provided those three

                              delicious ambrosia, then it was that the father of men and gods spoke
                              amongst them: “Hear me, bright children of Earth and

            <l n="645">that I may say what

                          So he said. And blameless Cottus answered him again: “</l>
            <l n="655">Divine one, you speak that which we

                              back again from the murky gloom and from our merciless

            <l n="670">whom Zeus brought
                              up to the light from Erebus beneath the earth. A hundred arms sprang

                              his shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the Titans
