<p rend="align(indent)">THE remedies of acute diseases are connected with the form of the symptoms, certain of which have been described by me in the preceding works. Whatever, therefore, relates to the cure of fevers, according to their differences, the form of the diseases, and the varieties in them, the greater part of these will be treated of in my discourses on fevers. But acute affections which are accompanied with fevers, such as Phrenitis, or those without fevers, as Apoplexy, of these alone will I now write; and that I may not commit blunders, or become diffuse by treating of the same matters in different places, the beginning and end correspond to the same in the work on the affections.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg003.perseus-eng2:1" n="2"> <pb n="378"/> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER I. THE CURE OF PHRENITICS.</head> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">THE patient ought to be laid in a house of moderate size, and mild temperature—in a warm situation, if winter, and in one that is cool and humid, if summer; in spring and autumn, to be regulated according to the season. Then the patient himself, and all those in the house, are to be ordered to preserve quiet; for persons in phrensy are sharp of hearing, are sensitive to noise, and easily become delirious. The walls should be smooth, level, without projections, not adorned with frieze<note resp="editor" place="inline">The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄχναι</foreign> would appear to have been applied like <emph rend="italic">frieze</emph> in English, both to the nap on woollen cloth, and in architecture, to ornaments of sculpture on a flat face. Our author evidently uses it in the latter sense; but I suspect the translators fail to recognise it. For the former meaning, see Erotian, and Föes Œc. Hippocr. Modern lexicographers do not seem acquainted with this use of the term. See Liddel and Scott’s; and Dunbar’s Lexicons.</note> or paintings; for painting on a wall is an excitant. And, moreover, they catch at certain false appearances before their eyes, and grope about things which are not projecting, as if they were so; and any unreal occasion may be a cause sufficient to make them raise their hands. Length and breadth of the couch moderate, so that the patient may neither toss about in a broad one, nor fall out of a narrow bed. In plain bed clothes, so that there may be no inducement to pick at their nap. But on a soft bed, for a hard one is offensive to the nerves; as in phrenitics, above all others, the nerves especially suffer, for they are subject to convulsions. Access of their dearest friends is to be permitted; stories and conversation not of an exciting character; for they ought to be gratified in everything, especially in cases where the delirium tends to anger. Whether they are to be laid in darkness or in light must be determined by the nature of the attack; for if they are exasperated by the light, and <pb n="379"/> see things which exist not, and represent to themselves things not present, or confound one thing with another, or if strange images obtrude themselves upon them; and, in a word, if they are frightened at the light, and the things in the light, darkness must be chosen; but if not, the opposite state. It is a good symptom, too, when they become of a sound mind, and their delirium abates, on exposure to the light. Abstinence from food should not be prolonged; food should be rather liquid, scanty, and frequently administered, for food soothes the soul: the proper time for giving it is during the remissions, both of the fever and of the delirium. But if they have become delirious from want of food, and if the fever do not remit, we are to give food that does not do much harm in fever. It is a favourable circumstance, when the fever and the delirium agree both as to the paroxysms and intermissions.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If, therefore, the time for the administering of food be come, in the first place, it must be enquired whether it be necessary to abstract blood. If, then, the delirium have come on with fever at the commencement, in the first or second day, it will be proper to open a vein at the elbow, especially the middle. But if the delirium supervene on the third or fourth day, we are to open a vein up to the first period of critical days. But if it was past the proper time for bleeding, on the sixth or seventh day, it will be proper to evacuate considerably before the crises in acute diseases, either by giving purgative medicines, or by using other stimulants. But when opening a vein you must not abstract much, even if you open the vein at the commencement; for phrenitis is an ailment easily convertible into syncope. But if the patient be plethoric and youthful, and if the ailment be connected with fulness in eating and drinking, those indications have nothing to do with the phrenitis; for even without the delirium, it would be proper to abstract much blood in such circumstances; but much less is to be abstracted, if such persons labour under phrenitis. <pb n="380"/> But we may open a vein the more boldly in these cases, if the disease proceed from the præcordia, and not from the head; for there (in the præcordia) is the origin of life. But the head is the seat of sensation, and of the origin of the nerves; and it attracts more blood from the heart than it imparts to the others. If it therefore suffer, it is not proper to open the vein at the elbow; for these affections are such that it is no small injury to evacuate in them. And if the strength be sufficient to withstand the evacuation, we must abstract only once, lest during the interval between the acts of evacuation, the proper season for food be lost. The fevers, in cases of phrenitis, are of a continual type, neither have they long intermissions, but experience short and ill-marked remissions. But if the patient give way before a sufficient quantity has been abstracted, it must be put off until another remission, unless it occur at a distant period; but, if not, having resuscitated the patient by odours, stroking the face, and pricking the feet, we are immediately to abstract blood. The measure of sufficiency is the strength.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">Liquid food is proper in all febrile diseases, but especially in phrenitic cases, for these are more arid than mere fevers. The mulse is to be given, unless they are bilious, for it is indigestible in patients who are subject to bitter bile. Alica<note resp="editor" place="inline">As this term is of frequent occurrence in the works of our author, as in those of Hippocrates, it may be proper to mention, once for all, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χόνδρος</foreign> of the Greeks and the <emph rend="italic">alica</emph> of the Romans was the species of grain called Spelt (<emph rend="italic">Triticum Spelta</emph>) broken down into rough granules; that is to say, it was coarsely ground Spelt.</note> washed with water, or mulse, is a good thing; also it is good to give pottages of a plain kind, such as decoctions of savory, of parsley, or of dill, for these are beneficial to the respiration, and are diuretic, and a free discharge of urine is beneficial in phrenetics. All kinds of pot-herbs, especially melons, for their gluten is good for lubricating the tongue, the trachea, and for <pb n="381"/> the alvine evacuations; but the best of all are beet, blite, cress, gourd in season, and whatever else is best in its own season. The juice of ptisan in a very liquid state, and containing little nourishment, is most proper at first, being made always thicker as the disease progresses. But the quantity of nourishment is to be diminished at the crises, and a little before them. And, if the disease be protracted, the customary food must not be abstracted, but we must give nourishing articles from the cereals, in order to support the patient; and when there is need, of the flesh of the extremities of beasts and fowls, mostly dissolved in the soups: these ought to be completely dissolved during the process of boiling. The rock fishes are preferable to all others;<note resp="editor" place="inline">All the Greek and Arabian authorities on dietetics hold, that fishes caught among rocks are particularly excellent. See Paulus Ægineta, t. i. p. 159.</note> but on the whole we must choose the best in the country, for countries are believed to differ as to the kinds of fish which are best in them. Fruit containing wine must be given restrictedly, for it is apt to affect the head and præcordia; but if required by the state of the strength and of the stomach, we must give such articles as apples boiled in mulse or roasted in suet. Of other things, each is to be diluted with hot water, if you give it solely for the refreshment of the stomach; but if it is wanted also for strength, you must not dilute the vinous part much. In a word, the food must be such as I have described.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">For the sake of refrigeration, the head is to be damped with the oil of the unripe olive pounded; for in phrenitics the head is not fond of being kept warm. But if restlessness and false visions be present, we must mix equal parts of rose-oil at first; and the rose-oil is to be increased for the astringing and cooling of the head. But if they become disordered in understanding, and their voice change, the hair (<emph rend="italic">capillary leaves</emph>?) of the wild thyme must be boiled in oils, or the juice of ivy or <pb n="382"/> of knot-grass is also to be infused. But if the delirium get more violent, hog’s-fennel and cow-parsnip are to be boiled in the oils, and some vinegar poured in; for these things dissipate the vapours and heat, and are solvents of the thick humours which contribute to the delirium. But care must be taken that the moist application do not extend to the neck and the tendons, for it is prejudicial to tendons and nerves. Every season is suitable for the damp application, except the commencement of a paroxysm; it should be used more rarely during the increase, but most frequently at the acme; and whenever they are delirious, then, in particular, it will be proper to use a cold application, made still more cold in the season of summer, but in winter tepid. To soothe the delirium it is well to foment the forehead with oxycrate, or the decoction of fleabane, by means of a sponge, and then to anoint with the oil of wild vine or of saffron, and also to anoint the nose and ears with them.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">These things, moreover, also induce sleep. For if they lay awake all night, nor sleep during the day, and the eyes stand quite fixed like horns, and the patients toss about and start up, we must contrive to procure sleep and rest for them; first, by fomentations to the head, with unmixed rose-oil, or oil of marjoram with the juice of ivy, or the decoction of wild thyme or of melilot. But poppy boiled in oil is particularly soporific when applied to the fontenelle of the head, or with a sponge to the forehead. But the poppies, if recently plucked and green, may be applied whole under the pillows; for they thicken and humectate the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), which is dry and attenuated, and diffuse over the senses fumes which prove the commencement of sleep. But if greater applications are needed, we may rub in the meconium (<emph rend="italic">expressed juice of poppy</emph>) itself on the forehead with water, and also anoint the nostrils with the same, and pour it into the ears. Gentle rubbing of the feet with oil, patting of the head, and particularly stroking of <pb n="383"/> the temples and ears is an effectual means; for by the stroking of their ears and temples wild beasts are overcome, so as to cease from their anger and fury.<note resp="editor" place="inline">This passage savours much of magnetical manipulation. The following verses of Solon have been quoted as referring to the same subject :—
<quote rend="align(blockquote)" xml:lang="grc">
	<l/>Ἄλλοι Παιῶνος πολυφαρμάκου ἔργον ἔχοντες
	<l rend="align(indent)"/>Ἰητροί· καὶ τοῖς οὐδὲν ἔπεστι τέλος· 
	<l/>Πολλάκι δ᾿ ἐχ ὀλίγης ὀδύνης μέγα γίγνεται ἄλγος, 
	<l rend="align(indent)"/>Κοὔκ ἄν τις λύσαιτ’ ἤπια φάρμακα δούς· 
	<l/>Τὸν δὲ κακαῖς νούσοισι κυκώμενον ἀργαλέαις τε 
	<l rend="align(indent)"/>Ἀψάμενος χειροῖν αἶψα τίθησ’ ὑγιῆ.</quote></note> But whatever is familiar to any one is to him a provocative of sleep. Thus, to the sailor, repose in a boat, and being carried about on the sea, the sound of the beach, the murmur of the waves, the boom of the winds, and the scent of the sea and of the ship. But to the musician the accustomed notes of his flute in stillness; or playing on the harp or lyre, or the exercise of musical children with song. To a teacher, intercourse with the tattle of children. Different persons are soothed to sleep by different means.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">To the hypochondria and region of the stomach, if distended by inflammation, hardness, and flatulence, embrocations and cataplasms are to be applied, with the addition of the oil of the over-ripe olive, for it is thick, viscid, and calefacient; it therefore is required in inflammation: let dill or flea-bane be boiled in it, and it is a good thing to mix all together; but if flatulence be present also, the fruits of cumin and parsley, and whatever other things are diuretic and carminative, along with sifted natron, are to be sprinkled on the application. But if the liver experience suffering and pain, apply unwashed wool just taken from the ewe, oil from the unripe olive, or rose-oil; but we must mix also Hellenic or Cretan rob, and boil in it melilot, and mixing all these things into one juice, foment the liver therewith. To the spleen the oil must be <pb n="384"/> mixed with vinegar; or if it should appear to be enlarged in bulk, oxycrate, and instead of the wool a soft sponge; for the spleen delights in and is relieved by such things. But if the hypochondria be collapsed and retracted upwards, and the skin be stretched, it will be best instead of the oil, or along with it, to use thick butter in equal quantity, and let fleabane and rosemary be boiled in the decoction, and dill is not unsuitable.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if it be the proper time for cataplasms, we may use the same oils to the same places, the ingredients of the cataplasms being linseed, fenugreek, or fine barley-meal; beans and vetches, also, are proper if the abdomen be swelled. Roasted millet, also, in bags, makes a light and soft fomentation; when ground it makes, along with honey, oil, and linseed, an excellent cataplasm for the hypochondria. Also let the same flowers, herbs, and seeds which I have described among the embrocations be used for the cataplasms. Honey, also, is useful along with these things, to give consistency to the dry things, and for the mixing of the toasted things, and for the preservation of the heat; it is a good thing, likewise, by itself; also a cataplasm half-boiled, and an embrocation dissolved in some of the liquids, is effectual as an emollient, calefacient, carminative, and diuretic, and to moderate the inflammations. These effects are produced also by mulse when drunk, and even more and greater effects when conveyed internally to the trachea, the lungs, the thorax, and the stomach.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The bowels, also, are to be frequently stimulated by suppositories or liniments (for they are generally constipated), in order to act as derivatives from the head, and also for the evaporation of the vapours in the chest, and for the evacuation of the matters in the belly; but, if the belly be confined for several days, it must be opened by a clyster of mulse, oil, and natron.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the distension of the inflammation do not properly <pb n="385"/> subside, we must apply a cupping-instrument with scarificators where the inflammation points and is greatest, on the first or second day, according as the inflamed parts may indicate, and the strength direct; and from those the amount of the evacuation of the blood must be determined, for excess occasions syncope. During the first and second day the fomentation should be the same; but, on the third, cerate with some of the oils used in the embrocations is to be applied: then, if they be still in a state of inflammation, epithemes, consisting of hyssop, fenugreek boiled in mulse, the resin of the turpentine plant, and wax; the oils the same for these places. If by these means the delirium do not at all abate, it will be necessary to have recourse to cropping of the head, provided the hairs be very long, to the extent of one half; but, if shorter, down to the skin: then, in the meantime having recruited the strength, to apply a cupping-instrument to the vertex, and abstract blood. But dry-cupping is first to be applied to the back.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But since in all the acute diseases the chest must be remedied, this part generally suffering with the heart and lungs, more especially from the difficulty of the respiration, which is sometimes hot, at other times cold; and, moreover, from ardent fever, cough, badness of the humours, and sympathy of the nerves, and complaint of the stomach, and illness of the pleura and of the diaphragm (for the heart, if it suffer from any dreadful illness, never recovers),—in cases of phrenitis these parts in particular must be soothed. For, indeed, the delirium in certain cases arises from some of the parts in the chest; respiration hot and dry; thirst acrid; febrile heat not easily endured, as being determined from all parts to the chest; and illness from the perversion of its native heat, but greater and more intolerable the communication of the same from the other parts to the chest: for the extremities are cold—the head, the feet, and the hands; but, above these last, the chest. It is to be remedied, <pb n="386"/> then, by humectation and refrigeration. For bathing, oil boiled with camomile or nard; in summer, also, Hellenic rob. But if it be necessary also to apply epithemes, dates moistened with austere wine, then levigated and pounded into a mass with nard, barley meal, and flower of the wild vine, form a soothing cataplasm for the chest: a cooling one is formed of apples bruised with mastich and melilot; all these things, however, are to be mixed up with wax and nard. But if the stomach be affected with torpor and loathing of food, the juice or hair of worm-wood are mixed up with them; and the hypochondriac region is to be fomented with this boiled up in oil. The infusion or the juice of it may be drunk before food to the amount of two cupfuls of the infusion, or one cupful of the bitter juice with two cupfuls of water. But if the stomach be affected with heartburn, not from the constitution of the disease, but of itself from acrid and saltish humours, or from being pinched with bile, or from being parched with thirst, we must give in the food milk mixed with water to the amount of half a hemina of milk in one cupful of water; the patient should swallow the most of it, but he may take a small portion of it with bread.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the patient be also affected with Causus, and there be thirst, restlessness, mania, and a desire of cold water, we must give less of it than in a case of Causus without phrenitis, for we must take care lest we injure the nerves; we are to give them as much as will prove a remedy for the stomach, and a little is sufficient, for phrenitics are spare drinkers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if converted into syncope, and this also happens (the powers of life being loosened, the patient being melted in sweat, and all the humours being determined outwardly, the strength and spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) being also dissolved), we must disregard the delirium, and be upon our guard lest the patient be resolved into vapours and humidity. Then the only support is wine, to nourish quickly by its substance, and to penetrate <pb n="387"/> everywhere, even to the extremities; to add tone to tone, to rouse the torpid spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), warm that which is cold, brace what is relaxed, restrain those portions which are flowing and running outwards, wine being sweet to the senses of smell so as to impart pleasure; powerful to confirm the strength for life; and most excellent to soothe the mind in delirium. Wine, when drunk, accomplishes all these good purposes; for they become composed by the soothing of their minds, are spontaneously nourished to strength, and are inspired with pleasure.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But when the fever has become protracted and feeble, and the delirium is converted into fatuity, but the hypochondrium is not much injured by swelling, flatulence, or hardness, and the head is the part principally affected, we must boldly wash the head, and practise copious affusions on it; for thus will the habit of body be moistened, the respiration of the head and exhalation over the whole body will be restored; and thus will that which is dry become diluted, and the sense purified of its mist, while the understanding remains sound and firm. These, indeed, are the indications of the removal of the disease.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg003.perseus-eng2:1" n="3"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER II. THE CURE OF LETHARGICS.</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)">LETHARGICS are to be laid in the light, and exposed to the rays of the sun (for the disease is gloom); and in a rather warm place, for the cause is a congelation of the innate heat. A soft couch, paintings on the wall, bed-clothes of various colours, and all things which will provoke the sense of sight; conversation, friction along with squeezing of the feet, pulling, tickling. If deep sleep prevail, shouting aloud, angry reproach, <pb n="388"/> threats regarding those matters which he is accustomed to dread, announcement of those things which he desires and expects. Everything to prevent sleep—the reverse of that which is proper for phrenitics.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">With regard to the depletion of lethargics this should be known:—If the obliviousness be the sequela of another disease, such as phrenitis, we must not open a vein, nor make a great evacuation of blood in any way, but inject the belly, not solely for the evacuation of its contents, but in order to produce revulsion from above, and to determine from the head: there should be a good deal of salts and natron in it, and it answers very well if you add a sprinkling of castor to the clyster; for in lethargics the lower intestine is cold, and dead, as it were, to evacuation. But, if the lethargy is not the consequence of another disease, but is the original affection, and if the patient appear to be plethoric, provided it be with blood, we must open a vein at the elbow; but, if with a watery phlegm, or other humours, we must purge by means of cneoros<note resp="editor" place="inline">Daphne Cneorum L.</note> with the ptisan, or by black hellebore with honeyed-water, in the beginning, if you wish to do so moderately; but if to a greater extent, you must give to the patient when fasting of the medicine called Hiera, to the extent of two drams with three cupfuls of honeyed-water; and, having waited until it purges, then give food, if it be the proper season; but otherwise nourishment is to be given the next day. It will be seasonable then to give in the evening a dram of the hiera, dissolved either in two cupfuls of water or of honeyed-water.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Total abstinence from food is bad, as is also much food. It is proper, then, to administer a little food every day, but not to withdraw food altogether; for the stomach to be reminded of its duties and fomented, as it were, during the whole day. Also the food must be attenuant and laxative, rather in the form of soups than roasted, such as hens or shell-fish; and the <pb n="389"/> herb mercury is to be boiled with it, and some vinegar added. And we may add to the juices, if it be proper to use the juice of ptisan, something to promote exhalation and the discharge of urine, such as fennel, parsley—the pot-herbs themselves, or their fruits. Horehound, also, by its acrid qualities, does good; and likewise colewort with oil, and the brine of fish (<emph rend="italic">garum</emph>). The sweet cumin is a most excellent medicine for the flatulence and urine; for the stomach and bladder are to be stimulated during the whole time of the disease.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The moist applications to the head the same as in the case of phrenitics; for in both the senses are filled with vapours, which must either be expelled by refrigerants and astringents, such as the oil of roses or the juice of ivy, or dissipated into exhalation by attenuants, such as wild thyme in vinegar, with the rose-oil. But if there be pain of the nerves, and coldness of the whole body, but more especially of the extremities, we must besmear and bathe the head and neck with castor and oil of dill, and anoint the spine with the same along with Sicyonian oil, the oil of must, or old oil; at the same time, we must rub both the arms from the shoulders and both the legs from the groins. With these, moreover, the bladder is to be soothed, which suffers, as being of a nervous nature, and is stressed as being the passage for the urine; and also is irritated by the acrimony of the humours, for the urine is bilious. But if the trembling increase, and there be danger of a convulsion, we must necessarily use Sicyonian oil to the head, but use it in small quantity. But if there be inflammation of the hypochondria, and fulness thereof, flatulence, and tension of the skin, or if there be a hollow there from retraction inwards of the hypochondria, we must apply the embrocations and cataplasms, described by us under Phrenitics.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The cupping-instrument is by no means to be used if the disease be the consequence of phrenitis, but this may be done more boldly if it be the original disease. If the tongue be <pb n="390"/> black, and a swelling point in the hypochondria, the cupping-instrument must necessarily be used. When in the course of time the senses have been evacuated, and the patient is otherwise more tolerant of the disease, we may apply the cupping-instrument to the top of the head, since we can evacuate from it without injury to the strength.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Flatulence is to be expelled both upwards and downwards; for lethargy produces collections of flatus both in the cavities and in the whole frame, from inactivity, torpor, and want of spirit, which motion and watchfulness dissipate; wherefore, having rubbed up green rue with honey and natron, we anoint therewith; it will expel the wind more effectually if one part of the resin of turpentine be added to these things. A fomentation also will expel flatus, either with hot unwashed wool, or with rough old rags, or a sponge with water in which hyssop, marjoram, penny-royal, or rue, have been boiled.

<p rend="align(indent)">If there be trembling of the hands and head, he may take a draught, consisting of castor with three cupfuls of honeyed-water, for some days; or if he will not drink this, we may melt down the castor in a sufficient quantity of oil, wherein rue has been boiled, to the amount of three cupfuls; and a double amount of this is to be injected into the lower bowel, and is to be repeated for several days; and after the benefit derived from it (for it brings off flatus upwards and downwards, and, in certain cases, urine and fæces), if it should <pb n="391"/> be diffused over the whole system in any way, the nerves recover from their tremblings and become strong, and it changes the habit of body to the hot and dry, and alters the constitutions of diseases. It is also a very excellent thing to blow it into the nostrils, for in this way it expels flatulence by sneezing; for as the bladder secretes urine, so does the nose mucus. It effects these things by its gentle heat, in which respect it is superior to the other sternutatories, pepper, hellebore, soap-wort, and euphorbium; for these things, both at their first and last impression are harsh, and disorder the head and the sense, whereas castor gradually creates a gentle heat. To the head it is also otherwise suitable, because the nerves everywhere derive their origin from it; and castor is a remedy for the diseases of the nerves; but to mix it with some one or more of the medicines described will not be disagreeable, for if it be mixed, it will not immediately disorder the head, even in a moderate degree, but after a time it will stir up the heat.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The nose is to be moistened by tickling; by odours acrid indeed to the sense, but possessed of heating powers, such as the castor itself, or savory, or penny-royal, or thyme, either in a green state, or in a dried, moistened well with vinegar.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">Anointing with acrid medicines is proper to the feet and knees. The <emph rend="italic">materiel</emph> thereof should be heating and pungent by degrees; for there is need of both in cases of lethargy to induce warmth and watchfulness. In the first place, it is proper to whip the limbs with the nettles, for the down thereof sticking to the skin does not endure long, but imparts no disagreeable tingling and pain; it also moderately stimulates, induces swelling, and provokes heat. But if you desire to have these effects produced more powerfully, rub in equal parts of lemnestis<note resp="editor" place="inline">An efflorescence collecting about reeds in salt lakes. The same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδάρκη</foreign>, for which see the Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon.</note> and euphorbium, with oil of must. It is <pb n="392"/> also a very good thing to rub with raw squill pulverised; but it is necessary to rub off the oily matter of the limb (for everything acrid loses its stimulant properties with oil) — unless it be medicinal — either the oil of privet, or that of must, or the Sicyonian. But if after these things a deep coma prevail, it will be proper, having pounded the wild cucumber with vinegar, and mixed it with an equal quantity of a cake of mustard, to apply this as an acrid cataplasm, and one which will speedily occasion redness, and will also quickly produce swelling. But if there be danger of blistering and of wounds, it will be proper to raise the cataplasm frequently, and see that none of these effects be produced. These things, therefore, are to be done to relieve the torpor and insensibility of the parts at all seasons, except at the commencement of the paroxysms.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the patient have already recovered his sensibility, but there is still some heaviness of the head, noise, or ringing thereof, it will be proper to evacuate phlegm by the mouth, first by giving mastich to chew, so that he may constantly spit, then again stavesacre, the granum cnidium,<note resp="editor" place="inline">Probably the fruit of the <emph rend="italic">Daphne cnidium.</emph></note> but more especially mustard, because it is a common article, and also because it is more of a phlegmagogue than the others. And if the patient drink it willingly, it will be sufficient to dissolve the matters in the stomach, it will also be able to moisten the stomach and expel flatulence; for this once fortunately happened to myself in the case of a man who drank it by my directions; for experience is a good teacher, one ought, then, to try experiments, for too much caution is ignorance.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The head, then, after the hair has been clipped to the skin, if much good is not thereby accomplished, is to be shaven to procure insensible perspiration, and also to allow the anointing with acrid medicines, such as that from lemnestis (or <emph rend="italic">adarce</emph>), <pb n="393"/> or thapsia,<note resp="editor" place="inline"><emph rend="italic">Thapsia Garganica L.</emph>, a species of deadly carrot.</note> or mustard moistened with water; these things, with double the quantity of bread, are to be rubbed on an old piece of skin, and applied to the head, taking good care at the expiry of an hour to foment the parts with hot sponges.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">It will also not be devoid of utility, when all, or most at least, of the fatal symptoms of the disease are gone, but the languor remains, to bathe; and then also gestation, friction, and all gentle motion will be beneficial.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">. . . . . should indeed the apoplexy be severe, for by all means the patients are, as it were, dead men whenever one is old, to whom this affection is congenial, and they cannot survive the greatness of the illness, combined with the misery of advanced life. It has been formerly stated by me, how the magnitude of the disease is to be estimated. If the patient be young, and the attack of apoplexy weak, it is still no easy matter to effect a cure; it must, however, be attempted. The equivalent remedy, then, as being the great assistance in a a great disease, is venesection, provided there be no mistake as to quantity; but the amount is difficult to determine, since if you take a little too much, you despatch the patient at once; for to them a little blood is most potent, as being that which imparts the vital heat to the frame itself, and to the food. But, if the quantity be inferior to the cause, you do little good with this the great remedy, for the cause still remains. But it is better to err on the side of smallness; for, if it should seem to have been deficient, and the appearance of the eyes, as seen from below, be favourable, we can open a vein again. We must open the vein at the hollow of the elbow, for the blood flows readily from it in the left arm. But in smaller attacks of apoplexy, it is necessary to consider whether the paralytic seizure be on the left side or the right. In a word, the abstraction is to be made from the healthy parts, for there the blood flows more freely, and thither the revulsion is made from the parts affected. When, therefore, the patient is seized with apoplexy without any obvious cause, we should decide thus concerning the abstraction of the blood. But if the attack happen from a blow, a fall from a high place, <pb n="395"/> or compression, there must be no procrastination, for in certain cases this alone is sufficient for the cure and to save life.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if it is not thought expedient to open a vein, owing to the patient’s having been seized with much coldness, torpor, and insensibility, an injection must be given for the evacuation of the engorgement in the bowels (for very generally persons are seized with apoplexy from the immoderate use of food and wine), and for the revulsion of the humours seated in the head. The clyster should be acrid; and an evacuant of phlegm and bile, consisting not only of natron, but also of euphorbium, to the amount of three oboli, added to the usual amount of a clyster, also the medullary part of the wild cucumber, or the decoction of the hair (<emph rend="italic">leaves</emph>) of centaury in oil or water. The following is a very excellent clyster: To the usual amount of honey add rue boiled with oil and the resin of the turpentine tree, and some salts, instead of natron, and the decoction of hyssop.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And if by these means the patient be somewhat aroused, either from being moved by the supervention of fevers, or having recovered from his insensibility, or the pulse has become good, or if the general appearance of the face has become favourable, one may entertain good hopes, and apply the remedies more boldly. Wherefore, when the strength is confirmed, the purgative hiera may be given to the patient fasting, and particularly a full dose. But, if the strength be an objection, it is to be given, to the amount of one-half, with honeyed-water. And we are to move him about, after having laid him stretched on a couch; and those who carry him must do so gently, he being allowed to rest frequently, to avoid inducing lassitude. And if there be a copious evacuation from the bowels, we are to permit it; but if not, give water, or honeyed-water, to the amount of two cupfuls, for drink. And if nausea supervene upon the purging, we are not to interfere with it; for the exertions of the body have some tendency to <pb n="396"/> resuscitate the patient, and the vomiting of the bile carries off the cause of the disease. The medicine hiera is a purger of the senses, of the head, and of the nerves. Enough, indeed, has been said respecting evacuation of every kind at the commencement.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But having wrapped the whole of his person in wool, we are to soak it with some oil — the Sicyonian, oil of musk (<emph rend="italic">gleucinum</emph>), or old oil, either each of these separately, or all mixed together; but it is best to melt into it a little wax, so as to bring it to the thickness of ointments; and it is to be rendered more powerful by adding some natron and pepper: these are to be reduced to a powder, and strained in a sieve. But castor has great efficacy in cases of palsy, both in the form of a liniment with some of the fore-mentioned oils, and it is still more potent when taken in a draught with honeyed-water, the quantity being to the amount we have stated under lethargics; but, at the same time, we must consider the age and disposition of the patient, whether he be ready to take the drink for several days. Inunctions are more powerful than fomentations, as being more easily borne, and also more efficacious; for the ointment does not run down so as to stain the bed-clothes (for this is disagreeable to the patient), and adheres to the body until, being melted by the heat thereof, it is drunk up. Moreover, the persistence of their effects is beneficial, whereas liquid applications run off. The ingredients of the ointments are such as have been stated by me; but along with them castor, the resin of the turpentine-tree, equal parts of euphorbium, of lemnestis, and of pellitory; of pepper, and of galbanum one-half, with triple the amount of Egyptian natron; and of wax, so as to bring it to a liquid consistence. But a much more complex mode of preparing these medicines has been described by me on various occasions, and under a particular head. Cataplasms are to be applied to the hardened and distended parts; their ingredients are linseed, fenugreek, barley-meal, oil <pb n="397"/> in which rue or dill has been boiled, the root of mallows pounded and boiled in honeyed-water, so as to become of the consistence of wax. They should be of a soft and agreeable consistence. These things are to be done if the patient still remains free of fever, or if the fever be slight, in which case no regard need be had to the heat.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the fevers be of an acute nature, and the remaining disease appear to be of minor consequence, and if these induce urgent danger, the diet and the rest of the treatment must be accommodated to them. Wherefore, the patients must use food altogether light and of easy digestion; and now, most especially, attention ought to be paid to the proper season for eating, and, during the paroxysms, the whole of the remedial means must be reduced; and, altogether, we must attend to the fevers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the disease be protracted, and if the head be at fault, we must apply the cupping-instrument to the back of the head, and abstract blood unsparingly; for it is more efficacious than phlebotomy, and does not reduce the strength. But, dry-cupping is to be first applied between the shoulders, in order to produce revulsion of the matters in the occiput.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Sometimes, also, the parts concerned in deglutition are paralysed, which is the sole help and safety of persons in apoplexy, both for the swallowing of food and for the transmission of medicines. For not only is there danger of want of nourishment and hunger, but also of cough, difficulty of breathing, and suffocation; for if one pour any liquid food into the mouth it passes into the trachea, neither the tonsils coming together for the protrusion of the food, nor the epiglottis occupying its proper seat where it is placed by nature, as the cover of the windpipe; we must, therefore, pour honeyed-water or the strained ptisan into a piece of bread resembling a long spoon, and passing it over the trachea, pour its contents into the stomach; for in this way deglutition is <pb n="398"/> still accomplished. But if the patient be in the extremity of danger, and the neck with the respiration is compressed, we must rub the neck and chin with heating things and foment. They effect nothing, and are unskilful in the art, who apply the cupping-instrument to the throat, in order to dilate the gullet; for distension, in order to procure the admission of food, is not what is wanted, but contraction of the parts for the purposes of deglutition. But the cupping-instrument distends further; and, if the patient wish to swallow, it prevents him by its expansion and revulsion, whereas it is necessary to pass into a state of collapse, in order to accomplish the contraction of deglutition; and in addition to these, it stuffs the trachea so as to endanger suffocation. And neither, if you place it on either side of the windpipe, does it any good; for muscles and nerves, and tendons and veins, are in front of it.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The bladder and the loose portion of the rectum are sometimes paralysed, in regard to their expulsive powers, when the bowels are constantly filled with the excrements, and the bladder is swelled to a great size. But sometimes they are affected as to their retentive powers, for the discharges run away as if from dead parts. In this case one must not boldly use the instrument, the catheter, for there is danger of inducing violent pain of the bladder, and of occasioning a convulsion in the patient. It is better to inject with no great amount of strained ptisan; and if the bowel be evacuated of the fæces, it will be proper to inject castor with oil. But the sole hope, both of general and partial attacks of paralysis, consists in the <emph rend="italic">sitz</emph> bath of oil. The manner of it will be described under the chronic diseases.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">EVEN the first fall in epilepsy is dangerous, if the disease attack in an acute form; for it has sometimes proved fatal in one day. The periodical paroxysms are also dangerous; and, therefore, on these accounts, epilepsy has been described among the acute diseases. But if the patient has become habituated to the illness, and the disease has taken a firm hold of him, it has become not only chronic, but, in certain cases, perpetual; for if it pass the prime of life, it clings to him in old age and in death.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Such remedies, then, as are applicable in the chronic state will be described among the chronic diseases; but such things as must be done for a sudden attack of the disease, of these the greater number have been described under apoplectics, namely, venesection, clysters, anointings, the cupping instrument; these means being the most powerful for the purpose of arousing. But I will now describe the peculiar remedies for an attack of the falling sickness. In children, then, to whom, owing to dyspepsia, or from excessive cold, the disease is familiar, vomiting, either of food, or of phlegm, or of any other humour, is beneficial. Feathers, then, dipped in the ointment of iris, excite vomiting; and the unguentum irinum is not inapplicable for smearing the tonsils with. But having first laid the child on his belly (this is the easiest position for vomiting), we must press gently on his lower belly. But if the lower jaw be convulsed or distorted, or if the hands and legs be tossed about, and if the whole face be fixed, the limbs are to be soothed by gentle rubbing with oil, and the distortions of the countenance rectified; the straight parts are to be gently bound, so that they may not become distorted. The <pb n="400"/> cold parts are to be fomented with unscoured wool, or with old rags. The anus is to be rubbed with honey along with the oil of rue, or with natron and liquid resin along with these things; and they are to be gently pushed within the anus, for they expel flatus, and children pass flatus in this disease. But if they can swallow, we may give them of this medicine: Of cardamom, one part; of copper, one siliqua. These things are to be drunk with honeyed-water; for either it is vomited up along with the matter annoying the stomach, or the bowels are opened. This is a very excellent linctus: Of cardamom, of mustard, and of the hair of hyssop equal parts; of the root of iris, one part, with a double quantity of natron; of pepper, to the amount of one-third. Having mixed up all these things together, and having separated the jaw, pour into the mouth, and even beyond the tonsils, so that the things may be swallowed. These things are proper for infants, and for young persons the same are applicable. But the more powerful emetics are to be taken: the bulbous root of narcissus; of mustard and of hyssop, equal parts; of copper and pepper, one-half the proportion of the former things. They are to be mixed with honey and given. These things are proper, in order to rouse from the paroxysm; but those calculated to produce the resolution of the disease will be described under the chronic diseases.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">NOW, indeed, a soft, comfortable, smooth, commodious, and warm bed is required; for the nerves become unyielding, hard, and distended by the disease; and also the skin, being dry <pb n="401"/> and rough, is stretched; and the eye-lids, formerly so mobile, can scarcely wink; the eyes are fixed and turned inwards; and likewise the joints are contracted, not yielding to extension. Let the house also be in a tepid condition; but, if in the summer season, not to the extent of inducing sweats or faintness; for the disease has a tendency to syncope. We must also not hesitate in having recourse to the other great remedies; for it is not a time for procrastination. Whether, then, the tetanus has come on from refrigeration, without any manifest cause, or whether from a wound, or from abortion in a woman, we must open the vein at the elbow, taking especial care with respect to the binding of the arm, that it be rather loose; and as to the incision, that it be performed in a gentle and expeditious manner, as these things provoke spasms; and take away a moderate quantity at first, yet not so as to induce fainting and coldness. And the patient must not be kept in a state of total abstinence from food, for famine is frigid and arid. Wherefore we must administer thick honeyed-water without dilution, and strained ptisan with honey. For these things do not press upon the tonsils, so as to occasion pain; and, moreover, they are soft to the gullet, and are easily swallowed, are laxative of the belly, and very much calculated to support the strength. But the whole body is to be wrapped in wool soaked in oil of must or of saffron, in which either rosemary, fleabane, or wormwood has been boiled. All the articles are to be possessed of heating properties, and hot to the touch. We must rub with a liniment composed of lemnestis, euphorbium, natron, and pellitory, and to these a good deal of castor is to be added. The tendons also are to be well wrapped in wool, and the parts about the ears and chin rubbed with liniments; for these parts, in particular, suffer dreadfully, and are affected with tension. Warm fomentations, also, are to be used for the tendons and bladder, these being applied in bags containing toasted millet, or in the bladders of cattle half <pb n="402"/> filled with warm oil, so that they may lay broad on the fomented parts. Necessity sometimes compels us to foment the head, a practice not agreeable to the senses, but good for the nerves; for, by raising vapours, it fills the senses with fume, but relaxes the nervous parts. It is proper, then, to use a mode of fomentation the safest possible, and materials not of a very heavy smell; and the materials should consist of oil devoid of smell, boiled in a double vessel,<note resp="editor" place="inline">A double vessel was a smaller vessel, to which heat was applied by placing it in a larger. It was called <emph rend="italic">balneum mariœ</emph> by the alchemists. It is frequently made mention of in the works of the ancient writers on pharmacy. See, in particular, Galen, sec. loc. vii. 2; De Sanit. tuend iv. 8; Meth. Med. viii. 5; Dioscorid. ii. 95; Oribasius Meth. Med. viii. 6, and the learned note of Daremberg.</note> and applied in bladders; or of fine salts in a bag: for millet and linseed are pleasant indeed to the touch, but gaseous, and of an offensive smell. The patient having been laid on his back, the fomentations are to be spread below the tendons, as far as the vertex; but we must not advance further to the bregma, for it is the common seat of all sensation, and of all remedial and noxious means it is the starting-point. But if it be necessary to apply cataplasms to the tendons, it must be done below the occiput; for if placed higher, they will fill the head with the steam of the linseed and fenugreek. After the cataplasms, it is a good thing to apply the cupping-instrument to the occiput on both sides of the spine; but one must be sparing in the use of heat, for the pressure of the lips of the instrument is thus painful, and excites contractions. It is better, then, to suck slowly and softly, rather than suddenly in a short time; for thus the part in which you wish to make the incision will be swelled up without pain. Your rule in regard to the proper amount of blood must be the strength. These are the remedies of tetanus without wounds.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the spasm be connected with a wound, it is dangerous, <pb n="403"/> and little is to be hoped. We must try to remedy it, however, for some persons have been saved even in such cases. In addition to the other remedies, we must also treat the wounds with the calefacient things formerly described by me, by fomentations, cataplasms, and such other medicines as excite gentle heat, and will create much pus: for in tetanus the sores are dry. Let the application consist of the manna of frankincense, and of the hair of poley, and of the resins of turpentine and pine-trees, and of the root of marsh-mallow and of rue, and of the herb fleabane. These things are to be mixed up with the cataplasms, melting some of them, sprinkling the others upon them, and levigating others beforehand with oil; but the mallow, having been pounded, is to be boiled beforehand in honeyed-water. We are to sprinkle, also, some castor on the ulcer, for no little warmth is thereby communicated to the whole body, because the rigors proceeding from the sores are of a bad kind. Rub the nostrils with castor along with oil of saffron; but also give it frequently, in the form of a draught, to the amount of three oboli. But if the stomach reject this, give intermediately of the root of silphium an equal dose to the castor, or of myrrh the half of the silphium: all these things are to be drunk with honeyed-water. But if there be a good supply of the juice of the silphium from Cyrene,<note resp="editor" place="inline">I would remind the professional reader, that the Cyrenaic silphium was a superior kind of <emph rend="italic">assa-fœtida</emph>, which at one time grew copiously in the region of Cyrene. See Paulus Ægineta, Syd. Soc. Edit., t. iii. 337.</note> wrap it, to the amount of a tare, in boiled honey, and give to swallow. It is best given in this way, as it slips unperceived through the palate; for it is acrid, and occasions disagreeable eructations, being a substance which has a bad smell. But if it cannot be swallowed thus, it must be given dissolved in honeyed-water; for it is the most powerful of all the medicines given to be swallowed, which are naturally <pb n="404"/> warming, diluent, and can relax distensions and soothe the nerves. But if they can swallow nothing, we must inject it into the anus with the oil of castor; and thus the anus is to be anointed with oil or honey. With this, also, we must anoint the fundament, along with oil or honey. But if they will drink nothing, we must make an injection of some castor with the oil. With this, also, we are to anoint the fundament, along with fat or honey; and also foment the bladder; and use it as an ointment, having melted it with a sufficiency of wax to bring it to the proper consistence. But if it be the time for evacuating flatulence and fæces, we are to inject two drams of the purgative hiera along with honeyed-water and oil, since, along with the expulsion of these, it warms the lower belly; for hiera is both a compound and heating medicine.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">THERE are two forms of quinsey. The one is attended with heat, and great inflammation of the tonsils, and swelling outwardly; moreover, the tongue, uvula, and all the parts there, are raised up into a swelling. The other is a collapse of these parts, and compression inwardly, with greater sense of suffocation, so that the inflammation appears to be determined to the heart. In it, then, particularly, we must make haste to apply our remedies, for it quickly proves fatal.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If, then, it proceed from taking too much food and wine, we must inject the bowels on the day of the attack, and that with two clysters: the one a common clyster, so as to bring off the feculent matters; and the other for the purpose of producing revulsion of the humours from the tonsils and chest. <pb n="405"/> It will therefore be, but not undiluted . . . . . . . and the decoctions of centaury and hyssop; for these medicines also bring off phlegm. And if the patient has been on a restricted diet, we open the vein at the elbow, and make a larger incision than usual, that the blood may flow with impetuosity and in large quantity; for such a flow is sufficient to mitigate the heat most speedily, is able to relieve the strangulation, and reduce all the bad symptoms. It is no bad practice, likewise, to bring the patient almost to fainting, and yet not so as that he should faint altogether, for some from the shock have died of the fainting . . . . . . . . or binding them with ligatures above the ankles and knees. It is a very good thing, likewise, to apply ligatures to the forearms above the wrists, and above the forearms to the arms. And if deglutition be easy, we are to give elaterium with honeyed-water, and the whey of milk, as much as will be sufficient to purge the patient. In these cases, elaterium is preferable to all other cathartics; but cneoros and mustard are also suitable, for both these purge the bowels. If the inflammations do not yield to these means, having bent the tongue back to the roof of the mouth, we open the veins in it; and if the blood flow freely and copiously, it proves more effectual than all other means. Liquid applications to the inflamed parts, at first of an astringent nature, so as to dispel the morbid matters: unwashed wool, then, with hyssop, moistened in wine, and the ointment from the unripe olive. But the cataplasms are similar to the liquid applications,—dates soaked in wine, and levigated with rose-leaves. But in order that the cataplasm may be rendered glutinous and soft, let flour or linseed, and honey and oil be added, to produce the admixture of all the ingredients. But if it turn to a suppuration, we are to use hot things, such as those used in the other form of synanche. Let fenugreek be the powder, and manna and resin the substances which are melted; and let the hair of poley be sprinkled on it, and a hot fomentation <pb n="406"/> be made with sponges of the decoction of the fruit of the bay and of hyssop. And the powdered dung of pigeons or of dogs, sifted in a sieve, is most efficacious in producing suppuration, when sprinkled on the cataplasm. As gargles, honeyed-water, with the decoction of dried lentil, or of hyssop, or of roses, or of dates, or of all together. We are also to smear the whole mouth, as far as the internal fauces, either with Simples, such as the juice of mulberries, or the water of pounded pomegranates, or the decoction of dates; or with Compound preparations, such as that from mulberries, or that from <emph rend="italic">besasa</emph>,<note resp="editor" place="inline">The wild rue, or <emph rend="italic">Peganum harmala.</emph> See Dioscorides, iii. 46.</note> or that from the juice of pomegranates, and that from swallows. But if the ulcers proceed from eschars, these gargles, and washes for the mouth, the decoction of hyssop in honeyed-water, or of fat figs in water, and along with them starch dissolved in honeyed-water, or the juice of ptisan, or of tragus (<emph rend="italic">spelt</emph>?).</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But in the species of synanche attended with collapse, we are to make a general determination from within outwardly, of the fluids, of the warmth, and of all the flesh, so that the whole may swell out. Let the liquid applications then be of a hot nature, with rue and dill, natron being sprinkled upon them; and along with them the cataplasms formerly mentioned. It is a good thing also to apply a cerate with natron and mustard for inducing heat; for heat determined outwardly is the cure of such complaints; and thus swelling takes place in the neck, and an external swelling rescues from peripneumonia; but in cases of synanche, the evil when inwardly is of a fatal nature. But those who, in order to guard against suffocation in quinsey, make an incision in the trachea for the breathing, do not appear to me to have proved the practicability of the thing by actual experiment; for the heat of the inflammation is increased by the wound, and thus contributes to the suffocation and cough. And, moreover, if by any means they should escape the danger, the lips of the <pb n="407"/> wound do not coalesce; for they are both cartilaginous, and not of a nature to unite.<note resp="editor" place="inline">On the Ancient History of Laryngotomy, see Paulus Ægineta, t. ii., pp. 301—303, Syd.

<p rend="align(indent)">OF the affections which form about the <emph rend="italic">columella</emph>, some require to be treated by excision; but the surgical treatment of such cases does not come within the design of this work. Some are to be treated as acute affections; for some of them readily prove fatal by suffocation and dyspnœa. These are the diseases which we call <emph rend="italic">uva</emph> and <emph rend="italic">columella</emph>; for both are attended with inflammation and increase in thickness and length, so that the parts hang down, and come into the <emph rend="italic">arteria aspera.</emph> The <emph rend="italic">columna</emph> is of equal thickness from the base to the extremity in the palate: the <emph rend="italic">uva</emph> is of unequal thickness; for its base at the palate is slender, whereas at its extremity it is rounded and thick, with redness and lividity, whence it gets the appellation of <emph rend="italic">uva.</emph> These, then, must be speedily relieved; for the death from suffocation is very speedy.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If, then, the patients be young, we must open the vein at the elbow, and evacuate copiously by a larger incision than usual; <pb n="408"/> for such an abstraction frees one from suffocation, as it were, from strangulation. It is necessary, also, to inject with a mild clyster, but afterwards with an acrid one, again and again, until one has drawn from the parts above by revulsion; and let ligatures be applied to the extremities above the ankles and knees, and above the wrists and forearms to the arms. But if the suffocation be urgent, we must apply a cupping-instrument to the occiput and to the thorax, with some scarifications, and also do everything described by me under synanche; for the mode of death is the same in both. We must also use the same medicines to the mouth, both astringents and emollients, with fomentation of the external parts, cataplasms, and liniments to the mouth. For the forms named <emph rend="italic">columella</emph> and <emph rend="italic">uva</emph>, as an astringent medicine take the juice of pomegranate, acacia dissolved in honey or water, hypocistis, Samian, Lemnian, or Sinopic earth, and the inspissated juice of sour grapes. But if the diseased part be ulcerated, gum and starch moistened in the decoction of roses or of dates, and the juice of ptisan or of spelt (<emph rend="italic">tragus</emph>). But in <emph rend="italic">columella</emph> let there be more of the stronger medicines, from myrrh, costus,<note resp="editor" place="inline"><emph rend="italic">Auklandia Costus L.</emph> See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p.190.</note> and cyperus;<note resp="editor" place="inline"><emph rend="italic">Cyperus rotundus L.</emph> See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 204.</note> for the <emph rend="italic">columella</emph> endures these acrid substances. But should the part suppurate, in certain cases even the bones of the palate have become diseased, and the patients have died, wasted by a protracted consumption. The remedies of these will be described elsewhere.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">IN some respects, the treatment of these is the same as that of the other affections in the tonsils, and in some peculiar. In inflammation and suffocation, the remedies are clysters, venesection, liquid applications, cataplasms, fomentation, ligatures, cupping; and all these are applicable here. But anointing with more potent medicines is proper; for the ulcers do not stop, nor do eschars form on the surface. But if a sanies from them run inwardly, the parts, even if before in a healthy state, very soon become ulcerated, and very soon the ulcers spread inwardly, and prove fatal. It might be beneficial to burn the affection with fire, but it is unsuitable owing to the isthmus. But we must use medicines resembling fire to stop the spreading and also for the falling off of the eschars: these are alum, gall, the flowers of the wild pomegranate, either in a dried state or with honeyed-water. And the same medicines may be blown in by means of a reed, or quill, or a thick and long tube, so that the medicines may touch the sores. The best of these medicines is calcined chalcitis,<note resp="editor" place="inline">Native Sulphate of Copper. See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. pp. 401, 402.</note> with cadmia<note resp="editor" place="inline">Calamine. See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 150.</note> triturated in vinegar. Let there be a double proportion of the cadmia, and of the root of rhubarb, with some fluid. It is necessary, however, to guard against their pressure, for the ulcers thus get moist and spread farther. We must, therefore, sprinkle them in a dry state with a quill. But the liquid medicines, having been much diluted, are to be injected upon the columella. But if the eschars be already loosened, and the ulcers become red, <pb n="410"/> there is then most danger of convulsion; for generally the ulcers are dried up, and thereby tonic contractions of the nerves are induced. It is necessary then to soften and moisten by means of milk, with starch, and the juice of ptisan, or of tragus, or linseed, or the seed of fenugreek. In certain cases also the uvula has been eaten down to the bone of the palate and the tonsils to their base and epiglottis; and in consequence of the sore, the patient could neither swallow anything solid nor liquid; but the drink regurgitating has cut him off by starvation.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">IN cases of Pleurisy there is no time for procrastination, nor for putting off the great remedy. For the fever, being very acute, hastens to a fatal termination; the pain also of the <emph rend="italic">succingens</emph> hurries on to the worse; and moreover coughs which agitate the chest and head exhaust the powers. Wherefore then, on the selfsame day we must by all means open a vein. But if it be in connection with repletion of food and drink, having kept the patient fasting for one day, we are to abstract blood from the vein in the hollow of the elbow, in a line with the opposite side, (for it is better to take it from a very great distance); but not to the extent of deliquium animi, for there is danger of Peripneumonia supervening if the body, being congealed, should leave the soul; for the fluids rush inward when deprived of their external heat and tension. For the Lungs are of loose texture, hot, and possessed of strong powers of attraction; the lungs also are the neighbours of the ribs, <pb n="411"/> and their associates in suffering; and this succession of disease is not readily recovered from; whereas in Pleuritis from Peripneumonia, recovery readily takes place, this combination being milder. It is necessary, therefore, after a moderate flow of blood, to recruit the patient for a time, and afterwards abstract again; if matters go on well, the same day, provided the remission be long; but if not, on the day following. But if there is no remission of the fever (for generally the fever prevails and increases for one day), we are to abstract blood the third day during the second remission, when also food is to be given—after having anointed the patient freely, having also applied to the side soft oil with the heating ointment of rue, or the decoction of dill. A very soothing fomentation is also to be applied to the side. In certain cases, the pain and inflammation are determined outwardly, so as to make it appear an affection of the parts there; but it is merely an exacerbation of the internal symptoms.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Let us now treat of regimen, in order that, respecting all the system of treatment, there may be no mistake. <q rend="double">For in food will consist the medicines, but also the medicines in food.</q> In kind, then, it is to be hot and humid, smooth and consistent, detergent, solvent, having the power of dissolving and attenuating phlegm. Of all kinds of food, therefore, ptisan is to be preferred; at the commencement, then, strained to its juice, so that the solid part of it may be separated; and made with honey only; and let the usual articles added to it for seasoning and variety be absent (for now the juice alone is sufficient). It will be calculated to moisten and warm, and able to dissolve and clear away phlegm, to evacuate upwards without pain such matters as should be brought up, and also readily evacuate the bowels downwards. For its lubricity is agreeable and adapted to deglutition. Moreover, its glutinous quality soothes heat, purges the membranes, concocts coughs, and softens all the parts. These are the virtues of <pb n="412"/> barley. The next place to it is held by chondrus,<note resp="editor" place="inline">Spelt, <emph rend="italic">Triticum spelta</emph>, deprived of its husks and broken down into granules. See Paul. Ægin. t. i. p.123, Syd. Soc. Edit.</note> being possessed of some of the good qualities of ptisan. For in regard to its glutinous quality, its lubricity, and its appropriateness for deglutition, it is equal to the other, but in other respects inferior. They are to be made plain, with honey alone. The tragus also is excellent.<note resp="editor" place="inline">The <emph rend="italic">tragus</emph> (called <emph rend="italic">tragum</emph> by Pliny, H. N. xviii. 10) was a culinary preparation frym Spelt, and would seem to have been much the same as the <emph rend="italic">chondrus.</emph> See Galen, Comment. in lib. de ratione victus in morb. acut.</note> But rice is worse than these, inasmuch as it has the property of drying, roughening, and of stopping the purgation of the sides, rather than of making it more fluid. A very excellent thing is dry bread, broken into pieces, passed through a sieve, gently warmed, well concocted, which with honeyed-water is sufficient nourishment. But if the disease have already progressed, and the patient have given up his food, the ptisan of barley is to be administered in a soft state, and well boiled. Dill and salts are to be the condiments of the ptisan, and oil which is thin, without quality, without viscidity, without asperity; it is better, however, not to boil much of the oil with the ptisan; for thus the draught becomes fatty, and the oil loses its badness, and with much boiling is no longer perceptible, being drunk up by the juice. And let leek with its capillary leaves, and bitter almonds, be boiled with the juice of ptisan; for the draught thus promotes perspiration, and becomes medicinal, and the leeks eaten out of the juice are beneficial and very delicious. Now also is the season for using wholesome eggs; but if the expectoration be fluid and copious, sprinkle on them some native sulphur and natron. But the best thing of all is to give new-laid eggs which have never been subjected to the fire; for the heat of the hen is more humid than fire, and <pb n="413"/> more congenial to the patient, as proceeding from one animal to another. But if the phlegm be glutinous and viscid, pour oil into the eggs, and sprinkle some of the dried resin of pine—so that the sulphur may be more powerful; melting also with them some of the resin of turpentine; pepper also and all cognate substances are beneficial in eggs, and in all kinds of food; the extremities of animals melted down in soups, pigeons, boiled hens; the brains of swine roasted with the cawl, but without it they are not savoury. If the patient has no <emph rend="italic">râle</emph>, we must give him fish from the depth of the sea, or rock fish, the best which the country produces. And that the patient may not transgress in regimen, owing to his appetite, nor become wasted by a spare diet, he is to be gratified with some fruit; such as apples boiled in water, or honeyed-water, or stewed in suet (but we must take off the skin and rough parts within along with the seeds,); and in season we may give some figs. We must give likewise of any other kind of autumn fruit which is not only not hurtful but also beneficial. So much with regard to diet.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">Wool fumigated with sulphur and moistened with oil in which dill and rue have been boiled, is to be laid on the side. Foment the side constantly with these, and, before the administration of food, apply cataplasms, in addition to the usual ingredients containing melilot boiled with honeyed-water, and mixing therewith some of the fleshy part of the poppy in a boiled state, and sprinkling on it the meal of the manna thuris.<note resp="editor" place="inline">See Paul. Ægin. t. iii. p. 241.</note> But if the expectoration be more fluid and copious, we are to mix the flour of darnel, or of hedge mustard, and sprinkle natron on it. But if the disease be prolonged, the pain having become fixed, and the purging liquid, it is to be apprehended that pus is about to form; wherefore mix with the cataplasms mustard and <emph rend="italic">cachrys;</emph><note resp="editor" place="inline">Probably the <emph rend="italic">Cachrys libanotis.</emph> See Dioscorides, M. M. iii. 78; and appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon under <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιβανωτίς</foreign>.</note> <pb n="414"/> and if the patients have a feeling as if the internal parts were cold, some vinegar may be poured into it. The heat of the cataplasms should be of a strong kind, that it may last the longer; for this is better than having the heat kept up by renewal of the cataplasms. Let the fomentations consist of salts and millet in bags, or of warm oil in bladders. Every apparatus used for fomentation should be light, so that the weight may not add to the pain. These things moreover are to be used also after the food, if the pain be urgent.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And, in addition to these means, now also should be the time of cupping; but it is best after the seventh day: before this you should not be urgent with it, for the diseases are not of a favourable character which require cupping before the seventh day. Let the instrument be large, broad every way, and sufficient to comprehend the place which is pained; for the pain does not penetrate inwardly, but spreads in width. There should be plenty of heat below the cupping-instrument, so as not only to attract, but also to warm before the extinction of the fire. And after the extinction, having scarified, we are to abstract as much blood as the strength will permit; much more than if you had to take away blood from the hypochondria for any other cause. For the benefit from cupping is most marked in cases of Pleurisy. But salts or natron are to be sprinkled on the scarifications, a pungent and painful practice indeed, but yet a healthful one. But we must estimate the powers and habits of the patient. For if strong in mind and robust in body, we must sprinkle some of the salts, not indeed so as to come into immediate contact with the wounds themselves, but they are to be sprinkled on a piece of linen-cloth damped with oil, and it is to be spread over the place; for the brine which runs from the melting of the salts is less stimulant than the salts themselves. We must also pour in much of the oil, that by its soothing properties it may obtund the pain occasioned by the acrimony of the other. On the second day it will be a very <pb n="415"/> good rule to apply the cupping-instrument again, so as that a thin sanies may be abstracted from the wounds. This, indeed, is much more effectual than the previous cupping, and much less calculated to impair the strength; for it is not blood, the nutriment of the body, but sanies that runs off. This then you are to do after having made a previous estimate of the strength. On the third day we are to apply cerate with the ointments of privet and of rue. But if the sputa still require purging, we are to melt into the cerates some resin, or mix some native sulphur therewith, and again the part is to have a fomentation. With regard to the form of the cupping-instrument, it should either be an earthen vessel, light, and adapted to the side, and capacious; or, of bronze, flat at the lips, so as to comprehend the parts affected with pain; and we are to place below it much fire along with oil, so that it may keep alive for a considerable time. But we must not apply the lips close to the skin, but allow access to the air, so that the heat may not be extinguished. And we must allow it to burn a long while, for the heat within it, indeed, is a very good fomentation, and a good provocative of perspirations.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And we must not overlook purging downwards, in men injecting oil of rue into the gut, and, in women, also into the womb. And let something be constantly drunk and swallowed; for this purpose, honeyed-water, with rue and juice of ptisan, if there is a constant cough, as being a medicine in the food. But if it is not the season of administering food, let it be one of the compound preparations, such as butter boiled with honey to a proper consistence. Of this, round balls the size of a bean are to be given to hold under the tongue, moving them about hither and thither, so that they may not be swallowed entire, but melted there. The medicine also from poppies with honey and melilot is agreeable, being possessed of soothing and hypnotic properties. This is to be given before the administration of food, after it, and after sleep. To the patient when fasting, the following medicinal substances are <pb n="416"/> to be given: of nettle, of linseed, of starch, and of pine fruit in powder, of each, a cupful (<emph rend="italic">cyathus</emph>), and of bitter almonds twenty-five in number, and as many seeds of pepper. These things being toasted and triturated with honey, are to be mixed up into a linctus; of these the dose is one spoonful (<emph rend="italic">cochleare</emph>). But if he expectorate thin and unconcocted matters, two drams of myrrh, one of saffron, and fifteen grains of pepper to be mixed with one pound of honey. This medicine should be given also before the administration of food to the amount of half a spoonful. It is good also in chronic cases, when oxymel likewise is to be given if the dyspnœa be urgent.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Such physicians as have given cold water to pleuritics, I cannot comprehend upon what principle they did so, nor can I approve the practice from experience; for if certain patients have escaped the danger from having taken cold water, these would appear to me not to have been pleuritic cases at all. But by the older physicians, a sort of congestion was called pleuritis, being a secretion of bile with pain of the side, attended with either slight fever or no fever at all. This affection, indeed, got the name of pleurisy, but it is not so in reality. But sometimes a spirit (or <emph rend="italic">wind, pneuma</emph>) collecting in the side, creates thirst and a bad sort of pain, and gentle heat; and this ignorant persons have called pleurisy. In them, then, cold water might prove a remedy through the good luck of the person using it; for the thirst may have been extinguished, and the bile and wind expelled downwards, while the pain and heat have been dissipated. But in inflammation of the side and swelling of the <emph rend="italic">succingeus</emph>, not only cold water but also cold respiration is bad.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If, then, owing to the treatment formerly described persons affected with pleurisy survive the attack, but have still a short cough, and now and then are seized with heat, we must hasten to dissipate these symptoms; for the residue of the disease either produces a relapse, or it is converted into a suppuration.</p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">INFLAMMATION and swelling of the lungs, and along with them a sense of suffocation, which does not long endure, constitute a very acute and fatal ailment. The remedies opposed to it, therefore, ought to be of equal power and speedily applied. We are to open instantly the veins at the elbow, and both together, on the right and on the left side, rather than abstract blood from one larger orifice, so that revulsion of the humours may take place from either side of the lungs: but we must not carry it to the extent of <emph rend="italic">deliquium animi</emph> for the <emph rend="italic">deliquium</emph> cooperates with the suffocation. But when even a small respite has been obtained, we must suppress the flow and abstraet more afterwards; for, if the exciting causes be from blood, the venesection carries them away; and if phlegm, or froth, or any other of the humours be the agent, the evacuations of the <pb n="420"/> veins widen the compass of the lungs for the passage of the breath.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">We must expel the fluids and flatus downwards, by anointing the anus after the venesection with natron, honey, rue, and the liquid resin from turpentine. Instead of the venesection,—provided there be a greater impediment,—we must give a clyster of acrid juice, namely, of salts, in addition to the natron, and turpentine resin with the honey; and rue boiled in the oil, and hyssop boiled in the water; and the fleshy parts of the wild cucumber, boiled with water, are very excellent.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Dry-cupping applied to the back, the shoulder, and the hypochondria, is altogether beneficial. And if the chest be fleshy, so that the cupping-instrument may not by its pressure bruise the skin about the bones, it is to be also applied there; for if the humours be attracted from all parts of the body, and the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) be determined outwardly, in those cases in which the lungs are, as it were, choked, there will be respite from the mischief; for peripneumonia is to be attacked in every possible way.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But, likewise, neither are we to neglect any of the medicines which prove useful when swallowed by the mouth, for the lungs attract fluids whether they be in health or diseased. We must, therefore, give such medicines as attenuate the fluids so as to promote their perspiration, and such as will lubricate and render them adapted for expectoration. For speedy relief, then, natron is to be drunk with the decoction of hyssop, or brine with vinegar and honey; or mustard moistened with honeyed-water; and we may confidently sprinkle on each some of the root of iris and pepper. But also these things, having been sifted, are to be given in a powder along with honey. But if the patients get no sleep during the day, and remain sleepless also during all the night, it is to be feared lest they become delirious, and there will be <pb n="421"/> need of various soporific medicines unless the disease give way, so that the seasonable administration of these medicines may lull the suffering, for these things are usually soporific. But if you give a medicine at the acme of the suffocation, or when death is at hand, you may be blamed for the patient’s death by the vulgar.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The food also must be suitable, acrid, light, solvent of thick matters, detergent: of pot-herbs, the leek, or the cress, or the nettle, or the cabbage boiled in vinegar; of austere things (<emph rend="italic">frumentacea?</emph>) the juice of ptisan, taking also of marjoram, or of hyssop, and of pepper, and more natron instead of the salts. Also spelt in grains well boiled with honeyed-water: in the course of the boiling, they should all be deprived of their flatulence, for flatulent things are hurtful to persons in peripneumonia. If they are free from fever, wine is to be given for drink, but not such as is possessed of much astringency, for astringency condenses bodies; but in these the parts are rather to be relaxed. We must also promote the expulsion of the sputa. On the whole the drink should be scanty, for drenching is prejudicial to the lungs, because the lungs attract from the stomach and belly.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Let the chest be covered up in wool, with oil, natron, and salts. The best ointment is that prepared of the lemnestis, and dried mustard with liquid cerate; and, on the whole, we are to determine outwardly the fluids, the heat, and the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>). And smelling to acrid things is beneficial, also anointings, and ligatures of the extremities. When these things are done, if the disease do not yield, the patient is in a hopeless condition.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">ALL the forms of the bringing up of blood are of an unmild character, not only as to mode, whether the flow proceed from rupture, erosion, or even rarefaction; and whether it come from the chest, the lungs, the stomach, or the liver, which are the most dangerous cases; but also from the head, although it occasions less mischief. For the flow is of blood; and blood is the food of all parts, the heat of all parts, and the colour of all parts. It is dreadful to see it flowing from the mouth in any way; but bad indeed if it proceed from an important viscus, and still worse if it proceed from rupture and erosion.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">It is necessary, therefore, that the physician should make the more haste in bringing assistance to this affection; and, in the first place, the patient must get coldish air to breathe, a chamber on the ground, and a couch firmly fixed, so that he may not be shaken (for all shaking is stimulant); the bed should be solid, not very yielding, nor deep, nor heated; his position erect; rest from speaking and hearing; tranquillity of mind, cheerfulness, since depression of spirits especially accompanies these cases; for who is there that does not dread death when vomiting blood?</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">If, therefore, the patient be full of blood, and have large veins, in every form of rejection we must open a vein; whether it proceed from rupture, or erosion, venesection is very suitable; and even, if from rarefaction, there is danger, lest the fulness of blood burst forth.<note resp="editor" place="inline">It is to be understood that by <emph rend="italic">rarefaction</emph> our author means exhalation; that is to say, increased action of the exhalants.</note> And we are to open the hollow vein at the elbow (for the blood flows readily from it, and it is easily opened, and the orifice can be safely kept open <pb n="423"/> for several days). In a word, then, in all the diseases of all the vital organs, this is the outlet of the blood. For the one higher up and this are both branches of the humeral, so that the one above can have no more remedial power than the mesal. They are ignorant of these divisions who have connected the upper vein with the stomach and liver. But if the flow proceed from the spleen, they direct us to open the vein of the left hand, which runs between the little finger and the one next the middle; for certain physicians held it to terminate in the spleen; but it is a branch of the vein below those at the elbow. Why, then, should we rather open the vein at the fingers than the one at the elbow? for there it is larger, and the blood flows readily from it. Altogether, then, we are to stop before coming to <emph rend="italic">deliquium animi.</emph> Yet neither, also, is much blood to be abstracted; for the hemorrhage itself is calculated to enfeeble the patient; but, after abstracting a small quantity, repeat the bleeding the same day, the next, and the day following. But if the patient be thin, and scantily supplied with blood, we must not open a vein. So much respecting the abstraction of blood.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">We are also to assist by means of ligatures to the extremities. Above the feet to the ankles and knees, and above the hands to the wrists and arms, a broad band is to be used, so that the constriction may be strong, and yet not produce pain. To the regions, also, from which the blood flows, we are to apply unwashed wool from the sheep; but moisten it with a liquid, such as austere wine, and the oils of roses and of myrtles. But if the hemorrhage be of an urgent nature, instead of the wool we are to use sponges, and vinegar instead of the wine, and let the part be anointed with myrtle oil; and we are to dust upon the sponges some of the dry inspissated juices, such as that of acacia, or of hypocistis, or else of aloes. The juice of the unripe grape, dissolved in vinegar, is also a very excellent thing. But if the liquid application be troublesome or <pb n="424"/> disagreeable, we are to use plasters; for these stretch the skin around, and press it, as it were, with the hand, and they are possessed of very strong powers as astringents and desiccants. In addition to these, there are very many others of tried efficacy; but the best are those which contain vinegar, and the expressed juice of ivy leaves, and asphaltos, and verdigris, alum, frankincense, myrrh, calcined copper, the squama æris, and such of the plasters as resemble these; or unscoured wool, or sponges damped in a small quantity of vinegar. But if the patients cannot bear the distension of the plasters, we are to make these things into an epitheme: fat dates, damped in dark austere wine, are pounded into a cake; then we are to sprinkle on it acacia in a soft state, and the rinds of pomegranate; these things having been all rubbed upon a rag, are applied to the chest. Barley-meal, moistened in wine or vinegar, or the fine flour of the dried lentil, sifted in a sieve, and made up with cerate or rose ointment, is to be applied; we are also to mix some of the root of the comfrey sifted. Another: Boil the roots of the wild prunes in vinegar, and having pounded into a cake, mix a little of sumach, and of gum, and of myrtle. These are to be mixed with one another differently, according as the strength of the medicines, mildness, or smell thereof is wanted. For we must also gratify the sick. These are the external remedies.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But a more important part of the treatment lies in things drunk and swallowed, since these remedies come nearest the injured parts. Of these there are three distinct kinds: either they are calculated by the contraction or compression of the vessels to bind the passages of the flux; or to incrassate and coagulate the fluid, so that it may not flow, even if the passages were in a state to convey it; or to dry up the outlets, by retaining the blood in its pristine state, so that the parts may not thus remain emptied by the flux, but may regurgitate where the effusion is. For rarefaction of the veins, astringency <pb n="425"/> is sufficient, for it runs through the pores like a fluid when poured into a water-cask newly wetted. And also in the division of vessels stypticity is the remedy, by producing contraction of the lips; but for this purpose we must use the greater and more powerful medicines. But if the form of hemorrhage be that from erosion, and if the lips of the ulcer do not coalesce by the action of the astringents, but the wound gapes, and cannot be brought together by compression, we must produce congelation of the blood, and also of the heat; for the flow is stopped by the immobility and coagulation of these. To the rare parts, then, oxycrate is sufficient for producing astriction; for the fluid is not pure blood, but the sanies thereof from small orifices; and even of this medicine, there is no necessity of much being given, or frequently; and in certain cases, the external treatment is sufficient. So, likewise, the decoction of dates and of edible carobs, when drunk, has by itself proved sufficient. Let the vinegar be from wines of an astringent nature, and if not by pharmaceutical preparation, at all events let it be such as by time has become acrid and astringent. But in dilatations of the wounds, in addition to the oxycrate, let there be given the simple medicines at first, such as the juice of plantain, of knot-grass, or of endive; of each an equal part with the oxycrate. But if the flow increase, sprinkle on it one dram of the dried hypocistis, or of acacia, on three cupfuls of the oxycrate. The juice, also, of the wild grape is very excellent. But if the ailment prevail over this, sprinkle on it triturated gall, and the dried root of the bramble, and the sea stone, the coral, triturated and dried. But the root of rhubarb is more powerful than these to cool, to dry, to astringe; in short, for every purpose. But it is used with the oxycrate alone; or, if more powerful things are required, as a remedy. To the juices of endive with plantain we add some of the root, namely, three oboli of it to three or four cyathi of the fluid. But in crosions, we must produce astringency <pb n="426"/> even in it, so as to induce coagulation of the blood that flows, and also for the sake of the containing vessels, so that the veins which have sustained a large wound may shut their mouths. But the medicines which are drunk should be strong, and capable of inducing coagulation. Wherefore, give the juice of coriander with vinegar, and the rennet of a hare, or of a hind, or of a kid, but not in great quantity (for certain of these have proved fatal in a large dose); but of the juice of the coriander give not less than half a cyathus to three of the oxycrate, and of the rennet three oboli, or at most four. For such modes of the flow, the Samian earth is very excellent, and the very white Aster, and the Eretrian, and the Sinopic, and the Lemnian seal: of these, at least, one dram weight, and at most three, with some of the decoctions, as of dates, or of edible carobs, or of the roots of brambles. But if there be roughness of the windpipe, and cough along with it, we must sprinkle these things on Cretic rob. Starch, dissolved in these, is a most excellent thing for lubricating the windpipe; for along with its power of lubricating, it also possesses that of agglutinating. If, therefore, the flow of blood be not urgent, it must be given once a day, before the administration of food; but if it be urgent, also a second and third time in the evening. And from the medicines are to be made draughts of the dried substances with honey, boiled to the proper consistence; galls pulverised: and a very good thing is sumach for the condiments, also grape-stones, and the fruit of the sharp dock, either each by itself, or all together. These things, moreover, are good to be kept below the tongue during the whole time of melting; but likewise common gum with the plant, (?) and the gum tragacanth. The compound medicines of tried efficacy are infinite; and various are the usages of trochisks—of that from Egyptian thorn, of another from amber, and another named from saffron, of which the composition has been described separately. </p>

<p rend="align(indent)">In the absence of fevers, everything is to be attempted in regard to medicines, giving them copiously and frequently. But if fever come on—and most frequently fever takes place, along with inflammations of the wounds—we must not stop the flow suddenly, nor give medicines during the paroxysms, for many die sooner of the fevers than of the flow of blood.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The articles of food are various in kind like the medicines, but also <q rend="double">the medicines are in the food;</q> for neither would it be easy to find all the good properties of food in any one article, nor even if a solitary thing were sufficient for the cure, should one only be used, as one would thus readily produce satiety; but we must grant variety if the disease should prove prolonged. Let the food, then, be astringent and refrigerant in properties, as also to the touch, for heat encourages bleeding. Washed alica; rice added to oxycrate; but if the vinegar excite coughing, the decoction of dates; baked bread which has been dried and pounded down to meal, and sifted. Of all these things a draught is to be made with oil; savory seasoned with salts, and sumach to be sprinkled upon it. And if you wish to gratify the patient’s palate, let coriander be added, for this purpose, whenever it is agreeable, or any of the diuretic and diffusible seeds. Lentil, then, with the juice of plantain, if the hemorrhage be urgent, but if not, we should spare the juice, for neither is it of easy digestion, nor pleasant to the taste; for in these cases we must not give indigestible things. But if you apprehend death from the hemorrhage, you must also give what is unpalatable and indigestible; nay, let even harsh things be given if they will preserve life; wherefore, let galls, dried and pulverised, be sprinkled when dry, and cold lentil: eggs thick from boiling, with the seeds of pomegranate or galls, for the food necessarily consists in the medicines. The drink altogether should be scanty, since liquids are incompatible with a dry diet. These are the proper things, provided you wish to astringe and cool. But if <pb n="428"/> you wish also to thicken the blood and spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), milk along with starch and granulated spelt (<emph rend="italic">chondrus</emph>), the milk being sometimes given with the starch, and sometimes with the <emph rend="italic">chondrus</emph>; they should be boiled to such a consistence as that the draught may not be liquid. But if you wish to incrassate and astringe still more, let the <emph rend="italic">chondrus</emph> be boiled with dates, and for the sake of giving consistence, let there be starch and milk; and the Tuscan <emph rend="italic">far</emph> is a very excellent thing, being thick, viscid, and glutinous when given along with the milk; the rennet of the kid is to be added to the liquid decoctions for the sake of coagulation, so that with the milk, it attains the consistency of new cheese: still thicker than these is millet boiled with milk like the <emph rend="italic">far</emph>, having gall and pomegranate rind sprinkled on it as a powder. But we must look to the proportions of the desiccants and incrassants, for all these things provoke coughing, and in certain cases, from excess of desiccant powers, they have burst the veins. But if things turn out well, and the blood is stopped, we must gradually change to the opposite plan of treatment, <q rend="double">and nothing in excess,</q> for these cases are apt to relapse, and are of a bad character. We must also strive to put flesh and fat on the patient by means of gestation, gentle frictions, exercise on foot, recreation, varied and suitable food.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">These are the means to be used if, after the flow of blood, the wound adhere and the part heal properly. But if the ulcer remain and become purulent, another plan of treatment is needed, for a discharge of different matters succeeds. This, however, will be treated of among the chronic diseases.</p> </div>

	<p rend="align(indent)">IN Syncope, it is necessary that the physician should exercise fore-knowledge; for, if you foresee its approach, and if things present co-operate strongly with you,<note resp="editor" place="inline">Allusion is here made to Hippocrates Aph. i. In the Aphorism it is <q rend="double">the attendants and externals</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς παρέοντας καὶ τὰ ἔχωθεν</foreign>), which our author condenses into <q rend="double">things present</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ παρέοντα</foreign>); and this is no doubt the reason why in this instance the neuter plural is construed with a verb plural. See the text.</note> you may avert it before its arrival. When it is come on, patients do not readily escape from it, for I have said that syncope is the dissolution of nature; and nature when dissolved cannot be restored. We must try to prevent it then, when still impending, or if not, at the commencement. We must form our prognosis from the circumstances stated by us among the acute diseases, where we have described the cause and also the symptoms. The fever Causus, then, is the commencement of the attack, and with Causus the worst of symptoms, dryness, insomnolency, heat of the viscera, as if from fire, but the external parts cold; the extremities, that is to say, the hands and feet, very cold; breathing slowly drawn; for the patients desiderate cold air, because they expire fire: pulse small, very dense, and trembling. Judging from these and the other things stated by me among the symptoms, you will immediately give assistance at the commencement.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Unless, then, when everything is against it, the habit, the age, the season, the timidity of the patient, we must open a vein, and even if many symptoms contra-indicate it, but an especial one require it, such as the tongue rough, dry, and black (for it is indicative of all the internal parts). And in <pb n="430"/> all cases we must form an estimate of the strength, whether or not it has failed owing to the pains of the disease and the regimen; for the loss of strength takes place, not only from deficiency, but also from smothering; and if the syncope arise from redundancy, and if inflammation of the hypochondria, or of the liver strongly indicate, there is no necessity for deferring the bleeding. We are to open the hollow vein at the elbow, and abstract the blood by a small orifice, that it may not have a marked effect on the strength; for sudden depletion tries the natural strength: and we must take away much less than if from any other cause; for in syncope, even a slight mistake readily sends a man to the regions below. We must, therefore, immediately give food for the restoration of the strength; for Nature delights in the removal of the old, and in the supply of new things.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the strength reject venesection, and inflammations be present, we must apply the cupping-instrument to the seat thereof a considerable time previous to the crisis of the disease; for the crisis takes place at the critical periods; since at the same periods Nature brings on a favourable crisis, and diseases prove fatal. And if the patient should come to such a state as to require wine, it is not very safe to take wine in inflammations; for, wine to persons labouring under inflammation is an increase of the pains, but to those free from inflammation it is an increase of the natural strength. A day or two before the cupping there is need of cataplasms, both in order to produce relaxation of the parts and to procure a flow of blood; and in certain cases, after the cupping, we are to apply a cataplasm on the next day. In this, too, let there be moderation; for there is the same danger from the abstraction of too much blood by cupping. Use clysters only for removing scybala which have long lodged in the bowels; but spare the strength.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Cold lotions to the head, such as have been directed by me <pb n="431"/> under Phrenitis, but somewhat more liberally. Pure air, rather cooler than otherwise, for respiration. The delight of the sight is to be studied as to plants, painting, waters, so that everything may be regarded with pleasure. The conversation of attendants cheerful; silence and cheerfulness on the part of the patient. Smells fragrant, not calculated to prove heavy to the senses in the head. And let the articles of food also possess a fragrant smell, such as flour moistened with water or vinegar; bread hot, and newly baked. The mouth not to be very often rinsed with wine, nor is it to be altogether rejected.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Drink to be given more frequently and more copiously than in other complaints. Food every day, light, digestible, mostly from grain, and that which is pleasant, even if somewhat less suitable. For, in these cases, rather than in any other, the palate is to be gratified, since not unusually the disease is generated in the stomach, so as to occasion resolution thereof. Abstinence or famine by no means; for the disease is sufficient to devour up all. But if the period be already come to a crisis, if there be a dew on the clavicle and forehead, the extremities cold; the pulse very small and very frequent, as if creeping, and feeble in tone, the patient must take a little food, and partake of wine effectually. The head, too, is to be strengthened by lotions, as also the bladder. These remedies have been described by me under Phrenitis. We are to give wine, not copiously nor to satiety, for certain patients by unseasonable repletion have died of anorexia, and inability to eat and drink; and to many patients having a good appetite, when the natural powers were dissolved, the abundant supply of food was of no avail; the food descending, indeed, into the stomach, but not ascending from the belly to recruit the strength. Let the food, therefore, be diversified, for the most part from grain, so as that it may be supped rather than masticated; or if solid, let it be made easy to <pb n="432"/> swallow. Eggs, not quite consistent nor roasted whole, but deprived of their solid portion; two or three pieces of bread soaked in wine, at first hot; but, after these, everything cold, unless there be latent inflammations. The wine is to be fragrant, and not very astringent; but by no means thick. Of the Greek wines, the Chian or Lesbian, and such other of the insular wines as are thin; of the Italian, the Surrentine, or Fundan, or Falernian, or Signine, unless it be very astringent; but of these we must reject such as are very old or very young. It is to be given at first hot, to the amount of not less than four cyathi, before the crisis, nor more than a hemina even if the patient be accustomed to drink. But after these things, having given food, if the symptoms of inflammation be past, we are again to give it cold as if for a remedy of the thirst; but this from necessity, and not by itself, but along with the food. We must also take care that the wine do not affect the brain; and after this, abstain. And if after an interval, he wish to sleep, quiet is to be enforced. But if much sweat flow, the pulse come to a stop, the voice become sharp, and the breast lose its heat, we are to give as much wine as the patient can drink. For those who are cold, wine is the only hope of life. Wine, therefore, if the patient be accustomed to it, is sometimes to be taken in drink, and sometimes food is to be eaten with the wine, after an interval, as a respite from the fatigue induced by the disease and the food, for when the strength is small, they are much fatigued, even by the act of taking food. Wherefore the patient must be stout-hearted and courageous, and the physician must encourage him with words to be of good cheer, and assist with diversified food and drink.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The other treatment is also to be applied energetically for restraining the sweats, and for resuscitating the spark of life. Let, therefore, an epitheme be applied to the chest on the left mamma,—dates triturated in wine along with aloes and <pb n="433"/> mastich,—and let these things be mixed up with a cerate composed of nard.<note resp="editor" place="inline">No doubt the Indian nard, namely, <emph rend="italic">Patrinia Jatamansi</emph>, Don.</note> And if this become disagreeable, we may apply another epitheme, made by taking the seed, and whatever is hard out of the apples, and having bruised them down, mix up with some fragrant meal; then we are to mix together some of the hair of wormwood, and of myrtle, and of acacia, and of the manna of frankincense, all sifted; which being all rubbed up together, are to be added to the cerate of wild vine. But if the sweat be not thereby restrained, the juice of the wild grape is to be added to the mixture, and acacia, and gum, and the edible part of sumach, and alum, and dates, and the scented juice of roses. All these things along with nard and oil of wild vine are to be applied to the chest; for this at the same time cools and is astringent. Let him lie in cool air, and in a house having a northern exposure; and if the cool breeze of Boreas breathe upon him, <q rend="double">it will refresh his soul sadly gasping for breath.</q> The prospect should be to-wards meadows, fountains, and babbling streams, for the sweet exhalations from them, and the delightful view, warm the soul and refresh nature. And, moreover, it is also an incentive to eat and to drink. But if from want one is not fortunate enough to possess these things, we must make an imitation of the cool breeze, by fanning with the branches of fragrant boughs, and, if the season of spring, by strewing the ground with such leaves and flowers as are at hand. The coverlet should be light and old, so as to admit the air, and permit the exhalation of the heat of the chest; the best kind is an old linen sheet. We are to sprinkle the neck, the region of the clavicle and chest with flour, so that it may nourish by its fragrance, and restrain by its dryness; and the spongy parts of the body are to be dusted with meal, but the face with the Samian earth, which is to be passed through a sieve; and <pb n="434"/> having been bound into a spongy cloth, it is to be dusted on the part, so that the finer particles may pass through the pores to the forehead and cheeks. And slaked lime and roasted gypsum, sifted in a small sieve, are to be applied to the moist parts. A sponge out of cold water applied to the face has sometimes stopped the sweats, by occasioning congelation of the running fluids, and by condensation of the pores. The anus is to be anointed, so that the flatus arising from the cold and food may be discharged. And we are to recall the heat of the extremities by gleucinum,<note resp="editor" place="inline">A fragrant oil prepared from must. See Paulus Ægineta, t.iii. p. 596.</note> or Sicyonian oil, along with pepper, castor, natron, and cachry,<note resp="editor" place="inline">The fruit of the <emph rend="italic">Cachrys libanotis, L.</emph> See Dioscorides, iii. 79.</note> melting into them a little wax, so that the liniment may stick. And we are to resuscitate the heat by means of the ointment of lemnestis, and of euphorbium, and of the fruit of the bay. The small red onions raw, along with pepper, and the powdered lees of vinegar, make an excellent cataplasm to the feet; but it is to be constantly raised from the place every hour, for there is danger of ulceration and blisters. From these things there is hope that the patient may thus escape.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And if the physician should do everything properly, and if everything turn out well, along with the syncope the inflammations that supervene are resolved; and sweat, indeed, is nowhere, but a restoration of the heat everywhere, even at the extremities of the feet and the nose; but the face is of a good colour; pulse enlarged in magnitude, not tremulous, strong; voice the same as customary, loud, and in every respect lively. Lassitude not out of place, but the patient is also seen sleeping: and, if sleep seize him, he digests his food, recovers his senses, and sprouts out into a new nature; and if roused from sleep, the breathing is free, he is light <pb n="435"/> and vigorous; and here calls to his memory the circumstances of the disease like a dream.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But in other cases obscure fevers are left behind, and sometimes slight inflammations, and a dry tongue: they are parched, have rigors, are enfeebled, and relaxed, in which cases there is a conversion to marasmus; when we must not waste time with rest and a slender diet, but have recourse to motions, by gestation, and to friction and baths, so that the embers of life may be roused and mended. We are to give milk, especially that of a woman who has just borne a child, and that a male child; for such persons require nursing like new-born children. Or if it cannot be obtained, we must give the milk of an ass which has had a foal not long before, for such milk is particularly thin;<note resp="editor" place="inline">The author appears to refer to the common way of trying the specific gravity of milk, by pouring a small quantity on the nail. See Paulus Ægineta, i. 3, Syd. Soc. Ed.</note> and by these means the patient is to be brought back to convalescence and his accustomed habits.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">IN Cholera, the suppression of the discharges is a bad thing, for they are undigested matters. We must, therefore, readily permit them to go on, if spontaneous, or if not, promote them by giving some tepid water to swallow, frequently indeed, but in small quantity, so that there may be no spasmodic retchings excited in the stomach. But if there also be tormina and coldness of the feet, we are to rub the abdomen with hot oil, boiled with rue and cumin, to dispel the flatulence; and we are to apply wool. And, having anointed the feet, they are to <pb n="436"/> be gently rubbed, stroking them rather than pinching them. And these things are to be done up to the knees for the restoration of the heat; and the same is to be practised until the fæces pass downwards, and the bilious matters ascend upwards.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if all the remains of the food have been discharged downwards, and if bile be evacuated, and if there still be bilious vomiting, retchings, and nausea, uneasiness and loss of strength, we must give two or three cupfuls (<emph rend="italic">cyathi</emph>) of cold water, as an astringent of the belly, to stop the reflux, and in order to cool the burning stomach; and this is to be repeatedly done when what even has been drunk is vomited. The cold water, indeed, readily gets warm in the stomach, and then the stomach rejects it, annoyed as it is both by hot and cold: but it constantly desiderates cold drink.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But, if the pulse also fall to a low state, and become exceedingly rapid and hurried, if there be sweat about the forehead and region of the clavicles, if it run in large drops from all parts of the body, and the discharge from the bowels is not restrained, and the stomach still vomits, with retchings and deliquium animi, we must add to the cold water a small quantity of wine, which is fragrant and astringent, that it may refresh the senses by its <emph rend="italic">bouquet</emph>, contribute to the strength of the stomach by its spirit, and to the restoration of the body by its nutritious powers. For wine is swiftly distributed upwards over the system, so as to restrain the reflux; and is subtil, so that when poured into the frame it strengthens the habit, and it is strong so as to restrain the dissolving powers. We are also to sprinkle on the body some fresh and fragrant meal. But if the bad symptoms become urgent, with sweating, and strainings, not only of the stomach, but also of the nerves, and if there be hiccups; and if the feet are contracted, if there be copious discharges from the bowels, and if the patient become dark-eoloured, and the pulse is <pb n="437"/> coming to a stop, we must try to anticipate this condition beforehand; but if it be come on, we must give much cold water and wine, not indeed wine slightly diluted, for fear of intoxication, and of hurting the nerves, and along with food, namely, pieces of bread soaked in it. We are likewise to give of other kinds of food, such as have been described by me under syncope, autumnal fruit of an astringent nature, services, medlars, quinces, or the grape.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if everything be vomited, and the stomach can contain nothing, we must return again to hot drink and food, for in certain cases the change stops the complaint; the hot things, moreover, must be intensely so. But if none of these things avail, we are to apply the cupping-instrument between the shoulder-blades, and turn it below the umbilicus; but we are to shift the cupping-instrument constantly, for it is painful when it remains on a place, and exposes to the risk of blistering. The motion of gestation is beneficial by its ventilation, so as to recreate the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), stay the food in the bowels, and make the patient’s respiration and pulse natural.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if these symptoms increase, we must apply epithemes over the stomach and chest; and these are to be similar to those for syncope—dates soaked in wine, acacia, hypocistis, mixed up with rose cerate, and spread upon a linen cloth, are to be applied over the stomach; and to the chest we are to apply mastich, aloe, the pulverised hair of wormwood, with the cerate of nard, or of wild vine, as a cataplasm to the whole chest; but if the feet and muscles be spasmodically distended, rub into them Sicyonian oil, that of must, or old oil with a little wax; and also add in powder some castor. And if the feet also be cold, we are to rub them with the ointment containing lemnestis and euphorbium, wrap them in wool, and rectify by rubbing with the hands. The spine also, the tendons, and muscles of the jaws are to be anointed with the same.</p> <pb n="438"/> 

<p rend="align(indent)">If, therefore, by these means the sweat and discharges from the bowels are stopped, and the stomach receives the food without vomiting it again, the pulse becomes large and strong, and the straining ceases; if the heat prevails everywhere, and reaches the extremities, and sleep concocts all matters, on the second or third day the patient is to be bathed, and remitted to his usual course of living. But if he vomit up everything, if the sweat flow incessant, if the patient become cold and livid, if his pulse be almost stopped and his strength exhausted, it will be well in these circumstances to try to make one’s escape with credit.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="5"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER V. CURE OF ILEUS.</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)">IN Ileus it is pain that kills, along with inflammation of the bowels, or straining and swelling. A most acute and most disgusting form of death! For others, when in a hopeless state of illness, fear nothing except their impending death; but those in ileus, from excess of pain earnestly desire death. The physician, therefore, must neither be inferior to the affection, nor more dilatory; but, if he find inflammation to be the cause, open a vein at the elbow by a large orifice, so that blood, which is the pabulum of the inflammation, may flow copiously; and it may be carried the length of deliquium animi, for this is either the commencement of an escape from pain, or of a torpor ending in insensibility. For in ileus a breathing-time for a short space, even from loss of sensibility, will prove an interval from pain; since, also, to persons enduring these pains, to die is happiness, but to impart it is not permitted to the respectable physician; but at times it is permitted, when <pb n="439"/> he foresees that present symptoms cannot be escaped from, to lull the patient asleep with narcotics and anæsthetics.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the ileus arise without inflammation, from corruption of the food or intense cold, we are to abstain from bleeding, but at the same time to do all the other things, and procure vomiting frequently by water, and drinking plenty of oil; then, again, we are to procure vomiting, and produce the expulsion of the flatus downwards, by stimulant medicines. Such a stimulant is the juice of sow-bread, and natron, or salts. Cumin and rue are carminatives. Wherefore we must rub in together all these things with turpentine resin, and foment with sponges; or we must inject with these things and oil, honey, hyssop, and the decoction of the fleshy parts of the wild cucumber. And if feculent matter be evacuated, we are again to inject hot oil with rue; for, if this remain inwardly, it proves a grateful fomentation to the bowels: and apply to the suffering parts lotions composed of oil which has been strongly boiled with rue and dill. And the fomentation is also to be applied, either by means of earthen or brazen vessels, or with millet and roasted salts. In addition to the ordinary cataplasms, one may be made of the flour of darnel and cumin, and the hair of hyssop and of marjoram. Cupping, without the abstraction of blood, indeed, but frequently applied, sometimes to one place, and sometimes to another—to the epigastric region, and to the loins as far as the groins, and behind to the ischiatic region as far as the kidneys and spine; for it is expedient to produce revulsion of the pain by all means. They should also get whetters (<emph rend="italic">propomata</emph><note resp="editor" place="inline">See Bekker’s Charicles, p. 248; and Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 546.</note>) of the decoction of cumin, or of rue, and of sison;<note resp="editor" place="inline">The <emph rend="italic">Sison amomum</emph>, Stone parsley, or German amomum. See Dioscorid. M. M. iii. 57; Galen. de Simpl.vii.; and Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 339.</note> or along with these some of the anodyne medicines. Of these there are very <pb n="440"/> many of tried efficacy. The medicine from vipers is also a good one, when drunk to a larger amount than usual. But if neither the pain remit, nor the flatulence nor fæces pass, we must necessarily give of the purgative hiera; for either the medicine is rejected with phlegm and bile, or it passes downwards, bringing off flatus, scybala, phlegm, and bile, which occasion the intensity of the evil. Laxative food: soups of hens, of shell-fish; the juice of ptisan boiled with much oil poured in at first before the boiling; boil along with it cumin, natron, leek with its hair. Or the cure is to be made with some laxative soup: snails much boiled, and their gravy, or that of limpet. Water is to be taken for drink, if there be fever, boiled with asarabacca, or nard, or cachry. For these things dispel flatus, are diuretic, and promote free breathing. But if he be free from pain, wine also is beneficial for the heat of the intestines, and for the restoration of the strength; and likewise the decoction of fennel-root, in a draught, and maiden-hair and cinnamon.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But if the inflammation turn to an abscess, it is better to contribute thereto by using the medicine for abscesses. These have been described under chronic diseases, where the treatment of cholics is described.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">THE formation of the blood is in the liver, and hence the distribution of it over the whole system. And the entire liver is, as it were, a concretion of blood. Wherefore the inflammations there are most acute; for nutrition is seated in this <pb n="441"/> place. If, therefore, inflammation form anywhere else, it is not remarkably acute; for it is an influx of blood that is inflamed; but in the liver there is no necessity for its coming from another quarter. For if any obstruction shut the outlets, the liver becomes inflamed by being deprived of its efflux, since the entrance of the food to the liver still continues patent; for there is no other passage of the food but this from the stomach and intestines to the whole body.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">It is necessary, therefore, to make a copious evacuation, by opening the veins at the elbow, and taking away blood frequently, but not in large quantity at a time. Total abstinence from food at first, but restricted diet afterwards, so that the liver may be devoid of its customary ingesta. It is necessary, also, by external applications to dispel the matters impacted in the liver. Lotions, therefore, with aloe or natron are proper, and unwashed wool is to be applied. There is need, then, of cooling means, because the liver is inflamed by the blood; for the blood is hot. The cataplasms, also, should be of such a nature, consisting of the meal of darnel, or of hedge-mustard, or of barley, or of linseed; and of liquid substances, such as acid wine, the juice of apples, of the tendrils of the vine, or of the leaves of the vine in season, or of the oil prepared with it. Fomentations are to be applied on sponges, of the decoction of the fruit of bays, of the lentisk, of penny-royal, and of iris.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">When you have soothed by these means, you must apply a cupping-instrument, unusually large, so as to comprehend the whole hypochondriac region, and make deeper incisions than usual, that you may attract much blood. And, in certain cases, leeches are better than scarifications; for the bite of the animal sinks deeper, and it makes larger holes, and hence the flow of blood from these animals is difficult to stop. And when the animals fall off quite full, we may apply the cupping-instrument, which then attracts the matters within. And <pb n="442"/> if there be sufficient evacuation, we are to apply styptics to the wounds; but these not of a stimulant nature, such as spiders’ webs, the manna of frankincense, and aloe, which are to be sprinkled in powder on the part; or bread boiled with rue or melilot, and the roots of marsh-mallow; but on the third day a cerate, made with nut-ben, or the hairy leaves of wormwood and iris. The malagmata should be such as are calculated to attenuate, rarify, or prove diuretic. Of these the best is that <q rend="double">from seeds</q> (<emph rend="italic">diaspermatôn</emph>) well known to all physicians from experience. That also is a good one of which marjoram and melilot are ingredients.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">The food should be light, digestible, possessed of diuretic qualities, and which will quickly pass through the bowels; such as granulated seeds of spelt (<emph rend="italic">alica</emph><note resp="editor" place="inline">See, in particular, Dr. Daremberg’s elaborate dissertation on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χόνδρος</foreign>, ap. Oribasium, t.i. p. 559.</note>) with honeyed-water, and a draught of these articles with salts and dill. The juice of ptisan, also, is detergent; and if you will add some of the seeds of carrot, you will make it more diuretic: for it evacuates by the passages which lead from the liver to the kidneys; and this is the most suitable outlet for matters passing out from the liver, owing to the wideness of the vessels and the straightness of the passage. We must also attract thither by cupping, applying the instrument to the region of the kidneys in the loins. To these parts, lotions are also to be applied, prepared with rue, the juncus, or calamus aromaticus. By these means, it is to be hoped that the patient may escape death.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But when it is turning to a suppuration, we must use the suppurative medicines which will be described by me under the head of colics. But if pus is formed, how the collection is to be opened, and how treated, will be explained by me in another place. The same observations apply to the spleen, in the event of an inflammation seizing this part also.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="7"> <pb n="443"/> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER VII. CURE OF THE ACUTE DISEASE OF THE DORSAL VEIN AND ARTERY.</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)">THE inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">vena cava</emph> and large artery, which extend along the spine, was called a species of Causus by those of former times. For in these cases the affections are similar: febrile heat acute and acrid, loathing of food, thirst, restlessness; a palpitating pulsation in the hypochondriac region and in the back, and the other symptoms described by me under this head. Moreover, the febrile heat tends to syncope, as in cases of causus. For, indeed, the liver is formed by the roots of the veins, and the heart is the original of the artery. You may suppose, then, that the upper portions of these viscera are subject to fatal ailments; for it is the heart which imparts heat to the artery, and the liver which conveys blood to the vein; and being both mighty parts, the inflammations, likewise, which spring from them are great.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Wherefore we are to open the veins at the elbow, and abstract a considerable amount of blood; not all at once, however, but at two or three times, and on a different day, so that the strength may recruit during the interval. Then we are to apply a cupping-instrument and cataplasms to the hypochondrium, where is the pulsation of the artery; and also between the scapulæ, for there, too, there are pulsations. We are to scarify unsparingly, and abstract much blood; for from this sort of evacuation the patients are not much prone to deliquium. The bowels, also, are apt to be unusually confined, and emollient clysters are to be used to lubricate them, but not on any account acrid ones; for they suffer an increase of fever from brine and the melting of the natron. The juice, therefore, of linseed and of fenugreek, and the decoction of the roots of <pb n="444"/> mallows, are sufficient to rouse and stimulate the bowels. The extremities, namely, the feet and hands, are to be warmed with gleucinum,<note resp="editor" place="inline">The ointment or oil from must. See Paulus Ægineta, t.iii. p.596.</note> or Sicyonian oil, or with the liniment from lemnestis; for these parts of them become very cold. And before the administration of food, we must give draughts to promote the urinary discharge, containing spignel, asarabacca, and wormwood, to which some natron in powder is to be added. But of all such medicines the strongest are cassia and cinnamon, provided one has plenty of it. In such cases, milk is both food and medicine; for they stand in need of refrigeration, a sort of fire being wrapped up within; and also of sweet food, and of that a copious supply in small bulk. Such virtues milk possesses as an article of food. Plenty of the milk of an ass which has just had a foal is to be given, and to two cupfuls of the milk one of water is to be added. That of the cow is also very good; and, thirdly, that of a goat. The articles of food should be of easy digestion; for the most part juices, such as that from the juice of the fennel; and let parsley seed be added to it, and honey. And the water which is drunk should contain these things.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But we must also promote sweats, and in every way make the perspiration moist and free. Lotions to the head, as in cases of causus. An epitheme to the chest and left mamma, such as in syncope. To lie in bed with the head elevated, so that everything may be alike as in causus. Gestation to a small extent, so as to provoke sweats; a bath, also, if he be burned up within. For these affections do not pass off by crises, even though they be forms of causus.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">INFLAMMATION in the kidneys is of an acute nature; for the veins passing from the liver to the kidneys are inflamed at the same time, and with these the liver; for these veins are not very long, but are very broad, so as to give the kidneys the appearance of being suspended near the liver. But suppression of urine takes place along with the inflammation, thereby contributing to the intensity of the inflammation; for the cavity of the kidneys is filled by the overflow of the urine which fails to escape. The same happens also with stones, provided one larger than the breadth of the ureters be formed in the kidneys: it then becomes seated there, and, not passing through, it occasions a stoppage of the urine. But we will treat of the formation of calculi among the chronic diseases; how they may either be prevented from forming, or how they may be broken when formed. With regard to heat and obstruction, such of these affections as prove quickly fatal will be described by me in this place.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Whether it be impaction of stones, or whether it be inflammation, we must open the vein at the elbow, unless a particular period of life prove an obstacle, and blood must be taken in a full stream and in large quantity. For not only are inflammations alleviated by evacuation, but also impacted stones are slackened by the evacuation of the vessels, and thus the stones escape during the passing of the urine. Then the parts are to be relaxed by bathing them with oil of must or of privet, and by fomentations and cataplasms. The herb southernwood, the schœnus, and calamus aromaticus, should form the ingredients of the cataplasms. Then we are to apply the cupping-instrument over the kidneys, in the loins, more <pb n="446"/> especially if the evacuation from this place has been of service. The bowels are to be softened by lubricating clysters, rather of a viscid than of an acrid nature, such as the juiees either of mallows or of fenugreek. Sometimes, also, diuretic medicines are to be given before food, such as are described respecting the liver, and also similar food of easy digestion: for in such cases indigestion is bad. Milk is a most excellent article, especially that of an ass; next, of a mare; even that of an ewe or a goat is useful, as being a kind of milk. If, then, they be free of fever, it is better also to prescribe the bath; but if not, they are to be placed in a sitz-bath formed of the decoction of herbs, filling the vessel up to their navel. But if it be turned to suppuration, what cataplasms and other medicines we are to use have formerly been laid down by us on many occasions.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">But, if the stone stick, we are to use the same fomentations and cataplasms, and try to break the stones with medicines taken in the form of drink. The simples are the herbs waterparsnip and <emph rend="italic">prionitis</emph>,<note resp="editor" place="inline">I am at a loss to decide what herb this was. It is not noticed either by Theophrastus or Dioscorides. Indeed, I am not aware that it occurs elsewhere, except in the work of Trallian, viii.4. Petit, I know not on what authority, suggests that it is the <emph rend="italic">asplenium ceterach.</emph> Liddel and Scott identify it with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέστρον</foreign>, but do not give their grounds for holding this opinion.</note> boiled with oil or edible vinegar, and the juice of it taken for drink: the compound ones are, that named from Vestinus, that from vipers and the reptile the skink, and such as from experience appear to be best. Gestation and succussion are calculated to promote the movement and protrusion of the calculi; for the passage of calculi into the bladder is very painful. But if the stones drop out, the patients become free from pain, which they have not been accustomed to be, not even in their dreams; and, as if escaped from inevitable evils, they feel relieved both in mind and in body.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">ACUTE affections, resembling those of the kidneys, form also in the bladder; namely, inflammations, ulcerations, calculi, and the obstructions from clots, and, along with these, suppression of urine and strangury. But in this part the pain is more acute, and death most speedy; for the bladder is a broad nerve, whereas the kidneys are like a concretion of blood, of the same species as the liver. But, moreover, the sufferings are most dreadful and most lamentable:</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">for there, by far,</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">On wretched men most cruel pains inflicts the god of war.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">We must, therefore, straightway make an incision in the flanks, and soothe the bladder by means of a fomentation of much oil, with rue and dill. But if grumous blood be the cause of the pains and stoppage of the urine, we are to give oxymel to drink, or a little quantity of lime with honeyedwater for the solution of the clots, and also such other things, both herbs and seeds, as promote the secretion of urine. But if there be danger from hemorrhage, it is to be stopped without delay, more than in the other cases; for the danger from it is not small. We must remedy it by the medicines which stop bleeding. In this case refrigeration of the bladder is beneficial; bathing with rose-oil and wine, and wrapping the parts in cloths made of unwashed wool.<note resp="editor" place="inline">This process is very circumstantially described by Oribasius under the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατείλησλς</foreign> Med. Coll.x.18. Dr. Daremberg translates it, <foreign xml:lang="fre">l’enroulement avec les bandes.</foreign></note> An epitheme may be formed with dates soaked in wine, with pomegranate or the juice of sumach. But if the patient is averse to the weight of <pb n="448"/> the epithemes and the great cooling, they must both be given up; for we must not cool greatly a part naturally thin and cold like the bladder. But we are to anoint the parts with oil of must, or acacia, or hypocistis with wine. But we must not use sponges, unless the hemorrhage be very urgent. The food should be farinaceous, of easy digestion, wholesome, diuretic, such as have been described by me under the head of the kidneys; milk, sweet wine, the Theræan and Scybelitic. Medicines should be drunk which are diuretic, fragrant, and diffusible, and other such things. A very excellent thing for the bladder is <emph rend="italic">cicadœ</emph>; roasted, in season, as an article of food; and out of season, when dried and triturated with water. Let also a little of the root of nard be boiled up with the <emph rend="italic">cicadœ.</emph> The same things may be used for preparing a bath to sit in for relaxation of the bladder.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But, if it be the impaction of calculi which stops the urine, we must push away the calculus and draw off the urine, with the instrument, the catheter, unless there be inflammations; for, in inflammations, neither do the passages well admit the instrument, and in addition they are hurt by the catheter. But if this treatment be inadmissible, and the patient is nearly killed with the sufferings, we must make an incision in the part under the <emph rend="italic">glans penis</emph>, and the neck of the bladder, in order to procure an outlet for the stone and the expulsion of the urine. And we must particularly endeavour to cure the part by bringing the wound to cicatrization. But if not, it is better that the patient should have a flux of urine for the remainder of his life, than that he should die most miserably of the pain.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">THE uterus in women has membranes extended on both sides at the flanks, and also is subject to the affections of an animal in smelling; for it follows after fragrant things as if for pleasure, and flees from fetid and disagreeable things as if for dislike. If, therefore, anything annoy it from above, it protrudes even beyond the genital organs. But if any of these things be applied to the os, it retreats backwards and upwards. Sometimes it will go to this side or to that,—to the spleen and liver, while the membranes yield to the distension and contraction like the sails of a ship.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">It suffers in this way also from inflammation; and it protrudes more than usual in this affection and in the swelling of its neck; for inflammation of the fundus inclines upwards; but if downwards to the feet, it protrudes externally, a troublesome, painful and unseemly complaint, rendering it difficult to walk, to lie on the side or on the back, unless the woman suffer from inflammation of the feet. But if it mount upwards, it very speedily suffocates the woman, and stops the respiration as if with a cord, before she feels pain, or can scream aloud, or can call upon the spectators, for in many cases the respiration is first stopped, and in others the speech. It is proper, then, in these cases, to call the physician quickly before the patient die. Should you fortunately arrive in time and ascertain that it is inflammation, you must open a vein, especially the one at the ankle, and pursue the other means which prove remedial in suffocation without inflammation: ligatures of the hands and feet so tight as to induce torpor; smelling to fetid substances—liquid pitch, hairs and wool burnt, the extinguished flame of a lamp, and castor, <pb n="450"/> since, in addition to its bad smell, it warms the congealed nerves. Old urine greatly rouses the sense of one in a death-like state, and drives the uterus downwards. Wherefore we must apply fragrant things on pessaries to the region of the uterus—any ointment of a mild nature, and not pungent to the touch, nard, or Ægyptian bacchar, or the medicine from the leaves of the malabathrum, the Indian tree,<note resp="editor" place="inline">A species of wild cinnamon or cassia-tree. See Edinburgh Greek Lexicon, Appendix, under the term.</note> or cinnamon pounded with any of the fragrant oils. These articles are to be rubbed into the female parts. And also an injection of these things is to be thrown into the uterus. The anus is to be rubbed with applications which dispel flatus; and injections of things not acrid, but softening, viscid, and lubricant, are to be given for the expulsion of the fæces solely, so that the region of the uterus may be emptied,—with the juice of marsh-mallow, or of fenugreek, but let melilot or marjoram be boiled along with the oil. But, if the uterus stands in need of support rather than evacuation, the abdomen is to be compressed by the hands of a strong woman, or of an expert man, binding it round also with a roller, when you have replaced the part, so that it may not ascend upwards again. Having produced sneezing, you must compress the nostrils; for by the sneezing and straining, in certain cases, the uterus has returned to its place. We are to blow into the nostrils also some of the root of soapwort,<note resp="editor" place="inline">The <emph rend="italic">Saponaria officinalis.</emph></note> or of pepper, or of castor. We are also to apply the instrument for dry-cupping to the thighs, loins, the ischiatic regions, and groins, in order to attract the uterus. And, moreover, we are to apply it to the spine, and between the scapulæ, in order to relieve the sense of suffocation. But if the feeling of suffocation be connected with inflammation, we may also scarify the vein leading along the pubes, and abstract plenty of blood. Friction of the <pb n="451"/> countenance, plucking of the hair, with bawling aloud, in order to arouse. Should the patient partially recover, she is to be seated in a decoction of aromatics, and fumigated from below with fragrant perfumes. Also before a meal, she is to drink of castor, and a little quantity of the hiera with the castor. And if relieved, she is to bathe, and at the proper season is to return to her accustomed habits; and we must look to the woman that her menstrual discharges flow freely.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">INFLAMMATION of the nerves in the genital organs occasions erection of the member with desire and pain <emph rend="italic">in re venerea:</emph> there arise spasmodic strainings which at no time abate, since the calamity is not soothed by the coition. They also become maddened in understanding, at first as regards shamelessness in the open performance of the act; for the inability to refrain renders them impudent; but afterwards . . . . . . . . when they have recovered, their understanding becomes quite settled.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">For all these causes, we must open the vein at the elbow, and also the one at the ankle, and abstract blood in large quantity and frequently, for now it is not unseasonable to induce deliquium animi, so as to bring on torpor of the understanding and remission of the inflammation, and also mitigation of the heat about the member; for it is much blood which strongly enkindles the heat and audacity; it is the pabulum of the inflammation, and the fuel of the disorder of the understanding, and of the confusion. The whole body is to be purged with the medicine, the hiera; for the patients not only require purging, but also a gentle medication, both <pb n="452"/> which objects are accomplished by the hiera. The genital organs, the loins, the perineum and the testicles, are to be wrapped in unwashed wool; but the wool must be moistened with rose-oil and wine, and the parts bathed, so much the more that no heating may be produced by the wool, but that the innate heat may be mitigated by the cooling powers of the fluids. Cataplasms of a like kind are to be applied; bread with the juice of plantain, strychnos,<note resp="editor" place="inline">Doubtful whether he means the <emph rend="italic">Solanum nigrum</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Physalis somnifera.</emph> See Paulus Ægineta, t. iii. p. 359.</note> endive, the leaves of the poppy, and the other narcotics and refrigerants. Also the genital organs, perineum, and ischiatic region, are to be rubbed with similar things, such as cicuta with water, or wine, or vinegar; mandragora, and acacia; and sponges are to be used instead of wool. In the interval we are to open the bowels with a decoction of mallows, oil, and honey. But everything acrid . . . . . . Cupping-instruments are to be fixed to the ischiatic region, or the abdomen; leeches also are very good for attracting blood from the inner parts, and to their bites a a cataplasm made of crumbs of bread with marsh-mallows. Then the patient is to have a sitz bath medicated with worm-wood, and the decoction of sage, and of flea-bane. But when the affection is protracted for a considerable time without any corresponding intermission, there is danger of a convulsion (for in this affection the patients are liable to convulsions), we must change the system of treatment to calefacients, there is need of oil of must or of Sicyonian oil instead of oil of roses, along with clean wool and warming cataplasms, for such treatment then soothes the inflammations of the nerves,—and we must also give castor with honeyed-water in a draught. Food containing little nourishment, in a cold state, in small quantity, and such as is farinaceous; mostly pot-herbs, the mallow, the blite, the lettuce, boiled gourd, boiled cucumber, <pb n="453"/> ripe pompion. Wine and fleshes to be used sparingly until convalescence have made considerable progress; for wine imparts warmth to the nerves, soothes the soul, recalls pleasure, engenders semen, and provokes to venery.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Thus far have I written respecting the cures of acute diseases. One must also be fertile in expedients, and not require to apply his mind entirely to the writings of others.
