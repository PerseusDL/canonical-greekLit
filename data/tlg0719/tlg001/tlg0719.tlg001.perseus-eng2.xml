<p rend="align(indent)"> * * * * sluggishness, vertigo, heaviness of the tendons, plethora and distension of the veins in the neck; and much nausea indeed after food, but also, not unfrequently, with abstinence, there is a faint nausea; and phlegm is often vomited; want of appetite and indigestion after little food: they have flatulence and meteorism in the hypochondria. These symptoms, indeed, are constant.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But, if it be near the accession of the paroxysm, there are before the sight circular flashes of purple or black colours, or of all mixed together, so as to exhibit the appearance of the rainbow expanded in the heavens; noises in the ears; a heavy smell; they are passionate, and unreasonably peevish. They fall down then, some from any such cause as lowness of spirits, but others from gazing intently on a running stream, a rolling <pb n="244"/>  wheel, or a turning top. But sometimes the smell of heavy odours, such as of the gagate stone (<emph rend="italic">jet</emph>), makes them fall down. In these cases, the ailment is fixed in the head, and from it the disorder springs; but, in others, it arises also from the nerves remote from the head, which sympathise with the primary organ. Wherefore the great fingers of the hands, and the great toes of the feet are contracted; pain, torpor, and trembling succeed, and a rush of them to the head takes place. If the mischief spread until it reach the head, a crash takes place, in these cases, as if from the stroke of a piece of wood, or of stone; and, when they rise up, they tell how they have been maliciously struck by some person. This deception occurs to those who are attacked with the ailment for the first time. But those to whom the affection has become habitual, whenever the disease recurs, and has already seized the finger, or is commencing in any part, having from experience a foreknowledge of what is about to happen, call, from among those who are present, upon their customary assistants, and entreat them to bind, pull aside, and stretch the affected members; and they themselves tear at their own members, as if pulling out the disease; and such assistance has sometimes put off the attack for a day. But, in many cases, there is the dread as of a wild beast rushing upon them, or the phantasy of a shadow; and thus they have fallen down.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In the attack, the person lies insensible; the hands are clasped together by the spasm; the legs not only plaited together, but also dashed about hither and thither by the tendons. The calamity bears a resemblance to slaughtered bulls; the neck bent, the head variously distorted, for sometimes it is arched, as it were, forwards, so that the chin rests upon the breast; and sometimes it is retracted to the back, as if forcibly drawn thither by the hair, when it rests on this shoulder or on that. They gape wide, the mouth is dry; the tongue protrudes, so as to incur the risk of a great wound, or <pb n="245"/>  of a piece of it being cut off, should the teeth come forcibly together with the spasm; the eyes rolled inwards, the eyelids for the most part are separated, and affected with palpitation; but should they wish to shut the lids they cannot bring them together, insomuch that the white of the eyes can be seen from below. The eyebrows sometimes relaxed towards the mesal space, as in those who are frowning, and sometimes retracted to the temples abnormally, so that the skin about the forehead is greatly stretched, and the wrinkles in the intersuperciliary space disappear: the cheeks are ruddy and quivering; the lips sometimes compressed together to a sharp point, and sometimes separated towards the sides, when they are stretched over the teeth, like as in persons smiling.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> As the illness increases lividity of countenance also supervenes, distension of the vessels in the neck, inability of speech as in suffocation; insensibility even if you call loudly. The utterance a moaning and lamentation; and the respiration a sense of suffocation, as in a person who is throttled; the pulse strong, and quick, and small in the beginning,—great, slow, and feeble in the end, and irregular throughout; tentigo of the genital organs. Such sufferings do they endure towards the end of the attack.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But when they come to the termination of the illness, there are unconscious discharges of the urine, and watery discharges from the bowels, and in some cases an evacuation also of the semen, from the constriction and compression of the vessels, or from the pruriency of the pain, and titillation of the humours; for in these cases the pains are seated in the nerves. The mouth watery; phlegm copious, thick, cold, and, if you should draw it forth, you might drag out a quantity of it in the form of a thread. But, if with length of time and much pain, the matters within the chest ferment, but the restrained spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) agitates all things, and there is a convulsion and disorder of the same, a flood, as it were, of humours swells up to <pb n="246"/>  the organs of respiration, the mouth, and the nose; and if along with the humours the spirit be mixed, it appears like the relief of all the former feelings of suffocation. They accordingly spit out foam, as the sea ejects froth in mighty tempests; and then at length they rise up, the ailment now being at an end. At the termination, they are torpid in their members at first, experience heaviness of the head, and loss of strength, and are languid, pale, spiritless, and dejected, from the suffering and shame of the dreadful malady.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:1" n="6"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER VI. ON TETANUS</head> 
	<p rend="align(indent)"> TETANUS, in all its varieties, is a spasm of an exceedingly painful nature, very swift to prove fatal, but neither easy to be removed. They are affections of the muscles and tendons about the jaws; but the illness is communicated to the whole frame, for all parts are affected sympathetically with the primary organs. There are three forms of the convulsion, namely, in a straight line, backwards, and forwards. Tetanus is in a direct line, when the person labouring under the distention is stretched out straight and inflexible. The contractions forwards and backwards have their appellation from the tension and the place; for that backwards we call Opisthotonos; and that variety we call Emprosthotonos in which the patient is bent forwards by the anterior nerves. For the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόνος</foreign> is applied both to a nerve, and to signify tension.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The causes of these complaints are many; for some are apt to supervene on the wound of a membrane, or of muscles, or of punctured nerves, when, for the most part, the patients die; for, <q rend="double">spasm from a wound is fatal.</q> And women also suffer from <pb n="247"/>  this spasm after abortion; and, in this case, they seldom recover. Others are attacked with the spasm owing to a severe blow in the neck. Severe cold also sometimes proves a cause; for this reason, winter of all the seasons most especially engenders these affections; next to it, spring and autumn, but least of all summer, unless when preceded by a wound, or when any strange diseases prevail epidemically. Women are more disposed to tetanus than men, because they are of a cold temperament; but they more readily recover, because they are of a humid. With respect to the different ages, children are frequently affected, but do not often die, because the affection is familiar and akin to them; striplings are less liable to suffer, but more readily die; adults least of all, whereas old men are most subject to the disease, and most apt to die; the cause of this is the frigidity and dryness of old age, and the nature of the death. But if the cold be along with humidity, these spasmodic diseases are more innocent, and attended with less danger.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In all these varieties, then, to speak generally, there is a pain and tension of the tendons and spine, and of the muscles connected with the jaws and cheek; for they fasten the lower jaw to the upper, so that it could not easily be separated even with levers or a wedge. But if one, by forcibly separating the teeth, pour in some liquid, the patients do not drink it but squirt it out, or retain it in the mouth, or it regurgitates by the nostrils; for the isthmus faucium is strongly compressed, and the tonsils being hard and tense, do not coalesce so as to propel that which is swallowed. The face is ruddy, and of mixed colours, the eyes almost immoveable, or are rolled about with difficulty; strong feeling of suffocation; respiration bad, distension of the arms and legs; subsultus of the muscles; the countenance variously distorted; the cheeks and lips tremulous; the jaw quivering, and the teeth rattling, and in certain rare cases even the ears are thus affected. I myself have beheld <pb n="248"/>  this and wondered! The urine is retained, so as to induce strong dysuria, or passes spontaneously from contraction of the bladder. These symptoms occur in each variety of the spasms.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But there are peculiarities in each; in Tetanus there is tension in a straight line of the whole body, which is unbent and inflexible; the legs and arms are straight.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Opisthotonos bends the patient backward, like a bow, so that the reflected head is lodged between the shoulder-blades; the throat protrudes; the jaw sometimes gapes, but in some rare cases it is fixed in the upper one; respiration stertorous; the belly and chest prominent, and in these there is usually incontinence of urine; the abdomen stretched, and resonant if tapped; the arms strongly bent back in a state of extension; the legs and thighs are bent together, for the legs are bent in the opposite direction to the hams.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if they are bent forwards, they are protuberant at the back, the loins being extruded in a line with the back, the whole of the spine being straight; the vertex prone, the head inclining towards the chest; the lower jaw fixed upon the breast bone; the hands clasped together, the lower extremities extended; pains intense; the voice altogether dolorous; they groan, making deep moaning. Should the mischief then seize the chest and the respiratory organs, it readily frees the patient from life; a blessing this, to himself, as being a deliverance from pains, distortion, and deformity; and a contingency less than usual to be lamented by the spectators, were he a son or a father. But should the powers of life still stand out, the respiration, although bad, being still prolonged, the patient is not only bent up into an arch but rolled together like a ball, so that the head rests upon the knees, while the legs and back are bent forwards, so as to convey the impression of the articulation of the knee being dislocated backwards.</p> 
<pb n="249"/> 

<p rend="align(indent)"> An inhuman calamity! an unseemly sight! a spectacle painful even to the beholder! an incurable malady! owing to the distortion, not to be recognised by the dearest friends; and hence the prayer of the spectators, which formerly would have been reckoned not pious, now becomes good, that the patient may depart from life, as being a deliverance from the pains and unseemly evils attendant on it. But neither can the physician, though present and looking on, furnish any assistance, as regards life, relief from pain or from deformity. For if he should wish to straighten the limbs, he can only do so by cutting and breaking those of a living man. With them, then, who are overpowered by the disease, he can merely sympathise. This is the great misfortune of the physician.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:1" n="7"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER VII. ON ANGINA, OR QUINSEY</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> ANGINA is indeed a very acute affection, for it is a compression of the respiration. But there are two species of it; for it is either an inflammation of the organs of respiration, or an affection of the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) alone, which contains the cause of the disease in itself.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The organs affected are, the tonsils, epiglottis, pharynx, uvula, top of the trachea; and, if the inflammation spread, the tongue also, and internal part of the fauces, when they protrude the tongue outside the teeth, owing to its abnormal size; for it fills the whole of the mouth, and the protuberance thereof extends beyond the teeth. This species is called Cynanche, either from its being a common affection of those animals, or from its being a customary practice for dogs to protrude the tongue even in health.</p> 
<pb n="250"/> 

<p rend="align(indent)"> The opposite symptoms attend the other species; namely, collapse of the organs, and diminution of the natural size, with intense feeling of suffocation, insomuch that it appears to themselves as if the inflammation had disappeared to the internal parts of the thorax, and had seized upon the heart and lungs. This we call Synanche, as if from the disease inclining inwardly and producing suffocation. It appears to me that this is an illness of the spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) itself, which has under-gone a morbid conversion to a hotter and drier state, without any inflammation of the organ itself. Nor is this any great wonder. For in the Charonæan caves the most sudden suffocations occur from no affection of any organ,<note resp="editor" place="inline">The Charonæan ditches or pits here mentioned, were in Phrygia. See Strabo, xii. 8. They are mentioned by Galen, de usu partium, vii.; Epid. i.t. xvii. p. 10, ed. Kühn; and Pliny, H.N. vii. 93. Their pestilential exhalations are often noticed by ancient authors.</note> but the persons die from one inspiration, before the body can sustain any injury. But likewise a man will be seized with <emph rend="italic">rabies</emph>, from respiring the effluvia of the tongue of a dog, without having been bitten. It is not impossible then, that such a change of the respiration should occur within, since many other phenomena which occur in a man bear a resemblance to external causes, such as juices which become spoiled both within and without. And diseases resemble deleterious substances, and men have similar vomitings from medicines and from fevers. Hence, also, it was not a wonderful thing, that in the plague of Athens, certain persons fancied that poisonous substances had been thrown into the wells in the Piræus by the Peloponnesians; for these persons did not perceive the affinity between a pestilential disease and deleterious substances.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Cases of Cynanche are attended with inflammation of the tonsils, of the fauces, and of the whole mouth; the tongue protrudes beyond the teeth and lips; they have salivation, the <pb n="251"/>  phlegm running out very thick and cold; they have their faces ruddy and swollen; their eyes protuberant, wide open, and red; the drink regurgitates by the nostrils. The pains violent, but obscured by the urgency of the suffocation; the chest and heart are in a state of inflammation; there is a longing for cold air, yet they inspire but little, until they are suffocated from the obstruction of the passage to the chest. In certain cases, there is a ready transference of the disease to the chest, and these die from the metastasis; the fevers feeble, slight, bringing no relief. But if, in any case, there is a turn to the better, abscesses form on either side, near the ears externally, or internally about the tonsils; and if these occur with torpor, and are not very protracted, the patients recover, indeed, but with pain and danger. But, if a particularly large swelling should occur, in such cases as are converted to an abscess, and the abscess is raised to a point, they are quickly suffocated. Such are the peculiar symptoms of cynanche.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Those of Synanche are, collapse, tenuity, and paleness; the eyes hollow, sunk inwardly; the fauces and uvula retracted upwards, the tonsils approaching one another still more; loss of speech: the feeling of suffocation is much stronger in this species than in the former, the mischief being seated in the chest whence the source of respiration. In the most acute cases, the patients die the same day, in some instances, even before calling in the physician; and in others, although called in, he could afford them no relief, for they died before the physician could apply the resources of his art. In those in which the disease takes a favourable turn, all the parts become inflamed, the inflammation being determined outwardly, so that the disease becomes cynanche in place of synanche. It is also a good thing when a strong swelling, or erysipelas, appears externally on the chest. And the skilful physician diverts the mischief to the chest by means of the cupping-instrument, or <pb n="252"/>  by applying mustard to the breast and the parts near the jaws he determines outwardly and discusses the disease. In certain cases, indeed, the evil by these means has been for a time driven outwards, but when so driven out it speedily reverts, and produces suffocation.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The causes are infinite, more especially exposure to cold, and, less frequently, to heat; blows; fish-bones fixed in the tonsils, cold draughts, intoxication, repletion, and the ills from respiration.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:1" n="8"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER VIII. ON THE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE UVULA</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> THE solid body suspended from the roof of the mouth between the two tonsils is called columella and gurgulio. Uva is the name of the affection. The columella (<emph rend="italic">uvula</emph>) is of a nervous nature, but humid, for it is situated in a humid region. Wherefore this body, the columella, suffers from various affections, for it becomes thickened from inflammation, being elongated and of equal thickness from the base to the extremity, and is attended with redness. Columna is the appellation of this affection. If it be rounded towards the extremity alone, and with its enlargement become livid and darkish, the name of the affection is Uva; for it altogether resembles a grape in figure, colour, and size. A third affection is that of the membranes when they have the appearance of broad sails, or the wings of bats, on this side and on that. This is called Lorum, for the lengthened folds of the membranes resemble thongs. But if the columella terminates in a slender and elongated membrane, having at its extremity a resemblance to the butt-end of a spear, it gets the name of <pb n="253"/>  Fimbria. This affection arises spontaneously from a defluxion, like the others, but also from an oblique incision when the surgeon leaves the membrane at one side.<note resp="editor" place="inline">Our author alludes here to the surgical operation, excision of the tonsils, described by Paulus Ægineta, vi. 30.</note> But if the organ (uvula) become bifid with two membranes hanging on this side and on that, it has no distinct appellation, but it is an easy matter for any one who sees it to recognise the nature of the disease.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> A sense of suffocation accompanies all these affections, and they can by no means swallow with freedom. There is cough in all the varieties, but especially in those named lorum and fimbria. For a titillation of the trachea is produced by the membrane, and in some cases it secretly instils some liquid into the windpipe, whence they cough. But in uva and columella there is still more dyspnœa and very difficult deglutition; for, in these cases, the fluid is squeezed up to the nostrils, from sympathy of the tonsils. The columella is common in old persons, the uva in the young and in adults; for they abound in blood, and are of a more inflammatory nature. The affections of the membranes are common in puberty and infancy. It is safe to apply the knife in all these varieties; but in the uva, while still red, hemorrhage, pains, and increase of inflammation supervene.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:1" n="9"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER IX. ON ULCERATIONS ABOUT THE TONSILS</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> ULCERS occur on the tonsils; some, indeed, of an ordinary nature, mild and innocuous; but others of an unusual kind, pestilential, and fatal. Such as are clean, small, superficial, without inflammation and without pain, are mild; but such as <pb n="254"/>  are broad, hollow, foul, and covered with a white, livid, or black concretion, are pestilential. Aphtha is the name given to these ulcers. But if the concretion has depth, it is an Eschar and is so called: but around the eschar there is formed a great redness, inflammation, and pain of the veins, as in carbuncle; and small pustules form, at first few in number, but others coming out, they coalesce, and a broad ulcer is produced. And if the disease spread outwardly to the mouth, and reach the columella (<emph rend="italic">uvula</emph>) and divide it asunder, and if it extend to the tongue, the gums, and the alveoli, the teeth also become loosened and black; and the inflammation seizes the neck; and these die within a few days from the inflammation, fever, fœtid smell, and want of food. But, if it spread to the thorax by the windpipe, it occasions death by suffocation within the space of a day. For the lungs and heart can neither endure such smells, nor ulcerations, nor ichorous discharges, but coughs and dyspnœa supervene.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The cause of the mischief in the tonsils is the swallowing of cold, rough, hot, acid, and astringent substances; for these parts minister to the chest as to the purposes of voice and respiration; and to the belly for the conveyance of food; and to the stomach for deglutition. But if any affection occur in the internal parts, namely, the belly, the stomach, or the chest, an ascent of the mischief by the eructations takes place to the isthmus faucium, the tonsils, and the parts there; wherefore children, until puberty, especially suffer, for children in particular have large and cold respiration; for there is most heat in them; moreover, they are intemperate in regard to food, have a longing for varied food and cold drink; and they bawl loud both in anger and in sport; and these diseases are familiar to girls until they have their menstrual purgation. The land of Egypt especially engenders it, the air thereof being dry for respiration, and the food diversified, consisting of roots, herbs of many kinds, acrid seeds, and thick drink; <pb n="255"/>  namely, the water of the Nile, and the sort of ale prepared from barley. Syria also, and more especially Cœlosyria, engenders these diseases, and hence they have been named Egyptian and Syrian ulcers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The manner of death is most piteous; pain sharp and hot as from carbuncle;<note resp="editor" place="inline">The term in the original, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθραξ</foreign>, may either signify <q rend="double">a live coal,</q> or the disease <q rend="double">Carbuncle.</q> See Paulus Ægineta, iv. 25. It is somewhat doubtful to which of these significations our author applies it here; indeed, the former would be the more emphatic.</note> respiration bad, for their breath smells strongly of putrefaction, as they constantly inhale the same again into their chest; they are in so loathsome a state that they cannot endure the smell of themselves; countenance pale or livid; fever acute, thirst is if from fire, and yet they do not desire drink for fear of the pains it would occasion; for they become sick if it compress the tonsils, or if it return by the nostrils; and if they lie down they rise up again as not being able to endure the recumbent position, and, if they rise up, they are forced in their distress to lie down again; they mostly walk about erect, for in their inability to obtain relief they flee from rest, as if wishing to dispel one pain by another. Inspiration large, as desiring cold air for the purpose of refrigeration, but expiration small, for the ulceration, as if produced by burning, is inflamed by the heat of the respiration. Hoarseness, loss of speech supervene; and these symptoms hurry on from bad to worse, until suddenly falling to the ground they expire.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:1" n="10"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER X. ON PLEURISY</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> UNDER the ribs, the spine, and the internal part of the thorax as far as the clavicles, there is stretched a thin strong membrane, <pb n="256"/>  adhering to the bones, which is named <emph rend="italic">succingens.</emph> When inflammation occurs in it, and there is heat with cough and parti-coloured sputa, the affection is named Pleurisy. But all these symptoms must harmonise and conspire together as all springing from one cause; for such of them as occur separately from different causes, even if they all occur together, are not called pleurisy. It is accompanied by acute pain of the clavicles; heat acrid; <emph rend="italic">decubitus</emph> on the inflamed side easy, for thus the membrane (<emph rend="italic">pleura</emph>) remains in its proper seat, but on the opposite side painful; for by its weight, the inflammation and suspension of the membrane, the pain stretches to all its adhesions at the shoulders and clavicles; and in certain cases even to the back and shoulder blade; the ancients called this affection Dorsal pleurisy. It is attended with dyspnœa, insomnolency, anorexia, florid redness of the cheeks, dry cough, difficult expectoration of phlegm, or bilious, or deeply tinged with blood, or yellowish; and these symptoms observe no order, but come and go irregularly; but, worst of all, if the bloody sputa cease, and the patients become delirious; and sometimes they become comatose, and in their somnolency the mind wavers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the disease take a bad turn, all the symptoms getting worse, they die within the seventh day by falling into syncope; or, if the commencement of the expectoration, and the more intense symptoms occurred with the second hebdomad, they die on the fourteenth day. It sometimes happens that in the intermediate period there is a transference of all the symptoms to the lungs; for the lung attracts to itself, being both porous and hot, and being moved for the attraction of the substances around, when the patient is suddenly suffocated by metastasis of the affection. But if the patient pass this period, and do not die within the twentieth day, he becomes affected with empyema. These, then, are the symptoms if the disease get into a bad state.</p> 
<pb n="257"/> 

<p rend="align(indent)"> But if it take a favourable turn, there is a profuse hemorrhage by the nostrils, when the disease is suddenly resolved; then follow sleep and expectoration of phlegm, and afterwards of thin, bilious matters; then of still thinner, and again of bloody, thick, and flesh-like; and if, with the bloody, the bile return, and with it the phlegm, the patient’s convalescence is secure; and these symptoms, if they should commence on the third day, with an easy expectoration of smooth, consistent, liquid, and (not) rounded sputa, the resolution takes place on the seventh day, when, after bilious discharges from the bowels, there is freedom of respiration, the mind settled, fever diminishing, and return of appetite. But if these symptoms commence with the second week, the resolution occurs on the fourteenth day.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if not so, it is converted into Empyema, as indicated by rigors, pungent pains, the desire of sitting erect, and the respiration becoming worse. It is then to be dreaded, lest, the lungs suddenly attracting the pus, the patient should be thereby suffocated, after having escaped the first and greater evils. But if the abscess creep in between the ribs and separate them, and point outwardly; or, if it burst into an intestine, for the most part the patient recovers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Among the seasons of the year winter most especially engenders the disease; next, autumn; spring, less frequently; but summer most rarely. With regard to age, old men are most apt to suffer, and most readily escape from an attack; for neither is there apt to be a great inflammation in an arid frame; nor is there a metastasis to the lungs, for old age is more frigid than any other age, and the respiration small, and the attraction of all things deficient. Young men and adults are not, indeed, very apt to suffer attacks; but neither, also, do they readily recover, for from a slight cause they would not experience even a slight attack of inflammation, and from great attacks there is greater danger. Children are least of all <pb n="258"/>  liable to pleurisy, and in their case it is less frequently fatal; for their bodies are rare, secretions copious, perspiration and exhalation abundant; hence neither is a great inflammation formed. This is the felicity of their period of life in the present affection.</p> </div> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)"> ANIMALS live by two principal things, food and breath (<emph rend="italic">spirit, pneuma</emph>); of these by far the most important is the respiration, for if it be stopped, the man will not endure long, but immediately dies. The organs of it are many, the commencement being the nostrils; the passage, the trachea; the containing vessel, the lungs; the protection and receptacle of the lungs, the thorax. But the other parts, indeed, minister only as instruments to the animal; but the lungs also contain the cause of attraction, for in the midst of them is seated a hot organ, the heart, which is the origin of life and respiration. It imparts to the lungs the desire of drawing in cold air, for it raises a heat in them; but it is the heart which attracts. If, therefore, the heart suffer primarily, death is not far off.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the lungs be affected, from a slight cause there is difficulty of breathing; the patient lives miserably, and death is the issue, unless some one effects a cure. But in a great affection, such as inflammation, there is a sense of suffocation, <pb n="262"/>  loss of speech and of breathing, and a speedy death. This is what we call Peripneumonia, being an inflammation of the lungs, with acute fever, when they are attended with heaviness of the chest, freedom from pain, provided the lungs alone are inflamed; for they are naturally insensible, being of loose texture, like wool. But branches of the aspera arteria are spread through them, of a cartilaginous nature, and these, also, are insensible; muscles there are nowhere, and the nerves are small, slender, and minister to motion. This is the cause of the insensibility to pain. But if any of the membranes, by which it is connected with the chest, be inflamed, pain also is present; respiration bad, and hot; they wish to get up into an erect posture, as being the easiest of all postures for the respiration. Ruddy in countenance, but especially the cheeks; the white of the eyes very bright and fatty; the point of the nose flat; the veins in the temples and neck distended; loss of appetite; pulse, at first, large, empty, very frequent, as if forcibly accelerated; heat indeed, externally, feeble, and more humid than natural, but, internally, dry, and very hot, by means of which the breath is hot; there is thirst, dryness of the tongue, desire of cold air, aberration of mind; cough mostly dry, but if anything be brought up it is a frothy phlegm, or slightly tinged with bile, or with a very florid tinge of blood. The blood-stained is of all others the worst.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the disease tend to a fatal termination, there is insomnolency; sleep brief, heavy, of a comatose nature; vain fancies; they are in a doting state of mind, but not violently delirious; they have no knowledge of their present sufferings. If you interrogate them respecting the disease, they will not acknowledge any formidable symptom; the extremities cold; the nails livid, and curved; the pulse small, very frequent, and failing, in which case death is near at hand, for they die mostly on the seventh day.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the disease abate and take a favourable turn, there is <pb n="263"/>  a copious hemorrhage from the nose, a discharge from the bowels of much bilious and frothy matters, such as might seem to be expelled from the lungs to the lower belly, provided it readily brings off much in a liquid state. Sometimes there is a determination to the urine. But they recover the most speedily in whose cases all these occur together.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In certain cases much pus is formed in the lungs, or there is a metastasis from the side, if a greater symptom of convalescence be at hand. But if, indeed, the matter be translated from the side to the intestine or bladder, the patients immediately recover from the peripneumony; but they have a chronic abscess in the side, which, however, gets better. But if the matter burst upon the lungs, some have thereby been suffocated, from the copious effusion and inability to bring it up. But such as escape suffocation from the bursting of the abscess, have a large ulceration in the lungs, and pass into phthisis; and from the abscess and phthisis old persons do not readily recover; but from the peripneumony, youths and adults.</p> </div>

	<p rend="align(indent)"> THERE are two species of the discharge of blood by the mouth. The one that by the mouth from the head and the vessels there; the passage is by the palate and fauces, where are situated the commencement of the œsophagus and trachea; and with hawking, and small and more urgent cough, they eructate the blood into the mouth; whereas, in that from the mouth, neither does hawking accompany, and it is called <emph rend="italic">Emptysis</emph> [<emph rend="italic">or</emph> spitting of blood]. But when the discharge is more scanty, and by drops, or when it comes more copiously from the head, <pb n="264"/>  or from the mouth, it is no longer called a bringing up, but either the same, or a spitting, or a hemorrhage. But if it ascend from the chest, and the viscera there, the lungs, aspera arteria, the parts about the spine, the discharge from these is not called a spitting, but a bringing up (in Greek, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγωγή</foreign>, the name being expressive of its coming upwards).<note resp="editor" place="inline">Cælius Aurelianus, under the head of <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">Sanguinis fluor,</q> thus explains the term:—<quote rend="double" xml:lang="lat">Improprium est enim fluorem vocare id quod ascensu quodam non lapsu fertur. Sed hæc Græci versa vice posuerunt, derivationem nominis intuentes. Hi enim anagogen vocant quod magis ex inferioribus ad superiora fluorem significat.</quote>—<title rend="italic">Tard. pass.</title> iii. 9. We are at a loss for a proper vocable in English to express this term. It is usually translated <foreign xml:lang="lat">rejectio</foreign> in Latin, which, however, is not sufficiently expressive. The most suitable in English, which I can think of, is <q rend="double">a bringing up.</q></note></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The symptoms of both are partly common, small and few in number, such as the seat of them, in which there is a coincidence between the bringing up and the spitting. But the peculiarities of each are great, many, and of vital importance, by which it is easy to distinguish either of them from the other. If, therefore, it came from the head, with a large discharge of blood, greater and more numerous symptoms will arise, but scanty from a slight and small spitting; in these cases, there is heaviness of the head, pain, noises of the ears, redness of countenance, distension of the veins, vertigo; and these are preceded by some obvious cause, such as a blow, exposure to cold, or heat, or intoxication; for drinking of wine speedily fills the head, and speedily empties it, by the bursting of a vessel; but from a slight intoxication there may be spitting, proceeding from rarefaction. Occasionally an habitual hemorrhage from the nostrils is stopped, and being diverted to the palate, produces the semblance of a bringing up of blood. If, therefore, it be from the head, there is titillation of the palate, frequent hawking, and with it a copious spitting takes place; a desire supervenes, and they readily cough. But if it flow into the aspera <pb n="265"/>  arteria from the palate, they then bring it up by coughing, and this it is which deceives them into the supposition that it comes from the viscera below. It runs, also, from the head into the stomach, when it is vomited up with nausea, and thus proves a source of deception, as appearing to come from the stomach. The blood brought up by spitting is not very thick, but dark in colour, smooth, consistent, unmixed with other substances; for, being hawked up, it comes immediately upon the tongue in a round shape, being readily separated; and if you examine the roof of the palate, you will find it thickened and ulcerated, and, for the most part, bloody; and a slight and simple plan of treatment will suffice, namely, astringents applied to the palate in a cold state; for by hot, relaxing, and dilating applications the flow is increased, and this is an indication that the spitting is from the head, in which case evacuations are to be made from the head by the veins, the nostrils, or by any other channel of discharge. And these things must be done speedily; for if the blood is discharged a considerable time, the flow will become permanent, and the parts there will contract the habit of receiving the blood. The trachea, also, becomes ulcerated, and the patients cough instead of hawking; and this proves the commencement of a consumption.</p> 
	<p rend="align(indent)"> The flow of blood from the chest and viscera below is called a bringing up (in Greek, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγωγή</foreign>). It is truly of a fatal nature, if it proceed from any of the vital parts which are ruptured—either the <emph rend="italic">vena cava</emph> in the heart, which conveys the blood from the liver, or from the large vein which lies along the spine. For from hemorrhage, as from slaughtering or impeded respiration, death is very speedy. But in those cases in which the blood comes from the lungs, the side, or the trachea, they do not die so speedily; but, nevertheless, they become affected with Empyema and Phthisis. Of these the least formidable is that from the trachea. But if the vomiting come from the stomach or bowels, the cases are not of a very <pb n="266"/>  fatal nature, even though the hemorrhage be large; neither is the recovery slow and changeable. But if it proceed from the liver and spleen, it is neither readily nor constantly discharged upwards, but the defluxion is more easy into the stomach and intestines. Yet neither is the discharge upwards by the lungs impossible or incredible, for in fevers there occur hemorrhages of blood from the liver and spleen by the nostrils, the blood flowing from the nostril on the same side as the viscus from which it comes. These, then, are the places from which the blood comes in the bringing up, and such the differences as to danger or mortality.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But the modes are three; for it is brought up either from rupture of a vessel, or from erosion, or from rarefaction. Rupture, then, takes place suddenly, either from a blow, straining at a load, or lifting a weight upward, or a leap from a height, or from bawling aloud, from violent passion, or some other similar cause, when blood is instantly poured forth from the vessel in great quantity.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if it proceed from erosion, the patient is to be interrogated if he ever had a cough before, or was affected with dyspnœa, and whether nausea or vomiting ever afflicted him previously. For from such chronic affections the vessels are corroded by a continued, copious, and acrid defluxion. When, therefore, the containing vessels, having been long wasted and attenuated, at length give way, they pour forth blood.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But the mode by rarefaction is, indeed, unattended by rupture, and on that account the discharge is neither copious nor sudden, nor does it consist of thick blood; for by the rarefaction of the vessels, the thin portion is excreted. But if much collect in a cavity, and be again brought up, it becomes thicker than natural, but yet not very thick, neither black, like a clot; but it is quickly brought up in greater quantity, as being from a collection. This mode of bringing up blood is common with women who have not their monthly purgation, <pb n="267"/>  and appears at the periods of the purgation, and stops during the intervals between them; and if the woman is not cured, the discharge upwards of blood will revert for many periods, and also, in certain cases, the vessels burst from fulness.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> And there is a difference of the discharge, whether it be brought up from an artery or a vein. For it is black, thick, and readily coagulates, if from a vein; it is less dangerous, and is more speedily stopped; but if from an artery, it is of a bright yellow colour and thin, does not readily coagulate, the danger is more imminent, and to stop it is not so easy; for the pulsations of the artery provoke the hemorrhage, and the lips of the wound do not coalesce from the frequent movements of the vessel.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Recovery, if from erosion, is protracted, difficult, and doubtful; for, owing to loss of substance, the parts of the ulcer do not come together, for it is an ulcer, and not a wound; and adhesion takes place more readily in ruptures, for the lips of the wound touch one another. This, then, is another difference as to danger. The mode attended with least danger is that from rarefaction; and in it the styptic and refrigerant method of treatment is sufficient.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The places are to be indicated from which the blood is brought up; for many of the symptoms are common, deception is easy, and the cure different. Blood, then, from erosion is not readily brought up from the stomach, for the coldness and stypticity of the articles of food and drink bring the parts to a state of condensation. Neither, also, are cases from erosion common, although more so than the former; for acrid defluxions do not adhere for any length of time, but are either brought up or are passed downwards. Rupture is more common in the stomach. If, then, any rupture take place, the hemorrhage is not very great, such as that from the thorax; for the veins there are slender, and the arteries also are small. <pb n="268"/>  But in appearance the blood is not very black, not intensely yellowish, smooth, or mixed with saliva, being brought up with nausea and vomiting, slight cough, sometimes with some discharge, and sometimes alone, without any expectoration; for the trachea sympathises with the gullet, being extended along and connected with it. There is pinching or constriction of the ulcer from the things swallowed, more especially if they are very cold, hot, or austere; and in certain cases pain is produced in the stomach, extending as far as the back; vomitings of phlegm, and sometimes, when the disease is long protracted, and there has been long abstinence from food, they bring up a great quantity of them; fevers, not of a continual type, but of an irregular kind.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But, from the stomach, what is brought up may be black and coagulated, even if it proceed from an artery; but if it proceed from a vein, it is much blacker and much more compact; much nausea and vomiting of pituitous and bilious matter; blood mixed up with the food, provided the man had eaten previously, for both the food and the blood are collected together in the same place; eructations frequent and fœtid, and, if much collect together, there is anxiety of mind and vertigo; but if these be vomited they are relieved. They are prostrate in strength, generally affected with a burning heat, and constant pain of the stomach.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But from the aspera arteria they bring up scanty and very fluid blood, with a cough; or, if they do not bring it up, they cough incessantly. There is a painful feeling in the throat, either a little below or above; voice hoarse and indistinct.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if it be from the lungs, the discharge is copious, especially if from erosion, with much cough, of an intense yellow colour, frothy, rounded; so that what is brought up from one part may be distinguished from what is brought up from another. But the defluxion, though contained in a common vessel, from the chest, is diversified after mixture, and you <pb n="269"/>  may distinguish parts of them as being portions of the thorax, and parts which have a fleshy appearance as being portions of the lungs. There is heaviness of the chest, freedom from pain, and much redness of the face, particularly in these cases.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if brought up from the thorax, pain stretching to the anterior part of the breast is indicative of the ruptured part; cough intense, expectoration difficult, the blood not very fluid, moderately thick, without froth. But if, in passing, the lung be affected by consent, a certain amount of froth is imparted to it, for the passage from the chest to the trachea is by the lungs.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if, indeed, from the side there be discharged with cough blood which is black, smooth, fœtid, stinking, as from putrefaction, with acute pain of the side, many die after the manner of pleuritics with fever.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> A season that is humid and hot engenders these affections. Spring is thus humid and hot. Next the summer; autumn less, but winter least of all. They die in summer mostly from hemorrhage, for great inflammations do not readily occur then; secondly, in spring, from inflammation and ardent fevers; but in autumn, attacks of <emph rend="italic">phthisis</emph> readily occur.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> In a word, every discharge of blood upwards, even if small, and although the ruptured vessels may have already united, is attended with lowness of spirits, dejection, and despair of life. For who is so firm in mind as to see himself enduring a state resembling that of a slaughtered animal, and yet have no fear of death? For the largest and most powerful animals, such as bulls, die very quickly from loss of blood. That, however, is no great wonder. But this is a mighty wonder: in the discharge from the lungs alone, which is particularly dangerous, the patients do not despair of themselves, even although near the last. The insensibility of the lungs to pain appears to me to be the cause of this; for pain, even although slight, makes one to fear death, and yet, in most cases, it is more dreadful than pernicious; <pb n="270"/>  whereas the absence of pain, even in the great illnesses, is attended with absence of the fear of death, and is more dangerous than dreadful.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)"> WELL by all means has the physician, and well have the common people succeeded in the appellation of this affection! It is, indeed, the name of a very acute malady; for what is there greater or more acute than the power of <emph rend="italic">Syncope ?</emph> and what other name more appropriate for the designation of this matter? what other organ more important than the heart for life or for death? Neither is it to be doubted that syncope is a disease of the heart, or that it is an injury of the vital powers thereof—such is the rapidity and such the mode of the destruction. For the affection is the solution of the bonds of the vital power, being antagonistic to the constitution of the man; for having seized fast thereon, it does not let go its hold, but brings him to dissolution. Nor is it any great wonder; for other diseases are peculiar to, and prove fatal to, certain organs, in which they are engendered, and to which they attach themselves. Thus pestilential and very malignant buboes derive their origin from the liver, but from no other part; tetanus, in like manner, from the nerves, and epilepsy from the head. Thus, therefore, syncope is a disease of the heart and of life. But such persons as regard it to be an affection of the stomach, because by means of food and wine, and in certain cases by cold substances, the powers have been restored and the mischief expelled—these, it would seem to me, ought to hold phrenitis to be a disease of the hair and skin of the <pb n="271"/>  head, since the phrenitics are relieved by the shaving and wetting thereof. But to the heart the vicinity of the stomach is most important, for from it the heart draws both what is suitable and what is unsuitable to itself. And by the lungs the heart draws spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>) for respiration, but yet the lungs do not hold a primary place in respiration; for the powers are not in the organs, but there where is the original of life and strength: But the stomach is neither the original nor seat of life; and yet one would be injured by atony thereof: for food which proves injurious to the heart does not hurt the stomach itself, but by it the heart; since those dying in such cases have symptoms of heart-affections, namely, pulse small and feeble, <emph rend="italic">bruit</emph> of the heart, with violent palpitation, vertigo, fainting, torpor, loss of tone in their limbs, sweating copious and unrestrainable, coldness of the whole body, insensibility, loss of utterance. How should the stomach endure such symptoms? For those peculiar to it are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hiccup, eructation, acidity; whereas in cardiac affections the patients are more acute in their senses, so that they see and hear better than formerly; they are also in understanding more sound, and in mind more pure, not only regarding present things, but also with regard to futurity they are true prophets. These, then, are the powers, not of the stomach, but of the heart, where is the soul and the nature thereof, and to it is to be referred this affection of its powers.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But this form of disease is a solution of the natural tone from a cold cause and humidity, and therefore they are not affected with heat, either internally or externally, neither do they suffer from thirst, and their breath is cold even when the disease proceeds from strong and ardent fevers, by which syncope is usually kindled up. For when nature is strong, and of the proper temperament, it rules all and commands all, whether humour, spirit (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), or solid, and, by their good order and symmetry, regulates the man in life; but if the bond <pb n="272"/>  of nature—that is to say, its tone—be dissolved, then this affection is produced. The original of it is <emph rend="italic">causus</emph>, which is in this form.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:2" n="4"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER IV. ON CAUSUS, OR ARDENT FEVER</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> HEAT, indeed, everywhere, both acrid and subtil, but especially in the internal parts; respiration hot, as if from fire; inhalation of air large; desire of cold; dryness of tongue; parchedness of lips and skin; extremities cold; urine intensely tinged with bile; insomnolency; pulse frequent, small, and feeble; eyes clear, glancing, reddish; healthy colour of the countenance.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the affection increase, all appearances become greater and worse; the pulse very small and very frequent; heat very dry and very acrid; intellect wavering; ignorance of all things; they are thirsty; a desire to touch anything cold, whether a wall, a garment, the floor, or a fluid; hands cold, palms thereof very hot, nails livid; breathing thick; perspiration like dew about the forehead and clavicles.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if nature attain the extremity of dryness and of heat, the hot is converted into cold, and the parched into humidity; for extreme intensities of things change to the opposite state. When, therefore, the bonds of life are dissolved, this is syncope. Then is there an irrestrainable sweat over all the body; respiration cold, much vapour about the nostrils; they have no thirst, and yet the other parts are parched except the organs of thirst, namely, the mouth and stomach; the urine thin and watery; belly for the most part dry, yet in certain cases the discharges are scanty and bilious; a redundancy of <pb n="273"/>  humours; even the bones, being dissolved, run off; and from all parts, as in a river, there is a current outwards.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> As to the state of the soul, every sense is pure, the intellect acute, the gnostic powers prophetic; for they prognosticate to themselves, in the first place, their own departure from life; then they foretell what will afterwards take place to those present, who fancy sometimes that they are delirious; but these persons wonder at the result of what has been said. Others, also, talk to certain of the dead, perchance they alone perceiving them to be present, in virtue of their acute and pure sense, or perchance from their soul seeing beforehand, and announcing the men with whom they are about to associate. For formerly they were immersed in humours, as if in mud and darkness; but when the disease has drained these off, and taken away the mist from their eyes, they perceive those things which are in the air, and with the naked soul become true prophets. But those who have attained such a degree of refinement in their humours and understanding will scarcely recover, the vital power having been already evaporated into air.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)"> CHOLERA is a retrograde movement of the <emph rend="italic">materiel</emph> in the whole body on the stomach, the belly, and the intestines; a most acute illness. Those matters, then, which collect in the stomach, rush upwards by vomiting; but those humours in the belly, and intestines, by the passages downwards. With regard to appearance, then, those things which are first discharged by vomiting, are watery; but those by the anus, liquid and <pb n="274"/>  fetid excrement, (for continued indigestion is the cause of this disease); but if these are washed out, the discharges are pituitous, and then bilious. At first, indeed, they are borne easily, and without pain; but afterwards the stomach is affected with retchings, and the belly with tormina.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But, if the disease become worse, the tormina get greater; there is fainting, prostration of strength in the limbs, anxiety, loss of appetite; or, if they take anything, with much rumbling and nausea, there is discharged by vomiting bile intensely yellow, and the downward discharges are of like kind; spasm, contractions of the muscles in the legs and arms; the fingers are bent; vertigo, hiccup, livid nails, frigidity, extremities cold, and altogether they are affected with rigors.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the disease tend to death, the patient falls into a sweat; black bile, upwards and downwards; urine retained in the bladder by the spasm; but, in fact, sometimes neither is there any urine collected in the bladder, owing to the metastasis of the fluids to the intestine; loss of utterance; pulse very small, and very frequent in the cases affected with syncope; continual and unavailing strainings to vomit; the bowels troubled with tenesmus, dry, and without juices; a painful and most piteous death from spasm, suffocation, and empty vomiting.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The season of summer, then, engenders this affection; next autumn; spring, less frequently; winter, least of all. With regard to the ages, then, those of young persons and adults; old age least of all; children more frequently than these, but their complaints are not of a deadly nature. </p></div><pb n="275"/>

<p rend="align(indent)"> AN inflammation takes place in the intestines, creating a deadly pain, for many die of intense tormina; but there is also formed a cold dull flatus (<emph rend="italic">pneuma</emph>), which cannot readily pass either upwards or downwards, but remains, for the most part rolled up in the small convolutions of the upper intestines, and hence the disease has got the appellation of <emph rend="italic">Ileus</emph> (<emph rend="italic">or Volvulus</emph>). But if in addition to the tormina, there be compression and softening of the intestines, and the abdomen protrude greatly, it is called <emph rend="italic">Chordapsus</emph>, from the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕψησις</foreign>, which signifies softening, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορδὴ</foreign>, which is a name for the intestines; and hence the Mesentery, which contains all the nerves, vessels, and membranes that support the intestines, was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχορδὶς</foreign> by the ancients.<note resp="editor" place="inline">Both Petit and Ermerins have animadverted on this singular derivation of the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορδαψός</foreign>. As Petit remarks, the true derivation is no doubt from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅπτεσθαι</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορδή</foreign>. The Greeks, it is well known, were very fanciful etymologists, of which we have striking proofs in the Cratylus of Plato.</note></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The cause of Ileus is a continued corruption of much multifarious and unaccustomed food, and repeated acts of indigestion, especially of articles which are apt to excite Ileus, as the ink of the cuttle-fish. And the same effects may be expected from a blow, or cold, or the drinking of cold water largely and greedily in a state of sweating; and in those cases, in which the gut has descended into the scrotum with fæces, and has not been replaced into the belly, or has been restored to its place with violence, in such cases it is customary for the <pb n="276"/>  lower intestines to get inflamed.<note resp="editor" place="inline">The substance of all the information to be found in the works of the ancient authorities on the subject of Hernia, may be seen in Paulus Ægineta, b.vi., 65, p. 66, Syd. Soc. Edit. I may mention, however, that although there be nothing in the works of the medical authorities which would lead us to suppose that the ancient surgeons were in the practice of operating to relieve incarcerated Hernia, the following passage in one of Martial’s Epigrams would almost lead us to suppose the contrary, <quote rend="double" xml:lang="lat">Mitius implicitas Alcon secat enterocelas,</quote> <title rend="italic">Epigr.</title> xi. 84; which might be thus translated, <q rend="double">The surgeon Alcon inflicts less pain in cutting for incarcerated intestinal hernia.</q></note> This affection is customary with children, who are subject to indigestion, and they more readily escape from the mischief, owing to their habits and the humidity of their intestines, for they are loose. Old persons do not readily suffer from the complaint, but rarely recover. The season of summer engenders the disease rather than that of spring; autumn, than winter; but the summer more than both.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Many therefore die speedily of these tormina. But in other cases pus is formed; and then again, the intestine having become black and putrified, has separated, and thus the patients have died. In these cases, provided the Ileus is mild, there is a twisting pain, copious humours in the stomach, loss of tone, languor, vacant eructations bringing no relief, borborygmi in the bowels, the flatus passing down to the anus, but not making its escape.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the attack of Ileus acquire intensity, there is a determination upwards of everything, flatus, phlegm, and bile; for they vomit all these; they are pale, cold over the whole body; much pain; respiration bad, they are affected with thirst.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> If they are about to die, there is cold sweat, dysuria, anus constricted, so that you could not pass a slender metal plate by it;<note resp="editor" place="inline">Perhaps he means <q rend="double">a needle.</q> See Testa, <title rend="italic">Mal. del Cuore</title>, t. iii.</note> vomiting of fæces; the patients are speechless; pulse, at last <pb n="277"/>  rare and small, but before death very small, very dense, and failing. These symptoms attend the disease in the small intestines.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But the same affections occur also in the colon, and the symptoms are similar, as also the issue; some of these escape if pus form in the colon, the reason of which is the fleshy thickness of this intestine. The pain is slender and sharp in the small intestines, but broad and heavy in the colon; the pain also sometimes darts up to the ribs, when the disease puts on the appearance of pleurisy; and these, moreover, are affected with fever; but sometimes it extends to the false ribs, on this side or on that, so that the pain appears to be seated in the liver and spleen; again it affects the loins, for the colon has many convolutions in all directions; but in other cases it fixes on the sacrum, the thighs, and the cremasters of the testicles. But in colic affections, they have rather retchings; and what is vomited is then bilious and oily. And the danger therefrom is so much the less, as the colon is more fleshy, and thicker than the small intestines, and consequently more tolerant of injury.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)"> IN the affections of the liver, the patients do not die, indeed, more quickly than in those of the heart; but yet they suffer more pain; for the liver is, in a great measure, a concretion of blood. But if the cause of death happen to be situated in its <emph rend="italic">Portæ</emph>, they die no less speedily than from the heart; for these parts are tissues formed of membranes, of important and slender nerves, and of large veins. Hence certain of the philosophers <pb n="278"/>  have held that the desires of the soul are seated there. In hemorrhage it greatly surpasses all the others; <q rend="double">for the liver is made up from the roots of veins.</q> Wherefore a great inflammation does form in it, but not very frequently, nor in its vital parts, for the patient would die previously. But a smaller inflammation often takes place, whence it happens that they escape death, indeed, but experience a more protracted state of disease. For of its office, as regards sanguification, there is no stop nor procrastination, as from it a supply of blood is sent to the heart, and to the parts below the diaphragm.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> If from a greater cause—a stroke, or continued indigestion of much and bad food, and intoxication, or great cold—an inflammation forms in the portal system, a very speedy death is the result. For there is a latent, smothered, and acrid heat; pulse languid; the kind of pain varied, and every way diversified, sometimes darting to the right side, so as to resemble a sharp weapon fixed in the place, and sometimes resembling tormina; again, at other times the pain is deep—nay, very deep; and, intermediate between the pain, atony and loss of utterance. The diaphragm and succingens (<emph rend="italic">pleura</emph>) are dragged downwards; for from them the liver is suspended as a weight. For this reason, a strong pain extends to the clavicle on the same side; an ineffectual cough, or only a desire thereof, and when it comes to a conclusion, dry; respiration bad, for the diaphragm does not co-operate with the lungs, by assisting them in contraction and dilatation. They draw in a small breath, but expire a larger; colour, a dark-green, leaden; they loathe food, or if they force themselves to take any, they become flatulent in the epigastrium; eructations bilious, acid, fetid; nausea, retchings, belly mostly loose, discharges bilious, viscid, small in quantity. The affections always go on increasing; mind not very much deranged, but torpid, unsettled, stupid; much timidity; coldness of the extremities, tremblings, rigors, <pb n="279"/>  hiccup of a spasmodic nature, jaundice, bile intense, the whole body tinged with bile. But if it appear before the seventh day, it proves fatal in many cases.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But those who have escaped a fatal termination, either by a hemorrhage, or a rapid discharge from the bowels of bilious matters, or from frequent discharges of intense urine, in these cases, after three weeks, the liver is converted into a purulent abscess. But if it pass considerably this period without an abscess, it ends inevitably in dropsy; the patients are thirsty, drink little, are dried in body, lose fat; there is a desire for acids, and an insensibility to taste.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Autumn engenders this affection, along with the indigestion produced by much summer-fruit and multifarious food. Of all ages, the adult is most subject to it.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:2" n="8"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER VIII. ON THE ACUTE DISEASE OF THE VENA CAVA</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> FROM the portæ of the liver, there passes a wide vein through the space intermediate between its extremities, which, being always divided into slender and more numerous branches, is distributed at last all over the liver in vessels imperceptible to the sight; and with their extremities anastomose the extremities of other veins, which, at first, are slender and numerous, grow larger and fewer in number, and, at last, they are collected into one large vein; hence, having become two by division, these pass through the liver. The upper one, then, having passed through the first lobe, appears on its convex side; then, having passed the diaphragm, it is inserted into the heart: this is called the <emph rend="italic">vena cava.</emph> The other, having passed through the lower lobe, the fifth, to its concave side, makes its <pb n="280"/>  exit near the spine, and is extended along it as far as the ischiatic region; and it, also, is called <emph rend="italic">vena cava.</emph> It obtains the same name, as being one and the same vein, which derives its origin from the liver. For if one choose, one may pass a plate of metal from the vena cava connected with the heart to that by the spine, and from the spine through the liver to the heart; for it is the same passage leading upwards.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> This vein, then, as I think, is all diseased in acute and strong affections; for it is altogether one vein. But other physicians fancy that only the part along the spine is affected, because there are no manifest symptoms in regard to the portion about the heart; for it is extended through the chest, having no adhesions, but floating in the chest, until, from the diaphragm, it adheres to the heart. If, then, any of the great ailments seize this vein, they are concealed by the thorax surrounding it.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Wherefore <emph rend="italic">kedmata</emph><note resp="editor" place="inline">See the note on the English translation of Hippocrates, Syd. Soc. Edit., vol. i. p. 216, and the authorities there referred to. The aneurismal varix would apply best to it in this place. It is not unlikely that aortal aneurisms were sometimes confounded with it. On this subject, see further Testa, <title rend="italic">Malattie del Cuore</title>, t. iii.</note> also form about this vein when a hemorrhage, bursting forth quickly proves fatal, the blood being discharged by the lungs and the arteria aspera, if it burst in the chest; but if, at its origin, the blood is poured into the lower belly, so that the bowels float in it, when the patients die before the blood makes its appearance, the belly being filled with blood.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Inflammation likewise forms about the vein, and it, also, proves fatal, if it be great; for there is an acrid and pungent heat enclosed in the cavities of both, but little surpassing what is natural, so that to the touch the heat appears to be slight; but the patient fancies himself burning hot; pulse small, very frequent, so as to appear compressed and forcibly accelerated; <pb n="281"/>  coldness of the extremities; intense thirst; dryness of the mouth; redness of countenance, along with paleness; he is reddish over the whole body; hypochondriac region hard, and retracted upwards; pain principally on the right side, and palpitation therein, extending to the flanks; and in certain cases, also, of the artery along the spine, provided the pulsation displays itself in the other hypochondriac region; for lying, as it does, on the left side, it sympathises with the other; the exhalation in the general system affording no relief, and not even making the skin soft, for it is dry, shrivelled, and rough; and more especially in the regions of the body where the bones are prominent, such as the back part of the elbow, the knees, or the knuckles. Sleep disturbed; the bowels, in certain cases, discharging nothing, and in others, the discharges small, acrid, bilious; urine, a bright yellow and pungent; not disordered, indeed, in mind, but they are torpid and wasted. Hence, those who have seen this constitution of disease have called it Causus, for the present symptoms are those of a species of Causus; and in autumn there is a tendency to malignity, both in adults and the young, in whom the habit of body is slender, from bad diet and hard labour. These, for the most part, die on the fourteenth day; but when the disease is protracted, they die in double that period. But those who either originally have a slight inflammation, or when a great inflammation is gradually resolved, escape the disease indeed, but never get rid of the mischief; for they labour under causus a long time. But the dangerous symptoms cease, namely, the pains, distension of the hypochondria, the bad pulse, and torpor of the intellect; but still they have nausea, are ill at ease, with distress of mind; and, moreover, these are attended with an accession of causus and thirst, dryness of the tongue and mouth; they inspire largely, drawing in a long and copious breath, as if wishing to draw in the whole atmosphere, for the purpose of refrigeration. And if they drink a large draught of cold water, they are <pb n="282"/>  relieved, indeed, for a short time; but then again the thirst is kindled up, and again they drink copiously. And this is the successive course of the malady. And a good physician would give with impunity a copious cold draught, as in other species of causus, and even with less risk, in the case of those labouring under causus from disease of the <emph rend="italic">vena cava.</emph> And if either the bowels or the bladder carry off the drink, there is no necessity for inducing vomiting; but if not, after much cold drink much vomiting must be induced. For the patient would burst, if, after drinking so much, he should have no discharges by sweating, by urine, or by the bowels.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)"> THE kidneys, as far as regards the peculiar structure of the organ, are not productive of any great danger, even if they should suffer acutely; for, being of a glandular nature, they are mild and do not experience deadly diseases. But their office is important, namely, the secretion of the urine from the blood, and its expulsion.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> It is stopped either by a stone, or an inflammation arising there, or a clot of blood, or something such; when no mischief arises from sympathy, owing to the peculiar nature of the organ affected, but the retention of the urine produces all sorts of dreadful symptoms. Heat, which is acrid, and induces nausea; a heavy pain along the spine at the loins; distention of the parts, especially of those about the hypochondrium; suppression of urine, not entirely, but they pass urine in drops, and have a desire to pass more, for there is the sensation of an overflow. But if the urine become acrid and pungent, coldness, tremblings, spasms, distention and fulness of the hypochondria <pb n="283"/>  supervene. This miserable state and the conjoined feeling become similar to that of tympanites produced by indigestion, from the taking of too much food. Pulse, at first, indeed, slow and languid; but, if the evil press harder, small, frequent, tumultuous, and irregular: sleep slight, painful, not continued; and suddenly starting up as if from the stroke of a sharp instrument, they fall over again into a deep sleep as if from fatigue: they are not much deranged in intellect, but talk incoherently; the countenance livid. But if the desire of making water return again, the patients pass a small quantity in drops, along with spasms and great pains, when, for a short time, they are relieved from their sufferings, and again they experience a relapse. Of those that die, they sink most quickly who pass no urine; but the greater part recover, either from the stone dropping down into the bladder along with the urine, or from the inflammation being converted into pus, or from being gradually dispelled. For, if the urine pass easily even in small quantity, they escape death; but for a length of time they waste in constitution; the patients undergo these sufferings while still able to keep up, but gradually fall into a state of consumption. The same seasons, places, and ages induce these affections as induce those in connection with the venæ cavæ.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Sometimes blood bursts from the kidneys suddenly in large quantity, and flows continuously for many days. None, however, die from the hemorrhage itself, but from the inflammation accompanying the hemorrhage, if the bleeding is stopped; but most frequently they die of strong inflammation induced by the stoppage.</p> </div> <pb n="284"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:2" n="10"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER X. ON THE ACUTE AFFECTIONS ABOUT THE BLADDER</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> THE bladder is a dangerous part to suffer in acute diseases, even when it merely sympathizes with other parts; but more dangerous and fatal if the affection begin with itself; for it is very potent to make the other parts sympathise with it, as the nerves and the understanding: for the bladder is a cold and white nerve, at a very great distance from the innate heat, but very near the external cold: for it is situated in the lowest part of the belly, at the greatest distance from the chest. But, also, its office is of vital importance, namely, the passage of the urine.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Even, then, when the passage is only stopped by stones, or clots, or from any native or foreign mischief, it is of a deadly nature. In women, the phlegmonous tumour of the uterus may compress it; and in men, the straight intestine at the end bowels, called the Rectum. In many cases, too, owing to involuntary restraint from modesty in assemblies and at banquets, being filled it becomes distended; and, from the loss of its contractile power, it no longer evacuates the urine. When, then, the urine is stopped, there is fulness of the parts above, namely, the kidneys; distension of the ureters, grievous pain of the loins, spasms, tremblings, rigors, alienation of mind. But if it suffer from an ulcer or inflammation, there are, indeed, many bad symptoms; but death from the ulcers is by far the most speedy. With regard, however, to the ulceration and purulent abscess, and those other affections which are not very acute, they will be treated of among the chronic diseases; but such as are acute, and prove fatal in fourteen days, or a little earlier or later, such as inflammation, thrombus, or a stone falling down to the neck of the bladder, of these I will now treat. If, therefore, any of these occur, there is retention <pb n="285"/>  of urine; swelling in the hypogastric region; acute pain all over the abdomen; distension of the bladder; a sallow sweat on the tenth day; vomitings of phlegm, then of bile; coldness of the whole body, but especially of the feet: but, if the mischief spread farther, there come on fevers attended with hiccup, pulse irregularly frequent and small, redness of the countenance, thirst, distress of mind, delirium, spasms. From deleterious substances, such as cantharides and buprestis, both the bladder is distended with flatus, and the whole belly suffers violence; and all things get worse, and death cannot be long delayed.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The bladder also sometimes suffers from hemorrhage; the blood there is bright and thin, but the patients never die from it, although it may not be easy to stop. But from the clots and the inflammation there is danger; for the coldness, mortification, gangrene, and the other evils consequent upon it readily prove fatal.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> Winter and autumn bring on these diseases. As to age, manhood, but still more old age. The other seasons and periods of life do not generally produce the diseases, and they very rarely prove fatal. Of all others, infants are most free from danger.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0719.tlg001.perseus-eng2:2" n="11"> <head rend="align(center)">CHAPTER XI. ON HYSTERICAL SUFFOCATION</head> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> IN the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb, a female viscus, closely resembling an animal; for it is moved of itself hither and thither in the flanks, also upwards in a direct line to below the cartilage of the thorax, and also obliquely to the right or to the left, either to the liver or spleen; and it likewise is subject to prolapsus downwards, and, in a word, it is <pb n="286"/>  altogether erratic. It delights, also, in fragrant smells, and advances towards them; and it has an aversion to fetid smells, and flees from them; and, on the whole, the womb is like an animal within an animal.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> When, therefore, it is suddenly carried upwards, and remains above for a considerable time, and violently compresses the intestines, the woman experiences a choking, after the form of epilepsy, but without convulsions. For the liver, diaphragm, lungs and heart, are quickly squeezed within a narrow space; and therefore loss of breathing and of speech seems to be present. And, moreover, the carotids are compressed from sympathy with the heart, and hence there is heaviness of head, loss of sensibility, and deep sleep.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> And in women there also arises another affection resembling this form, with sense of choking and loss of speech, but not proceeding from the womb; for it also happens to men, in the manner of <emph rend="italic">catochus.</emph> But those from the uterus are remedied by fetid smells, and the application of fragrant things to the female parts; but in the others these things do no good; and the limbs are moved about in the affection from the womb, but in the other affection not at all. Moreover, voluntary and involuntary tremblings . . . . . . . . . . . but from the application of a pessary to induce abortion, powerful congelation of the womb, the stoppage of a copious hemorrhage, and such like.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> If, therefore, upon the womb’s being moved upwards, she begin to suffer, there is sluggishness in the performance of her offices, prostration of strength, atony, loss of the faculties of her knees, vertigo, and the limbs sink under her; headache, heaviness of the head, and the woman is pained in the veins on each side of the nose.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if they fall down they have heartburn . . . . . in the hypochondriac regions; flanks empty, where is the seat of the womb; pulse intermittent, irregular, and failing; strong sense <pb n="287"/>  of choking; loss of speech and of sensibility; respiration imperceptible and indistinct; a very sudden and incredible death, for they have nothing deadly in their appearance; in colour like that of life, and for a considerable time after death they are more ruddy than usual; eyes somewhat prominent, bright, not entirely fixed, but yet not very much turned aside.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the uterus be removed back to its seat before the affection come to a conclusion, they escape the suffocation. When the belly rumbles there is moisture about the female parts, respiration thicker and more distinct, a very speedy rousing up from the affection, in like manner as death is very sudden; for as it readily ascends to the higher regions, so it readily recedes. For the uterus is buoyant, but the membranes, its supporters, are humid, and the place is humid in which the uterus lies; and, moreover, it flees from fetid things, and seeks after sweet: wherefore it readily inclines to this side and to that, like a log of wood, and floats upwards and downwards. For this reason the affection occurs in young women, but not in old. For in those in whom the age, mode of life, and understanding is more mobile, the uterus also is of a wandering nature; but in those more advanced in life, the age, mode of living, understanding, and the uterus are of a steady character. Wherefore this suffocation from the womb accompanies females alone.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But the affections common to men happen also to the uterus, such as inflammation and hemorrhage, and they have the common symptoms; namely, fever, asphexy, coldness, loss of speech. But in hemorrhage the death is even more sudden, being like that of a slaughtered animal.</p> </div> <pb n="288"/>

<p rend="align(indent)"> THE Satyrs, sacred to Bacchus, in the paintings and statues, have the member erect, as the symbol of the divine performance. It is also a form of disease, in which the patient has erection of the genital organ, the appellation of Satyriasis being derived from its resemblance to the figure of the god.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> It is an unrestrainable impulse to connection; but neither are they at all relieved by these embraces, nor is the tentigo soothed by many and repeated acts of sexual intercourse. Spasms of all the nerves, and tension of all the tendons, groins, and perineum, inflammation and pain of the genital parts, redness of countenance, and a dewy moisture. Wrapped up in silent sorrow, they are stupid, as if grievously afflicted with their calamity. But if the affection overcome the patient’s sense of shame, he will lose all restraint of tongue as regards obscenity, and likewise all restraint in regard to the open performance of the act, being deranged in understanding as to indecency; for they cannot restrain themselves, are thirsty, and vomit much phlegm. Afterwards, froth settles on their lips, as is the case with goats in the season of rutting, and the smell likewise is similar. The urine, after long retention, is white, thick, and like semen; bowels constipated; spontaneous titillations of the sides and arm-pits; they have convulsions, loathe food, or, if presented to them, they snatch it confusedly.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> But if the illness tend to death, they become flatulent, belly protuberant, tension of the tendons and of all the muscles, difficulty of movement, contraction of the limbs, pulse small, weak, and irregular.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> All these symptoms have been sometimes removed by copious discharges from the bowels of phlegm and bile, and by <pb n="289"/>  vomiting in like manner, not without danger. The proper cure is deep and very protracted sleep; for much sleep induces coldness, paralysis, and torpor of the nerves; and torpidity and refrigeration cure Satyriasis.</p> 
<p rend="align(indent)"> The affection, for the most part, is formed in spring and summer. Of the periods of life, it occurs principally in boys and striplings, more especially in such as are naturally prone to sexual intercourse. It is a most acute, disgusting, and unseemly ailment. For the most part, the patients die on the seventh day. It is said, that women also suffer from this affection; that they have the same impulse to venery, and the other symptoms the same. I believe, indeed, that lust is engendered in women of a humid temperament, so as to induce a copious discharge of the superfluous humours; but I do not at all believe that they are affected with Satyriasis, for their nature, being cold, is not adapted to it. But neither, also, has woman the parts necessary for erection, like those of a Satyr, whence the affection derives its name; and neither also are men subject to suffocation from the womb, because men have not an uterus.</p> <pb/> </div> </div></div> </body>
