					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and
						pray them to grant you the thoughts, words and deeds likely to render your
						command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends and
						your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>Having gained the goodwill of the gods, you have then to recruit a sufficient
						number of mounted men that you may bring the number up to the total required
						by the law,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">1,000; but, as we shall see,
							the number had fallen to something like 650 at the time Xenophon
							wrote.</note> and also may prevent any decrease in the cavalry
						establishment. Unless additional recruits are enrolled in the force, the
						number will constantly dwindle, for some men are bound to retire through old
						age and others to drop off for various reasons. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the ranks are filling up, you must see
						that the horses get enough food to stand hard work, since horses unfit for
						their work can neither overtake nor escape. You must see that they are
						docile, because disobedient animals assist the enemy more than their own
						side. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p>And horses that kick when mounted must be got rid of, for such brutes often
						do more mischief than the enemy. You must also look after their feet, so
						that they can be ridden on rough ground, for you know that wherever
						galloping is painful to them, they are useless. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having made sure that the horses are in good
						condition, the next business is to train the men. First they must learn to
						mount from the spring,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A difficult feat,
							since the Greek rider had no stirrups.</note> since many before now have
						owed their lives to that. Secondly, they must practise riding over all sorts
						of ground, since any kind of country may become the area of war. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>As soon as they have acquired a firm seat, your next task is to take steps
						that as many as possible shall be able to throw the javelin when
							mounted<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">When attacking infantry in line
							the cavalry never charged home; but only approached near enough to throw
							the javelin with effect. Hence the importance attached to an
							accomplishment by no means easy to perform without stirrups. See
							especially <title>On Horsemanship</title> chap. 12.</note> and shall
						become efficient in all the details of horsemanship.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After that both horses and men must be armed,
						so that, while they are themselves thoroughly protected against wounds, they
						may have the means of inflicting the greatest loss on the enemy. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p>Then you must contrive to make the men obedient: otherwise neither good
						horses nor a firm seat nor fine armour are of any use.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For ensuring efficiency in all these matters
						the cavalry commander, as a matter of course, is the principal authority.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p>But, at the same time, the state thinks it difficult for the cavalry
						commander to carry out all these duties single-handed; therefore, it also
						elects colonels of regiments to assist him; and it has charged the Council
						with the duty of taking a share in the management of the cavalry. I think it
						well, then, that you should encourage the colonels to be as eager as
						yourself for the efficiency of the cavalry, and should have suitable
						spokesmen in the Council, that their speeches may alarm the men—they will do
						better under the influence of fear—and may also appease the wrath of the
						Council, in case it shows indignation at the wrong time. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here, then, you have brief notes on the
						matters that demand your attention. I will now try to explain how these
						duties may best be carried out in detail.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the men, you must obviously raise them
						as required by the law, from among those who are most highly qualified by
						wealth and bodily vigour, either by obtaining an order of the court or by
						the use of persuasion. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p>The cases that should be brought before the court, I think, are those of men
						who otherwise might be suspected of having bribed you not to apply for a
						judgment. For the smaller men will at once have a ground for escaping,
						unless you first compel the most highly qualified to serve. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p>I think, too, that, by dwelling on the brilliancy of horsemanship, you might
						fire some of the young men with ambition to serve in the cavalry, and that
						you might overcome the opposition of their guardians by informing them that
						they will be required to keep horses by someone, if not by you, on account
						of their wealth; whereas, if their </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p>boys join up during your command, you will put an end to their extravagance
						in buying expensive horses, and see that they soon make good riders. And you
						must try to suit your actions to your words. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the existing cavalry, I think that the
						Council should give notice that in future double the amount of exercise will
						be required, and that any horse unable to keep up will be rejected. This
						warning would put the screw on the men and make them feed their horses
						better and take more care of them. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<p>I think it would be well, too, if notice were given that vicious horses would
						be rejected. Under the stimulus of this threat men would break in such
						animals more thoroughly and would be more careful in buying horses. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
					<p>Again, it would be well to give notice that horses found kicking at exercise
						will be rejected. For it is impossible even to keep such animals in line; in
						a charge against an enemy they are bound to lag behind, and the consequence
						is, that through the bad behaviour of his horse, the man himself becomes
						useless. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For getting horses’ feet into the best condition,<note
								resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Horse-shoes being unknown; cf. <title>On
									Horsemanship</title> chap 4.</note> if anyone has an easier and
							cheaper method than mine, by all means adopt it. If not, I hold—and I
							speak from experience—that the right way is to throw down some stones
							from the road, averaging about a pound in weight, and to curry the horse
							on these and to make him stand on them whenever he goes out of the
							stable. For the horse will constantly use his feet on the stones when he
							is cleaned and when he is worried by flies. Try it, and you will find
							your horses’ feet round, and will believe in the rest of my rules. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Assuming that the horses are in good
						condition, I will explain how to make the men themselves thoroughly
						efficient.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We would persuade the young recruits to learn
						for themselves how to mount from the spring; but if you provide an
						instructor, you will receive well-merited praise. The way to help the older
						men is to accustom them to get a leg-up in the Persian fashion. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To ensure that the men have a firm seat,
						whatever the nature of the ground, it is, perhaps, too much trouble to have
						them out frequently when there is no war going on; but you should call the
						men together, and recommend them to practise turning off the roads and
						galloping over all sorts of ground when they are riding to quarters or any
						other place. For this does as much good as taking them out, and it is less
						tedious. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
					<p>It is useful to remind them that the state supports an expenditure of nearly forty
								talents<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Say 9,500 pounds as
								reckoned about the year <date when="1925">1925</date>. The pay is,
								of course, alluded to. The expenditure would amount daily to nearly
								666 drachmae. The cavalryman’s normal pay was a drachma a day. Hence
								it looks as if the number of the cavalry in <date when="-0365"
									>365</date> B.C. had fallen to about 650.</note> a year in order
							that she may not have to look about for cavalry in the event of war, but
							may have it ready for immediate use. For with this thought in their
							minds the men are likely to take more pains with their horsemanship, so
							that when war breaks out they may not have to fight untrained for the
							state, for glory and for life. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
					<p>It is well also to give notice to the men that you intend to take them out
						yourself some day, and lead them over country of all kinds. And during the
						manoeuvres that precede the sham fight it is proper to take them out to a
						different piece of country at different times: this is better for both men
						and horses. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for throwing the javelin on horseback,<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">At a suspended shield.</note> I think that
						the greatest number will practise that if you add a warning to the colonels
						that they will be required to ride to javelin exercise themselves at the
						head of the marksmen of the regiment. Thus, in all probability, everyone of
						them will be eager to turn out as many marksmen as possible for the service
						of the state. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Towards the proper arming of the men, I think
						that the greatest amount of assistance will be obtained from the colonels,
						if they are persuaded that from the point of view of the state the
						brilliance of the regiment is a far more glorious ornament to them than the
						brightness of their own accoutrements only. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
					<p>It is likely that they will not be hard to persuade in such matters,
						considering that honour and glory were the attractions that the colonelcy
						held out to them, and they can arm the men in accordance with the
						regulations laid down in the law without incurring expense themselves,
						afterwards compelling the men to spend their pay on their arms, as the law
							ordains.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The reference is first to the
							<q type="soCalled">establishment money</q> for horse and equipment, due to recruits when they
							had passed the examination by the Council. There is another allusion to
							it in 9.5. This sum is independent of the pay; and it is probable that
							on leaving the service the cavalryman had to refund it.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To make the men who are under your command
						obedient, it is important to impress on them by word of mouth the many
						advantages of obedience to authority, and no less important to see that good
						discipline brings gain and insubordination loss in every respect. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The best way of inducing every colonel to take
						pride in commanding a well equipped regiment, I think, is to arm your
						company of couriers as well as you can, to demand of them constant practice
						in the use of the javelin, and to instruct them in it after making yourself
						proficient. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
					<p>And if you could offer prizes to the regiments for skill in all the feats
						that the public expects the cavalry to perform at the spectacles, I think
						this would appeal strongly to the spirit of emulation in every Athenian. For
						evidence of this I may refer to the choruses, in which many labours and
						heavy expenses are the price paid for trifling rewards. Only you must find
						judges whose suffrage will shed lustre on a victory. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When your men are well trained in all these
						points, they must, of course, understand some plan of formation, that in
						which they will show to greatest advantage in the sacred processions and at
						manoeuvres, fight, if need be, with the greatest courage, and move along
						roads and cross rivers with perfect ease in unbroken order. So I will now
						try to explain the formation that I think will give the best results in
						these various circumstances. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the state has divided the cavalry into ten
						separate regiments. I hold that within these you should, to begin with,
						appoint file-leaders<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="soCalled">Decadarchs,</q>
							commanding a file of ten <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκάς</foreign>. X.
							had in mind the organisation of the Spartan infantry; cp.
								<title>Constitution of the Lac.</title> 11.5.</note> after
						consulting each of the colonels, choosing sturdy men, who are bent on
						winning fame by some brilliant deed. These should form the front rank. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p>Next you should choose an equal number of the oldest and most sensible to
						form the rear rank. To use an illustration, steel has most power to cut
						through steel when its edge is keen and its back reliable. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To fill the ranks between the front and rear,
						the file-leaders should choose the men to form the second line, and these in
						turn the men to form the third, and so on throughout. In this way every man
						will naturally have complete confidence in the man behind him. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You must be very careful to appoint a
						competent man as leader in the rear.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e.,
							the last man of each file, cf. 3, who in some cases would have to act as
							leader. In the Spartan infantry he was the man with the longest service
							in the file.</note> For if he is a good man, his cheers will always
						hearten the ranks in front of him in case it becomes necessary to charge;
						or, should the moment come to retreat, his prudent leadership will, in all
						probability, do much for the safety of his regiment. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>An even number of file-leaders has this
						advantage over an odd, that it is possible to divide the regiment into a
						larger number of equal parts.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The reasons why I like this formation are
						these. In the first place, all the men in the front rank are officers; and
						the obligation to distinguish themselves appeals more strongly to men when
						they are officers than when they are privates. Secondly, when anything has
						to be done, the word of command is much more effective if it is passed to
						officers rather than to privates. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let us assume that this formation has been
						adopted: every file-leader must know his position in the line of march by
						word passed along by the colonel, just as every colonel is informed by the
						commander of his proper place in the charge. For when these instructions are
						given there will be much better order than if the men hamper one another
						like a crowd leaving the theatre. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p>And in the event of a frontal attack, the men in the van are far more willing
						to fight when they know that this is their station; so is the rear-rank in
						the event of a surprise attack in the rear, when the men there understand
						that it is disgraceful to leave their post. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p>But if no order is kept there is confusion whenever the roads are narrow or
						rivers are being crossed; and when an action is fought no one voluntarily
						takes his post in the fighting line.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All these preliminaries must be thoroughly
						mastered by all the cavalry, if they are to give their leader unflinching
						support. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now we come to duties that the cavalry
						commander must perform himself. First, he must sacrifice to propitiate the
						gods on behalf of the cavalry; secondly, he must make the processions during
						the festivals worth seeing; further, he must conduct all the other
						obligatory displays before the people with as much splendour as possible,
						that is to say, the reviews in the Academy, in the Lyceum, at Phalerum, and
						in the Hippodrome.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Nothing in the sequel
							refers to manoeuvres at Phalerum; accordingly it has been proposed to
							omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὰ Φαληροῖ</foreign> as spurious.
							The Hippodrome was probably in the N.W. district of the <placeName
								key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>. This treatise gives the
							only information that we possess about these functions.</note></p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These again are only brief notes; and I will
						now explain exactly how the details of these various functions may be
						carried out with most splendour. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the processions, I think they would be
						most acceptable both to the gods and to the spectators if they included a
						gala ride in the market place. The starting point would be the Herms<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Herms stood in two rows between the
							<q type="soCalled">Stoa Basileios</q> and the 
							<q type="soCalled">Poicile.</q> The Eleusinium, probably lay at the
							western foot of the Acropolis. See Frazer, <title>Pausanias</title> vol.
							2., p. 121 and p. 131. Some think the site was at the east foot.</note>;
						and the cavalry would ride round saluting the gods at their shrines and
						statues. So at the Great Dionysia the dance of the choruses forms part of
						the homage offered to the Twelve and to other gods.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the circuit is completed and the
						cavalcade is again near the Herms, the next thing to do, I think, is to
						gallop at top speed by regiments as far as the Eleusinium. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p>I will add a word on the position in which the lances should be held to prevent crossing.
							Every man should point his lance between his horse’s ears, if the
							weapons are to look fearsome, stand out distinctly, and at the same time
							to convey the impression of numbers. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The gallop finished and the goal reached, the
						right plan is to ride back to the temples by the same route, but at a slow
						pace: thus every effect that can be obtained from a horse with a man on his
							back<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Greek text is unreliable
							here.</note> will be included in the display, to the satisfaction of
						gods and men alike. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I know that our cavalrymen are not accustomed
						to these movements: but I am sure that they are desirable and beautiful, and
						will delight the spectators. I am aware, too, that the cavalry have
						exhibited other novel feats of skill in days when the cavalry commanders had
						sufficient influence to get their wishes carried out. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>During the parade at the Lyceum, before the
						javelin-throwing, the right way is to ride in two divisions in line of
						battle, each division consisting of five regiments with its commander at the
						head and the colonels; and the line should be so extended that the whole
						breadth of the course will be covered. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p>As soon as they reach the highest point looking down on the Theatre opposite,<note
								resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Theatre of Dionysus, facing them as
								they come westwards from the Lyceum.</note> I think it would clearly
							be useful if you displayed your men’s ability to gallop downhill in
							fairly large companies. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p>To be sure, I know well enough that, if they feel confident of their ability
						to gallop, they will welcome the opportunity of showing off their skill: but
						you must see that they are not short of practice, or the enemy will compel
						them to do it against their will. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The formation that would add most to the
						beauty of the exercises at the inspections<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
							>The allusion is not to the inspection of recruits by the Council, but
							to the manoeuvres enumerated in 3.l. The formation is that proposed in
							2.</note> has already been explained. Provided his horse is strong
						enough, the leader should ride round with the file that is on the outside
						every time. He will be galloping all the time himself, and the file whose
						turn it is to be on the outside with him will also be galloping. Thus the
						eyes of the Council will always be on the galloping file, and the horses
						will get a breathing space, resting by turns.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">As it is not known precisely what evolutions took place
							at the displays, it is impossible to make out what changes Xenophon
							proposes.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Hippodrome is the scene of the
						display, the right plan would be that the men should first be drawn up on a
						front broad enough to fill the Hippodrome with horses and drive out the
						people standing there. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p>In the sham fight when the regiments pursue and fly from one another at the
						gallop in two squadrons of five regiments, each side led by its commander,
						the regiments should ride through one another. How formidable they will look
						when they charge front to front; how imposing when, after sweeping across
						the Hippodrome, they stand facing one another again; how splendid, when the
						trumpet sounds and they charge once more at a quicker pace! </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p>After the halt, the trumpet should sound once more, and they should charge
						yet a third time at top speed; and when they have crossed, they should all
						range themselves in battle line preparatory to being dismissed, and ride up
						to the Council, just as you are accustomed to do. </p>
				</div>

						another error. Some men, when they suppose themselves to be stronger than
						the enemy whom they are going to attack, take an utterly inadequate force
						with them.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Hellenica</title>
							6.5.51.</note> The consequence is that they are apt to incur the loss
						they expected to inflict. Or, when they know themselves to be weaker than
						the enemy, they use all their available strength in the attack. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p>The right procedure, in my opinion, is just the opposite: when the commander
						expects to win, he should not hesitate to use the whole of his strength: for
						an overwhelming victory never yet was followed by remorse. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p>But when he tries conclusions with a much stronger force, knowing beforehand
						that he is bound to retreat when he has done his best, I hold that it is far
						better in such a case to throw a small part of his strength into the attack
						than the whole of it; only horses and men alike should be his very best. For
						such a force will be able to achieve something and to retreat with less
						risk. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p>But when he has thrown the whole of his strength into an attack on a stronger
						force, and wants to retire, the men on the slowest mounts are bound to be
						taken prisoners; others to be thrown through lack of horsemanship; and
						others to be cut off owing to inequalities in the ground, since it is hard
						to find a wide expanse of country entirely to your liking. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<p>Moreover, owing to their numbers they will collide and hinder and hurt one
						another frequently. But good horses and men will contrive to escape,
						especially if you manage to scare the pursuers by using your reserves. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
					<p>Sham ambuscades, too, are helpful for this purpose. It is also useful to
						discover on what quarter your friends may suddenly reveal themselves in a
						safe position and make the pursuit slower. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
					<p>Then again it is obvious that in point of endurance and speed the advantage is much more
							likely to rest with a small than with a large force. I do not mean that
							mere paucity of numbers will increase the men’s powers of endurance and
							add to their speed; but it is easier to find few men than many who will
							take proper care of their horses and will practise the art of
							horsemanship intelligently on their own account. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Should it happen at any time that the cavalry
						forces engaged are about equal, I think it would be a good plan to split
						each regiment into two divisions, putting one under the command of the
						colonel, and the other under the best man available. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
					<p>The latter would follow in the rear of the colonel’s division for a time; but presently,
							when the adversary is near, he would wheel on receiving the order and
							charge. This plan, I think, would make the blow delivered by the
							regiment more stunning and more difficult to parry. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
					<p>Both divisions should have an infantry contingent; and if the infantry,
						hidden away behind the cavalry, came out suddenly and went for the enemy, I
						think they would prove an important factor in making the victory more
						decisive; for I have noticed that a surprise cheers men up if it is
						pleasant, but stuns them if it is alarming. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
					<p>Anyone will recognise the truth of this who reflects that, however great
						their advantage in numbers, men are dazed when they fall into an ambuscade,
						and that two hostile armies confronting each other are scared out of their
						wits for the first few days. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is no difficulty in adopting these
						tactics; but only a good cavalry commander can find men who will show
						intelligence, reliability and courage in wheeling to charge the enemy. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
					<p>For the commander must be capable both by his words and action of making the
						men under him realize that it is good to obey, to back up their leader, and
						to charge home; of firing them with a desire to win commendation; and of
						enabling them to carry out their intentions with persistence. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Suppose now that the cavalry are busy in the no-man’s-land
							that separates two battle lines drawn up face to face or two strategic
							positions, wheeling, pursuing and retreating. After such manoeuvres both
							sides usually start off at a slow pace, but gallop at full speed in the
							unoccupied ground. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
					<p>But if a commander first feints in this manner, and then after wheeling, pursues and
							retreats at the gallop he will be able to inflict the greatest loss on
							the enemy, and will probably come through with the least harm, by
							pursuing at the gallop so long as he is near his own defence, and
							retreating at the gallop from the enemy’s defences. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
					<p>If, moreover, he can secretly leave behind him four or five of the best
						horses and men in each division, they will be at a great advantage in

						no more possible than to know everything that is going to happen. </p>

				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>The most important of all my hints, I think, is this: Whatever you decide to be best, see
