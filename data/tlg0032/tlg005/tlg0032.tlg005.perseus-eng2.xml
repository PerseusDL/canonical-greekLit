                    indicted, deliberated on his defence and on his end. It is true that others have
                    written about this, and that all of them have reproduced the loftiness of his
                    words,—a fact which proves that his utterance really was of the character
                    intimated;—but they have not shown clearly that he had now come to the
                    conclusion that for him death was more to be desired than life; and hence his
                    lofty utterance appears rather ill-considered. </p>

                    appropriate to the resolve he had made. For he stated that on seeing
                            <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> discussing any and
                    every subject rather than the trial, he had said: </p>

                    eloquent speech and have condemned innocent men to death, and often on the other
                    hand the guilty have been acquitted either because their plea aroused compassion
                    or because their speech was witty?</said> <said direct="true">Yes, indeed!</said> he had answered; <said direct="true">and I have
                    tried twice already to meditate on my defence, but my divine sign interposes.</said>

                    than I have up to now? For I have realized that my whole life has been spent in
                    righteousness toward God and man,—a fact that affords the greatest satisfaction;
                    and so I have felt a deep self-respect and have discovered that my associates

                            easiest. For if I am condemned now, it will clearly be my privilege to
                            suffer a death that is adjudged by those who have superintended this
                            matter to be not only the easiest but also the least irksome to one’s
                            friends and one that implants in them the deepest feeling of loss for
                            the dead. For when a person leaves behind in the hearts of his
                            companions no remembrance to cause a blush or a pang, but dissolution
                            comes while he still possesses a sound body and a spirit capable of
                            showing kindliness, how could such a one fail to be sorely

                            thus addressed him: ‘I am pondering whether to call you god or man.’ Now
                            Apollo did not compare me to a god; he did, however, judge that I far
                            excelled the rest of mankind. However, do not believe the god even in

                    in itself implied an acknowledgment of guilt. Then, when his companions wished
                    to remove him clandestinely from prison, he would not accompany them, but seemed
