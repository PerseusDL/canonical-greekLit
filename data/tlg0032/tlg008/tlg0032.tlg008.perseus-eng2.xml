					<p>Simonides, the poet, once paid a visit to Hiero, the despot. When both found
						time to spare, Simonides said: “Hiero, will you please explain something to
						me that you probably know better than I?”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“And pray what is it,” said Hiero, “that I can know better than one so wise
						as yourself?” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“I know you were born a private citizen,” he answered, “and are now a despot.
						Therefore, as you have experienced both fortunes, you probably know better
						than I how the lives of the despot and the citizen differ as regards the
						joys and sorrows that fall to man's lot.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="3">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Surely,” said Hiero, “seeing that you are still a private citizen, it is for
						you to remind me of what happens in a citizen's life; and then, I think, I
						could best show you the differences between the two.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Well,” said Simonides, taking the suggestion, “I think I have observed that
						sights affect private citizens with pleasure and pain through the eyes,
						sounds through the ears, smells through the nostrils, meat and drink through
						the mouth, carnal appetites—of course we all know how. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>In the case of cold and heat, things hard and soft, light and heavy, our
						sensations of pleasure and pain depend on the whole body, I think. In good
						and evil we seem to feel pleasure or pain, as the case may be—sometimes
						through the instrumentality of the moral being only, at other times through
						that of the moral and the physical being together. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>Sleep, it seems clear to me, affects us with pleasure; but how and by what
						means and when are puzzles that I feel less able to solve. And perhaps it is
						no matter for surprise if our sensations are clearer when we are awake than
						when we are asleep.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“For my part, Simonides,” said Hiero in answer to this, “I cannot say how a
						despot could have any sensations apart from those you have mentioned. So
						far, therefore, I fail to see that the despot's life differs in any respect
						from the citizen's.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“In this respect it does differ,” said Simonides: “the pleasures it
						experiences by means of these various organs are infinitely greater in
						number, and the pains it undergoes are far fewer.”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“It is not so, Simonides,” retorted Hiero; “I assure you far fewer pleasures
						fall to despots than to citizens of modest means, and many more and much
						greater pains.”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Incredible!” exclaimed Simonides. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<p>“Were it so, how should a despot's throne be an object of desire to many,
						even of those who are reputed to be men of ample means? And how should all
						the world envy despots?” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“For this reason of course,” said Hiero, “that they speculate on the subject
						without experience of both estates. But I will try to show you that I am
						speaking the truth, beginning with the sense of sight. That was your first
						point, if I am not mistaken. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="11">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“In the first place, then, taking the objects that we perceive by means of
						vision, I find by calculation that in regard to sight-seeing, despots are
						worse off. In every land there are things worth seeing: and in search of
						these private citizens visit any city they choose, and attend the national
						festivals, where all things reputed to be most worth seeing are assembled.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="12">
					<p>But despots are not at all concerned with missions to shows. For it is risky
						for them to go where they will be no stronger than the crowd, and their
						property at home is too insecure to be left in charge of others while they
						are abroad. For they fear to lose their throne, and at the same time to be
						unable to take vengeance on the authors of the wrong. Perhaps you may say:
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="13">
					<p>`But, after all, such spectacles come to them even if they stay at home.' No,
						no, Simonides, only one in a hundred such; and what there are of them are
						offered to despots at a price so exorbitant that showmen who exhibit some
						trifle expect to leave the court in an hour with far more money than they
						get from all the rest of the world in a lifetime.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="14">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Ah,” said Simonides, “but if you are worse off in the matter of
						sight-seeing, the sense of hearing, you know, gives you the advantage.
						Praise, the sweetest of all sounds, is never lacking, for all your courtiers
						praise everything you do and every word you utter. Abuse, on the contrary,
						that most offensive of sounds, is never in your ears, for no one likes to
						speak evil of a despot in his presence.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="15">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“And what pleasure,” asked Hiero, “comes, do you suppose, of this shrinking
						from evil words, when one knows well that all harbour evil thoughts against
						the despot, in spite of their silence? Or what pleasure comes of this
						praise, do you think, when the praises sound suspiciously like flattery?”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="16">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Well yes,” replied Simonides, “in this of course I agree with you entirely,
						Hiero, that praise from the freest is sweetest. But this, now, you will not
						persuade anyone to believe, that the things which support human life do not
						yield you a far greater number of pleasures.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="17">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Yes, Simonides, and I know that the reason why most men judge that we have
						more enjoyment in eating and drinking than private citizens is this; they
						think that they themselves would find the dinner served at our table better
						eating than what they get. Anything, in fact, that is better than what they
						are accustomed to gives them pleasure. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="18">
					<p>This is why all men look forward to the festivals, except the despots. For
						their table is always laden with plenty, and admits of no extras on feast
						days. Here then is one pleasure in respect of which they are worse off than
						the private citizen, the pleasure of anticipation. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="19">
					<p>But further, your own experience tells you, I am sure, that the greater the
						number of superfluous dishes set before a man, the sooner a feeling of
						repletion comes over him; and so, as regards the duration of his pleasure
						too, the man who has many courses put before him is worse off than the
						moderate liver.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="20">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“But surely,” said Simonides, “so long as the appetite holds out, the man who
						dines at the costlier banquet has far more pleasure than he who is served
						with the cheaper meal.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="21">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Don't you think, Simonides, that the greater a man's pleasure in any
						occupation the stronger is his devotion to it?”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Certainly.”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Then do you notice that despots fall to their meal with any more zest than
						private persons to theirs?”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“No, no, of course not; I should rather say with more disgust, according to
						the common opinion.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="22">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Well now,” said Hiero, “have you observed all those pickles and sauces that
						are put before despots—acid, bitter, astringent and so forth?”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Yes, certainly; and very unnatural cates I think them for human beings.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="23">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Don't you look on these condiments, then, as mere fads of a jaded and
						pampered appetite? I know well enough, and I expect you know too, that
						hearty eaters have no need of these concoctions.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="24">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Well, I certainly think that those costly unguents with which you anoint
						your bodies afford more satisfaction to those who are near you than to
						yourselves, just as the man who has eaten rank food is less conscious of the
						disagreeable smell than those who come near him.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="25">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Quite so, and we may add that he who has all sorts of food at all times has
						no stomach for any sort. Offer a man a dish that he seldom tastes, and he
						eats a bellyful with gusto.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="26">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“It seems,” remarked Simonides, “as if the satisfaction of the sexual
						appetites were the only motive that produces in you the craving for
						despotism. For in this matter you are free to enjoy the fairest that meets
						your eye.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="27">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“I assure you that we are worse off than private citizens in the matter to
						which you now refer. First take marriage. It is commonly held that a
						marriage into a family of greater wealth and influence is most honourable,
						and is a source of pride and pleasure to the bridegroom. Next to that comes
						a marriage with equals. A marriage with inferiors is considered positively
						degrading and useless. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="28">
					<p>Now unless a despot marries a foreign girl, he is bound to marry beneath him;
						and so the thing to be desired does not come his way. And whereas it is
						exceedingly pleasant to receive the attentions of the proudest of ladies,
						the attentions of slaves are quite unappreciated when shown, and any little
						shortcomings produce grievous outbursts of anger and annoyance. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="29">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“In his relations with young boys, again, even much more than in his
						relations with women, the despot is at a disadvantage. We all know, I
						suppose, that passion increases the sweets of sex beyond measure. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="30">
					<p>Passion, however, is very shy of entering the heart of a despot, for passion
						is fain to desire not the easy prize, but the hoped-for joy. Therefore, just
						as a man who is a stranger to thirst can get no satisfaction out of
						drinking, so he who is a stranger to passion is a stranger to the sweetest
						pleasures of sex.” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="31">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>To this speech of Hiero's Simonides replied, laughing:</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“How say you, Hiero? You deny that love for boys springs up in a despot's
						heart? Then how about your passion for Dailochus, whom they call most fair?”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="32">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Why, Simonides, the explanation, of course, is this: I desire to get from
						him not what I may have, apparently, for the asking, but that which a despot
						should be the last to take. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="33">
					<p>The fact is, I desire of Dailochus just that which human nature, maybe,
						drives us to ask of the fair. But what I long to get, I very strongly desire
						to obtain by his goodwill, and with his consent; but I think I could sooner
						desire to do myself an injury than to take it from him by force. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="34">
					<p>For to take from an enemy against his will is, I think, the greatest of all
						pleasures, but favours from a loved one are very pleasant, I fancy, only
						when he consents. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="35">
					<p>For instance, if he is in sympathy with you, how pleasant are his looks, how
						pleasant his questions and his answers; how very pleasant and ravishing are
						the struggles and bickerings. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="36">
					<p>But to take advantage of a favourite against his will seems to me more like
						brigandage than love. Nay, your brigand finds some pleasure in his gain and
						in hurting his foe; but to feel pleasure in hurting one whom you love, to be
						hated for your affection, to disgust him by your touch, surely that is a
						mortifying experience and pitiful! </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="37">
					<p>The fact is, a private citizen has instant proof that any act of compliance
						on the part of his beloved is prompted by affection, since he knows that the
						service rendered is due to no compulsion; but the despot can never feel sure
						that he is loved. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="38">
					<p>For we know that acts of service prompted by fear copy as closely as possible
						the ministrations of affection. Indeed, even plots against despots as often
						as not are the work of those who profess the deepest affection for them.”
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="2">
				<div type="section" n="1">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>To this Simonides replied: “Well, the points that you raise seem to me mere
						trifles. For I notice that many respected men willingly go short in the
						matter of meat and drink and delicacies, and deliberately abstain from
						sexual indulgence. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">
					<p>But I will show you where you have a great advantage over private citizens.
						Your objects are vast, your attainment swift: you have luxuries in
						abundance: you own horses unequalled in excellence, arms unmatched in
						beauty, superb jewelry for women, stately houses full of costly furniture:
						moreover you have servants many in number and excellent in accomplishments
						and you are rich in power to harm enemies and reward friends.”</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>To this Hiero answered: </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>“Well, Simonides, that the multitude should be deceived by despotic power
						surprises me not at all, since the mob seems to guess wholly by appearances
						that one man is happy, another miserable. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<p>Despotism flaunts its seeming precious treasures outspread before the gaze of
						the world: but its troubles it keeps concealed in the heart of the despot,
						in the place where human happiness and unhappiness are stored away. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>That this escapes the observation of the multitude I say, I am not surprised.
						But what does seem surprising to me is that men like you, whose intelligence
						is supposed to give you a clearer view of most things than your eyes, should
						be equally blind to it. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>But I know well enough by experience, Simonides, and I tell you that despots
						get the smallest share of the greatest blessings, and have most of the
						greatest evils. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>Thus, for instance, if peace is held to be a greatest blessing to mankind,
						very little of it falls to the share of despots: if war is a great evil, of
						that despots receive the largest share. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>To begin with, so long as their state is not engaged in a war in which all
						take part, private citizens are free to go wherever they choose without fear
						of being killed. But all despots move everywhere as in an enemy's country;
						at any rate they think they are bound to wear arms continually themselves,
						and to take an armed escort about with them at all times. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“Secondly, in the event of an expedition against an enemy's country, private
						citizens at least think themselves safe as soon as they have come home. But
						when despots reach their own city, they know that they are now among more
						enemies than ever. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<p>Again, suppose that strangers invade their city in superior force; true, the
						weaker are conscious of danger while they are outside the walls; yet once
						they are inside the fortress, all feel themselves bestowed in safety. But
						the despot is not out of danger even when he passes within the palace gates;
						nay, it is just there that he thinks he must walk most warily. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="11">
					<p>Once again, to private citizens a truce or peace brings rest from war; but
						despots are never at peace with the people subject to their despotism, and
						no truce can ever make a despot confident. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="12">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“There are, of course, wars that are waged by states against one another, and
						wars waged by the despot against his oppressed subjects. Now the hardships
						incidental to these wars that fall on the citizen fall also on the despot.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="13">
					<p>For both must wear arms, be watchful, run risks; and the sting of a defeat is
						felt by both alike. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="14">
					<p>So far, then, both are equally affected by wars. But the joys that fall to
						the citizens of states at war are not experienced by despots.<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">I.e., in the wars that he wages against his
							subjects. The whole of this paragraph is obscurely expressed and highly
							artificial; and it has been variously interpreted. The text also is
							uncertain.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="15">
					<p>For, you know, when states defeat their foes in a battle, words fail one to
						describe the joy they feel in the rout of the enemy, in the pursuit, in the
						slaughter of the enemy. What transports of triumphant pride! What a halo of
						glory about them! What comfort to think that they have exalted their city!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="16">
					<p>Everyone is crying: `I had a share in the plan, I killed most'; and it's hard
						to find where they don't revel in falsehood, claiming to have killed more
						than all that were really slain. So glorious it seems to them to have won a
						great victory! </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="17">
					<p>But when a despot harbours suspicion, and, well aware that opposition is on
						foot, puts the conspirators to death, he knows that he does not exalt the
						city as a whole; he understands that the number of his subjects will be
						less; he cannot look cheerful; nor does he boast himself of his achievement;
						nay, he belittles the occurrence as much as possible, and explains, while he
						is at the work, that there is nothing wrong in what he has done, so far are
						his deeds from seeming honourable even to himself. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="18">
					<p>Even the death of those whom he feared does not restore him to confidence; he
						is yet more on his guard afterwards than before. And now I have shown you
						the kind of war that a despot wages continually. </p>

					<p>“Such, then, is the nature of this possession—a possession wherein despots

						accounted their closest friends. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">

					<p>But for despots the position is the reverse in this case too. Instead of

					<p>“If you suppose that just because he has more possessions than the private

						Simonides. Trained athletes feel no pleasure when they prove superior to
						amateurs, but they are cut to the quick when they are beaten by a rival
						athlete; in like manner the despot feels no pleasure when he is seen to
						possess more than private citizens, but is vexed when he has less than other
						despots; for he regards them as his rivals in wealth. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>Nor even does the despot gain the object of his desire any quicker than the
						private citizen. For the private citizen desires a house or a farm or a
						servant; but the despot covets cities or wide territory or harbours or
						strong citadels, and these are far more difficult and perilous to acquire
						than the objects that attract the citizen. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>And, moreover, you will find that even poverty is rarer among private
						citizens than among despots. For much and little are to be measured not by
						number, but in relation to the owner's needs; so that what is more than
						enough is much, and what is less than enough is little. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<p>Therefore, the despot with his abundance of wealth has less to meet his
						necessary expenses than the private citizen. For while private citizens can
						cut down the daily expenditure as they please, despots cannot, since the
						largest items in their expenses and the most essential are the sums they
						spend on the life-guards, and to curtail any of these means ruin. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<p>Besides, when men can have all they need by honest means, why pity them as

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="11">
					<p>Now, despots are not seldom forced into the crime of robbing temples and

						they hatch a plot, the upright lest the people desire them for leaders. </p>

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="15">
					<p>And I can assure you of this, Simonides: when a despot fears any citizen, he
						is reluctant to see him alive, and yet reluctant to put him to death. To
						illustrate my point, suppose that a good horse makes his master afraid that
						he will do him some fatal mischief: the man will feel reluctant to slaughter

				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>For indeed it seems to me, Hiero, that in this man differs from other

					<p>The services of the indifferent seemed to us not acts of grace, and favours

					<p>And as for presents, most men offer them to one whom they hate, and that too

					<p>For whenever men feel that some person is competent to be their benefactor,

				</div>

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">
					<p>In trying to discover whether this is so, let us for the time being pass over
						the question whether the ruler, because of his greater power, is able to

						consider which of the two wins the greater measure of gratitude from the
						same actions.</p>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>“You shall have the most trifling examples to begin with. </p>

				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>First, suppose that two men greet someone with a friendly remark on seeing
						him. One is a ruler, the other a citizen. In this case which greeting, do
						you think, is the more delightful to the hearer? Or again, both commend the
						same man. Which commendation, do you think, is the more welcome? Suppose
						that each does the honours when he offers sacrifice. Which invitation, think

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<p>Suppose they are equally attentive to a sick man. Is it not obvious that the

						the plain citizen's gift? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>Nay, to my way of thinking, even the gods cause a peculiar honour and favour
						to dance attendance on a great ruler. For not only does rule add dignity of
						presence to a man, but we find more pleasure in the sight of that man when
						he is a ruler than when he is a mere citizen, and we take more pride in the
						conversation of those who rank above us than in that of our equals. </p>

				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>And favourites, mark you, who were the subject of your bitterest complaint

						in a high light. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>Moreover, inasmuch as equal services rendered by you rulers are rewarded with

					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>Hiero instantly rejoined: </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>“Indeed it is not so, Simonides; for we are forced to engage far oftener than
						private citizens in transactions that make men hated. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<p>Thus, we must extort money in order to find the cash to pay for what we want:
						we must compel men to guard whatever needs protection: we must punish
						wrongdoers; we must check those who would fain wax insolent; and when a
						crisis arises that calls for the immediate despatch of forces by land and
						sea, we must see that there is no dilly-dallying. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<p>Further, a great despot must needs have mercenaries; and no burden presses
						more heavily on the citizens than that, since they believe that these troops
						are maintained not in the interests of equality, but for the despot's
						personal ends.” </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="9">
				<div type="section" n="1">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>In answer to this Simonides said: “Well, Hiero, I do not deny that all these
						matters must receive attention. But I should divide a ruler's activities
						into two classes, those that lead inevitably to unpopularity, and those that
						are greeted with thanks. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">
					<p>The duty of teaching the people what things are best, and of dispensing
						praise and honour to those who accomplish the same most efficiently, is a
						form of activity that is greeted with thanks. The duty of pronouncing
						censure, using coercion, inflicting pains and penalties on those who come
						short in any respect, is one that must of necessity give rise to a certain
						amount of unpopularity. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>Therefore my sentence is that a great ruler should delegate to others the
						task of punishing those who require to be coerced, and should reserve to
						himself the privilege of awarding the prizes. The excellence of this
						arrangement is established by daily experience. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<p>Thus, when we want to have a choral competition, the ruler offers prizes, but
						the task of assembling the choirs is delegated to choir-masters, and others
						have the task of training them and coercing those who come short in any
						respect. Obviously, then, in this case, the pleasant part falls to the
						ruler, the disagreeables fall to others. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>Why, then, should not all other public affairs be managed on this principle?
						For all communities are divided into parts—`tribes,' `wards,' `unions,' as
						the case may be—and every one of these parts is subject to its appointed
						ruler. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>If, then, the analogy of the choruses were followed and prizes were offered
						to these parts for excellence of equipment, good discipline, horsemanship,
						courage in the field and fair dealing in business, the natural outcome would
						be competition, and consequently an earnest endeavour to improve in all
						these respects too. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>And as a matter of course, with the prospect of reward there would be more
						despatch in starting for the appointed place, and greater promptitude in the
						payment of war taxes, whenever occasion required. Nay, agriculture itself,
						most useful of all occupations, but just the one in which the spirit of
						competition is conspicuous by its absence, would make great progress if
						prizes were offered for the farm or the village that can show the best
						cultivation, and many good results would follow for those citizens who threw
						themselves vigorously into this occupation. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>For apart from the consequent increase in the revenues, sobriety far more
						commonly goes with industry; and remember, vices rarely flourish among the
						fully employed. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="9">
					<p>If commerce also brings gain to a city, the award of honours for diligence in
						business would attract a larger number to a commercial career. And were it
						made clear that the discovery of some way of raising revenue without hurting
						anyone will also be rewarded, this field of research too would not be
						unoccupied. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="10">
					<p>In a word, once it becomes clear in every department that any good suggestion
						will not go unrewarded, many will be encouraged by that knowledge to apply
						themselves to some promising form of investigation. And when there is a

						achievement is bound to come. </p>

				<div type="section" n="11">

					<p>“In case you fear, Hiero, that the cost of offering prizes for many subjects

					<p>“Well, Simonides,” said Hiero, “I think you are right in saying that. But

						will have no further need of a bodyguard?” </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="2">

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="3">
					<p>The way to manage men like that is to put the fear of the bodyguard into
						them. And as for the gentlemen, you can probably confer greater benefits on

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="4">
					<p>For I presume that you maintain the force primarily to protect yourself. But
						masters have often been murdered by their slaves. If therefore the first
						duty enjoined on the mercenaries were to act as the bodyguard of the whole
						community and render help to all, in case they got wind of any such
						intention—there are black sheep in every fold, as we all know—I say, if they
						were under orders to guard the citizens as well as the depot, the citizens
						would know that this is one service rendered to them by the mercenaries.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="5">
					<p>Nor is this all: for naturally the mercenaries would also be able to give
						fearlessness and security in the fullest measure to the labourers and cattle
						in the country, and the benefit would not be confined to your own estates,
						but would be felt up and down the countryside. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="6">
					<p>Again, they are competent to afford the citizens leisure for attending to
						their private affairs by guarding the vital positions. Besides, should an
						enemy plan a secret and sudden attack, what handier agents can be found for
						detecting or preventing their design than a standing force, armed and
						organized? Or once more, when the citizens go campaigning, what is more
						useful to them than mercenaries? For these are, as a matter of course, the
						readiest to bear the brunt of toil and danger and watching. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="section" n="7">
					<p>And must not those who possess a standing force impose on border states a

				</div>
				<div type="section" n="8">
					<p>Further, when the citizens get it into their heads that these troops do no
