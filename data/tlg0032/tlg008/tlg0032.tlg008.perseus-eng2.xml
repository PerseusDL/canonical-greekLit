					<p>Simonides, the poet, once paid a visit to Hiero, the despot. When both found
						time to spare, Simonides said: <said direct="true">Hiero, will you please explain something to
						me that you probably know better than I?</said>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<said direct="true">And pray what is it,</said> said Hiero, <said direct="true">that I can know better than one so wise
						as yourself?</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">I know you were born a private citizen,</said> he answered, <said
								direct="true">and are now a despot. Therefore, as you have
								experienced both fortunes, you probably know better than I how the
								lives of the despot and the citizen differ as regards the joys and
								sorrows that fall to man’s lot.</said>
						</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Surely,</said> said Hiero, <said direct="true">seeing that you are still
								a private citizen, it is for you to remind me of what happens in a
								citizen’s life; and then, I think, I could best show you the
								differences between the two.</said>
						</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Well,</said> said Simonides, taking the suggestion, 
						<said direct="true">I think I have observed that
						sights affect private citizens with pleasure and pain through the eyes,
						sounds through the ears, smells through the nostrils, meat and drink through
						the mouth, carnal appetites—of course we all know how.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In the case of cold and heat, things hard and soft, light and heavy, our
						sensations of pleasure and pain depend on the whole body, I think. In good
						and evil we seem to feel pleasure or pain, as the case may be—sometimes
						through the instrumentality of the moral being only, at other times through
						that of the moral and the physical being together.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Sleep, it seems clear to me, affects us with pleasure; but how and by what
						means and when are puzzles that I feel less able to solve. And perhaps it is
						no matter for surprise if our sensations are clearer when we are awake than
						when we are asleep.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">For my part, Simonides,</said> said Hiero in answer to this, <said direct="true">I cannot say how a
						despot could have any sensations apart from those you have mentioned. So
						far, therefore, I fail to see that the despot’s life differs in any respect
						from the citizen’s.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">In this respect it does differ,</said> said Simonides: <said direct="true">the pleasures it
						experiences by means of these various organs are infinitely greater in
						number, and the pains it undergoes are far fewer.</said>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<said direct="true">It is not so, Simonides,</said> retorted Hiero; <said direct="true">I assure you far fewer pleasures
						fall to despots than to citizens of modest means, and many more and much
						greater pains.</said>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<said direct="true">Incredible!</said> exclaimed Simonides. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><said direct="true">Were it so, how should a despot’s throne be an object of desire to many,
						even of those who are reputed to be men of ample means? And how should all
						the world envy despots?</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">For this reason of course,</said> said Hiero, 
						<said direct="true">that they speculate on the subject
						without experience of both estates. But I will try to show you that I am
						speaking the truth, beginning with the sense of sight. That was your first
						point, if I am not mistaken.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In the first place, then, taking the objects that we perceive by means of
						vision, I find by calculation that in regard to sight-seeing, despots are
						worse off. In every land there are things worth seeing: and in search of
						these private citizens visit any city they choose, and attend the national
						festivals, where all things reputed to be most worth seeing are assembled.</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But despots are not at all concerned with missions to shows. For it is risky
						for them to go where they will be no stronger than the crowd, and their
						property at home is too insecure to be left in charge of others while they
						are abroad. For they fear to lose their throne, and at the same time to be
						unable to take vengeance on the authors of the wrong. Perhaps you may say:</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">
						<said direct="false">But, after all, such spectacles come to them even if they stay at home.</said> No,
						no, Simonides, only one in a hundred such; and what there are of them are
						offered to despots at a price so exorbitant that showmen who exhibit some
						trifle expect to leave the court in an hour with far more money than they
						get from all the rest of the world in a lifetime.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Ah,</said> said Simonides, <said direct="true">but if you are worse off in the matter of
						sight-seeing, the sense of hearing, you know, gives you the advantage.
						Praise, the sweetest of all sounds, is never lacking, for all your courtiers
						praise everything you do and every word you utter. Abuse, on the contrary,
						that most offensive of sounds, is never in your ears, for no one likes to
						speak evil of a despot in his presence.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">And what pleasure,</said> asked Hiero, <said direct="true">comes, do you suppose, of this shrinking
						from evil words, when one knows well that all harbour evil thoughts against
						the despot, in spite of their silence? Or what pleasure comes of this
						praise, do you think, when the praises sound suspiciously like flattery?</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Well yes,</said> replied Simonides, <said direct="true">in this of course I agree with you entirely,
						Hiero, that praise from the freest is sweetest. But this, now, you will not
						persuade anyone to believe, that the things which support human life do not
						yield you a far greater number of pleasures.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Yes, Simonides, and I know that the reason why most men judge that we have
						more enjoyment in eating and drinking than private citizens is this; they
						think that they themselves would find the dinner served at our table better
						eating than what they get. Anything, in fact, that is better than what they
						are accustomed to gives them pleasure.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">This is why all men look forward to the festivals, except the despots. For
						their table is always laden with plenty, and admits of no extras on feast
						days. Here then is one pleasure in respect of which they are worse off than
						the private citizen, the pleasure of anticipation.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But further, your own experience tells you, I am sure, that the greater the
						number of superfluous dishes set before a man, the sooner a feeling of
						repletion comes over him; and so, as regards the duration of his pleasure
						too, the man who has many courses put before him is worse off than the
						moderate liver.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">But surely,</said> said Simonides, <said direct="true">so long as the appetite holds out, the man who
						dines at the costlier banquet has far more pleasure than he who is served
						with the cheaper meal.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Don’t you think, Simonides, that the greater a man’s pleasure in any
								occupation the stronger is his devotion to it?</said>
							<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
							<said direct="true">Certainly.</said>
							<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
							<said direct="true">Then do you notice that despots fall to their meal
								with any more zest than private persons to theirs?</said>
							<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
							<said direct="true">No, no, of course not; I should rather say with more
								disgust, according to the common opinion.</said></p> 
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Well now,</said> said Hiero, <said direct="true">have you observed all those pickles and sauces that
						are put before despots—acid, bitter, astringent and so forth?</said>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<said direct="true">Yes, certainly; and very unnatural cates I think them for human beings.</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Don’t you look on these condiments, then, as mere fads of a jaded and
								pampered appetite? I know well enough, and I expect you know too,
								that hearty eaters have no need of these concoctions.</said>
						</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Well, I certainly think that those costly unguents with which you anoint
						your bodies afford more satisfaction to those who are near you than to
						yourselves, just as the man who has eaten rank food is less conscious of the
						disagreeable smell than those who come near him.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Quite so, and we may add that he who has all sorts of food at all times has
						no stomach for any sort. Offer a man a dish that he seldom tastes, and he
						eats a bellyful with gusto.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">It seems,</said> remarked Simonides, <said direct="true">as if the satisfaction of the sexual
						appetites were the only motive that produces in you the craving for
						despotism. For in this matter you are free to enjoy the fairest that meets
						your eye.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">I assure you that we are worse off than private citizens in the matter to
						which you now refer. First take marriage. It is commonly held that a
						marriage into a family of greater wealth and influence is most honourable,
						and is a source of pride and pleasure to the bridegroom. Next to that comes
						a marriage with equals. A marriage with inferiors is considered positively
						degrading and useless.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Now unless a despot marries a foreign girl, he is bound to marry beneath him;
						and so the thing to be desired does not come his way. And whereas it is
						exceedingly pleasant to receive the attentions of the proudest of ladies,
						the attentions of slaves are quite unappreciated when shown, and any little
						shortcomings produce grievous outbursts of anger and annoyance.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In his relations with young boys, again, even much more than in his
						relations with women, the despot is at a disadvantage. We all know, I
						suppose, that passion increases the sweets of sex beyond measure.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Passion, however, is very shy of entering the heart of a despot, for passion
						is fain to desire not the easy prize, but the hoped-for joy. Therefore, just
						as a man who is a stranger to thirst can get no satisfaction out of
						drinking, so he who is a stranger to passion is a stranger to the sweetest
						pleasures of sex.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>To this speech of Hiero’s Simonides replied, laughing:
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<said direct="true">How say you, Hiero? You deny that love for boys springs up in a despot’s
						heart? Then how about your passion for Dailochus, whom they call most fair?</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">Why, Simonides, the explanation, of course, is this: I desire to get from
						him not what I may have, apparently, for the asking, but that which a despot
						should be the last to take.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">The fact is, I desire of Dailochus just that which human nature, maybe,
						drives us to ask of the fair. But what I long to get, I very strongly desire
						to obtain by his goodwill, and with his consent; but I think I could sooner
						desire to do myself an injury than to take it from him by force.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For to take from an enemy against his will is, I think, the greatest of all
						pleasures, but favours from a loved one are very pleasant, I fancy, only
						when he consents.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For instance, if he is in sympathy with you, how pleasant are his looks, how
						pleasant his questions and his answers; how very pleasant and ravishing are
						the struggles and bickerings.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But to take advantage of a favourite against his will seems to me more like
						brigandage than love. Nay, your brigand finds some pleasure in his gain and
						in hurting his foe; but to feel pleasure in hurting one whom you love, to be
						hated for your affection, to disgust him by your touch, surely that is a
						mortifying experience and pitiful!</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">The fact is, a private citizen has instant proof that any act of compliance
						on the part of his beloved is prompted by affection, since he knows that the
						service rendered is due to no compulsion; but the despot can never feel sure
						that he is loved.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For we know that acts of service prompted by fear copy as closely as possible
						the ministrations of affection. Indeed, even plots against despots as often
						as not are the work of those who profess the deepest affection for them.</said>
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p>To this Simonides replied: <said direct="true">Well, the points that you raise seem to me mere
						trifles. For I notice that many respected men willingly go short in the
						matter of meat and drink and delicacies, and deliberately abstain from
						sexual indulgence.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But I will show you where you have a great advantage over private citizens.
						Your objects are vast, your attainment swift: you have luxuries in
						abundance: you own horses unequalled in excellence, arms unmatched in
						beauty, superb jewelry for women, stately houses full of costly furniture:
						moreover you have servants many in number and excellent in accomplishments
						and you are rich in power to harm enemies and reward friends.</said>
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					To this Hiero answered: </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><said direct="true">Well, Simonides, that the multitude should be deceived by despotic power
						surprises me not at all, since the mob seems to guess wholly by appearances
						that one man is happy, another miserable.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Despotism flaunts its seeming precious treasures outspread before the gaze of
						the world: but its troubles it keeps concealed in the heart of the despot,
						in the place where human happiness and unhappiness are stored away.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">That this escapes the observation of the multitude I say, I am not surprised.
						But what does seem surprising to me is that men like you, whose intelligence
						is supposed to give you a clearer view of most things than your eyes, should
						be equally blind to it.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But I know well enough by experience, Simonides, and I tell you that despots
						get the smallest share of the greatest blessings, and have most of the
						greatest evils.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Thus, for instance, if peace is held to be a greatest blessing to mankind,
						very little of it falls to the share of despots: if war is a great evil, of
						that despots receive the largest share.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">To begin with, so long as their state is not engaged in a war in which all
						take part, private citizens are free to go wherever they choose without fear
						of being killed. But all despots move everywhere as in an enemy’s country;
						at any rate they think they are bound to wear arms continually themselves,
						and to take an armed escort about with them at all times.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Secondly, in the event of an expedition against an enemy’s country, private
						citizens at least think themselves safe as soon as they have come home. But
						when despots reach their own city, they know that they are now among more
						enemies than ever.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Again, suppose that strangers invade their city in superior force; true, the
						weaker are conscious of danger while they are outside the walls; yet once
						they are inside the fortress, all feel themselves bestowed in safety. But
						the despot is not out of danger even when he passes within the palace gates;
						nay, it is just there that he thinks he must walk most warily.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Once again, to private citizens a truce or peace brings rest from war; but
						despots are never at peace with the people subject to their despotism, and
						no truce can ever make a despot confident.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">There are, of course, wars that are waged by states against one another, and
						wars waged by the despot against his oppressed subjects. Now the hardships
						incidental to these wars that fall on the citizen fall also on the despot.</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For both must wear arms, be watchful, run risks; and the sting of a defeat is
						felt by both alike.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">So far, then, both are equally affected by wars. But the joys that fall to
						the citizens of states at war are not experienced by despots.<note

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For, you know, when states defeat their foes in a battle, words fail one to
						describe the joy they feel in the rout of the enemy, in the pursuit, in the
						slaughter of the enemy. What transports of triumphant pride! What a halo of
						glory about them! What comfort to think that they have exalted their city!</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Everyone is crying: <said direct="false">I had a share in

						</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But when a despot harbours suspicion, and, well aware that opposition is on

					<p>In answer to this Simonides said: <said direct="true">Well, Hiero, I do not deny that all these
						matters must receive attention. But I should divide a ruler’s activities
						into two classes, those that lead inevitably to unpopularity, and those that
						are greeted with thanks.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">The duty of teaching the people what things are best, and of dispensing
						praise and honour to those who accomplish the same most efficiently, is a
						form of activity that is greeted with thanks. The duty of pronouncing
						censure, using coercion, inflicting pains and penalties on those who come
						short in any respect, is one that must of necessity give rise to a certain
						amount of unpopularity.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Therefore my sentence is that a great ruler should delegate to others the
						task of punishing those who require to be coerced, and should reserve to
						himself the privilege of awarding the prizes. The excellence of this
						arrangement is established by daily experience.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Thus, when we want to have a choral competition, the ruler offers prizes, but
						the task of assembling the choirs is delegated to choir-masters, and others
						have the task of training them and coercing those who come short in any
						respect. Obviously, then, in this case, the pleasant part falls to the
						ruler, the disagreeables fall to others.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Why, then, should not all other public affairs be managed on this principle?
						For all communities are divided into parts—<q type="emph">tribes,</q> <q type="emph">wards,</q> <q type="emph">unions,</q> as
						the case may be—and every one of these parts is subject to its appointed
						ruler.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">If, then, the analogy of the choruses were followed and prizes were offered
						to these parts for excellence of equipment, good discipline, horsemanship,
						courage in the field and fair dealing in business, the natural outcome would
						be competition, and consequently an earnest endeavour to improve in all
						these respects too.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">And as a matter of course, with the prospect of reward there would be more
						despatch in starting for the appointed place, and greater promptitude in the
						payment of war taxes, whenever occasion required. Nay, agriculture itself,
						most useful of all occupations, but just the one in which the spirit of
						competition is conspicuous by its absence, would make great progress if
						prizes were offered for the farm or the village that can show the best
						cultivation, and many good results would follow for those citizens who threw
						themselves vigorously into this occupation.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For apart from the consequent increase in the revenues, sobriety far more
						commonly goes with industry; and remember, vices rarely flourish among the
						fully employed.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">If commerce also brings gain to a city, the award of honours for diligence in
						business would attract a larger number to a commercial career. And were it
						made clear that the discovery of some way of raising revenue without hurting
						anyone will also be rewarded, this field of research too would not be
						unoccupied.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In a word, once it becomes clear in every department that any good suggestion
						will not go unrewarded, many will be encouraged by that knowledge to apply
						themselves to some promising form of investigation. And when there is a
						wide-spread interest in useful subjects, an increase of discovery and
						achievement is bound to come.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In case you fear, Hiero, that the cost of offering prizes for many subjects
						may prove heavy, you should reflect that no commodities are cheaper than
						those that are bought for a prize. Think of the large sums that men are
						induced to spend on horse-races, gymnastic and choral competitions, and the
						long course of training and practice they undergo for the sake of a paltry
						prize.</said> </p>

					<p><said direct="true">Well, Simonides,</said> said Hiero, 
						<said direct="true">I think you are right in saying that. But
						what about the mercenaries? Can you tell me how to employ them without
						incurring unpopularity? Or do you say that a ruler, once he becomes popular,
						will have no further need of a bodyguard?</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>
					<p><said direct="true">No, no, he will need them, of course,</said> said Simonides. 
						<said direct="true">For I know that some
						human beings are like horses—the more they get what they want, the more
						unruly they are apt to become.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">The way to manage men like that is to put the fear of the bodyguard into
						them. And as for the gentlemen, you can probably confer greater benefits on
						them by employing mercenaries than by any other means.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">For I presume that you maintain the force primarily to protect yourself. But
						masters have often been murdered by their slaves. If therefore the first
						duty enjoined on the mercenaries were to act as the bodyguard of the whole
						community and render help to all, in case they got wind of any such
						intention—there are black sheep in every fold, as we all know—I say, if they
						were under orders to guard the citizens as well as the depot, the citizens
						would know that this is one service rendered to them by the mercenaries.</said>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Nor is this all: for naturally the mercenaries would also be able to give
						fearlessness and security in the fullest measure to the labourers and cattle
						in the country, and the benefit would not be confined to your own estates,
						but would be felt up and down the countryside.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Again, they are competent to afford the citizens leisure for attending to
						their private affairs by guarding the vital positions. Besides, should an
						enemy plan a secret and sudden attack, what handier agents can be found for
						detecting or preventing their design than a standing force, armed and
						organized? Or once more, when the citizens go campaigning, what is more
						useful to them than mercenaries? For these are, as a matter of course, the
						readiest to bear the brunt of toil and danger and watching.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">And must not those who possess a standing force impose on border states a
						strong desire for peace? For nothing equals an organized body of men,
						whether for protecting the property of friends or for thwarting the plans of
						enemies.</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Further, when the citizens get it into their heads that these troops do no
						harm to the innocent and hold the would-be malefactor in check, come to the
						rescue of the wronged, care for the citizens and shield them from danger,
						surely they are bound to pay the cost of them with a right good-will. At all
						events they keep guards in their homes for less important objects than
						these.</said> </p>

			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">

					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Nor should you hesitate to draw on your private property, Hiero, for the

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">But let us go into details. First, which do you suppose is likely to bring

						market-places and harbours?</said> </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Which will make you look more terrible to the enemy, to dazzle all beholders

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Which plan, think you, will yield revenues more abounding, to keep only your

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">And what about the breeding of chariot horses, commonly considered the

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Indeed my own opinion is that it is not even seemly for a great despot to
