					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Inasmuch as we have had a long experience of cavalry, and
							consequently claim familiarity with the art of horsemanship, we wish to
							explain to our younger friends what we believe to be the correct method
							of dealing with horses. True there is already a treatise on horsemanship
							by Simon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A considerable fragment of
								this work survives in a MS. in Emmanuel College, <placeName
									key="tgn,7011980">Cambridge</placeName>. The most recent
								editions are those of <placeName key="tgn,1128011">Oder</placeName>
								and Ruhl. The <q type="emph">cavalry commander</q> named Simon
								referred to in Aristophanes’ <title>Knights</title> 242, is just a
								member of the chorus, but the name probably recalls the
								author.</note> who also dedicated the bronze horse in the Eleusinium
							at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and recorded his
							own feats in relief on the pedestal. Nevertheless, we shall not erase
							from our work the conclusions that happen to coincide with his, but
							shall offer them to our friends with far greater pleasure, in the belief
							that they are more worthy of acceptance because so expert a horseman
							held the same opinions as we ourselves: moreover, we shall try to
							explain all the points that he has omitted.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First we will give directions how best to
						avoid being cheated in buying a horse.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For judging an unbroken colt, the only
						criterion, obviously, is the body, for no clear signs of temper are to be
						detected in an animal that has not yet had a man on his back. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In examining his body, we say you must first
						look at his feet. For, just as a house is bound to be worthless less if the
						foundations are unsound, however well the upper parts may look, so a
						war-horse will be quite useless, even though all his other points are good,
						if he has bad feet; for in that case he will be unable to use any of his
						good points. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When testing the feet first look to the hoofs.
						For it makes a great difference in the quality of the feet if they are thick
						rather than thin. Next you must not fail to notice whether the hoofs are
						high both in front and behind, or low. For high hoofs have the frog, as it
						is called, well off the ground; but flat hoofs tread with the strongest and
						weakest part of the foot simultaneously, like a bow-legged man. Moreover,
						Simon says that the ring, too, is a clear test of good feet: and he is
						right; for a hollow hoof rings like a cymbal in striking the ground.<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="written">M. Bourgelat, in his preface to the second
							volume of <title>Les Elemens Hippiatriques</title> reprehends this
							remark as trifling and false; and if our author is to be understood
							literally, the criticism is certainly just.</q>—Berenger 1.221. Yet it is
							unlikely that Simon and X. were both mistaken.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having begun here, we will proceed upwards by
						successive steps to the rest of the body.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The bones (of the pastern) above the hoofs and
						below the fetlocks should not be too upright, like a goat’s: such legs give
						too hard a tread, jar the rider, and are more liable to inflammation. Nor
						yet should the bones be too low,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="written">The
							pasterns (of the hackney) should neither be too oblique, which bespeaks
							weakness: nor too straight, which wears the horse out and is unpleasant
							to the rider.</q>—Blair in Loudon’s <title>Agriculture.</title></note> else
						the fetlocks are likely to become bare and sore when the horse is ridden
						over clods or stones. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The bones of the shanks should be thick,<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><q type="emph">Wide</q> would be a more suitable word.</note>
						since these are the pillars of the body; but not thick with veins nor with
						flesh, else when the horse is ridden over hard ground, these parts are bound
						to become charged with blood and varicose; the legs will swell, and the skin
						will fall away, and when this gets loose the pin,<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">The Greek word means the fibula in man, but the fibula,
							of course, is no part of the shank in the horse. Morgan rightly says
							that X. writes throughout of the horse as he appears outwardly, and not
							of the skeleton (with which he was unacquainted), and that the allusion
							is to the back sinew of the shin.</note> too, is apt to give way and
						lame the horse. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If the colt’s knees are supple when bending as
						he walks, you may guess that his legs will be supple when he is ridden too,
						for all horses acquire greater suppleness at the knee as time goes on.
						Supple knees are rightly approved, since they render the horse less likely
						to stumble and tire than stiff legs. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The arms below the shoulders,<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">The forearm, not the true arm, which X. includes in the
							chest.</note> as in man, are stronger and better looking if they are
						thick.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A chest of some width is better formed both
						for appearance and for strength, and for carrying the legs well apart
						without crossing. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>His neck should not hang downwards from the
						chest like a boar’s, but stand straight up to the crest, like a cock’s;<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The horse should not be
							<q type="emph">cock-throttled.</q></note> but it should be flexible at the bend; and the
						head should be bony, with a small cheek. Thus the neck will protect the
						rider, and the eye see what lies before the feet.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">He will not be a <q type="emph">star-gazer.</q></note> Besides, a horse
						of such a mould will have least power of running away, be he never so
						high-spirited, for horses do not arch the neck and head, but stretch them
						out when they try to run away. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You should notice, too, whether both jaws are
						soft or hard, or only one; for horses with unequal jaws are generally
						unequally sensitive in the mouth.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A prominent eye looks more alert than one that
						is hollow, and, apart from that, it gives the horse a greater range of
						vision. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p>And wide open nostrils afford room for freer breathing than close ones, and
						at the same time make the horse look fiercer, for whenever a horse is angry
						with another or gets excited under his rider, he dilates his nostrils. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A fairly large crest and fairly small ears
						give the more characteristic shape to a horse’s head.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>High withers offer the rider a safer seat and
						a stronger grip on the shoulders.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The double back<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true"><q type="written">That was before the days of saddles, and horsemen had a
							tender interest in the double back—the characteristic back of dappled
							horses.</q>—Pocock, <title>Horses</title>, p. 118. <quote>Duplex agitur per
							lumbos spina,</quote> says <persName><surname>Virgil</surname></persName>
							<title>Georg.</title> 3.87.</note> is both softer to sit on than the
						single and more pleasing to the eye. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The deeper the flanks and the more swelling
						toward the belly, the firmer is the seat and the stronger, and as a rule,
						the better feeder is the horse.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The broader and shorter the loins, the more
						easily the horse lifts his fore quarters and the more easily he brings up
						his hind quarters. And, apart from that, the belly looks smallest so, and if
						it is big it disfigures the horse to some extent, and also makes him to some
						extent both weaker and clumsier. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The haunches must be broad and fleshy, that
						they may be in right proportion to the flanks and chest, and if they are
						firm all over, they will be lighter for running and will make the horse
						speedier. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If the gap that separates the hams under the
						tail is broad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">He must not be <q type="emph">cat-hammed</q>
							(Berenger), which means that the hocks will be turned inwards. Such
							horses are often good trotters (Blane), but the Greek cavalry rider did
							not require that.</note> he will also extend his hind legs well apart
						under his belly; and by doing that he will be more fiery and stronger when
						he throws himself on his haunches and when he is ridden, and will make the
						best of himself in all ways. One can infer this from the action of a man:
						for when he wants to lift anything from the ground, a man invariably tries
						to lift it with his legs apart rather than close together. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A horse’s stones should not be big: but it is
						impossible to observe this in a colt.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the parts below, the hocks, shin bones,
						fetlocks and hoofs, what we have said about the corresponding parts in the
						forelegs applies to these also. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I want also to explain how one is least likely
						to be disappointed in the matter of size. The colt that is longest in the
						shanks at the time he is foaled makes the biggest horse.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true"><q type="written">For his stature this is an infallible rule that the
							shinne bone...never increaseth, no not from the first foaling...insomuch
							that if those bones be long and large, we are ever assured that the
							Foale will prove a tall and large Horse.</q> G. Markham,
								<title>Cavalerice,</title>
							<date when="1617">1617</date>.</note> For in all quadrupeds the shanks
						increase but little in size as time goes on, whereas the rest of the body
						grows to them, so as to be in the right proportion. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He who applies these tests to a colt’s shape
						is sure, in my opinion, to get a beast with good feet, strong, muscular, of
						the right look and the right size. If some change as they grow, still we may
						confidently rely on these tests, for it is far commoner for an ugly colt to
						make a useful horse than for a colt like this to turn out ugly. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We do not think it necessary to give
							directions<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, perhaps, <gloss>to give many
							directions.</gloss> Something is lost in the MSS., in which the <foreign
								xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> (added by Courier) does not
							appear.</note> for breaking a colt. For in our states the cavalry are
						recruited from those who have ample means and take a considerable part in
						the government. And it is far better for a young man to get himself into
						condition and when he understands the art of horsemanship to practise riding
						than to be a horse-breaker; and an older man had far better devote himself
						to his estate and his friends and affairs of state and of war than spend his
						time in horse-breaking. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>So he who shares my opinion about horse-breaking will, of course, send his
						colt out. Still he should put in writing what the horse is to know when he
						is returned, just as when he apprentices his son to a profession. For these
						articles will serve as notes to remind the horse-breaker of what he must
						attend to if he is to get his money. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Still, care must be taken that the colt is
						gentle, tractable, and fond of man when he is sent to the horse-breaker.
						That sort of business is generally done at home through the groom, if he
						knows how to contrive that hunger and thirst and horseflies are associated
						by the colt with solitude, while eating and drinking and delivery from
						irritation come through man’s agency. For in these circumstances a foal is
						bound not only to like men, but to hanker after them. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p>One should also handle those parts in which the horse likes most to be
						cherished, that is to say the hairiest parts and those where the horse has
						least power of helping himself, if anything worries him. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p>Let the groom be under orders also to lead him through crowds, and accustom
						him to all sorts of sights and all sorts of noises. If the colt shies at any
						of them, he must teach him, by quieting him and without impatience, that
						there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think that the directions I have given on
						the subject of horse-breaking are sufficient for the private person. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In case the intention is to buy a horse
						already ridden, we will write out some notes that the buyer must thoroughly
						master if he is not to be cheated over his purchase.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First, then, he must not fail to ascertain the
						age. A horse that has shed all his milk teeth does not afford much ground
						for pleasing expectations, and is not so easily got rid of.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">The knowledge of the teeth as a criterion of age is
							rudimentary.</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If he is clearly a youngster, one must notice
						further how he receives the bit in his mouth and the headstall about his
						ears. This may best be noticed if the buyer sees the bridle put on and taken
						off again. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next, attention must be paid to his behaviour
						when he receives the rider on his back. For many horses will not readily
						accept a thing if they know beforehand that, if they accept it, they will be
						forced to work. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Another thing to be observed is whether when
						mounted he is willing to leave his companions, or whether in passing
						standing horses he does not bolt towards them. Some too, in consequence of
						bad training run away from the riding ground to the paths that lead home.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A horse with jaws unequally sensitive is
						detected by the exercise called the <q type="emph">ring,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
							>i.e., the <q type="emph">volte</q>; see note at 7.13.</note> but much more by changing
						the exercise.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., by riding on the other
							hand. The allusion, as Hermann saw, is not to the inverted volte.</note>
						For many do not attempt to bolt unless they have a bad mouth, and the road
						along which they can bolt home gives them their chance.<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">The meaning is, that if, for example, the road on the
							right leads home, the horse with a more sensitive right jaw will try to
							bolt down it.</note> It is likewise necessary to know whether, when
						going at full speed he can be pulled up sharp, and whether he turns readily.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>And it is well to make sure whether he is equally willing to obey when roused
						by a blow. For a disobedient servant and a disobedient army are of course
						useless; and a disobedient horse is not only useless, but often behaves just
						like a traitor. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As we have assumed that the horse to be bought
						is designed for war, he must be tested in all the particulars in which he is
						tested by war. These include springing across ditches, leaping over walls,
						rushing up banks, jumping down from banks. One must also try him by riding
						up and down hill and on a slope. All these experiments prove whether his
						spirit is strong and his body sound. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nevertheless, it is not necessary to reject a
						horse that is not perfect in these trials. For many break down in these not
						from want of ability, but from lack of experience. With teaching, use and
						discipline they will perform all these exercises well, provided they are
						otherwise sound and not faulty. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p>But one should beware of horses that are naturally shy. For timid horses give
						one no chance of using them to harm the enemy, and often throw their rider
						and put him in a very awkward situation. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is necessary also to find out whether the
						horse has any vice towards horses or towards men, and whether he will not
						stand tickling: for all these things prove troublesome to the owner. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As regards objection to being bridled or
						mounted, and the other reactions, there is a much better way still of
						detecting these, namely, by trying to do over again, after the horse has
						finished his work, just what one did before starting on the ride. All horses
						that are willing after their work to do another spell thereby give
						sufficient proofs of a patient temper. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To sum up: the horse that is sound in his
						feet, gentle and fairly speedy, has the will and the strength to stand work,
						and, above all, is obedient, is the horse that will, as a matter of course,
						give least trouble and the greatest measure of safety to his rider in
						warfare. But those that want a lot of driving on account of their laziness,
						or a lot of coaxing and attention on account of their high spirit, make
						constant demands on the rider’s hands and rob him of confidence in moments
						of danger. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When a man has found a horse to his mind,
						bought him and taken him home, it is well to have the stable so situated
						with respect to the house that his master can see him very often; and it is
						a good plan to have the stall so contrived that it will be as difficult to
						steal the horse’s fodderout of the manger as the master’s victuals from the
						larder. He who neglects this seems to me to neglect himself; for it is plain
						that in danger the master entrusts his life to his horse. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>But a well-secured stall is not only good for preventing theft of the fodder
						but also because one can see when the horse does not spill his food.<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In healthy excitement. See J. K. Anderson,
							in <title>J.H.S.</title> 80.1-2.</note> And on noticing this one may be
						sure that either his body is overfull of blood and needs treatment or the
						horse is overworked and wants rest, or that laminitis<note resp="Loeb"
							anchored="true">So J. K. Anderson, <title>Ancient Greek
								Horsemanship,</title> pp. 162, 207, not, as was once believed,
							colic.</note> or some other ailment is coming on. It is the same with
						horses as with men: all distempers in the early stage are more easily cured
						than when they have become chronic and have been wrongly treated. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Just as the food and exercise of the horse
						must be attended to in order that he may keep sound, so his feet must be
						cared for. Now damp and slippery floors ruin even well-formed hoofs. In
						order that they may not be damp, the floors should have a slope to carry off
						the wet, and, that they may not be slippery, they should be paved all over
						with stones, each one about the size of the hoof. Such floors, indeed, have
						another advantage because they harden the feet of the horses standing on
						them. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To take the next point: the groom must lead
						out the horse to clean him, and must loose him from the stall after the
						morning feed, that he may return to his evening feed with more appetite. Now
						the stableyard will be of the best form and will strengthen the feet if he
						throws down and spreads over it four or five loads of round stones, the size
						of a fist, about a pound in weight, and surrounds them with a border of iron
						so that they may not be scattered. Standing on these will have the same
						effect as if the horse walked on a stone road for some time every day. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p>When he is being rubbed down and teased with flies he is bound to use his
						hoofs in the same way as when he walks. The frogs also are hardened by
						stones scattered in this way.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same care must be taken to make his mouth
						tender as to harden his hoofs. This is done by the same methods as are
						employed to soften human flesh. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is a mark of a good horseman, in our
						opinion, to see that his groom, like himself, is instructed in the way in
						which he should treat the horse.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First then the man ought to know that he

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p>But the other kind of bit acts like a chain: for only the part that you hold

					<p>Many suppose that an animal that has supple legs will also be capable of

				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>But the right hand must be raised when the man intends to fling his javelin
