<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I have often wondered by what arguments those who drew up the indictment against <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> could persuade the Athenians that his life was forfeit to the state. The indictment against him was to this effect: <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> is guilty of rejecting the gods acknowledged by the state and of bringing in strange deities: he is also guilty of corrupting the youth.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First then, that he rejected the gods acknowledged by the state — what evidence did they produce of that? He offered sacrifices constantly, and made no secret of it, now in his home, now at the altars of the state temples, and he made use of divination with as little secrecy. Indeed it had become notorious that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> claimed to be guided by ‘the deity:’<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That immanent ‘divine something,’ as <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> terms it, which <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> claimed as his peculiar possession.</note> it was out of this claim, I think, that the charge of bringing in strange deities arose.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>He was no more bringing in anything strange than are other believers in divination, who rely on augury, oracles, coincidences and sacrifices. For these men's belief is not that the birds or the folk met by accident know what profits the inquirer, but that they are the instruments by which the gods make this known; and that was <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>' belief too.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Only, whereas most men say that the birds or the folk they meet dissuade or encourage them, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> said what he meant: for he said that the deity gave him a sign. Many of his companions were counselled by him to do this or not to do that in accordance with the warnings of the deity: and those who followed his advice prospered, and those who rejected it had cause for regret.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And yet who would not admit that he wished to appear neither a knave nor a fool to his companions? but he would have been thought both, had he proved to be mistaken when he alleged that his counsel was in accordance with divine revelation. Obviously, then, he would not have given the counsel if he had not been confident that what he said would come true. And who could have inspired him with that confidence but a god? And since he had confidence in the gods, how can he have disbelieved in the existence of the gods?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Another way he had of dealing with intimate friends was this: if there was no room for doubt, he advised them to act as they thought best; but if the consequences could not be foreseen, he sent them to the oracle to inquire whether the thing ought to be done.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Those who intended to control a house or a city, he said, needed the help of divination. For the craft of carpenter, smith, farmer or ruler, and the theory of such crafts, and arithmetic and economics and generalship might be learned and mastered by the application of human powers;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>but the deepest secrets of these matters the gods reserved to themselves; they were dark to men. You may plant a field well; but you know not who shall gather the fruits: you may build a house well; but you know not who shall dwell in it: able to command, you cannot know whether it is profitable to command: versed in statecraft, you know not whether it is profitable to guide the state: though, for your delight, you marry a pretty woman, you cannot tell whether she will bring you sorrow: though you form a party among men mighty in the state, you know not whether they will cause you to be driven from the state.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>If any man thinks that these matters are wholly within the grasp of the human mind and nothing in them is beyond our reason, that man, he said, is irrational. But it is no less irrational to seek the guidance of heaven in matters which men are permitted by the gods to decide for themselves by study: to ask, for instance, Is it better to get an experienced coachman to drive my carriage or a man without experience?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. vi. 6.</note> Is it better to get an experienced seaman to steer my ship or a man without experience? So too with what we may know by reckoning, measurement or weighing. To put such questions to the gods seemed to his mind profane. In short, what the gods have granted us to do by help of learning, we must learn; what is hidden from mortals we should try to find out from the gods by divination: for to him that is in their grace the gods grant a sign.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><p>Moreover, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> lived ever in the open; for early in the morning he went to the public promenades and training-grounds; in the forenoon he was seen in the market; and the rest of the day he passed just where most people were to be met: he was generally talking, and anyone might listen. Yet none ever knew him to offend against piety and religion in deed or word.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>He did not even discuss that topic so favoured by other talkers, “the Nature of the Universe”: and avoided speculation on the so-called “Cosmos” of the Professors, how it works, and on the laws that govern the phenomena of the heavens: indeed he would argue that to trouble one's mind with such problems is sheer folly.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>In the first place, he would inquire, did these thinkers suppose that their knowledge of human affairs was so complete that they must seek these new fields for the exercise of their brains; or that it was their duty to neglect human affairs and consider only things divine?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>Moreover, he marvelled at their blindness in not seeing that man cannot solve these riddles; since even the most conceited talkers on these problems did not agree in their theories, but behaved to one another like madmen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>As some madmen have no fear of danger and others are afraid where there is nothing to be afraid of, as some will do or say anything in a crowd with no sense of shame, while others shrink even from going abroad among men, some respect neither temple nor altar nor any other sacred thing, others worship stocks and stones and beasts, so is it, he held, with those who worry with “Universal Nature.” Some hold that “What is” is one, others that it is infinite in number: some that all things are in perpetual motion, others that nothing can ever be moved at any time: some that all life is birth and decay, others that nothing can ever be born or ever die.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Nor were those the only questions he asked about such theorists. Students of human nature, he said, think that they will apply their knowledge in due course for the good of themselves and any others they choose. Do those who pry into heavenly phenomena imagine that, once they have discovered the laws by which these are produced, they will create at their will winds, waters, seasons and such things to their need? Or have they no such expectation, and are they satisfied with knowing the causes of these various phenomena?</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such, then, was his criticism of those who meddle with these matters. His own conversation was ever of human things. The problems he discussed were, What is godly, what is ungodly; what is beautiful, what is ugly; what is just, what is unjust; what is prudence, what is madness; what is courage, what is cowardice; what is a state, what is a statesman; what is government, and what is a governor;—these and others like them, of which the knowledge made a “gentleman,” in his estimation, while ignorance should involve the reproach of “slavishness.”</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So, in pronouncing on opinions of his that were unknown to them it is not surprising that the jury erred: but is it not astonishing that they should have ignored matters of common knowledge?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>For instance, when he was on the Council and had taken the counsellor's oath by which he bound himself to give counsel in accordance with the laws, it fell to his lot to preside in the Assembly when the people wanted to condemn Thrasyllus and Erasinides and their colleagues to death by a single vote. That was illegal, and he refused the motion in spite of popular rancour and the threats of many powerful persons. It was more to him that he should keep his oath than that he should humour the people in an unjust demand and shield himself from threats.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>For, like most men, indeed, he believed that the gods are heedful of mankind, but with an important difference; for whereas they do not believe in the omniscience of the gods, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> thought that they know all things, our words and deeds and secret purposes; that they are present everywhere, and grant signs to men of all that concerns man.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">IV. iii, 2; <title>Cyropaedia</title> I. vi. 46.</note></p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I wonder, then, how the Athenians can have been persuaded that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> was a freethinker, when he never said or did anything contrary to sound religion, and his utterances about the gods and his behaviour towards them were the words and actions of a man who is truly religious and deserves to be thought so.</p></div>
    
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No less wonderful is it to me that some believed the charge brought against <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> of corrupting the youth. In the first place, apart from what I have said, in control of his own passions and appetites he was the strictest of men; further, in endurance of cold and heat and every kind of toil he was most resolute; and besides, his needs were so schooled to moderation that having very little he was yet very content.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Such was his own character: how then can he have led others into impiety, crime, gluttony, lust, or sloth? On the contrary, he cured these vices in many, by putting into them a desire for goodness, and by giving them confidence that self-discipline would make them gentlemen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>To be sure he never professed to teach this; but, by letting his own light shine, he led his disciples to hope that they through imitation of him would attain to such excellence.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Furthermore, he himself never neglected the body, and reproved such neglect in others. Thus over-eating followed by over-exertion he disapproved. But he approved of taking as much hard exercise as is agreeable to the soul;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. vi. 17.</note> for the habit not only insured good health, but did not hamper the care of the soul.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>On the other hand, he disliked foppery and pretentiousness in the fashion of clothes or shoes or in behaviour. Nor, again, did he encourage love of money in his companions. For while he checked their other desires, he would not make money himself out of their desire for his companionship.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>He held that this self-denying ordinance insured his liberty. Those who charged a fee for their society he denounced for selling themselves into bondage; since they were bound to converse with all from whom they took the fee.
</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>He marvelled that anyone should make money by the profession of virtue, and should not reflect that his highest reward would be the gain of a good friend; as though he who became a true gentleman could fail to feel deep gratitude for a benefit so great.</p></div>    
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p><persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> indeed never promised any such boon to anyone; but he was confident that those of his companions who adopted his principles of conduct would throughout life be good friends to him and to one another. How, then, should such a man “corrupt the youth”? Unless, perchance, it be corruption to foster virtue.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, said his accuser, he taught his companions to despise the established laws by insisting on the folly of appointing public officials by lot, when none would choose a pilot or builder or flautist by lot, nor any other craftsman for work in which mistakes are far less disastrous than mistakes in statecraft. Such sayings, he argued, led the young to despise the established constitution and made them violent.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>But I hold<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. iv. 21.</note> that they who cultivate wisdom and think they will be able to guide the people in prudent policy never lapse into violence: they know that enmities and dangers are inseparable from violence, but persuasion produces the same results safely and amicably. For violence, by making its victims sensible of loss, rouses their hatred: but persuasion, by seeming to confer a favour, wins goodwill. It is not, then, cultivation of wisdom that leads to violent methods, but the possession of power without prudence.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>Besides, many supporters are necessary to him who ventures to use force: but he who can persuade needs no confederate, having confidence in his own unaided power of persuasion. And such a man has no occasion to shed blood; for who would rather take a man's life than have a live and willing follower?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But his accuser argued thus.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Among the associates of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> were Critias and Alcibiades; and none wrought so many evils to the state. For Critias in the days of the oligarchy bore the palm for greed and violence: Alcibiades, for his part, exceeded all in licentiousness and insolence under the democracy.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>Now I have no intention of excusing the wrong these two men wrought the state; but I will explain how they came to be with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>Ambition was the very life-blood of both: no Athenian was ever like them. They were eager to get control of everything and to outstrip every rival in notoriety. They knew that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> was living on very little, and yet was wholly independent; that he was strictly moderate in all his pleasures; and that in argument he could do what he liked with any disputant.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Sharing this knowledge and the principles I have indicated, is it to be supposed that these two men wanted to adopt the simple life of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, and with this object in view sought his society? Did they not rather think that by associating with him they would attain the utmost proficiency in speech and action?</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>For my part I believe that, had heaven granted them the choice between the life they saw <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> leading and death, they would have chosen rather to die. Their conduct betrayed their purpose; for as soon as they thought themselves superior to their fellow-disciples they sprang away from <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> and took to politics; it was for political ends that they had wanted <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it may be answered: <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> should have taught his companions prudence before politics. I do not deny it; but I find that all teachers show their disciples how they themselves practise what they teach, and lead them on by argument. And I know that it was so with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>: he showed his companions that he was a gentleman himself, and talked most excellently of goodness and of all things that concern man.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>I know further that even those two were prudent so long as they were with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, not from fear of fine or blow, but because at that time they really believed in prudent conduct.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But many self-styled lovers of wisdom may reply: A just man can never become unjust; a prudent man can never become wanton; in fact no one having learned any kind of knowledge can become ignorant of it. I do not hold with this view.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VII. v. 75. Against Antisthenes.</note> I notice that as those who do not train the body cannot perform the functions proper to the body, so those who do not train the soul cannot perform the functions of the soul: for they cannot do what they ought to do nor avoid what they ought not to do.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>For this cause fathers try to keep their sons, even if they are prudent lads, out of bad company: for the society of honest men is a training in virtue, but the society of the bad is virtue's undoing. As one of the poets says:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“From the good shalt thou learn good things; but if thou minglest with the bad thou shalt lose even what thou hast of wisdom.”</l></quote><bibl>Theognis</bibl></cit>And another says:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“Ah, but a good man is at one time noble, at another base.”</l></quote><bibl>unknown</bibl></cit></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>My testimony agrees with theirs; for I see that, just as poetry is forgotten unless it is often repeated, so instruction, when no longer heeded, fades from the mind. To forget good counsel is to forget the experiences that prompted the soul to desire prudence: and when those are forgotten, it is not surprising that prudence itself is forgotten.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p>I see also that men who take to drink or get involved in love intrigues lose the power of caring about right conduct and avoiding evil. For many who are careful with their money no sooner fall in love than they begin to waste it: and when they have spent it all, they no longer shrink from making more by methods which they formerly avoided because they thought them disgraceful.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>How then can it be impossible for one who was prudent to lose his prudence, for one who was capable of just action to become incapable? To me indeed it seems that whatever is honourable, whatever is good in conduct is the result of training, and that this is especially true of prudence. For in the same body along with the soul are planted the pleasures which call to her: “Abandon prudence, and make haste to gratify us and the body.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And indeed it was thus with Critias and Alcibiades. So long as they were with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, they found in him an ally who gave them strength to conquer their evil passions. But when they parted from him, Critias fled to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, and got among men who put lawlessness before justice; while Alcibiades, on account of his beauty, was hunted by many great ladies, and because of his influence at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and among her allies he was spoilt by many powerful men: and as athletes who gain an easy victory in the games are apt to neglect their training, so the honour in which he was held, the cheap triumph he won with the people, led him to neglect himself.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p>Such was their fortune: and when to pride of birth, confidence in wealth, vainglory and much yielding to temptation were added corruption and long separation from <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, what wonder if they grew overbearing?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>For their wrongdoing, then, is <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> to be called to account by his accuser? And does he deserve no word of praise for having controlled them in the days of their youth, when they would naturally be most reckless and licentious? Other cases, at least, are not so judged.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p>For what teacher of flute, lyre, or anything else, after making his pupils proficient, is held to blame if they leave him for another master, and then turn out incompetent? What father, whose son bears a good character so long as he is with one master, but goes wrong after he has attached himself to another, throws the blame on the earlier teacher? Is it not true that the worse the boy turns out with the second, the higher is his father's praise of the first? Nay, fathers themselves, living with their sons, are not held responsible for their boys' wrongdoing if they are themselves prudent men.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p>This is the test which should have been applied to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> too. If there was anything base in his own life, he might fairly have been thought vicious. But, if his own conduct was always prudent, how can he be fairly held to blame for the evil that was not in him?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nevertheless, although he was himself free from vice, if he saw and approved of base conduct in them, he would be open to censure. Well, when he found that Critias loved Euthydemus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">IV. ii. 1.</note> and wanted to lead him astray, he tried to restrain him by saying that it was mean and unbecoming in a gentleman to sue like a beggar to the object of his affection, whose good opinion he coveted, stooping to ask a favour that it was wrong to grant.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
<p>As Critias paid no heed whatever to this protest, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, it is said, exclaimed in the presence of Euthydemus and many others, “Critias seems to have the feelings of a pig: he can no more keep away from Euthydemus than pigs can help rubbing themselves against stones.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>Now Critias bore a grudge against <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> for this; and when he was one of the Thirty and was drafting laws with Charicles, he bore it in mind. He inserted a clause which made it illegal “to teach the art of words.” It was a calculated insult to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, whom he saw no means of attacking, except by imputing to him the practice constantly attributed to philosophers,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the practice of “making the worse appear the better argument.” In Plato, <title>Apol.</title> 19b, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> makes Aristophanes (<title>Clouds</title>) author of this charge against him. Aristotle in the <title>Rhetoric</title> (B 24, 11) associates the practice with the name of Protagoras: cp. Diog. Laert. ix. 51.</note> and so making him unpopular. For I myself never heard <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> indulge in the practice, nor knew of anyone who professed to have heard him do so. The truth came out.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>When the Thirty were putting to death many citizens of the highest respectability and were encouraging many in crime, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> had remarked: “It seems strange enough to me that a herdsman<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VIII. ii. 14.</note> who lets his cattle decrease and go to the bad should not admit that he is a poor cowherd; but stranger still that a statesman when he causes the citizens to decrease and go to the bad, should feel no shame nor think himself a poor statesman.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>This remark was reported to Critias and Charicles, who sent for <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, showed him the law and forbade him to hold conversation with the young.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“May I question you,” asked <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “in case I do not understand any point in your orders?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“You may,” said they.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well now,” said he,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
<p>“I am ready to obey the laws. But lest I unwittingly transgress through ignorance, I want clear directions from you. Do you think that the art of words from which you bid me abstain is associated with sound or unsound reasoning? For if with sound, then clearly I must abstain from sound reasoning: but if with unsound, clearly I must try to reason soundly.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Since you are ignorant, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” said Charicles in an angry tone, “we put our order into language easier to understand. You may not hold any converse whatever with the young.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well then,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “that there may be no question raised about my obedience, please fix the age limit below which a man is to be accounted young.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“So long,” replied Charicles, “as he is not permitted to sit in the Council, because as yet he lacks wisdom. You shall not converse with anyone who is under thirty.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Suppose I want to buy something, am I not even then to ask the price if the seller is under thirty?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes,” answered Charicles, “you may in such cases. But the fact is, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, you are in the habit of asking questions to which you know the answer: so that is what you are not to do.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Am I to give no answer, then, if a young man asks me something that I know? — for instance, ‘Where does Charicles live?’ or ‘Where is Critias?’”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes,” answered Charicles, “you may, in such cases.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But you see, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” explained Critias, “you will have to avoid your favourite topic, — the cobblers, builders and metal workers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VI. ii. 37.</note>; for it is already worn to rags by you in my opinion.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then must I keep off the subjects of which these supply illustrations, Justice, Holiness, and so forth?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Indeed yes,” said Charicles, “and cowherds too: else you may find the cattle decrease.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus the truth was out: the remark about the cattle had been repeated to them: and it was this that made them angry with him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So much, then, for the connexion of Critias with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> and their relation to each other.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
<p>I venture to lay it down that learners get nothing from a teacher with whom they are out of sympathy. Now, all the time that Critias and Alcibiades associated with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> they were out of sympathy with him, but from the very first their ambition was political advancement. For while they were still with him, they tried to converse, whenever possible, with prominent politicians.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
<p>Indeed, there is a story told of Alcibiades, that, when he was less than twenty years old, he had a talk about laws with Pericles, his guardian, the first citizen in the State.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Tell me, Pericles,” he said, “can you teach me what a law is?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly,” he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then pray teach me. For whenever I hear men praised for keeping the laws, it occurs to me that no one can really deserve that praise who does not know what a law is.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
    <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, Alcibiades, there is no great difficulty about what you desire. You wish to know what a law is. Laws are all the rules approved and enacted by the majority in assembly, whereby they declare what ought and what ought not to be done.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Do they suppose it is right to do good or evil?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Good, of course, young man, — not evil.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But if, as happens under an oligarchy, not the majority, but a minority meet and enact rules of conduct, what are these?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Whatsoever the sovereign power in the State, after deliberation, enacts and directs to be done is known as a law.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“If, then, a despot, being the sovereign power, enacts what the citizens are to do, are his orders also a law?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, whatever a despot as ruler enacts is also known as a law.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But force, the negation of law, what is that, Pericles? Is it not the action of the stronger when he constrains the weaker to do whatever he chooses, not by persuasion, but by force?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That is my opinion.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then whatever a despot by enactment constrains the citizens to do without persuasion, is the negation of law?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I think so: and I withdraw my answer that whatever a despot enacts without persuasion is a law.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And when the minority passes enactments, not by persuading the majority, but through using its power, are we to call that force or not?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Everything, I think, that men constrain others to do ‘without persuasion,’ whether by enactment or not, is not law, but force.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“It follows then, that whatever the assembled majority, through using its power over the owners of property, enacts without persuasion is not law, but force?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Alcibiades,” said Pericles, “at your age, I may tell you, we, too, were very clever at this sort of thing. For the puzzles we thought about and exercised our wits on were just such as you seem to think about now.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Ah, Pericles,” cried Alcibiades, “if only I had known you intimately when you were at your cleverest in these things!”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So soon, then, as they presumed themselves to be the superiors of the politicians, they no longer came near <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. For apart from their general want of sympathy with him, they resented being cross-examined about their errors when they came. Politics had brought them to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, and for politics they left him.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48">
<p>But Criton was a true associate of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, as were Chaerophon, Chaerecrates, Hermogenes, Simmias, Cebes, Phaedondas, and others who consorted with him not that they might shine in the courts or the assembly, but that they might become gentlemen, and be able to do their duty by house and household, and relatives and friends, and city and citizens. Of these not one, in his youth or old age, did evil or incurred censure.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But,” said his accuser, “<persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> taught sons to treat their fathers with contempt: he persuaded them that he made his companions wiser than their fathers: he said that the law allowed a son to put his father in prison if he convinced a jury that he was insane; and this was a proof that it was lawful for the wiser to keep the more ignorant in gaol.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
<p>In reality <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> held that, if you clap fetters on a man for his ignorance, you deserve to be kept in gaol yourself by those whose knowledge is greater than your own: and such reasoning led him frequently to consider the difference between Madness and Ignorance. That madmen should be kept in prison was expedient, he thought, both for themselves and for their friends: but those who are ignorant of what they ought to know deserve to learn from those who know it.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But,” said his accuser, “<persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> caused his companions to dishonour not only their fathers, but their other relations as well, by saying that invalids and litigants get benefit not from their relations, but from their doctor or their counsel.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
<p>Of friends too he said that their goodwill was worthless, unless they could combine with it some power to help one: only those deserved honour who knew what was the right thing to do, and could explain it. Thus by leading the young to think that he excelled in wisdom and in ability to make others wise, he had such an effect on his companions that no one counted for anything in their estimation in comparison with him.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
<p>Now I know that he did use this language about fathers, relations and friends. And, what is more, he would say that so soon as the soul, the only seat of intelligence, is gone out of a man, even though he be our nearest and dearest, we carry out his body and hide it in the tomb.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54">
<p>Moreover, a man's dearest friend is himself: yet, even in his lifetime he removes or lets another remove from his body whatever is useless and unprofitable. He removes his own nails, hair, corns: he lets the surgeon cut and cauterize him, and, aches and pains notwithstanding, feels bound to thank and fee him for it. He spits out the saliva from his mouth as far away as he can, because to retain it doesn't help him, but harms him rather.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now in saying all this, he was not giving a lesson on “the duty of burying one's father alive, or making mincemeat of one's body”: he meant to show that unreason is unworth, and was urging the necessity of cultivating sound sense and usefulness, in order that he who would fain be valued by father or by brother or by anyone else may not rely on the bond of familiarity and neglect him, but may try to be useful to all those by whom he would be valued.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, his accuser alleged that he selected from the most famous poets the most immoral passages, and used them as evidence in teaching his companions to be tyrants and malefactors: for example, Hesiod's line:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace.”</l><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hes. WD 309">Hes. WD 309</bibl></note></quote><bibl>Hes. WD 309</bibl></cit>He was charged with explaining this line as an injunction to refrain from no work, dishonest or disgraceful, but to do anything for gain.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57">
<p>Now, though <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> would fully agree that it is a benefit and a blessing to a man to be a worker, and a disadvantage and an evil to be an idler — that work, in fact, is a blessing, idleness an evil — “working,” “being a worker,” meant to him doing good work; but gambling and any occupation that is immoral and leads to loss he called idling. When thus interpreted there is nothing amiss with the line:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace.”</l></quote><bibl>Hes. WD 309</bibl></cit></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58">
<p>Again, his accuser said that he often quoted the passage from Homer, showing how Odysseus:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“Whenever he found one that was a captain and a man of mark, stood by his side, and restrained him with gentle words: ‘Good sir, it is not seemly to affright thee like a coward, but do thou sit thyself and make all thy folk sit down...’ But whatever man of the people he saw and found him shouting, him he drove with his sceptre and chid him with loud words: ‘Good sir, sit still and hearken to the words of others that are thy betters: but thou art no warrior and a weakling, never reckoned whether in battle or in council.’”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.188">Hom. Il. 2.188</bibl>; Leaf's translation.</note></l></quote></cit><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This passage, it was said, he explained to mean that the poet approved of chastising common and poor folk.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59">
<p>But <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> never said that: indeed, on that view he would have thought himself worthy of chastisement. But what he did say was that those who render no service either by word or deed, who cannot help army or city or the people itself in time of need, ought to be stopped, even if they have riches in abundance, above all if they are insolent as well as inefficient.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60">
<p>But <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, at least, was just the opposite of all that: he showed himself to be one of the people and a friend of mankind. For although he had many eager disciples among citizens and strangers, yet he never exacted a fee for his society from one of them, but of his abundance he gave without stint to all. Some indeed, after getting from him a few trifles for nothing, became vendors of them at a great price to others, and showed none of his sympathy with the people, refusing to talk with those who had no money to give them.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Aristippus especially is meant.</note></p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61">
<p>But Socrates did far more to win respect for the State in the world at large than Lichas, whose services to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> have made his name immortal. For Lichas used to entertain the strangers staying at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> during the Feast of the Dancing Boys;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">According to Eusebius this festival, which was held in the summer, was instituted in honour of the Spartans who fell fighting against the Argives for the possession of Thyrea.</note> but <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> spent his life in lavishing his gifts and rendering the greatest services to all who cared to receive them. For he always made his associates better men before he parted with them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the character of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62">
<p>To me he seemed to deserve honour rather than death at the hands of the State. And a consideration of his case in its legal aspect will confirm my opinion. Under the laws, death is the penalty inflicted on persons proved to be thieves, highwaymen, cutpurses, kidnappers, robbers of temples; and from such criminals no man was so widely separated as he.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63">
<p>Moreover, to the State he was never the cause of disaster in war, or strife or treason or any evil whatever. Again, in private life no man by him was ever deprived of good or involved in ill.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64">
<p>None of these crimes was ever so much as imputed to him. How then could he be guilty of the charges? For so far was he from “rejecting the gods,” as charged in the indictment, that no man was more conspicuous for his devotion to the service of the gods: so far from “corrupting the youth,” as his accuser actually charged against him, that if any among his companions had evil desires, he openly tried to reform them and exhorted them to desire the fairest and noblest virtue, by which men prosper in public life and in their homes. By this conduct did he not deserve high honour from the State?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In order to support my opinion that he benefited his companions, alike by actions that revealed his own character and by his conversation, I will set down what I recollect of these.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First, then, for his attitude towards religion; his deeds and words were clearly in harmony with the answer given by the Priestess at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to such questions as “What is my duty about sacrifice?” or about “cult of ancestors.” For the answer of the Priestess is, “Follow the custom of the State: that is the way to act piously.” And so <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> acted himself and counselled others to act. To take any other course he considered presumption and folly.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And again, when he prayed he asked simply for good gifts,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. vi. 5.</note> “for the gods know best what things are good.” To pray for gold or silver or sovereignty or any other such thing, was just like praying for a gamble or a fight or anything of which the result is obviously uncertain.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Though his sacrifices were humble, according to his means, he thought himself not a whit inferior to those who made frequent and magnificent sacrifices out of great possessions. The gods (he said) could not well delight more in great offerings than in small — for in that case must the gifts of the wicked often have found more favour in their sight than the gifts of the upright — and man would not find life worth having, if the gifts of the wicked were received with more favour by the gods than the gifts of the upright. No, the greater the piety of the giver, the greater (he thought) was the delight of the gods in the gift. He would quote with approval the line:<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">“According to thy power render sacrifice to the immortal gods,’</l><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hes. WD 336">Hes. WD 336</bibl></note></quote></cit>and he would add that in our treatment of friends and strangers, and in all our behaviour, it is a noble principle to render according to our power.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>If ever any warning seemed to be given him from heaven, he would more easily have been persuaded to choose a blind guide who did not know the road in preference to one who could see and knew the way, than to disregard the admonition. All men, in fact, who flouted the warnings of the gods in their anxiety to avoid the censure of men, he denounced for their foolishness. He himself despised all human opinions in comparison with counsel given by the gods.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He schooled his body and soul by following, a system which, in all human calculation, would give him a life of confidence and security, and would make it easy to meet his expenses. For he was so frugal that it is hardly possible to imagine a man doing so little work as not to earn enough to satisfy the needs of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. He ate just sufficient food to make eating a pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found appetite the best sauce<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. v. 12.</note>: and any kind of drink he found pleasant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Whenever he accepted an invitation to dinner, he resisted without difficulty the common temptation to exceed the limit of satiety; and he advised those who could not do likewise to avoid appetizers that encouraged them to eat and drink what they did not want: for such trash was the ruin of stomach and brain and soul.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>“I believe,” he said in jest, “it was by providing a feast of such things that Circe made swine; and it was partly by the prompting of Hermes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In <title>Odyssey</title>, X. 281 f.</note> partly through his own self-restraint and avoidance of excessive indulgence in such things, that Odysseus was not turned into a pig.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>This was how he would talk on the subject, half joking, half in earnest.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of sensual passion he would say: “Avoid it resolutely: it is not easy to control yourself once you meddle with that sort of thing.” Thus, on hearing that Critobulus had kissed Alcibiades' pretty boy, he put this question to Xenophon before Critobulus:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>“Tell me, Xenophon, did you not suppose Critobulus to be a sober person, and by no means rash; prudent, and not thoughtless or adventurous?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly,” said Xenophon.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then you are to look on him henceforth as utterly hot-headed and reckless: the man would do a somersault into a ring of knives; he would jump into fire.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“What on earth has he done to make you think so badly of him?” asked Xenophon.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“What has the man done?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>What do you think will happen to you through kissing a pretty face? Won't you lose your liberty in a trice and become a slave, begin spending large sums on harmful pleasures, have no time to give to anything fit for a gentleman, be forced to concern yourself with things that no madman even would care about?”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Heracles! what alarming power in a kiss!” cried Xenophon.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“What? Does that surprise you?” continued <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. “Don't you know that the scorpion, though smaller than a farthing, if it but fasten on the tongue, inflicts excruciating and maddening pain?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, to be sure; for the scorpion injects something by its bite.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And do you think, you foolish fellow, that the fair inject nothing when they kiss, just because you don't see it?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus in the matter of carnal appetite, he held that those whose passions were not under complete control should limit themselves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm when the need was there.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Concerning eating and drinking then and carnal indulgence such were his views, and he thought that a due portion of pleasure would be no more lacking to him than to those who give themselves much to these, and that much less trouble would fall to his lot.</p></div>

The ears catch all sounds, but are never choked with them. Again, the incisors of all creatures are adapted for cutting, the molars for receiving food from them and grinding it. And again, the mouth, through which the food they want goes in, is set near the eyes and nostrils; but since what goes out is unpleasant, the ducts through which it passes are turned away and removed as far as possible from the organs of sense.

<p>Again, though all creatures have a tongue, the tongue of man alone has been formed by them to be capable of contact with different parts of the mouth, so as to enable us to articulate the voice and express all our wants to one another.

And what race of living things other than man worships gods?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Surely then, if we should refuse a vicious slave, the master must look to it that he does not grow vicious himself? For whereas the covetous, by robbing other men of their goods, seem to enrich themselves, a vicious man reaps no advantage from the harm he does to others. If he is a worker of mischief to others, he brings much greater mischief on himself, if indeed the greatest mischief of all is to ruin not one's home merely, but the body and the soul.</p></div>

<p>Is it that those who take money are bound to carry out the work for which they get a fee, while I, because I refuse to take it, am not obliged to talk with anyone against my will?

<p>For avoiding slavery to the belly or to sleep and incontinence, is there, think you, any more effective specific than the possession of other and greater pleasures, which are delightful not only to enjoy, but also because they arouse hopes of lasting benefit? And again, you surely know that while he who supposes that nothing goes well with him is unhappy, he who believes that he is successful in farming or a shipping concern or any other business he is engaged in is happy in the thought of his prosperity.</p></div>

<p>Clearly, then, if you set any value on your society, you would insist on getting the proper price for that too. It may well be that you are a just man because you do not cheat people through avarice; but wise you cannot be, since your knowledge is not worth anything.”</p></div>

Those who offer it to all comers for money are known as sophists, prostitutors of wisdom, but we think that he who makes a friend of one whom he knows to be gifted by nature, and teaches him all the good he can, fulfils the duty of a citizen and a gentleman.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>That is my own view, Antiphon. Others have a fancy for a good horse or dog or bird: my fancy, stronger even than theirs, is for good friends.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Suppose a bad flute-player wants to be thought a good one, let us note what he must do. Must he not imitate good players in the accessories of the art? First, as they wear fine clothes and travel with many attendants, he must do the same. Further, seeing that they win the applause of crowds, he must provide himself with a large claque. But, of course, he must never accept an engagement, or he will promptly expose himself to ridicule as an incompetent player and an impostor to boot. And so, what with incurring heavy expense and gaining nothing, and bringing disgrace on himself as well, he will make his life burdensome, unprofitable and ridiculous.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>So too if a man who is not a general or a pilot wanted to be thought a good one, let us imagine what would happen to him. If his efforts to seem proficient in these duties failed to carry conviction, would not his failure be galling to him? if they succeeded, would not his success be still more disastrous? for it is certain that if a man who knew nothing about piloting a ship or commanding an army were appointed to such work, he would lose those whom he least wanted to lose and would bring ruin and disgrace on himself.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By similar reasoning he would show how unprofitable is a reputation for wealth or courage or strength when it is undeserved. “Tasks beyond their powers,” he would say, “are laid on the incompetent, and no mercy is shown to them when they disappoint the expectation formed of their capability.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">

For states claim to treat their rulers just as I claim to treat my servants.

Rewards like these are indeed of little worth after all the toil; but what of those who toil to win good friends, or to subdue enemies, or to make themselves capable in body and soul of managing their own homes well, of helping their friends and serving their country?

It is strange too that a man should think he loses by his brothers because he cannot have their possessions as well as his own, and yet should not think that he loses by his fellow-citizens because their possessions are not his; and whereas in this case men can reflect that it is better to belong to a community, secure in the possession of a sufficiency, than to dwell in solitude with a precarious hold on all the property of their fellow-citizens, they fail to see that the same principle applies to brothers.</p></div>

For the hands cannot deal simultaneously with things that are more than six feet or so apart: the feet cannot reach in a single stride things that are even six feet apart: and the eyes, though they seem to have a longer range, cannot at the same moment see things still nearer than that, if some are in front and some behind.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, I once heard him give a discourse on friendship<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VIII. vii. 13.</note> that was likely, as I thought, to help greatly in the acquisition and use of friends.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For he said that he often heard it stated that of all possessions the most precious is a good and sincere friend. “And yet,” he said, “there is no transaction most men are so careless about as the acquisition of friends.</p></div>

For I find that they are careful about getting houses and lands and slaves and cattle and furniture, and anxious to keep what they have; but though they tell one that a friend is the greatest blessing, I find that most men take no thought how to get new friends or how to keep their old ones.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
Indeed, if one of their friends and one of their servants fall ill at the same time, I find that some call in the doctor to attend the servant and are careful to provide everything that may contribute to his recovery, whereas they take no heed of the friend. In the event of both dying, they are vexed at losing the servant, but don't feel that the death of the friend matters in the least. And though none of their other possessions is uncared for and unconsidered, they are deaf to their friends' need of attention.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
And besides all this, I find that most men know the number of their other possessions, however great it may be, yet cannot tell the number of their friends, few as they are; and, if they are asked and try to make a list, they will insert names and presently remove them. So much for the thought they give to their friends!</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
Yet surely there is no other possession that can compare with a good friend. For what horse, what yoke of oxen is so good a servant as the good friend? What slave so loyal and constant? or what possession so serviceable?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
The good friend is on the watch to supply whatever his friend wants for building up his private fortune and forwarding his public career. If generosity is called for, he does his part: if fear harasses, he comes to the rescue, shares expenses, helps to persuade, bears down opposition: he is foremost in delighting him when he is prosperous and raising him up when he falls.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
Of all that a man can do with his hands, see for himself with his eyes, hear for himself with his ears or accomplish with his feet, in nothing is a friend backward in helping.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, I once heard him exhort a listener — for so I interpreted his words — to examine himself and to ask how much he was worth to his friends. For he had noticed that one of his companions was neglecting a poverty-stricken friend; so he put a question to Antisthenes in the presence of several others, including the careless friend.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
“Antisthenes,” he said, “have friends like servants their own values? For one servant, I suppose, may be worth two minas,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Some 8 pounds.</note> another less than half a mina, another five minas, another no less than ten. Nicias, son of Niceratus, is said to have given a whole talent<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Some 240 pounds.</note> for a manager of his silver-mine. So I am led to inquire whether friends too may not differ in value.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes,” replied Antisthenes, “there are men whose friendship I, at any rate, would rather have than two minas: others I should value at less than half a mina: others I would prefer to ten minas: others I would sacrifice any sum and take any trouble to have among my friends.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then if that is so,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “were it not well that one should ask himself how much he is really worth to his friends, and try to make himself as precious as possible, in order that his friends may not be tempted to betray him? For my part, I often hear complaints of this sort: ‘A friend betrayed me,’ ‘one whom I regarded as my friend gave me up for the sake of a mina.’</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
I think over such matters and reflect that, when a man sells a bad slave he takes anything he can get for him; and perhaps it is tempting to sell a bad friend when there is a chance of getting more than he is worth. Good servants, I find, are not offered for sale, nor are good friends betrayed.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I did,” answered Critobulus, “for I saw that poor orators have good speakers among their friends, and some who are incapable of commanding an army are intimate with great generals.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Coming then to the point under discussion, do you know cases of useless persons making useful friends?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Assuredly not; but if it is impossible that the bad should gain the friendship of gentlemen, then I am anxious to know whether it is quite easy for a gentleman as a matter of course to be the friend of gentlemen?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Your trouble is, Critobulus, that you often find men who do good and shun evil not on friendly terms, but apt to quarrel and treat one another more harshly than worthless fellows.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes,” said Critobulus, “and such conduct is not confined to individuals, but even the cities that care most for the right and have least liking for the wrong are often at enmity.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>
These thoughts make me despair about the acquisition of friends. For I see on the one hand that rogues cannot be friends with one another — for how could the ungrateful, the careless, the selfish, the faithless, the incontinent, form friendships? I feel sure, then, that rogues are by their nature enemies rather than friends.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
But then, as you point out, neither can rogues ever join in friendship with honest men, for how can wrongdoers become friendly with those who hate their conduct? And if we must add that the votaries of virtue strive with one another for headship in cities, and envy and hate one another, who then will be friends and where shall loyalty and faithfulness be found?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Ah, Critobulus, but there is a strange complication in these matters. Some elements in man's nature make for friendship: men need one another, feel pity, work together for their common good, and, conscious of the facts, are grateful to one another. But there are hostile elements in men. For, holding the same things to be honourable and pleasant, they fight for them, fall out and take sides. Strife and anger lead to hostility, covetousness to enmity, jealousy to hatred.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
Nevertheless through all these barriers friendship slips, and unites the gentle natures. For thanks to their virtue these prize the untroubled security of moderate possessions above sovereignty won by war; despite hunger and thirst, they can share their food and drink without a pang; and although they delight in the charms of beauty they can resist the lure and avoid offending those whom they should respect;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
they can not only share wealth lawfully and keep from covetousness, but also supply one another's wants; they can compose strife not only without pain, but with advantage to one another, and prevent anger from pursuing its way towards remorse: but jealousy they take away utterly, regarding their own good things as belonging to their friends, and thinking their friend's good things to be their own.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
Surely, then, it is likely that true gentlemen will share public honours too not only without harm to one another, but to their common benefit? For those who desire to win honour and to bear rule in their cities that they may have power to embezzle, to treat others with violence, to live in luxury, are bound to be unjust, unscrupulous, incapable of unity.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
But if a man seeks to be honoured in a state that he may not be the victim of injustice himself and may help his friends in a just cause, and when he takes office may try to do some good to his country, why should he be incapable of union with one like himself? Will his connexion with other gentlemen render him less capable of serving his friends? Will he be less able to benefit his city with the help of other gentlemen?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>
Even in the public games it is clear that, if the strongest competitors were allowed to join forces against the weaker, they would win all the events, they would carry off all the prizes. True, that is not permitted in the games; but in politics, where the gentlemen are the strongest, nobody prevents anyone from forming any combination he may choose for the benefit of the state; surely, then, in public life it is a gain to make friends with the best, and to see in them partners and fellow-workers in a common cause, and not rivals.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>
But, again, it is equally clear that anyone who goes to war will need allies, and more of them if he is to fight an army of gentlemen. Moreover, those who are willing to fight at your side must be well treated that they may be willing to exert themselves; and it is a far sounder plan to show kindness to the best, who are fewer in number, than to the worst, who are the greater company; for the bad want many more kindnesses than the good.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
Courage, Critobulus; try to be good, and when you have achieved that, set about catching your gentleman. Maybe, I myself, as an adept in love, can lend you a hand in the pursuit of gentlemen. For when I want to catch anyone it's surprising how I strain every nerve to have my love returned, my longing reciprocated by him, in my eagerness that he shall want me as much as I want him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
I see that you too will feel this need when you want to form a friendship. So do not hide from me the names of those whom you wish to make your friends; for I am careful to please him who pleases me, and so, I think, I am not without experience in the pursuit of men.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” said Critobulus in reply, “these are the lessons I have long wished to learn, especially if the same skill will serve to win a good soul and a fair face.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Ah no, Critobulus,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “it belongs not to my skill to lay hands on the fair and force them to submit.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“A kiss for the fair,” exclaimed Critobulus, “and a thousand kisses for the good!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then you will permit me to say this about you to those whose friendship you desire.

If you don't yet see clearly, take the following cases as illustrations. Suppose that I wanted to get a shipmaster to make you his friend, and as a recommendation told him that you are a good skipper, which is untrue; and suppose that he believed me and put you in charge of his ship in spite of your not knowing how to steer it: have you any reason to hope that you would not lose the ship and your life as well? Or suppose that I falsely represented to the Assembly that you are a born general, jurist and statesman in one, and so persuaded the state to commit her fortunes to you, what do you suppose would happen to the state and to yourself under your guidance? Or again, suppose that I falsely described you to certain citizens in private as a thrifty, careful person, and persuaded them to place their affairs in your hands, wouldn't you do them harm and look ridiculous when you came to the test?</p></div>

Besides, at present, I fancy, you don't love these ladies and they don't love you: you think they are a tax on you, and they see that you feel them to be a burden.

To be sure, if they were going to do something disgraceful, death would be a better fate.

I think it's better than begging, especially as I have no security to offer for a loan.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And how long will you have the strength, do you think, to earn your living by your work?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh, not long, of course.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But remember, when you get old you will have to spend money, and nobody will be willing to pay you for your labour.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“True.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then it would be better to take up some kind of work at once that will assure you a competence when you get old, and to go to somebody who is better off and wants an assistant, and get a return for your services by acting as his bailiff, helping to get in his crops and looking after his property.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Briefly, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, I have no inclination to expose myself to any man's censure.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But, you see, Eutherus, it is by no means easy to find a post in which one is not liable to censure. Whatever one does, it is difficult to avoid mistakes, and it is difficult to escape unfair criticism even if one makes no mistakes. I wonder if you find it easy to avoid complaints entirely even from your present employers.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
You should try, therefore, to have no truck with grumblers and to attach yourself to considerate masters; to undertake such duties as you can perform and beware of any that are too much for you, and, whatever you do, to give of your best and put your heart into the business. In this way, I think, you are most likely to escape censure, find relief from your difficulties, live in ease and security, and obtain an ample competence for old age.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I remember that he once heard Criton say that life at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was difficult for a man who wanted to mind his own business. “At this moment,” Criton added, “actions are pending against me not because I have done the plaintiffs an injury, but because they think that I would sooner pay than have trouble.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Tell me, Criton,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “do you keep dogs to fend the wolves from your sheep?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly,” replied Criton, “because it pays me better to keep them.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then why not keep a man who may be able and willing to fend off the attempts to injure you?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I would gladly do so were I not afraid that he might turn on me.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“What? don't you see that it is much pleasanter to profit by humouring a man like you than by quarrelling with him? I assure you there are men in this city who would take pride in your friendship.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon they sought out Archedemus, an excellent speaker and man of affairs, but poor. For he was not one of those who make money unscrupulously, but an honest man, and he would say that it was easy to take forfeit from false accusers. So whenever Criton was storing corn, oil, wine, wool or other farm produce, he would make a present of a portion to Archedemus, and when he sacrificed, he invited him, and in fact lost no similar opportunity of showing courtesy.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
Archedemus came to regard Criton's house as a haven of refuge and constantly paid his respects to him. He soon found out that Criton's false accusers had much to answer for and many enemies. He brought one of them to trial on a charge involving damages or imprisonment.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
The defendant, conscious that he was guilty on many counts, did all he could to get quit of Archedemus. But Archedemus refused to let him off until he withdrew the action against Criton and compensated him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
Archedemus carried through several other enterprises of a similar kind; and now many of Criton's friends begged him to make Archedemus their protector, just as when a shepherd has a good dog the other shepherds want to pen their flocks near his, in order to get the use of his dog.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
Archedemus was glad to humour Criton, and so there was peace not only for Criton but for his friends as well. If anyone whom he had offended reproached Archedemus with flattering Criton because he found him useful, he would answer: “Which, then, is disgraceful: to have honest men for your friends, by accepting and returning their favours, and to fall out with rogues; or to treat gentlemen as enemies by trying to injure them, and to make friends of rogues by siding with them, and to prefer their intimacy?”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Archedemus surpasses even the <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> of Xenophon in the art of dressing up the obvious in the guise of a conundrum.</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Henceforward Archedemus was respected by Criton's friends and was himself numbered among them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, of course,” he replied, “and I invite others to help, by offering a reward for the recovery of the man.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And further, if one of your servants is ill, do you take care of him and call in doctors to prevent him dying?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Indeed I do.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, suppose that one of your acquaintance, who is much more useful than your servants, is near being ruined by want, don't you think it worth your while to take steps to save him?</p></div>

Now you know that Hermogenes is a conscientious man and would be ashamed to take a favour from you without making a return.

Good householders, you know, say that the right time to buy is when a valuable article can be bought at a low price; and in these times the circumstances afford an opportunity of acquiring good friends very cheap.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Thank you, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” said Diodorus, “pray bid Hermogenes call on me.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, indeed I won't,” said he; “for in my opinion it is at least as good for you to go to him yourself as to invite him to come to you, and you have quite as much to gain as he by doing so.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The consequence was that Diodorus set off to visit Hermogenes; and in return for a small sum he acquired a friend who made a point of thinking how he could help and please him either by word or deed.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I will now explain how he helped those who were eager to win distinction by making them qualify themselves for the honours they coveted.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He once heard that Dionysodorus had arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and gave out that he was going to teach generalship. Being aware that one of his companions wished to obtain the office of general from the state, he addressed him thus:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
“Young man, surely it would be disgraceful for one who wishes to be a general in the state to neglect the opportunity of learning the duties, and he would deserve to be punished by the state much more than one who carved statues without having learned to be a sculptor.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
For in the dangerous times of war the whole state is in the general's hands, and great good may come from his success and great evil from his failure. Therefore anyone who exerts himself to gain the votes, but neglects to learn the business, deserves punishment.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This speech persuaded the man to go and learn.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
When he had learnt his lesson and returned, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> chaffed him. “Don't you think, sirs,” he said, “that our friend looks more ‘majestic,’ as Homer called Agamemnon, now that he has learnt generalship? For just as he who has learnt to play the harp is a harper even when he doesn't play, and he who has studied medicine is a doctor even though he doesn't practise, so our friend will be a general for ever, even if no one votes for him. But your ignoramus is neither general nor doctor, even if he gets every vote.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
But,” he continued, “in order that any one of us who may happen to command a regiment or platoon under you may have a better knowledge of warfare, tell us the first lesson he gave you in generalship.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“The first was like the last,” he replied; “he taught me tactics — nothing else.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But then that is only a small part of generalship. For a general must also be capable of furnishing military equipment and providing supplies for the men;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I. vi. 14.</note> he must be resourceful, active, careful, hardy and quick-witted; he must be both gentle and brutal, at once straightforward and designing, capable of both caution and surprise, lavish and rapacious, generous and mean, skilful in defence and attack; and there are many other qualifications, some natural, some acquired, that are necessary to one who would succeed as a general.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
It is well to understand tactics too; for there is a wide difference between right and wrong disposition of the troops,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">ibid. VI. iii. 25.</note> just as stones, bricks, timber and tiles flung together anyhow are useless, whereas when the materials that neither rot nor decay, that is, the stones and tiles, are placed at the bottom and the top, and the bricks and timber are put together in the middle, as in building, the result is something of great value, a house, in fact.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Your analogy is perfect, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” said the youth; “for in war one must put the best men in the van and the rear,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">ibid.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well and good, provided that he taught you also to distinguish the good and the bad men. If not, what have you gained by your lessons? No more than you would have gained if he had ordered you to put the best money at the head and tail, and the worst in the middle, without telling you how to distinguish good from base coin.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I assure you he didn't; so we should have to judge for ourselves which are the good men and which are the bad.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then we had better consider how we may avoid mistaking them.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I want to do so,” said the youth.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well now,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “if we had to lay hands on a sum of money, would not the right arrangement be to put the most covetous men in the front?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I think so.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And what should we do with those who are going to face danger? Should our first line consist of the most ambitious?’<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes: they are the men who will face danger for the sake of glory.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “did he teach you only the disposition of an army, or did he include where and how to use each formation?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Not at all.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And yet there are many situations that call for a modification of tactics and strategy.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I assure you he didn't explain that.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then pray go back and ask him.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>One day when he met a man who had been chosen general, he asked him,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VIII. xi. 14.</note> “For what reason, think you, is Agamemnon dubbed ‘Shepherd of the people’ by Homer?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
Because a king is chosen, not to take good care of himself, but for the good of those who have chosen him;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> I.6.8.</note> and all men fight in order that they may get the best life possible, and choose generals to guide them to it.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, when someone had been chosen a leader of cavalry, I remember that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> conversed with him in the following manner:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Young man,” he said, “can you tell us why you hankered after a cavalry command? I presume it was not to be first of the cavalry in the charge; for that privilege belongs to the mounted archers; at any rate they ride ahead of their commanders even.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“True.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Nor was it to get yourself known either.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“But perhaps you think you can hand over the cavalry in better condition to the state when you retire, and can do something for the good of the state as a cavalry leader, in case there is any occasion to employ that arm?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, certainly,” said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “and no doubt it is a fine thing if you can do that.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Come then, tell us first how you propose to improve the horses.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh, but I don't think that is my business. Every man must look after his own horse.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then if some of your men appear on parade with their horses ailing or suffering from bad feet or sore legs, others with underfed animals that can't go the pace, others with restive brutes that won't keep in line, others with such bad kickers that it is impossible to line them up at all, what will you be able to make of your cavalry? how will you be able to do the state any good with a command like that?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I am much obliged to you,” he replied, “and I will try to look after the horses carefully.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Won't you also try to improve the men?” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I will.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then will you first train them to mount better?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes, I must, so that if anyone is thrown he may have a better chance of saving himself.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>

Don't look down on business men, Nicomachides. For the management of private concerns differs only in point of number from that of public affairs. In other respects they are much alike, and particularly in this, that neither can be carried on without men, and the men employed in private and public transactions are the same. For those who take charge of public affairs employ just the same men when they attend to their own; and those who understand how to employ them are successful directors of public and private concerns, and those who do not, fail in both.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Aristippus attempted to cross-examine <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> in the same fashion as he had been cross-examined by him in their previous encounter, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, wishing to benefit his companions, answered like a man who is resolved to do what is right, and not like a debater guarding against any distortion of the argument.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Aristippus asked if he knew of anything good, in order that if <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> mentioned some good thing, such as food, drink, money, health, strength, or daring, he might show that it is sometimes bad. But he, knowing that when anything troubles us we need what will put an end to the trouble, gave the best answer:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
“Are you asking me,” he said, “whether I know of anything good for a fever?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, not that.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“For ophthalmia?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, nor that.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“For hunger?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, not for hunger either.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, but if you are asking me whether I know of anything good in relation to nothing, I neither know nor want to know.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again Aristippus asked him whether he knew of anything beautiful: “Yes, many things,” he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“All like one another?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“On the contrary, some are as unlike as they can be.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“How then can that which is unlike the beautiful be beautiful?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“The reason, of course, is that a beautiful wrestler is unlike a beautiful runner, a shield beautiful for defence is utterly unlike a javelin beautiful for swift and powerful hurling.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That is the same answer as you gave to my question whether you knew of anything good.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“You think, do you, that good is one thing and beautiful another? Don't you know that all things are both beautiful and good in relation to the same things? In the first place, Virtue is not a good thing in relation to some things and a beautiful thing in relation to others. Men, again, are called ‘beautiful and good’ in the same respect and in relation to the same things: it is in relation to the same things that men's bodies look beautiful and good and that all other things men use are thought beautiful and good, namely, in relation to those things for which they are useful.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Is a dung basket beautiful then?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course, and a golden shield is ugly, if the one is well made for its special work and the other badly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Do you mean that the same things are both beautiful and ugly?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course — and both good and bad.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
For what is good for hunger is often bad for fever, and what is good for fever bad for hunger; what is beautiful for running is often ugly for wrestling, and what is beautiful for wrestling ugly for running. For all things are good and beautiful in relation to those purposes for which they are well adapted, bad and ugly in relation to those for which they are ill adapted.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again his dictum about houses, that the same house is both beautiful and useful, was a lesson in the art of building houses as they ought to be.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He approached the problem thus:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“When one means to have the right sort of house, must he contrive to make it as pleasant to live in and as useful as can be?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And this being admitted, “Is it pleasant,” he asked, “to have it cool in summer and warm in winter?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they agreed with this also, “Now in houses with a south aspect, the sun's rays penetrate into the porticoes in winter, but in summer the path of the sun is right over our heads and above the roof, so that there is shade. If, then, this is the best arrangement, we should build the south side loftier to get the winter sun and the north side lower to keep out the cold winds.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
To put it shortly, the house in which the owner can find a pleasant retreat at all seasons and can store his belongings safely is presumably at once the pleasantest and the most beautiful. As for paintings and decorations, they rob one of more delights than they give.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For temples and altars the most suitable position, he said, was a conspicuous site remote from traffic; for it is pleasant to breathe a prayer at the sight of them, and pleasant to approach them filled with holy thoughts.</p></div>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When asked again whether Courage could be taught or came by nature, he replied: “I think that just as one man's body is naturally stronger than another's for labour, so one man's soul is naturally braver than another's in danger. For I notice that men brought up under the same laws and customs differ widely in daring.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
Nevertheless, I think that every man's nature acquires more courage by learning and practice. Of course Scythians and Thracians would not dare to take bronze shield and spear and fight Lacedaemonians; and of course Lacedaemonians would not be willing to face Thracians with leather shields and javelins, nor Scythians with bows for weapons.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
And similarly in all other points, I find that human beings naturally differ one from another and greatly improve by application. Hence it is clear that all men, whatever their natural gifts, the talented and the dullards alike, must learn and practise what they want to excel in.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Between Wisdom and Prudence he drew no distinction; but if a man knows and practises what is beautiful and good, knows and avoids what is base,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Greek text is corrupt, but the sense is clear.</note> that man he judged to be both wise and prudent. When asked further whether he thought that those who know what they ought to do and yet do the opposite are at once wise and vicious, he answered: “No; not so much that, as both unwise and vicious. For I think that all men have a choice between various courses, and choose and follow the one which they think conduces most to their advantage. Therefore I hold that those who follow the wrong course are neither wise nor prudent.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He said that Justice and every other form of Virtue is Wisdom. “For just actions and all forms of virtuous activity are beautiful and good. He who knows the beautiful and good will never choose anything else, he who is ignorant of them cannot do them, and even if he tries, will fail. Hence the wise do what is beautiful and good, the unwise cannot and fail if they try. Therefore since just actions and all other forms of beautiful and good activity are virtuous actions, it is clear that Justice and every other form of Virtue is Wisdom.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Madness, again, according to him, was the opposite of Wisdom. Nevertheless he did not identify Ignorance with Madness; but not to know yourself, and to assume and think that you know what you do not, he put next to Madness. “Most men, however,” he declared, “do not call those mad who err in matters that lie outside the knowledge of ordinary people: madness is the name they give to errors in matters of common knowledge.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
For instance, if a man imagines himself to be so tall as to stoop when he goes through the gateways in the Wall, or so strong as to try to lift houses or to perform any other feat that everybody knows to be impossible, they say he's mad. They don't think a slight error implies madness, but just as they call strong desire love, so they name a great delusion madness.”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The last sentence cannot imply that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> thought self-ignorance “a slight error,” but must be merely a further elucidation of popular nomenclature. But it comes very awkwardly here.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Considering the nature of Envy, he found it to be a kind of pain, not, however, at a friend's misfortune, nor at an enemy's good fortune, but the envious are those only who are annoyed at their friends' successes. Some expressed surprise that anyone who loves another should be pained at his success, but he reminded them that many stand in this relation towards others, that they cannot disregard them in time of trouble, but aid them in their misfortune, and yet they are pained to see them prospering. This, however, could not happen to a man of sense, but it is always the case with fools.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Considering the nature of Leisure, he said his conclusion was that almost all men do something. Even draught-players and jesters do something, but all these are at leisure, for they might<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, if with Stobaeus we omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)cei=nai ga\r au)toi=s</foreign>, “have leisure to go.”</note> go and do something better. But nobody has leisure to go from a better to a worse occupation. If anyone does so, he acts wrongly, having no leisure.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">kakw=s e)/fh</foreign> with Stobaeus, “he does it in spite of want of leisure.”</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Kings and rulers, he said, are not those who hold the sceptre, nor those who are chosen by the multitude, nor those on whom the lot falls, nor those who owe their power to force or deception; but those who know how to rule.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cyropaedia, I. i. 3.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
For once it was granted that it is the business of the ruler to give orders and of the ruled to obey, he went on to show that on a ship the one who knows, rules, and the owner and all the others on board obey the one who knows: in farming the landowners, in illness the patients, in training those who are in training, in fact everybody concerned with anything that needs care, look after it themselves if they think they know how, but, if not, they obey those who know, and not only when such are present, but they even send for them when absent, that they may obey them and do the right thing. In spinning wool, again, he would point out, the women govern the men because they know how to do it and men do not.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If anyone objected that a despot may refuse to obey a good counsellor, “How can he refuse,” he would ask, “when a penalty waits on disregard of good counsel? All disregard of good counsel is bound surely to result in error, and his error will not go unpunished.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If anyone said that a despot can kill a loyal subject, “Do you think,” he retorted, “that he who kills the best of his allies suffers no loss, or that his loss is trifling? Do you think that this conduct brings him safety, or rather swift destruction?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When someone asked him what seemed to him the best pursuit for a man, he answered: “Doing well.” Questioned further, whether he thought good luck a pursuit, he said: “On the contrary, I think luck and doing are opposite poles. To hit on something right by luck without search I call good luck, to do something well after study and practice I call doing well; and those who pursue this seem to me to do well.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
And the best men and dearest to the gods,” he added, “are those who do their work well; if it is farming, as good farmers; if medicine, as good doctors; if politics, as good politicians. He who does nothing well is neither useful in any way nor dear to the gods.”</p></div>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10"><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then again, whenever he talked with artists who followed their art as a business, he was as useful to them as to others.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, on entering the house of Parrhasius the painter one day, he asked in the course of a conversation with him: “Is painting a representation of things seen, Parrhasius? Anyhow, you painters with your colours represent and reproduce figures high and low, in light and in shadow, hard and soft, rough and smooth, young and old.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“True.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And further, when you copy types of beauty, it is so difficult to find a perfect model that you combine the most beautiful details of several, and thus contrive to make the whole figure look beautiful.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, we do!”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well now, do you also reproduce the character of the soul, the character that is in the highest degree captivating, delightful, friendly, fascinating, lovable? Or is it impossible to imitate that?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh no, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>; for how could one imitate that which has neither shape nor colour nor any of the qualities you mentioned just now, and is not even visible?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Do human beings commonly express the feelings of sympathy and aversion by their looks?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I think so.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then cannot thus much be imitated in the eyes?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Undoubtedly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Do you think that the joys and sorrows of their friends produce the same expression on men's faces, whether they really care or not?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh no, of course not: they look radiant at their joys, downcast at their sorrows.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then is it possible to represent these looks too?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Undoubtedly.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Moreover, nobility and dignity, self-abasement and servility, prudence and understanding, insolence and vulgarity, are reflected in the face and in the attitudes of the body whether still or in motion.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“True.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then these, too, can be imitated, can they not?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Undoubtedly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Now which do you think the more pleasing sight, one whose features and bearing reflect a beautiful and good and lovable character, or one who is the embodiment of what is ugly and depraved and hateful?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No doubt there is a great difference, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On another occasion he visited Cleiton the sculptor, and while conversing with him said: “Cleiton, that your statues of runners, wrestlers, boxers and fighters are beautiful I see and know. But how do you produce in them that illusion of life which is their most alluring charm to the beholder?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As Cleiton was puzzled and did not reply at once, “Is it,” he added, “by faithfully representing the form of living beings that you make your statues look as if they lived?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Undoubtedly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then is it not by accurately representing the different parts of the body as they are affected by the pose — the flesh wrinkled or tense, the limbs compressed or outstretched, the muscles taut or loose — that you make them look more like real members and more convincing?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, certainly.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Does not the exact imitation of the feelings that affect bodies in action also produce a sense of satisfaction in the spectator?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Oh yes, presumably.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then must not the threatening look in the eyes of fighters be accurately represented, and the triumphant expression on the face of conquerors be imitated?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Most certainly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“It follows, then, that the sculptor must represent in his figures the activities of the soul.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On visiting Pistias the armourer, who showed him some well-made breastplates, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> exclaimed: “Upon my word, Pistias, it's a beautiful invention, for the breastplate covers the parts that need protection without impeding the use of the hands.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
But tell me, Pistias,” he added, “why do you charge more for your breastplates than any other maker, though they are no stronger and cost no more to make?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Because the proportions of mine are better, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And how do you show their proportions when you ask a higher price — by weight or measure? For I presume you don't make them all of the same weight or the same size, that is, if you make them to fit.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Fit? Why, of course! a breastplate is of no use without that!”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then are not some human bodies well, others ill proportioned?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then if a breastplate is to fit an ill-proportioned body, how do you make it well-proportioned?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“By making it fit; for if it is a good fit it is well-proportioned.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Apparently you mean well-proportioned not absolutely, but in relation to the wearer, as you might call a shield well-proportioned for the man whom it fits, or a military cape — and this seems to apply to everything according to you.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
And perhaps there is another important advantage in a good fit.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Tell it me, if you know, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“The good fit is less heavy to wear than the misfit, though both are of the same weight. For the misfit, hanging entirely from the shoulders, or pressing on some other part of the body, proves uncomfortable and irksome; but the good fit, with its weight distributed over the collar-bone and shoulder-blades, the shoulders, chest, back and belly, may almost be called an accessory rather than an encumbrance.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“The advantage you speak of is the very one which I think makes my work worth a big price. Some, however, prefer to buy the ornamented and the gold-plated breastplates.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Still, if the consequence is that they buy misfits, it seems to me they buy ornamented and gold-plated trash.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
However, as the body is not rigid, but now bent, now straight, how can tight breastplates fit?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“They can't.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“You mean that the good fits are not the tight ones, but those that don't chafe the wearer?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That is your own meaning, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, and you have hit the right nail on the head.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11"><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At one time there was in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> a beautiful woman named Theodote/, who was ready to keep company with anyone who pleased her. One of the bystanders mentioned her name, declaring that words failed him to describe the lady's beauty, and adding that artists visited her to paint her portrait, and she showed them as much as decency allowed. “We had better go and see her,” cried <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>; “of course what beggars description can't very well be learned by hearsay.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Come with me at once,” returned his informant. So off they went to Theodote/'s house, where they found her posing before a painter, and looked on.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the painter had finished, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> said: “My friends, ought we to be more grateful to Theodote/ for showing us her beauty, or she to us for looking at it? Does the obligation rest with her, if she profits more by showing it, but with us, if we profit more by looking?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When someone answered that this was a fair way of putting it, “Well now,” he went on, “she already has our praise to her credit, and when we spread the news, she will profit yet more; whereas we already long to touch what we have seen, and we shall go away excited and shall miss her when we are gone. The natural consequence is that we become her adorers, she the adored.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then, if that is so,” exclaimed Theodote/, “of course I ought to be grateful to you for looking.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this point <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> noticed that she was sumptuously dressed, and that her mother at her side was wearing fine clothes and jewellery; and she had many pretty maids, who also were well cared for, and her house was lavishly furnished.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Tell me, Theodote/,” he said, “have you a farm?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Not I,” she answered.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Or a house, perhaps, that brings in money?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, nor a house.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Some craftsmen, possibly?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, none.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then where do you get your supplies from?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I live on the generosity of any friend I pick up.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“A fine property, upon my word, Theodote/, and much better than abundance of sheep and goats and oxen. But,” he went on, “do you trust to luck, waiting for friends to settle on you like flies, or have you some contrivance of your own?”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“How could I invent a contrivance for that?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Much more conveniently, I assure you, than the spiders. For you know how they hunt for a living: they weave a thin web, I believe, and feed on anything that gets into it.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And do you advise me, then, to weave a trap of some sort?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course not.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
Since hares feed by night, hounds specially adapted for night work are provided to hunt them; and since they run away at daybreak, another pack of hounds is obtained for tracking them by the scent along the run from the feeding ground to the form; and since they are so nimble that once they are off they actually escape in the open, yet a third pack of speedy hounds is formed to catch them by hot pursuit; and as some escape even so, nets are set up in the tracks where they escape, that they may be driven into them and stopped dead.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then can I adapt this plan to the pursuit of friends?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course you can, if for the hound you substitute an agent who will track and find rich men with an eye for beauty, and will then contrive to chase them into your nets.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Nets! What nets have I got?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“One, surely, that clips close enough — your body! And inside it you have a soul that teaches you what glance will please, what words delight, and tells you that your business is to give a warm welcome to an eager suitor, but to slam the door upon a coxcomb; yes, and when a friend has fallen sick, to show your anxiety by visiting him; and when he has had a stroke of good fortune, to congratulate him eagerly; and if he is eager in his suit, to put yourself at his service heart and soul. As for loving, you know how to do that, I am sure, both tenderly and truly; and that your friends give you satisfaction, you convince them, I know, not by words but by deeds.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Upon my word,” said Theodote/, “I don't contrive one of these things.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Nevertheless,” he continued, “it is very important that your behaviour to a man should be both natural and correct. For assuredly you can neither catch a friend nor keep him by violence;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Cyropaedia</title> VIII. vii. 13.</note> it is kindness and sweetness that catch the creature and hold him fast.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“True,” she said.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“First, then, you must ask such favours of your suitors as they will grant without a moment's hesitation; and next you must repay their favours in the same coin; for in this way they will prove most sincerely your friends, most constant in their affection and most generous.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
And they will appreciate your favours most highly if you wait till they ask for them. The sweetest meats, you see, if served before they are wanted, seem sour, and to those who have had enough they are positively nauseating; but even poor fare is very welcome when offered to a hungry man.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And how can I make them hunger for my fare?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Why, in the first place, you must not offer it to them when they have had enough, nor prompt them until they have thrown off the surfeit and are beginning to want more; then, when they feel the want, you must prompt them by behaving as a model of propriety, by a show of reluctance to yield, and by holding back until they are as keen as can be; for then the same gifts are much more to the recipient than when they are offered before they are desired.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” exclaimed Theodote/, “why don't you become my partner in the pursuit of friends?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“By all means — if you persuade me.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And how am I to persuade you?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That you will find out and contrive for yourself, if you want my help.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Come and see me often, then.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On noticing that Epigenes, one of his companions, was in poor condition, for a young man, he said: “You look as if you need exercise,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="grc">i)diw/ths</foreign> is one who is ignorant of any profession or occupation: <foreign xml:lang="grc">i)diwtikw=s e)/xein</foreign> here means to be ignorant of athletic training.</note> Epigenes.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well,” he replied, “I'm not an athlete, Socrates.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Just as much as the competitors entered for <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>,” he retorted. “Or do you count the life and death struggle with their enemies, upon which, it may be, the Athenians will enter, but a small thing?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
Why, many, thanks to their bad condition, lose their life in the perils of war or save it disgracefully: many, just for this same cause, are taken prisoners, and then either pass the rest of their days, perhaps, in slavery of the hardest kind, or, after meeting with cruel sufferings and paying, sometimes, more than they have, live on, destitute and in misery. Many, again, by their bodily weakness earn infamy, being thought cowards.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
Or do you despise these, the rewards of bad condition, and think that you can easily endure such things? And yet I suppose that what has to be borne by anyone who takes care to keep his body in good condition is far lighter and far pleasanter than these things. Or is it that you think bad condition healthier and generally more serviceable than good, or do you despise the effects of good condition?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
And yet the results of physical fitness are the direct opposite of those that follow from unfitness. The fit are healthy and strong; and many, as a consequence, save themselves decorously on the battle-field and escape all the dangers of war; many help friends and do good to their country and for this cause earn gratitude; get great glory and gain very high honours, and for this cause live henceforth a pleasanter and better life, and leave to their children better means of winning a livelihood.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I tell you, because military training is not publicly recognised by the state, you must not make that an excuse for being a whit less careful in attending to it yourself. For you may rest assured that there is no kind of struggle, apart from war, and no undertaking in which you will be worse off by keeping your body in better fettle. For in everything that men do the body is useful; and in all uses of the body it is of great importance to be in as high a state of physical efficiency as possible.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
Why, even in the process of thinking, in which the use of the body seems to be reduced to a minimum, it is matter of common knowledge that grave mistakes may often be traced to bad health. And because the body is in a bad condition, loss of memory, depression, discontent, insanity often assail the mind so violently as to drive whatever knowledge it contains clean out of it.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
But a sound and healthy body is a strong protection to a man, and at least there is no danger then of such a calamity happening to him through physical weakness: on the contrary, it is likely that his sound condition will serve to produce effects the opposite of those that arise from bad condition. And surely a man of sense would submit to anything to obtain the effects that are the opposite of those mentioned in my list.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whenever some of the members of a dining-club brought more meat<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="grc">o)/yon,</foreign> literally a tit-bit eaten with bread; Lat. pulmentum.</note> than others, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> would tell the waiter either to put the small contribution into the common stock or to portion it out equally among the diners. So the high batteners felt obliged not only to take their share of the pool, but to pool their own supplies in return; and so they put their own supplies also into the common stock. And since they thus got no more than those who brought little with them, they gave up spending much on meat.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He observed on one occasion that one of the company at dinner had ceased to take bread, and ate the meat by itself. Now the talk was of names and the actions to which they are properly applied. “Can we say, my friends,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “what is the nature of the action for which a man is called greedy? For all, I presume, eat meat with their bread when they get the chance: but I don't think there is so far any reason for calling them greedy?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, certainly not,” said one of the company.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, suppose he eats the meat alone, without the bread, not because he's in training, but to tickle his palate, does he seem a greedy fellow or not?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“If not, it's hard to say who does,” was the reply.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here another of the company queried, “And he who eats a scrap of bread with a large helping of meat?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“He too seems to me to deserve the epithet,” said <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. “Aye, and when others pray for a good wheat harvest, he, presumably, would pray for a good meat supply.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The young man, guessing that these remarks of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> applied to him, did not stop eating his meat, but took some bread with it. When <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> observed this, he cried: “Watch the fellow, you who are near him, and see whether he treats the bread as his meat or the meat as his bread.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On another occasion he noticed one of the company at dinner tasting several dishes with each bite of bread. “Can you imagine,” he asked, “a meal more extravagant and more ruinous to the victuals than his who eats many things together, and crams all sorts of sauces into his mouth at once? At any rate by mixing more ingredients than the cooks, he adds to the cost, and since he mixes ingredients that they regard as unsuitable in a mixture, if they are right, then he is wrong and is ruining their art.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
Yet it is surely ridiculous for a master to obtain highly skilled cooks, and then, though he claims no knowledge of the art, to alter their confections? There's another drawback, too, attaching to the habit of eating many things together. For if many dishes are not provided, one seems to go short because one misses the usual variety: whereas he who is accustomed to take one kind of meat along with one bit of bread can make the best of one dish when more are not forthcoming.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He used to say too that the term “good feeding” in Attic was a synonym for “eating.” The “good” in the compound implied the eating of food that could harm neither body nor soul and was not hard to come by.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he would often say he was “in love”; but clearly his heart was set not on those who were fair to outward view, but on those whose souls excelled in goodness. These excellent beings he recognised by their quickness to learn whatever subject they studied, ability to remember what they learned, and desire for every kind of knowledge on which depend good management of a household and estate and tactful dealing with men and the affairs of men. For education would make such beings not only happy in themselves, and successful in the management of their households, but capable of conferring happiness on their fellow-men and on states alike. His method of approach varied.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
To those who thought themselves possessed of natural endowments and despised learning, he explained that the greater the natural gifts, the greater is the need of education; pointing out that thoroughbreds by their spirit and mettle develop into serviceable and splendid creatures, if they are broken in as colts, but if unbroken, prove intractable and sorry jades; and high-bred puppies, keen workers and good tacklers of game, make first-rate hounds and useful dogs, if well trained, but, if untrained, turn out stupid, crazy, disobedient brutes. It is the same with human beings.</p></div>

The most highly gifted, the youths of ardent soul, capable of doing whatever they attempt, if educated and taught their duty grow into excellent and useful men; for manifold and great are their good deeds.

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I will now show his method of dealing with those who thought they had received the best education, and prided themselves on wisdom. He was informed that Euthydemus, the handsome, had formed a large collection of the works of celebrated poets and professors, and therefore supposed himself to be a prodigy of wisdom for his age, and was confident of surpassing all competitors in power of speech and action. At present, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> observed, he did not enter the Market-place owing to his youth, but when he wanted to get anything done, he would be found sitting in a saddler's shop near the Market. So, to make an opening, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> went to this shop with some of his companions.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the first visit, one of them asked: </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
“Was it by constant intercourse with some wise man or by natural ability that Themistocles stood out among his fellow-citizens as the man to whom the people naturally looked when they felt the want of a great leader?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In order to set Euthydemus thinking, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> said:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“If in the minor arts great achievement is impossible without competent masters, surely it is absurd to imagine that the art of statesmanship, the greatest of all accomplishments, comes to a man of its own accord.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Some time afterwards, meeting Euthydemus again, he saw that he was reluctant to join the circle and anxious not to betray any admiration for the wisdom of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>: “Well, gentlemen,” said he, “when our friend Euthydemus has attained his full powers, and some question of policy is before the Assembly, he won't be backward in offering advice: that is obvious from his behaviour. I fancy he has prepared a noble exordium to his addresses, with due care not to give the impression that he is indebted to anyone for his knowledge. No doubt he will begin his speech with this introduction:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“‘Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I have never yet learnt anything from anyone, nor when I have been told of any man's ability in speech and in action, have I sought to meet him, nor have I been at pains to find a teacher among the men who know.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when it became evident that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> had gained the attention of Euthydemus, but that Euthydemus still avoided breaking silence himself, and thought that he assumed an air of prudence by remaining dumb, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> wanted to put an end to that affectation. “How strange it is,” he said, “that those who want to play the harp or the flute, or to ride or to get skill in any similar accomplishment, work hard at the art they mean to master, and not by themselves but under the tuition of the most eminent professors, doing and bearing anything in their anxiety to do nothing without their teachers' guidance, just because that is the only way to become proficient: and yet, among those who want to shine as speakers in the Assembly and as statesmen, there are some who think that they will be able to do so on a sudden, by instinct, without training or study.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
Yet surely these arts are much the harder to learn; for many more are interested in them and far fewer succeed. Clearly then these arts demand a longer and more intense application than the others.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Skill in speaking and efficiency in affairs, therefore, and ingenuity, were not the qualities that he was eager to foster in his companions.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the first place, then, he tried to make his companions prudent towards the gods. Accordingly he discoursed on this topic at various times, as those who were present used to relate. The following conversation between him and Euthydemus I heard myself.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Tell me, Euthydemus,” he began, “has it ever occurred to you to reflect on the care the gods have taken to furnish man with what he needs?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“No, indeed it has not,” replied Euthydemus.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Well, no doubt you know that our first and foremost need is light, which is supplied to us by the gods?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course; since without light our eyes would be as useless as if we were blind.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And again, we need rest; and therefore the gods grant us the welcome respite of night.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, for that too we owe them thanks.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And since the night by reason of her darkness is dim, whereas the sun by his brightness illuminates the hours of the day and all things else, have they not made stars to shine in the night, that mark the watches of night for us, and do we not thereby satisfy many of our needs?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That is so.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Moreover, the moon reveals to us not only the divisions of the night, but of the month too.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Now, seeing that we need food, think how they make the earth to yield it, and provide to that end appropriate seasons which furnish in abundance the diverse things that minister not only to our wants but to our enjoyment.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Truly these things too show loving-kindness.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Think again of their precious gift of water, that aids the earth and the seasons to give birth and increase to all things useful to us and itself helps to nourish our bodies, and mingling with all that sustains us, makes it more digestible, more wholesome, and more palatable: and how, because we need so much of it, they supply it without stint.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“That too shows design at work.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Think again of the blessing of fire, our defence against cold and against darkness, our helpmate in every art and all that man contrives for his service.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Think again how the sun, when past the winter solstice, approaches, ripening some things and withering others, whose time is over; and having accomplished this, approaches no nearer, but turns away, careful not to harm us by excess of heat; and when once again in his retreat he reaches the point where it is clear to ourselves, that if he goes further away, we shall be frozen with the cold, back he turns once more and draws near and revolves in that region of the heavens where he can best serve us.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, verily, these things do seem to be done for the sake of mankind.”</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes,” replied <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, “and is it not evident that they too receive life and food for the sake of man? For what creature reaps so many benefits as man from goats and sheep and horses and oxen and asses and the other animals? He owes more to them, in my opinion, than to the fruits of the earth. At the least they are not less valuable to him for food and commerce; in fact a large portion of mankind does not use the products of the earth for food, but lives on the milk and cheese and flesh they get from live stock. Moreover, all men tame and domesticate the useful kinds of animals, and make them their fellow-workers in war and many other undertakings.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“There too I agree with you, seeing that animals far stronger than man become so entirely subject to him that he puts them to any use he chooses.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, and you will realise the truth of what I say if, instead of waiting for the gods to appear to you in bodily presence, you are content to praise and worship them because you see their works. Mark that the gods themselves give the reason for doing so; for when they bestow on us their good gifts, not one of them ever appears before us gift in hand; and especially he who co-ordinates and holds together the universe, wherein all things are fair and good, and presents them ever unimpaired and sound and ageless for our use,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">ibid.

Mark that even the sun, who seems to reveal himself to all, permits not man to behold him closely, but if any attempts to gaze recklessly upon him, blinds their eyes. And the gods' ministers too you will find to be invisible. That the thunderbolt is hurled from heaven, and that he overwhelms all on whom he falls, is evident, but he is seen neither coming nor striking nor going. And the winds are themselves invisible, yet their deeds are manifest to us, and we perceive their approach. Moreover, the soul of man, which more than all else that is human partakes of the divine, reigns manifestly within us, and yet is itself unseen.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“For these reasons it behoves us not to despise the things that are unseen, but, realising their power in their manifestations, to honour the godhead.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“<persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,” replied Euthydemus, “that I will in no wise be heedless of the godhead I know of a surety. But my heart fails me when I think that no man can ever render due thanks to the gods for their benefits.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Nay, be not down-hearted, Euthydemus; for you know that to the inquiry, ‘How am I to please the gods?’ the Delphic god replies, ‘Follow the custom of the state'; and everywhere, I suppose, it is the custom that men propitiate the gods with sacrifices according to their power. How then can a man honour the gods more excellently and more devoutly than by doing as they themselves ordain?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
Only he must fall no whit short of his power. For when he does that, it is surely plain that he is not then honouring the gods.

And when the Thirty laid a command on him that was illegal, he refused to obey.

Again, when he was tried on the charge brought by Meletus, whereas it is the custom of defendants to curry favour with the jury and to indulge in flattery and illegal appeals, and many by such means have been known to gain a verdict of acquittal, he rejected utterly the familiar chicanery of the courts; and though he might easily have gained a favourable verdict by even a moderate indulgence in such stratagems, he chose to die through his loyalty to the laws rather than to live through violating them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such views frequently found expression in his conversations with different persons; I recollect the substance of one that he had with Hippias of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> concerning Justice. Hippias, who had not been in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for a considerable time, found <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> talking: he was saying that if you want to have a man taught cobbling or building or smithing or riding, you know where to send him to learn the craft: some indeed declare that if you want to train up a horse or an ox in the way he should go, teachers abound. And yet, strangely enough, if you want to learn Justice yourself, or to have your son or servant taught it, you know not where to go for a teacher.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Hippias heard this, “How now?” he cried in a tone of raillery, “still the same old sentiments, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, that I heard from you so long ago?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Yes, Hippias,” he replied, “always the same, and — what is more astonishing — on the same topics too!

For example, in answer to the question, ‘How many letters are there in “<persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>” and how do you spell it?’ do you try to say something different now from what you said before?

And to whom would allies rather entrust leadership or command of a garrison, or cities? Whom would anyone more confidently expect to show gratitude for benefits received? Or whom would one rather benefit than him from whom he thinks he will receive due gratitude? Whose friendship would anyone desire, or whose enmity would he avoid more earnestly?

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He did also try to make his companions efficient in affairs, as I will now show.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Kingship and despotism, in his judgment, were both forms of government, but he held that they differed. For government of men with their consent and in accordance with the laws of the state was kingship; while government of unwilling subjects and not controlled by laws, but imposed by the will of the ruler, was despotism. And where the officials are chosen among those who fulfil the requirements of the laws, the constitution is an aristocracy: where rateable property is the qualification for office, you have a plutocracy: where all are eligible, a democracy.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whenever anyone argued with him on any point without being able to make himself clear, asserting but not proving, that so and so was wiser or an abler politician or braver or what not, he would lead the whole discussion back to the definition required, much in this way:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Do you say that your man is a better citizen than mine?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I do indeed.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Then why didn't we first consider what is the function of a good citizen?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Let us do so.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“In financial administration, then, is not the better man he who makes the city wealthier?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Certainly.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And in war he who makes her stronger than her rivals?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Of course.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And on an embassy he who turns enemies into friends?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“Presumably.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“And in debate he who puts down strife and produces harmony?”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“I think so.”<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By this process of leading back the argument even his adversay came to see the truth clearly.</p></div>

Whenever he himself argued out a question, he advanced by steps that gained general assent, holding this to be the only sure method. Accordingly, whenever he argued, he gained a greater measure of assent from his hearers than any man I have known. He said that Homer gave Odysseus the credit of being “a safe speaker”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Odyssey,</title> viii. 171.</note> because he had a way of leading the discussion from one acknowledged truth to another.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think that I have said enough to show that <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> stated his own opinion plainly to those who consorted with him: I will now show that he also took pains to make them independent in doing the work that they were fitted for. For I never knew a man who was so careful to discover what each of his companions knew. Whatever it befits a gentleman to know he taught most zealously, so far as his own knowledge extended; if he was not entirely familiar with a subject, he took them to those who knew.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
He also taught them how far a well-educated man should make himself familiar with any given subject.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For instance, he said that the study of geometry should be pursued until the student was competent to measure a parcel of land accurately in case he wanted to take over, convey or divide it, or to compute the yield; and this knowledge was so easy to acquire, that anyone who gave his mind to mensuration knew the size of the piece and carried away a knowledge of the principles of land measurement.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
He was against carrying the study of geometry so far as to include the more complicated figures, on the ground that he could not see the use of them. Not that he was himself unfamiliar with them, but he said that they were enough to occupy a lifetime, to the complete exclusion of many other useful studies.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Similarly he recommended them to make themselves familiar with astronomy, but only so far as to be able to find the time of night, month and year, in order to use reliable evidence when planning a journey by land or sea, or setting the watch, and in all other affairs that are done in the night or month or year, by distinguishing the times and seasons aforesaid. This knowledge, again, was easily to be had from night hunters and pilots and others who made it their business to know such things.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
But he strongly deprecated studying astronomy so far as to include the knowledge of bodies revolving in different courses, and of planets and comets, and wearing oneself out with the calculation of their distance from the earth, their periods of revolution and the causes of these. Of such researches, again he said that he could not see what useful purpose they served. He had indeed attended lectures on these subjects too; but these again, he said, were enough to occupy a lifetime to the complete exclusion of many useful studies.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In general, with regard to the phenomena of the heavens, he deprecated curiosity to learn how the deity contrives them: he held that their secrets could not be discovered by man, and believed that any attempt to search out what the gods had not chosen to reveal must be displeasing to them. He said that he who meddles with these matters runs the risk of losing his sanity as completely as Anaxagoras, who took an insane pride in his explanation of the divine machinery.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For that sage, in declaring the sun to be fire, ignored the facts than men can look at fire without inconvenience, but cannot gaze steadily at the sun; that their skin is blackened by the sun's rays, but not by fire. Further, he ignored the fact that sunlight is essential to the health of all vegetation, whereas if anything is heated by fire it withers. Again, when he pronounced the sun to be a red-hot stone, he ignored the fact that a stone in fire neither glows nor can resist it long, whereas the sun shines with unequalled brilliance for ever.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He also recommended the study of arithmetic. But in this case as in the others he recommended avoidance of vain application; and invariably, whether theories or ascertained facts formed the subject of his conversation, he limited it to what was useful.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He also strongly urged his companions to take care of their health. “You should find out all you can,” he said, “from those who know. Everyone should watch himself throughout his life, and notice what sort of meat and drink and what form of exercise suit his constitution, and how he should regulate them in order to enjoy good health. For by such attention to yourselves you can discover better than any doctor what suits your constitution.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When anyone was in need of help that human wisdom was unable to give he advised him to resort to divination; for he who knew the means whereby the gods give guidance to men concerning their affairs never lacked divine counsel.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for his claim that he was forewarned by “the deity” what he ought to do and what not to do, some may think that it must have been a delusion because he was condemned to death. But they should remember two facts. First, he had already reached such an age, that had he not died then, death must have come to him soon after. Secondly, he escaped the most irksome stage of life and the inevitable diminution of mental powers, and instead won glory by the moral strength revealed in the wonderful honesty and frankness and probity of his defence, and in the equanimity and manliness with which he bore the sentence of death.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In fact it is admitted that there is no record of death more nobly borne. For he was forced to live for thirty days after the verdict was given, because it was the month of the Dêlia,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See Plato, <title>Phaedo,</title> p. 58 b. The festival was held in the month Thargelion, our May.</note> and the law did not allow any public execution to take place until the sacred embassy had returned from Delos. During this interval, as all his intimate acquaintances could see, he continued to live exactly as before; and, in truth, before that time he had been admired above all men for his cheerfulness and serenity.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
How, then, could man die more nobly? Or what death could be nobler than the death most nobly faced? What death more blessed than the noblest? Or what dearer to the gods than the most blessed?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I will repeat what Hermogenes, son of Hipponicus, told me about him. “When Meletus had actually formulated his indictment,” he said, “Socrates talked freely in my presence, but made no reference to the case. I told him that he ought to be thinking about his defence. His first remark was, ‘Don't you think that I have been preparing for it all my life?’ And when I asked him how, he said that he had been constantly occupied in the consideration of right and wrong, and in doing what was right and avoiding what was wrong, which he regarded as the best preparation for a defence.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
Then I said, ‘Don't you see, Socrates, that the juries in our courts are apt to be misled by argument, so that they often put the innocent to death, and acquit the guilty?’ ‘Ah, yes, Hermogenes,’ he answered, ‘but when I did try to think out my defence to the jury, the deity at once resisted.’</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
‘Strange words,’ said I; and he, ‘Do you think it strange, if it seems better to God that I should die now? Don't you see that to this day I never would acknowledge that any man had lived a better or a pleasanter life than I? For they live best, I think, who strive best to become as good as possible: and the pleasantest life is theirs who are conscious that they are growing in goodness.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
And to this day that has been my experience; and mixing with others and closely comparing myself with them, I have held without ceasing to this opinion of myself. And not I only, but my friends cease not to feel thus towards me, not because of their love for me (for why does not love make others feel thus towards their friends?), but because they think that they too would rise highest in goodness by being with me.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
But if I am to live on, haply I may be forced to pay the old man's forfeit — to become sand-blind and deaf and dull of wit, slower to learn, quicker to forget, outstripped now by those who were behind me. Nay, but even were I unconscious of the change, life would be a burden to me; and if I knew, misery and bitterness would surely be my lot.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>“‘But now, if I am to die unjustly, they who unjustly kill me will bear the shame of it. For if to do injustice is shameful, whatever is unjustly done must surely bring shame. But to me what shame is it that others fail to decide and act justly concerning me?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
I see that posterity judges differently of the dead according as they did or suffered injustice. I know that men will remember me too, and, if I die now, not as they will remember those who took my life. For I know that they will ever testify of me that I wronged no man at any time, nor corrupted any man, but strove ever to make my companions better.’”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This was the tenor of his conversation with Hermogenes and with the others. All who knew what manner of man Socrates was and who seek after virtue continue to this day to miss him beyond all others, as the chief of helpers in the quest of virtue. For myself, I have described him as he was: so religious that he did nothing without counsel from the gods; so just that he did no injury, however small, to any man, but conferred the greatest benefits on all who dealt with him; so self-controlled that he never chose the pleasanter rather than the better course; so wise that he was unerring in his judgment of the better and the worse, and needed no counsellor, but relied on himself for his knowledge of them; masterly in expounding and defining such things; no less masterly in putting others to the test, and convincing them of error and exhorting them to follow virtue and gentleness. To me then he seemed to be all that a truly good and happy man must be. But if there is any doubter, let him set the character of other men beside these things; then let him judge.</p></div>
