						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Shortly after this, at the beginning

								And when the Athenian day-watcher described him, he signalled to the
								generals, and they put out against him with twenty ships; and

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
							<p>And when the Athenians came near, the men under Dorieus fought, from

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now Mindarus caught sight of the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>And the Athenians set out against him and did battle,<note

								their support, with eighteen ships.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>Thereupon the Peloponnesians took to flight in the direction of
								Abydus; and Pharnabazus came along the shore to their aid, and
								riding his horse into the sea as far as possible, bore a share in
								the fighting and cheered on his followers, cavalry and infantry.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>Meanwhile the Peloponnesians made a barrier of their ships and
								marshalled themselves on the shore and fought. At length the
								Athenians sailed away to Sestus after capturing thirty of the
								enemy’s ships, though without their crews, and recovering those
								which they had previously lost themselves.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p>From Sestus all but forty of their ships went off in different
								directions, outside the Hellespont, to collect money; and
								Thrasyllus, who was one of the generals, set sail for Athens to
								report these events and to ask for troops and ships.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Tissaphernes came to the
								Hellespont; and when Alcibiades with a single trireme went to visit
								him, bearing friendly offerings and gifts, Tissaphernes seized him
								and imprisoned him in Sardis, saying that the King ordered him to
								make war upon the Athenians.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>Thirty days later, however, Alcibiades, together with Mantitheus, who
								had been taken prisoner in Caria, provided themselves with horses
								and made their escape from Sardis by night to Clazomenae.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile the Athenians at Sestus,
								learning that<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								sail against them with sixty ships, withdrew by night to Cardia.
									There<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0410">410 B.C.</date></note> Alcibiades joined them,
								coming from Clazomenae with five triremes and a dispatch boat. But
								upon learning that the Peloponnesian ships had set out from Abydus
								to Cyzicus, he proceeded overland to Sestus and gave orders that the
								ships should sail around to that place.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>When they had arrived there and he was on the point of putting out to
								sea for battle, Theramenes sailed in from Macedonia with a
								reinforcement of twenty ships, and at the same time Thrasybulus
								arrived from Thasos with twenty more, both of them having been
								engaged in collecting money.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>And after bidding them also to follow after him when they had removed
								their cruising sails,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Thus <q

								off with his own ships to Parium; and when all the ships had come
								together at Parium, to the number of eighty-six, they set sail
								during the ensuing night, and on the next day at breakfast time
								arrived at Proconnesus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
							<p>There they learned that Mindarus was at Cyzicus, and also Pharnabazus
								with his army. Accordingly they remained that day at Proconnesus,
								but on the following day Alcibiades called an assembly of his men
								and told them that they must needs fight at sea, fight on land, and
								fight against fortresses. <said direct="true">For we,</said> he said, <said direct="true">have no money, but the enemy have an
									abundance of it from the King.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>Now on the preceding day, when they had come to anchor, Alcibiades
								had taken into his custody all the vessels in the harbour, even the
								small ones, in order that no one should report to the enemy the size
								of his fleet, and he made proclamation that death would be the
								punishment of any one who was caught sailing across to the other
								side of the strait.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
							<p>And after the assembly he made preparations for battle and, in the
								midst of a heavy rain, set out for Cyzicus. When he<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0410">410
										B.C.</date></note> was near Cyzicus, the weather cleared and
								the sun came out, and he sighted the ships under Mindarus, sixty in
								number, engaged in practice at some distance from the harbour and
								already cut off from it by his own fleet.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>But the Peloponnesians, when they saw that the Athenian triremes were
								far more numerous than before and were near the harbour, fled to the
								shore; and mooring their ships together, they fought with their
								adversaries as they sailed down upon them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>Alcibiades, however, with twenty of his ships sailed round the fleets
								and landed on the shore. When Mindarus saw this, he also landed, and
								fell fighting on the shore; and those who were with him fled. And
								the Athenians took away with them to Proconnesus all the
								Peloponnesian ships, except those of the Syracusans; for these were
								burned by their own crews.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From
								Proconnesus the Athenians sailed on the next day against
								Cyzicus;</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>and the Cyzicenes admitted them, inasmuch as the Peloponnesians and
								Pharnabazus had evacuated the city.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p>There Alcibiades remained for twenty days, and after obtaining a
								great deal of money from the Cyzicenes, but without doing any
								further harm in the city, sailed back to Proconnesus. From there he
								sailed to Perinthus and Selymbria.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
							<p>And the Perinthians admitted the Athenian forces to their city, and
								the Selymbrians, while not admitting them, gave them money.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>From there they proceeded to Chrysopolis, in Calchedonia, and
								fortified it, established a custom house in the city, and proceeded
								to collect the tithe-duty from vessels sailing out of the
									Pontus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">I.e., a tax of ten per
									cent. on all goods passing out through the Bosporus.</note>;
								they also left there as a garrison thirty ships and two of the
									generals,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0410">410 B.C.</date></note> Theramenes and Eumachus,
								to have charge of the fort, to attend to the outgoing ships, and to
								harm the enemy in any other way they could. The other generals
								returned to the Hellespont.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile a letter dispatched to
								Lacedaemon by Hippocrates, vice-admiral under Mindarus, was
								intercepted and taken to Athens; it ran as follows: <q type="written">The ships are
								gone. Mindarus is dead. The men are starving. We know not what to
								do.</q></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>Pharnabazus, however, urged the whole Peloponnesian army and their
								allies not to be discouraged over a matter of ship-timber—for he
								said there was plenty of that in the King’s land—so long as their
								bodies were safe; and he not only gave to each man a cloak and
								subsistence for two months, but he also armed the sailors and set
								them as guards over his own coastline.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>Furthermore, calling together the generals and ship-captains from the
								various states, he bade them build triremes at Antandrus to equal
								the number which they had severally lost, giving them money for the
								purpose and telling them to get timber from Mount Ida.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>And while the ship-building was going on, the Syracusans helped the
								Antandrians to finish a portion of their wall, and in the
								garrison-duty made themselves most popular. For this reason the
								Syracusans now enjoy at Antandrus the privileges of benefactors and
								citizens. As for Pharnabazus, after making these arrangements he
								went at once to the relief of Calchedon.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this time word came from home to
								the Syracusan generals that they had been banished by the democratic
									party.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The generals being of
									the oligarchical party in Syracuse.</note> Accordingly they
								called together their soldiers and, through Hermocrates as
									spokesman,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0410">410 B.C.</date></note> lamented their
								misfortune in being unjustly and illegally banished, all without
								exception. They urged their soldiers to continue zealous in the
								future, as they had been in the past, and to be true men in obeying
								every order; and they directed them to choose new commanders, to
								hold office until those who had been chosen to fill their places
								should arrive from Syracuse.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>The men, however, and particularly the captains and marines and
								steersmen, set up a shout at this and bade the generals remain in
								command. They replied that they ought not to indulge in partizan
								opposition to their own government. <said direct="true">But if anyone,</said> they said, <said direct="true">has
								any charge to bring against us, you should give us a hearing,
								remembering how many naval battles you have won and how many ships
								you have captured when fighting by yourselves, and how often when
								associated with others you have proved yourselves invincible under
								our leadership, occupying the most honourable post in the line of
								battle on account of our skill and your own zealous spirit,
								exhibited both on land and sea.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>But when no one brought any charge against them, at the request of
								the troops they remained until their successors arrived,—Demarchus,
								the son of Epicydes, Myskon, the son of Menecrates, and Potamis, the
								son of Gnosis. Then, after most of the captains had taken oath that,
								when they returned to Syracuse, they would bring their generals back
								from exile, they sped them on their ways, commending them all;</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>but in particular those who had associated with Hermocrates felt
								exceedingly the loss of his care and enthusiasm and democratic
								spirit. For the best of those whose acquaintance he made, both
								captains and steersmen and marines, he<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0410">410
									B.C.</date></note> used to gather every day in the morning and
								at evening to his own tent, where he communicated to them whatever
								he was planning to say or to do; he instructed them also, sometimes
								directing them to speak ex tempore and sometimes after
								deliberation.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p>As a result of this Hermocrates enjoyed the greatest reputation in
								the general council, and was thought superior to all others as
								speaker and adviser. He now went to visit Pharnabazus; and since he
								had once brought an accusation against Tissaphernes at Lacedaemon,
								in which Astyochus supported him as witness, and had been adjudged
								to speak the truth, he received money from Pharnabazus before he
								asked for it, and busied himself with collecting mercenaries and
								triremes with a view to his restoration to Syracuse. Meanwhile the
								Syracusans who succeeded the banished generals arrived at Miletus
								and took over the ships and the troops.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At about this time a revolution took
								place in Thasos, and the partisans of Lacedaemon and the Laconian
								governor Eteonicus were driven out of the island. And Pasippidas the
								Laconian, who was accused of having managed this intrigue, in
								collusion with Tissaphernes, was banished from Sparta, while
								Cratesippidas was sent out to the fleet which Pasippidas had
								collected from the allies, and assumed command of it at Chios.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>During these days also, and while
								Thrasyllus was in Athens, Agis made a raid from Decelea up to the
								very walls of the city; and Thrasyllus led forth the Athenians and
								all others who were in the city and marshalled them beside the
									Lyceum,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A gymnasium outside the
									walls.</note> with the intention of engaging the enemy if they
								approached.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
							<p>When Agis saw this, he withdrew in haste, and some<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0410">410
										B.C.</date></note> few of his rear line were killed by the
								Athenian light troops. In consequence of this occurrence the
								Athenians were still more ready to give Thrasyllus the help for
								which he had come, and they voted that he might choose out for
								service a thousand hoplites, a hundred horsemen, and fifty
								triremes.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile Agis, who could see from
								Decelea great numbers of grain-ships sailing in to Piraeus, said
								that it was useless for his troops to be trying all this long time
								to shut off the Athenians from access to their land, unless one
								should occupy also the country from which the grain was coming in by
								sea; and that it was best to send to Calchedon and Byzantium
								Clearchus, the son of Rhamphias, who was diplomatic agent for the
								Byzantines at Sparta.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>When this was resolved upon, fifteen ships were manned by the
								Megarians and the other allies, more properly transports than
								warships, and Clearchus set out with them. Three of his ships were
								destroyed in the Hellespont by the nine Attic ships which were
								continually on duty there to protect the Athenian merchantmen, but
								the rest escaped to Sestus and from there made their way safely to
								Byzantium.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the year ended, being the year in
								which the Carthaginians, under the leadership of Hannibal, made an
								expedition against Sicily, with an army of one hundred thousand men,
								and in the course of three months captured two Greek cities, Selinus
								and Himera.</p>

								summer for Samos.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p>After remaining there for three days he sailed to Pygela; and there
								he laid waste the country and attacked the wall of the town. A force
								from Miletus, however, came to the aid of the Pygelans, and finding
								the Athenian light troops scattered, pursued them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
							<p>Thereupon the peltasts and two companies of the hoplites came to the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>On the next day they sailed to Notium and from there, after making
								the necessary preparations, marched to Colophon; and the
								Colophonians gave them their allegiance. It was now the time when
								the grain was ripening, and during the following night they made a
								raid into Lydia, burned many villages, and seized money, slaves, and
								other booty in great quantities.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>Stages, the Persian, however, was in this region, and when the
								Athenians had scattered from their camp for private plunder, he
								captured one of them and killed seven others, despite the fact that
								their cavalry came to the rescue.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>After this Thrasyllus led his<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0409">409 B.C.</date></note> army back
								to the coast, with the intention of sailing to Ephesus. But when
								Tissaphernes learned of this plan, he gathered together a large army
								and sent out horsemen to carry word to everybody to rally at Ephesus
								for the protection of Artemis.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>And now, on the seventeenth day after his raid, Thrasyllus sailed to
								Ephesus; and having disembarked the hoplites at the foot of Mount
								Coressus, and the cavalry, peltasts, marines, and all the rest near
								the marsh on the opposite side of the city, he led forward the two
								divisions at daybreak.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p>The defenders of the city sallied forth to meet the attack,—the
								Ephesians, the allies whom Tissaphernes had brought them, the crews
								of the original twenty Syracusan ships and of five others which
								chanced to have arrived there at the time, newly come from Syracuse
								under the command of Eucles, the son of Hippon, and Heracleides, the
								son of Aristogenes, and finally, the crews of two Selinuntine
								ships.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>All these contingents directed their first attack upon the hoplites
								at Coressus; and after routing them, killing about a hundred of
								them, and pursuing the rest down to the shore, they turned their
								attention to those by the marsh; and there also the Athenians were
								put to flight, and about three hundred of them were killed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>So the Ephesians set up a trophy there and a second at Coressus. They
								also gave to the Syracusans and Selinuntines, who had especially
								distinguished themselves, the prizes for valour, not only general
								prizes, but many to particular individuals among them, while upon
								any one of them who at any time might desire it they conferred the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the Athenians, after obtaining

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
							<p>And now, when this had been accomplished, thinking that they were at

								up in a condition of freedom for the longest time.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Now we, believing that for men like ourselves and you democracy is a

								the present form of government.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">And if we find anyone opposed to the oligarchy, so far as we have the

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><said direct="true" rend="merge">Now in fact we find this man

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">In fact, however, he was the very man who took the initiative in the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Therefore he ought to be punished, not merely as an enemy, but also

								the democracy into the oligarchy of the Four Hundred,<note

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">

								ought, as one on shipboard, to hold to his task until they come into

								duty was assigned me by them, I failed to pick up the unfortunates

								the storm it was not possible even to sail, much less to pick up the

									outside the walls (see note on Odeum, 9). In their <q type="emph">distrust of
									one another</q> (see above) they sought by this means to prevent

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>The latter, who were now numerous and included all sorts of people,

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>As for the men in the city, none of them went forth from the walls

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>In retaliation, the men in Piraeus killed one of the cavalrymen,
								Callistratus, of the tribe of Leontis, having captured him in the

								even made attacks upon the wall of the city. And perhaps it is
								proper to mention also the following device of the engineer in the
								city: when he learned that the enemy were intending to bring up
								their siege-engines by the race-course which leads from the Lyceum,
								he ordered all his teams to haul stones each large enough to load a
								wagon and drop them at whatever spot in the course each driver
								pleased. When this had been done, each single one of the stones

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">

								sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon, and likewise those in the city who
								were on the roll, and asked for aid on the plea that the commons had
								revolted from the Lacedaemonians, Lysander, calculating that it was
								possible to blockade the men in Piraeus both by land and by sea and
								to force them to a quick surrender if they were cut off from
								provisions, lent his assistance to the ambassadors, with the result
								that a hundred talents was loaned to the Athenian oligarchs and that
								Lysander himself was sent out as governor on land and his brother
								Libys as admiral of the fleet.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>Accordingly, Lysander proceeded to Eleusis and busied himself with
								gathering a large force of Peloponnesian hoplites; meanwhile the

								the men in the city again had their turn of being confident, in
								reliance upon Lysander. While matters were proceeding in this way,
								Pausanias the king, seized with envy of Lysander because, by
								accomplishing this project, he would not only win fame but also make
								Athens his own, persuaded three of the five ephors and led forth a
								Lacedaemonian army.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>And all the allies likewise followed with him, excepting the

								did not think they would be true to their oaths if they took the
								field against the Athenians when the latter were doing nothing in
								violation of the treaty; in fact, however, they acted as they did
								because they supposed that the Lacedaemonians wanted to make the
								territory of the Athenians their own sure possession.<milestone

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p>Then, sending ambassadors to the men in Piraeus, Pausanias bade them
								disperse to their homes; and when they refused to obey, he attacked

								might not be evident that he felt kindly toward them. And when he
								had retired without accomplishing anything by his attack, on the
								next day he took two regiments of the Lacedaemonians and three
								tribes of the Athenian cavalry and proceeded along the shore to the
								Still Harbour,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Apparently the inlet

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p>As he was returning, some of the enemy attacked him and caused him
								trouble, whereupon, becoming<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0403">403 B.C.</date></note> angry, he
								ordered the cavalry to charge upon them at full speed, and the

									resp="Loeb">I.e. the youngest ten year-classes, each year-class

								with the rest of his troops came along in the rear. And they killed
								nearly thirty of the enemy’s light troops and pursued the rest to
								the theatre in Piraeus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p>There, as it chanced, the whole body of the light troops and likewise
								the hoplites of the men in Piraeus were arming themselves. And the
								light troops, rushing forth at once, set to throwing javelins,
								hurling stones, shooting arrows, and discharging slings; then the
								Lacedaemonians, since many of them were being wounded and they were
								hard pressed, gave ground, though still facing the enemy; and at
								this the latter attacked much more vigorously. In this attack
								Chaeron and Thibrachus, both of them polemarchs,<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The title of the commander of a

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
							<p>Now Thrasybulus and the rest of his troops—that is, the hoplites—when

								in line, eight deep, in front of their comrades. And Pausanias,
								being hard pressed and retreating about four or five stadia to a
								hill, sent orders to the Lacedaemonians and to the allies to join
								him. There he formed an extremely deep phalanx and led the charge
								against the Athenians. The Athenians did indeed accept battle at
								close quarters; but in the end some of them were pushed into the
								mire of the marsh of Halae and others gave way; and about one
								hundred and fifty of them were<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon Pausanias set up a trophy
								and returned to his camp; and despite what had happened he was not
								angry with them, but sent secretly and instructed the men in Piraeus
								to send ambassadors to him and the ephors who were with him, telling
								them also what proposals these ambassadors should offer; and they
								obeyed him. He also set about dividing the men in the city, and gave
								directions that as many of them as possible should gather together
								and come to him and the ephors and say that they had no desire to be
								waging war with the men in Piraeus, but rather to be reconciled with
								them and in common with them to be friends of the
								Lacedaemonians.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>Now Naucleidas also, who was an ephor, was pleased to hear this. For,
								as it is customary for two of the ephors to be with a king on a
								campaign, so in this instance Naucleidas and one other were present,
								and both of them held to the policy of Pausanias rather than to that
								of Lysander. For this reason they eagerly sent to Lacedaemon both
								the envoys from Piraeus, having the proposals for peace with the
								Lacedaemonians, and the envoys from the city party as private
								individuals, namely, Cephisophon and Meletus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p>When, however, these men had departed for Lacedaemon, the authorities
								in the city also proceeded to send ambassadors, with the message
								that they surrendered both the walls which they possessed and
								themselves to the Lacedaemonians, to do with them as they wished;
								and they said they counted it only fair that the men in Piraeus, if
								they claimed to be friends of the Lacedaemonians, should in like

								that the two parties should be at peace with one another and that
								every man should depart to his home except the members of the
								Thirty, and of the Eleven, and of the Ten who had ruled in Piraeus.
								They also decided that if any of the men in the city were afraid,

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When these things had been

								never did you any wrong for the sake of money; while you, though
								richer than any of them, have done many disgraceful things for the

								the Lacedaemonians, since they were the leaders of all Hellas,
								should undertake to protect them also, the Greeks in Asia, in order
								that their land might not be laid waste and that they themselves
								might be free.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>Accordingly, the Lacedaemonians sent them<note anchored="true"

								Peloponnesians. Thibron also asked from the Athenians three hundred
								cavalrymen, saying that he would provide pay for them himself. And

								they should live in foreign lands and perish there.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>Furthermore, when they arrived in Asia, Thibron also gathered troops

								reward for accompanying him on his expedition against Greece.
								Furthermore, Gorgion and Gongylus gave in their allegiance to
								Thibron, they being brothers, one of them the ruler of Gambrium and
								Palaegambrium, the other of Myrina and Grynium; and these cities
								also were a gift from the Persian king to the earlier Gongylus,
								because he espoused the Persian cause,—the only man among the
								Eretrians who did so,—and was therefore banished.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>On the other hand, there were some weak cities which Thibron did

								to yield he invested and besieged it. When he proved unable to
								capture it in any other way, he sunk a shaft and began to dig a
								tunnel therefrom, with the idea of cutting off their water supply.
								And when they made frequent sallies from within the wall and threw
								pieces of wood and stones into the shaft, he met this move by making
								a wooden shed and setting it over the shaft. The Larisaeans,
								however, sallied forth by night and destroyed the shed also, by
								fire. Then, since he seemed to be accomplishing nothing, the ephors
								sent him word to leave Larisa and undertake a campaign against

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When, in pursuance of his intention to

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>And when Dercylidas took over the command of the army, being aware

								one of the two rather than against both together. Besides,
								Dercylidas was an enemy of Pharnabazus from earlier days; for after
								he had become governor at Abydus at the time when Lysander was
								admiral, he was compelled, as a result of his being slandered by
								Pharnabazus, to stand sentry, carrying his shield—a thing which is
								regarded by Lacedaemonians of character as a disgrace; for it is a

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>And from the outset he was so superior to Thibron in the exercise of

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p><said direct="true">Pharnabazus, my husband was not only a friend to you in all other

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>When Pharnabazus heard this, he decided that the woman should be
								satrap. And when she had become mistress of the province, she not
								only paid over the tributes no less faithfully than had her husband,
								but besides this, whenever she went to the court of Pharnabazus she
								always carried him gifts, and whenever he came down to her province
								she received him with far more magnificence and courtesy than any of
								his other governors;</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>and she not only kept securely for Pharnabazus the cities which she
								had received from her husband, but also gained possession of cities
								on the coast which had not been subject to him, Larisa, Hamaxitus,
								and Colonae—attacking their walls with a Greek mercenary force,
								while she herself looked on from a carriage; and when a man won her
								approval she would bestow bounteous gifts upon him, so that she
								equipped her mercenary force in the most splendid fashion. She also
								accompanied Pharnabazus in the field, even when he invaded the land
								of the Mysians or the Pisidians because of their continually
								ravaging the King’s territory. In return for these services
								Pharnabazus paid her magnificent honours, and sometimes asked her to
								aid him as a counsellor.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
							<p>Now when she was more than forty years old, Meidias,<note

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>When he had done these things, he seized the strong cities of Scepsis

								Meidias sent gifts to Pharnabazus and claimed the right to be ruler
								of the province, even as Mania had been. And Pharnabazus in reply
								told him to take good care of his gifts until he came in person and

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>Now a certain Athenadas, a Sicyonian captain, thinking that

								rushed forward with his own company and tried to choke up their
								spring. And the people within the walls, sallying forth against him,
								inflicted many wounds upon him, killed two of his men, and drove
								back the rest with blows and missiles. But while Dercylidas was in a
								state of vexation and was thinking that his attack would thus be
								made less spirited, heralds came forth from the wall, sent by the
								Greeks in the city, and said that what their commander was doing was

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>While they were still talking about this, there came a messenger from

								Dercylidas sent him one man from each of the cities of the allies,

								and came forth from the city, and when he met Dercylidas asked him

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>When Dercylidas entered he proceeded to the acropolis, keeping

								made proclamation that the spearmen of Meidias’ bodyguard should

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p><said direct="true">Now don’t you,</said> said he, <said direct="true">be too petty about the details.</said> When the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>Now when the rest led the way to the dwelling of Mania, to which

								entered he called the stewards, told his servants to seize them, and
								announced to them that if they were caught concealing any of Mania’s
								property they should have their throats cut on the spot; so they
								showed it to him. When he had seen all, he shut it up, sealed it,
								and set a guard upon it.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">

								not, despising the Lacedaemonian army because of his superiority in

								him whether he preferred to have peace or war. And Pharnabazus,
								thinking that Aeolis had been made a strong base of attack upon his

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When these things had taken place,
								Dercylidas went to Bithynian Thrace and there passed the winter, by

								often at war with him. And during most of the time Dercylidas was
								plundering Bithynia in safety and had provisions in abundance; when,
								however, a force of Odrysians, about two hundred horsemen and about
								three hundred peltasts, came to him as allies from Seuthes<note

								numbers, peltasts and horsemen, and at daybreak made an attack upon
								the Greek hoplites, who numbered about two hundred. When the
								attacking party came near, some of them hurled spears and others
								threw javelins at the Greeks. And the latter, wounded and slain one
								after another, and unable to do the enemy any harm because of
									being<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								in the end the Greeks were shot down like cattle shut up in a pen.
								About fifteen of them, however, made their escape to the main Greek

								belief that if Caria, the particular province where the residence of
								Tissaphernes was, should suffer harm, under these circumstances he
								would very quickly leave them independent. When the ephors heard

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>Now it chanced that at this time Pharnabazus had come to visit

								was ready to make war together with him, to be his ally, and to aid
								him in driving the Greeks out of the territory of the King; for he

							<p>But when they were there, they decided to station adequate garrisons

								Dercylidas heard that they had crossed the Maeander again, he told
								Pharax that he was afraid Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus might overrun
								and pillage the land, unprotected as it was, and so crossed over
								himself to Ionia. Now while they were on the march, the army being
								by no means in battle formation, since they supposed that the enemy

								they saw scouts on the burial-mounds in front of them;</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>and when they also sent men to the tops of the mounds and towers in

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>On the other side Pharnabazus, it was reported, was urging an
								engagement. But Tissaphernes, remembering the way Cyrus’ troops had
								made war with the Persians and believing that the Greeks were all
								like them, did not wish to fight, but sent to Dercylidas and said
								that he wanted to come to a conference with him. And Dercylidas,
								taking the best-looking of the troops he had, both cavalry and
								infantry, came forward to meet the messengers and said: <said direct="true">For my part
								I had prepared to fight, as you see; however, since he wishes to

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>When this plan had been decided upon and carried out, the armies went

								your domain during the truce.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>After this agreement had been reached, Tissaphernes made oath to the
								commissioners who were sent to him, Herippidas, Dercylidas, and
								Megillus, that in very truth and without guile he would negotiate
								the peace, and they in turn made oath on behalf of Agesilaus to
								Tissaphernes that in very truth, if he did this, Agesilaus would
								steadfastly observe the truce. Now Tissaphernes straightway violated
								the oaths which he had sworn; for instead of keeping peace he sent
								to the King for a large army in addition to that which he had
								before. But Agesilaus, though he was aware of this, nevertheless
								continued to abide by the truce.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile, during the time that
								Agesilaus was spending in quiet and leisure at Ephesus, since the
								governments in the cities were in a state of confusion—for it was no
								longer democracy, as in the time of Athenian rule, nor decarchy, as
								in the time of Lysander—and since the people all knew Lysander, they
								beset him with requests that he should obtain from Agesilaus the
								granting of their petitions; and for this reason a very great crowd
								was continually courting and following him, so that Agesilaus
									appeared<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								station and Lysander king.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p>Now Agesilaus showed afterwards that he also was enraged by these
								things; but the thirty Spartiatae<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									>See 2 above.</note> with him were so jealous that they could
								not keep silence, but said to Agesilaus that Lysander was doing an
								unlawful thing in conducting himself more pompously than royalty.
								When, however, Lysander now began to introduce people to Agesilaus,
								the king would in every case dismiss, without granting their
								petitions, those who were known by him to be supported in any way by
								Lysander. And when Lysander found that the outcome was invariably
								the opposite of what he desired, he realized how the matter stood;
								and he no longer allowed a crowd to follow him, while he plainly
								told those who wanted him to give them any help that they would fare
								worse if he supported them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>But being distressed at his disgrace, he went to Agesilaus and said:
								<said direct="true">Agesilaus, it seems that you, at least, understand how to humiliate
									your friends.</said> <said direct="true">Yes, by Zeus, I do,</said> said he, <said direct="true">at any rate those who
								wish to appear greater than I; but as for those who exalt me, if I
								should prove not to know how to honour them in return, I should be
								ashamed.</said> And Lysander said: <said direct="true">Well, perhaps it is indeed true that
								you are acting more properly than I acted. Therefore grant me this
								favour at least: in order that I may not be shamed by having no
								influence with you, and may not be in your way, send me off
								somewhere. For, wherever I may be, I shall endeavour to be useful to
								you.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>When he had thus spoken, Agesilaus also thought it best to follow
								this course, and he sent him to the Hellespont. There Lysander, upon
								learning that Spithridates the Persian had suffered a slight at the
								hands of Pharnabazus, had a conference with him and persuaded him
									to<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0396">396 B.C.</date></note> revolt, taking with him
								his children and the money he had at hand and about two hundred
								horsemen. And Lysander left everything else at Cyzicus, but put
								Spithridates himself and his son on board ship and brought them with
								him to Agesilaus. And when Agesilaus saw them, he was pleased with
								the exploit, and immediately inquired about the territory and
								government of Pharnabazus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when Tissaphernes, growing
								confident because of the army which had come down from the King,
								declared war upon Agesilaus if he did not depart from Asia, the
								allies and the Lacedaemonians who were present showed that they were
								greatly disturbed, thinking that the force which Agesilaus had was
								inferior to the King’s array; but Agesilaus, his countenance
								radiant, ordered the ambassadors to carry back word to Tissaphernes
								that he felt very grateful to him because, by violating his oath, he
								had made the gods enemies of his side and allies of the Greeks. Then
								he straightway gave orders to the soldiers to pack up for a
								campaign, and sent word to the cities which had to be visited by
								anyone who marched upon Caria, that they should make ready a market.
								He also dispatched orders to the Ionians, Aeolians, and
								Hellespontines to send to him at Ephesus troops which should take
								part in the campaign.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>Now Tissaphernes, both because Agesilaus had no cavalry (and Caria
								was unsuited for cavalry), and because he believed that he was angry
								with him on account of his treachery, made up his mind that he was
								really going to march against his own residence in Caria, and
								accordingly sent all his infantry across into that province, and as
								for his cavalry, he led it round into the plain of the Maeander,
								thinking that he was strong enough to trample the Greeks under<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0396">396
										B.C.</date></note> foot with his horsemen before they should
								reach the regions which were unfit for cavalry. Agesilaus, however,
								instead of proceeding against Caria, straightway turned in the
								opposite direction and marched towards Phrygia, and he picked up and
								led along with him the contingents which met him on the march,
								subdued the cities, and, since he fell upon them unexpectedly,
								obtained great quantities of booty.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>Most of the time he pursued his march through the country in safety;
								but when he was not far from Dascyleium, his horsemen, who were
								going on ahead of him, rode to the top of a hill so as to see what
								was in front. And by chance the horsemen of Pharnabazus, under the
								command of Rhathines and Bagaeus, his bastard brother, just about
								equal to the Greek cavalry in number, had been sent out by
								Pharnabazus and likewise rode to the top of this same hill. And when
								the two squadrons saw one another, not so much as four plethra<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The plethrum=c. 100 feet.</note>
								apart, at first both halted, the Greek horsemen being drawn up four
								deep like a phalanx,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The <q type="mentioned">phalanx</q>
									of this period was sometimes four, seldom more than eight, deep.
									The tendency of later tactics was to increase its depth greatly
									(cp. IV. ii. 18, VI. iv. 12), a tendency which culminated in the
									famous Macedonian phalanx.</note> and the barbarians with a
								front of not more than twelve, but many men deep. Then, however, the
								barbarians charged.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
							<p>When they came to a hand-to-hand encounter, all of the Greeks who
								struck anyone broke their spears, while the barbarians, being armed
								with javelins of cornel-wood, speedily killed twelve men and two
								horses. Thereupon the Greeks were turned to flight. But when
								Agesilaus came to the rescue with the hoplites, the barbarians
								withdrew again and one of them was killed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>After this cavalry battle had<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0396">396 B.C.</date></note> taken
								place and Agesilaus on the next day was offering sacrifices with a
								view to an advance, the livers of the victims were found to be
								lacking a lobe. This sign having presented itself, he turned and
								marched to the sea. And perceiving that, unless he obtained an
								adequate cavalry force, he would not be able to campaign in the
								plains, he resolved that this must be provided, so that he might not
								have to carry on a skulking warfare. Accordingly he assigned the
								richest men of all the cities in that region to the duty of raising
								horses; and by proclaiming that whoever supplied a horse and arms
								and a competent man would not have to serve himself, he caused these
								arrangements to be carried out with all the expedition that was to
								be expected when men were eagerly looking for substitutes to die in
								their stead.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">

								coming on, he<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								at Ephesus; and desiring to train the army, he offered prizes both
								to the heavy-armed divisions, for the division which should be in
								the best physical condition, and to the cavalry divisions, for the
								one which should show the best horsemanship; and he also offered
								prizes to peltasts and bowmen, for all who should prove themselves
								best in their respective duties. Thereupon one might have seen all
								the gymnasia full of men exercising, the hippodrome full of riders,
								and the javelin-men and bowmen practising.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>In fact, he made the entire city, where he was staying, a sight worth
								seeing; for the market was full of all sorts of horses and weapons,
								offered for sale, and the copper-workers, carpenters, smiths,
								leather-cutters, and painters were all engaged in making martial
								weapons, so that one<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"

								thought that the city was really a workshop of war.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>And one would have been encouraged at another sight also—Agesilaus in

								practise obedience to authority, may we not reasonably suppose that
								such a place abounds in high hopes?</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>And again, believing that to feel contempt for one’s enemies infuses
								a certain courage for the fight, Agesilaus gave orders to his
								heralds that the barbarians who were captured by the Greek raiding
								parties should be exposed for sale naked. Thus the soldiers, seeing
								that these men were white-skinned because they never were without
								their clothing, and soft and unused to toil because they always rode
								in carriages, came to the conclusion that the war would be in no way
								different from having to fight with women.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile the year had now ended since
								the time when Agesilaus had set sail from Greece, so that Lysander

								Xenocles and one other to the command of the cavalry, Scythes to the
								command of the Helot hoplites, Herippidas to the Cyreans,<note

								infantry across into Caria, just as before, and stationed his
								cavalry in the plain of the Maeander. Agesilaus, however, did not
								belie his words, but, even as he had announced, marched straight to
								the neighbourhood of Sardis. For three days he proceeded through a
								country bare of enemies, and had provisions for the army in
								abundance, but on the fourth day the cavalry of the enemy came
								up.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>And their commander told the leader of the baggage-train to cross the
								Pactolus river and encamp, while the horsemen themselves, getting

								ordered his horsemen to go to their aid. And the Persians, in their
								turn, when they saw this movement, gathered together and formed an
								opposing line, with very many companies of their horsemen.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>Then Agesilaus, aware that the infantry of the enemy was not yet at

								against the opposing line of horsemen, ordering the first ten

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>Now the Persians met the attack of the cavalry; but when the whole

								alike, friends<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">So that the peltasts

								Greece.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When this battle took place
								Tissaphernes chanced to be at Sardis, so that the Persians charged

								concluded that Tissaphernes was responsible for the bad turn his
								affairs were taking, and accordingly sent down Tithraustes and cut
								off his head. After he had done this, Tithraustes sent ambassadors
								to Agesilaus with this message: <said direct="true">Agesilaus, the man who was
								responsible for the trouble in your eyes and ours has received his
								punishment; and the King deems it fitting that you should sail back

								should render him the ancient tribute.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>When Agesilaus replied that he could not do this without the sanction

								you receive word from the city, go over into the territory of
								Pharnabazus, since it is I who have taken vengeance upon your
								enemy.</said> <said direct="true">Then, until I go there,</said> said Agesilaus, <said direct="true">give me
								provisions for the army.</said> Tithraustes accordingly gave him thirty

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>And when he was in the plain which is above Cyme, orders came to him
								from the authorities at home to exercise command as he thought best
								over the fleet also, and to appoint as admiral whomsoever he wished.
								Now the Lacedaemonians did this because they reasoned that if the
								same man were in command of both army and fleet, the army would be
								much stronger because the strength of both would be united, and the
								fleet likewise because the army would appear wherever it was
								needed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>But when Agesilaus heard this, in the first place he sent orders to
								the cities in the islands and on the coast to build triremes in such
								numbers as the several cities desired. And the result was new
								triremes to the number of one hundred and twenty, consisting of
								those which the cities offered and those which private individuals
								built out of desire to please Agesilaus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>Then he appointed as admiral Peisander, his wife’s brother, a man who
								was ambitious and of a stout spirit, but rather inexperienced in

								to deal with the situation, sent Timocrates the Rhodian to Greece,

								to the leaders in the various states on condition that they<note

								of those whom you formerly ruled, and of the King himself with his
								vast power. And we certainly were valuable allies to the
								Lacedaemonians, as you so well know; but now we can be expected to
								support you altogether more stoutly than we supported the
								Lacedaemonians then; for it is by no means on behalf of islanders or
								Syracusans, or in fact of any alien people, that we shall be lending
								our aid as we were then, but on behalf of our own injured
								selves.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">And this also is to be well understood, that the selfishly acquired
								dominion of the Lacedaemonians is far easier to destroy than the

								who had none, while they, being few, arrogate to themselves dominion
								over men who are many times their number and are fully as well
								armed. This, then, is our proposal; but be well assured, men of

							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words he ceased speaking.
								But as for the Athenians, very many spoke in support of him and they
								voted unanimously to aid the Thebans. And Thrasybulus, after giving
								the ambassadors the decree for an answer, pointed out also that,
								although Piraeus was without walls, they would nevertheless brave
								the danger of repaying to the Thebans a greater favour<note

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>So the Thebans went away and made preparations for defending
								themselves, and the Athenians for aiding them. And in fact the
								Lacedaemonians did not longer delay, but Pausanias the king marched
								into Boeotia with the troops from home and those from Peloponnesus
								except the Corinthians, who refused to accompany them. And Lysander,
								at the head of the army from Phocis, Orchomenus, and the places in
								that region, arrived at Haliartus before Pausanias.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>Having arrived, he did not keep quiet and wait for the army from
								Lacedaemon, but went up to the wall of the Haliartians with the
								troops which he had. And at first he tried to persuade them to
								revolt from the Thebans and become independent; but when some of the
								Thebans, who were within the wall, prevented them from doing so, he
								made an attack upon the wall.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>And on hearing of this the Thebans came on the run to the rescue,
								both hoplites and cavalry. Whether it was that they fell upon
								Lysander unawares, or that he saw them coming and nevertheless stood
								his ground in the belief that he would be victorious, is uncertain;
								but this at any rate is clear, that the battle took place beside the
								wall; and a trophy stands at the gates of the Haliartians. Now when
								Lysander had been killed and his troops were fleeing to the
								mountain, the Thebans pursued stoutly.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p>But when they had reached the heights in their pursuit and came upon
								rough country and narrow ways, the hoplites of the enemy turned
								about and threw javelins and other missiles<note anchored="true"

									B.C.</date></note> upon them. And when two or three of them who
								were in the van had been struck down, and the enemy began to roll
								stones down the hill upon the rest and to attack them with great
								spirit, the Thebans were driven in flight from the slope, and more
								than two hundred of them were killed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On this day, therefore, the Thebans
								were despondent, thinking that they had suffered losses no less
								severe than those they had inflicted; on the following day, however,
								when they learned that the Phocians and the rest had all gone away
								in the night to their several homes, then they began to be more
								elated over their exploit. But when, on the other hand, Pausanias
								appeared with the army from Lacedaemon, they again thought that they
								were in great danger, and, by all accounts, there was deep silence
								and despondency in their army.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>When, however, on the next day the Athenians arrived and formed in
								line of battle with them, while Pausanias did not advance against

								greatly; as for Pausanias, he called together the commanders of
								regiments and of fifties, and took counsel with them as to whether
								he should join battle or recover by means of a truce the bodies of
								Lysander and those who fell with him.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>Accordingly Pausanias and the other Lacedaemonians who were in

								Corinthians had altogether refused to accompany them and those who
								had come<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e. the other

									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0395">395

								were few, and, most important of all, that the bodies lay close up
								to the wall, so that even in case of victory it would not be easy to
								recover them on account of the men upon the towers—for all these
								reasons they decided that it was best to recover the bodies under a
								truce.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>The Thebans, however, said that they would not give up the dead
								except on condition that the Lacedaemonians should depart from their
								country. The Lacedaemonians welcomed these conditions, and were
								ready, after taking up their dead, to depart from Boeotia. When this
								had been done, the Lacedaemonians marched off despondently, while
								the Thebans behaved most insolently—in case a man trespassed never
								so little upon anyone’s lands, chasing him back with blows into the
								roads. Thus it was that this campaign of the Lacedaemonians came to
								its end.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>But when Pausanias reached home he was brought to trial for his life.
								He was charged with having arrived at Haliartus later than Lysander,

								recovered the bodies of the dead by a truce instead of trying to
								recover them by battle, and with having allowed the Athenian
								democrats to escape when he had got them in his power in

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
							<p>There was also a river, full of all kinds of fish, flowing by the

								foraging expeditions.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>But on one occasion, while the soldiers were getting their provisions
								in disdainful and careless fashion, because they had not previously

								hundred horsemen.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>Now when the Greeks saw him advancing upon them, they ran together to

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">

								the half of the several detachments had come out.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>However, in order that the rest of the thirty Spartiatae might not

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>And when at daybreak he fell upon the encampment of Pharnabazus, many

								baggage and many baggage animals.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>For through fear that, if he took up a fixed position anywhere, he

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>Now when the Paphlagonians and Spithridates had brought in the

								he might have a great quantity of booty to turn in to the officials
								who sold it.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>They, however, would not stand being so treated, but, feeling that

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>And when Agesilaus heard what he had to say, Apollophanes, after

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>Now Agesilaus, on learning these things, at first was overcome with

								Ionians, Aeolians, and Hellespontines, ran forth in their turn from
								the phalanx of Agesilaus, and the whole mass joined in the charge

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p>Thereupon some of the mercenaries were already garlanding Agesilaus,

								but the Thebans on their side, when they saw that their allies had
								taken refuge at Mount Helicon, wishing to break through to join

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this point one may unquestionably

								those in the rear, he did not do this, but crashed against the
								Thebans front to front; and setting shields against shields they

								And he, although he had received many wounds, nevertheless did not
								forget the deity, but ordered them to allow these men to go away

								compelled to share in the rights of citizenship at Argos, for which
								they had no desire, they had less influence in their state than

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>The walls, however, are a long distance from each other; his troops,

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>Then the Argives, filled with overweening confidence on account of

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p> Meanwhile the Corinthian exiles, being victorious over the troops

								went to the rescue, keeping the stockade on their left. But when the
								Argives heard that the Lacedaemonians were in their rear, they
								turned around and burst out of the stockade again on the run. And

								wall, crowded together in a disorderly mass, continued their retreat
								towards the city. When, however, they came upon the Corinthian
								exiles and discovered that they were enemies, they turned back
								again. Thereupon some of them, climbing up by the steps to the top

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>It was then that Agesilaus won credit by a trifling but timely

								and hail towards evening—and besides, they had gone up in light
								clothing suitable to the summer season—and they were shivering and,

								not less than ten men carrying fire in earthen pots. And when these

								the greater part of the cattle. And Agesilaus with the army

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>And when they were distant from Sicyon about twenty or thirty stadia,
								the polemarch with the hoplites, who were about six hundred in
								number, set out to return to Lechaeum, and ordered the commander of
								horse to follow after him with the regiment of horsemen after they
								had escorted the Amyclaeans as far as they themselves directed. Now
								they were by no means unaware that there were many peltasts and many

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>But those in the city of the Corinthians, both Callias, the son of
								Hipponicus, commander of the Athenian hoplites, and Iphicrates,
								leader of the peltasts, when they descried the Lacedaemonians and
								saw that they were not only few in number, but also unaccompanied by
								either peltasts or cavalry, thought that it was safe to attack them
								with their force of peltasts. For if they should proceed along the
								road, they could be attacked with javelins on their unprotected side
								and destroyed; and if they should undertake to pursue, they with
								their peltasts, the nimblest of all troops, could easily escape the
								hoplites.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
							<p>Having come to this conclusion, they led forth their troops. And
								Callias formed his hoplites in line of battle not far from the city,
								while Iphicrates with his peltasts attacked the Lacedaemonian
								regiment. Now when the Lacedaemonians<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0390">390

								several men had been wounded and several others slain, they directed
								the shield-bearers<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Slaves who
									carried the shields of the hoplites.</note> to take up these
								wounded men and carry them back to Lechaeum; and these were the only
								men in the regiment who were really saved.<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb">i.e., saved both in life and in honour.</note> Then
								the polemarch ordered the first ten year-classes<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb">See note on II. iv. 32.</note> to
								drive off their assailants.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>But when they pursued, they caught no one, since they were hoplites
								pursuing peltasts at the distance of a javelin’s cast; for
								Iphicrates had given orders to the peltasts to retire before the
								hoplites got near them; and further, when the Lacedaemonians were
								retiring from the pursuit, being scattered because each man had
								pursued as swiftly as he could, the troops of Iphicrates turned
								about, and not only did those in front again hurl javelins upon the
								Lacedaemonians, but also others on the flank, running along to reach
								their unprotected side. Indeed, at the very first pursuit the
								peltasts shot down nine or ten of them. And as soon as this
								happened, they began to press the attack much more boldly.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
							<p>Then, as the Lacedaemonians continued to suffer losses, the polemarch
								again ordered the first fifteen year-classes to pursue. But when
								these fell back, even more of them were shot down than at the first
								retirement. And now that the best men had already been killed, the
								horsemen joined them, and with the horsemen they again undertook a
								pursuit. But when the peltasts turned to flight, at that moment the
								horsemen managed their attack badly; for they did not chase the
								enemy until they had killed some of them, but both in the pursuit
								and in the turning backward kept an<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0390">390 B.C.</date></note> even front
								with the hoplites. And what with striving and suffering in this way
								again and again, the Lacedaemonians themselves kept continually
								becoming fewer and fainter of heart, while their enemies were
								becoming bolder, and those who attacked them continually more
								numerous.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>Therefore in desperation they gathered together on a small hill,
								distant from the sea about two stadia, and from Lechaeum about
								sixteen or seventeen stadia. And the men in Lechaeum, upon
								perceiving them, embarked in small boats and coasted along until
								they came opposite the hill. Then the troops, being now desperate,
								because they were suffering and being slain, while unable to inflict
								any harm themselves, and, besides this, seeing the Athenian hoplites
								also coming against them, took to flight. And some of them plunged
								into the sea, and some few made their escape with the horsemen to
								Lechaeum. But in all the battles and in the flight about two hundred
								and fifty of them were killed.</p>

							<p>Then, upon their refusing to obey him, he proceeded to do so,

								asking whether<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								with piety if he did not acknowledge the holy truce claimed by the

								to hinder the invasion, they sent, as they were wont to do, two
								heralds, garlanded, pleading a holy truce. But Agesipolis in reply
								said that the gods did not think they were making this plea justly,

								the naval battle took place, and he did not, like the other

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><said direct="true">Gentlemen, at this moment it is

								showing loyalty in the midst of prosperity calls for no particular
								admiration, but always, if men show themselves steadfast when
								friends have fallen upon misfortunes, this is remembered for all
								time. Do not suppose that just because we have been defeated in the
								naval battle, we are therefore ever afterward to be counted for
								naught. Nay, even in former times, you recall, when the Athenians
								were rulers of the sea, our state was able both to confer benefit
								upon friends and to inflict harm upon enemies. And the greater the

								away from us, by so much the greater in reality would your fidelity
								be made manifest. But if anyone is afraid that we may be besieged
								here both by land and by sea, let him reflect that there is not yet
								a Greek fleet on the sea, and if the barbarians shall undertake to
								rule the sea, Greece will not tolerate this; so that in helping

								they ought not to be discouraged, either, when they reflected that
								even in Asia, which had belonged from all time to the King, there
								was Temnus—not a large city—and Aegae and other places in which
								people were able to dwell without being subject to the King. <said direct="true">In any

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>Then Teleutias continued his voyage to Rhodes, having now

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>Then, with this matter successfully arranged, and the cities in Asia

								on vessels sailing out of the Pontus.<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb">cp. I. i. 22 and note.</note> He also changed the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now after he had accomplished these

								went against none of them until he had marshalled in Mytilene the
								four hundred hoplites from his own ships and all the exiles from the
								Lesbian cities who had fled for refuge to Mytilene, and had also
									added<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								secondly to the exiles, that if they proceeded all together against
								each single one of the cities, they would be able, acting in unison,
								to accomplish their restoration to their native states, and again to
								his marines, that by making Lesbos likewise friendly to their state
								they would at once obtain a great abundance of money. Then, after

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>Therimachus, however, who chanced to be the Lacedaemonian governor,

								collected money from various cities, and came to Aspendus in
								particular and anchored in the Eurymedon river. And after he had
								already received money from the Aspendians, his soldiers wrongfully

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p>They did not, indeed, find any fault with Dercylidas; but Anaxibius,

								Athenians, so that matters might not stand so well with them in the
								Hellespont.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p>Accordingly the ephors gave Anaxibius three triremes and money enough

								from Pharnabazus, take the field in retaliatory expeditions against
								the cities which had made expeditions against Abydus, march upon
								them, and lay waste their territory. On the naval side, in addition

							<p>The Athenians, however, learning of these things, and fearing that

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p>Now when he reached the Chersonese, at first Anaxibius and he made
								war upon one another by sending out raiding parties; but as time
								went on Iphicrates found out that Anaxibius had gone to Antandrus
								with his mercenaries, the Lacedaemonians who were with him, and two
								hundred hoplites from Abydus, and heard that he had brought
								Antandrus into relations of friendship with him. Whereupon,
								suspecting that after he had also established his garrison there he
								would return again and bring the Abydenes back home, Iphicrates
								crossed over by night to the most deserted portion of the territory
								of Abydus, and going up into the mountains, set an ambush.
								Furthermore, he ordered the triremes which had brought him across
								the strait to sail at daybreak along the coast of the Chersonese, up
								the strait, in order that it might seem that he had sailed up the
								Hellespont to collect money, as he was wont to do.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>Having done all these things he was not disappointed, for Anaxibius
								did come marching back, even though—at least, as the story ran—his

								fact, filled with disdainful confidence because he was proceeding
								through a friendly country and to a friendly city, and because he
								heard from those who met him that Iphicrates had sailed up in the
									direction<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								making his march in a rather careless fashion.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p>Nevertheless, Iphicrates did not rise from ambush so long as the army
								of Anaxibius was on the level ground; but when the Abydenes, who
								were in the van, were now in the plain of Cremaste, where their gold
								mines are, and the rest of the army as it followed along was on the
								downward slope, and Anaxibius with his Lacedaemonians was just
								beginning the descent, at this moment Iphicrates started his men up
								from their ambush and rushed upon him on the run.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
							<p>Then Anaxibius, judging that there was no hope of safety, inasmuch as
								he saw that his army extended over a long and narrow way, and

								come to his assistance up the hill, and since he also perceived that
								all were in a state of terror when they saw the ambush, said to

								fighting on that spot. His favourite youth, however, remained by his

								fell with him. But the rest of the Lacedaemonians fled and fell one
								after another, the enemy pursuing as far as the city. Furthermore,

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>Then the generals of the Athenians gathered together from Samothrace,

								they then, setting out from the Chersonese as a base, blockaded him
								and his twenty-five ships with the thirty-two ships under their
								command. As for Gorgopas, on his voyage back from Ephesus he fell in
								with Eunomus, and for the moment took refuge in Aegina, reaching
								there a little before sunset. Then he at once disembarked his men
								and gave them dinner.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p> Meanwhile Eunomus, after waiting a short time, sailed off. And when
								night came on he led the way, carrying a light, as the custom is, so

								Gorgopas immediately embarked his men and followed on in the
								direction of the light, keeping behind the enemy so that he should
								not be visible or give them a chance to notice him; while his
								boatswains gave the time by clicking stones together instead of with
								their voices, and made the men employ a sliding motion of the

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>But when the ships of Eunomus were close to the shore near Cape

								just disembarking, others were still occupied in coming to anchor,
								and others were even yet on their way toward the shore. Then, a
								battle being fought by moonlight, Gorgopas captured four triremes,
								and taking them in tow,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"

								with his peltasts, landed in Aegina and set an ambush in a hollow
								place beyond the Heracleium. Then at daybreak, just as had been
								agreed, the hoplites of the Athenians came, under the command of
								Demaenetus, and ascended to a point about sixteen stadia beyond the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">

								whenever I am in command of you, I pray just as earnestly for your
								lives as for my own. As to provisions, you would be surprised,
								perhaps, if I should say that I am more desirous of your being
								supplied than of being supplied myself; indeed, by the gods, I
								should prefer to go without food myself for two days than to have
								you go without for one. And just as my door was open in days past,

								suffer discomfort, but that from them you may gain something
								good.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>And when they had come he embarked them upon the ships and sailed
								during the night to the harbour of the Athenians, now letting the
								men rest and bidding them get a little sleep, and now setting them
								at the oars. But if anyone supposes that it was madness for him to
								sail with twelve triremes against men who possessed many ships, let

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p>He conceived that the Athenians were more careless about their fleet

								Athens than against ten elsewhere. For in the case of ships that

								here and there.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
							<p>These, then, were the considerations which he had weighed before he

								led on and they followed. Now he forbade them to sink or harm any
								merchant vessel with their own ships; but if they saw a trireme at
								anchor anywhere, he ordered them to try to make her unseaworthy, and
								furthermore, to bring out in tow the merchant ships which were
								loaded, and to board the larger ones wherever they could and take
								off their people. Indeed, there were some of his men who even leaped
								ashore on to the Deigma,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> A quay

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>He, then, succeeded in accomplishing these things. But as for the

								from the streets to their homes to get their weapons, and still
								others to the city to carry the news. Then all the Athenians,

								had been captured.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>But Teleutias sent off the captured merchant vessels to Aegina and

								and they, upon seeing him, fled. Now he speedily succeeded in
								overhauling the slowest of the enemy’s ships with his fastest; but
								giving orders to the leaders of his own fleet not to attack the

								And when he had captured them, those who were behind, upon seeing

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>And after the twenty ships from Syracuse had come and joined

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>The Athenians, therefore, seeing that the enemy’s ships were many,

								Orchomenus, keeping watch upon their allied states — those which
								they trusted, to prevent their being destroyed, and those which they
								distrusted, to prevent their revolting — and suffering and causing

								the Argives, knowing that the Lacedaemonian ban had been called out
								against them, and being aware that their plea of the sacred
									months<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">cp. IV. vii. 2 f. and

								were eager for peace.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>So that when Tiribazus ordered those to be present who desired to
								give ear to the peace which the King had sent down, all speedily

								and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians.
								But whichever of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing these words the

								the Thebans claimed the right to take the oath in the name of all
								the Boeotians. Agesilaus, however, refused to accept their oaths
								unless they swore, just as the King’s writing directed, that every
								city, whether small or great, should be independent. But the
								ambassadors of the Thebans said that these were not the instructions
								which had been given them. <said direct="true">Go then,</said> said Agesilaus, <said direct="true">and ask your

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p>Agesilaus, however, on account of his hatred for the Thebans, did not

								thither among the Perioeci to hasten their coming, and likewise sent

								Argives that if they did not depart from Corinth, he would make war
								upon them. And when, as a result of the fear which seized both

							<p>And when he had entered Mantinean territory, he first laid waste the

								and the other half working. And after the trench had been

								built a wall round about the city. Learning, however, that the corn

								the previous year, and thinking that it would be a grievous thing if
								it should prove necessary to burden both his state and its allies

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>Its outflow being thus checked, the water rose not only above the

								contrivances to prevent the tower from falling; but when they were
								no longer able to resist the water, being seized with the fear that
								if any portion of the encircling wall fell they would become
								prisoners of war, they offered to agree to tear down their walls.
								The Lacedaemonians, however, said that they would not make peace

								if the Lacedaemonians made an expedition against them, some of the
								people within the walls would let them into the city. For not only
								were there many kinsmen of the exiles in the city, and people who
								were friendly to them for other reasons, but also, as is indeed
								usual in most cities, some desired a change of government and
								therefore wanted to bring back the exiles.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>On account, then, of such fears, the Phliasians voted to take back

								who had purchased such property to recover the price of it from the
								public treasury; and if any dispute should arise in any case between
								these purchasers and the exiles, it was to be settled by legal
								process. Thus ended, in its turn, this incident of the Phliasian

								cities in Macedonia. We also had information that Amyntas was
								withdrawing from his cities and had already been all but driven out

									The polemarchs were the chief officials of Thebes.</note>, were
								at variance with one another, and both of them leaders of their
								respective political clubs. Hence Ismenias, on account of his hatred
								for the Lacedaemonians, did not even go near Phoebidas. Leontiades,
								however, not only paid court to him in various ways, but when he had
								become intimate with him, spoke to him as follows:</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p><said direct="true">Phoebidas, it is within your power this day to render the greatest

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>When Phoebidas heard this, he was filled with bouyant hopes; for he
								was a man with a far greater passion for performing some brilliant
								achievement than for life itself, although, on the other hand, he
								was not regarded as one who weighed his acts or had much practical
								wisdom. And when he had agreed to the plan, Leontiades directed him
								to set out on his way, prepared as he was to depart from
									Thebes.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								was summer and midday, the streets were entirely deserted, at this
								time Leontiades rode out on horseback to overtake Phoebidas, turned
								him back, and led him straight to the Acropolis. And after
								establishing Phoebidas there with the troops under his command,
								giving him the key to the gates, and telling him to let no one into
								the Acropolis unless he himself so ordered, he proceeded at once to
								the meeting of the senate. And when he had arrived there, he spoke

							<p><said direct="true">Be not at all despondent, gentlemen, because the Lacedaemonians are

								law directs that a polemarch shall have power to arrest any man who
								seems to be doing deeds which deserve death, I arrest Ismenias here,
								as an instigator of war. Therefore do you captains, and you who have
								been detailed with them, arise, seize this man, and lead him away to
								the place where you have been directed to take him.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p>Now those who knew of the plan were of course present, obeyed the
								order, and seized Ismenias; but of those who did not know about it
								and were opponents of Leontiades and his party, some fled at once
								out of the city, fearing that they would be put to death; others
								withdrew at first to their homes; when they learned, however, that
								Ismenias was imprisoned in the Cadmea, then all those who<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0383">383

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When these things had been

								Leontiades proceeded at once to Lacedaemon. There he found the
								ephors and the majority of the citizens angry with Phoebidas because
								he had acted in this matter without authorization by the state.
								Agesilaus, however, said that if what he had done was harmful to
								Lacedaemon, he deserved to be punished, but if advantageous, it was
								a time-honoured custom that a commander, in such cases, had the
								right to act on his own initiative. <said direct="true">It is precisely this point,

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">

								were wont to say yourselves; for you saw that they were always
								friendly to your enemies, and enemies to your friends. Did they not
								refuse to join you in the campaign against the Athenian commons in
								Piraeus, who were bitter enemies of yours, and did they not, on the
								other hand, march against the Phocians because they saw that you
								were well disposed towards them?</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Again, knowing that you were making war upon the Olynthians, they
								undertook to conclude an alliance with them, and you in those past

								that they were forcing Boeotia to be under their sway; but now that
								this stroke has been accomplished,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0383">383 B.C.</date></note> there is
								no need of your fearing the Thebans; on the contrary, a brief

								support that you may desire, provided only you show as much concern
								for us as we have shown for you.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p>Upon hearing these words the Lacedaemonians resolved, so long as the
								Acropolis had been seized, to keep it garrisoned, and to bring
								Ismenias to trial. Accordingly they sent out as judges three
								Lacedaemonians and one from each of the allied states, whether small
								or great. And it was not until the court held its sitting that
								charges were brought against Ismenias, — that he was a supporter of
								the barbarians, that he had become a guest-friend of the Persian
								satrap to the hurt of Greece, that he had received a share of the
								money which came from the King, and that he and Androcleidas were
								chiefly responsible for all the trouble and disorder in Greece.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>To all these charges he did indeed make a defence, but he failed to
								persuade the court that he was not a man of great and evil

								the Lacedaemonians their support in even more than was demanded of

								more spirit set about dispatching the joint army to Olynthus. They
								sent out Teleutias as governor, and not only sent with him their own
								full contingent of the total ten thousand men, but also transmitted
								official dispatches to the various allied states, directing them to
								follow Teleutias in accordance with the resolution of the allies.
									And<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								their hearty support to Teleutias, — for he was regarded as a man

								Agesilaus, eagerly sent with him both hoplites and horsemen.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
							<p>Now he prosecuted his march with no great speed, his concern being
								rather to make the journey without doing any harm to the friends of
								his state and to collect as large a force as possible. He also sent
								word on ahead to Amyntas and asked him not only to hire mercenaries,
								but likewise to give money to the kings in his neighbourhood, that
								they might become allies, if he really wanted to recover his
								dominions. Furthermore, he sent to Derdas, the ruler of Elimia,
								pointing out to him that the Olynthians had already subdued the
								greater power, Macedonia, and would not let the lesser escape unless
								someone put a stop to their presumption.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
							<p>As a result of his doing these things he had a very large army when

								come to Potidaea, he proceeded from there with his army in order of
								battle into the enemy’s country. Now on his way toward the city of
								Olynthus he neither burned nor cut down, believing that anything of
								this sort he should do would prove so many obstacles in his way both
								as he approached and as he withdrew; but he believed that when he
								should retire from the city it would be right to cut down the trees

								behind.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">

								where the enemy issued forth, — while the rest of the phalanx, made
								up of the allies, stretched away to the right. As for the horsemen,
								he likewise posted upon the right wing the Laconians, the Thebans,
								and all the Macedonians who were present, while he kept by his own
								side Derdas and his horsemen, numbering about four hundred, not only
								because he admired this troop, but also to do honour to Derdas, so
								that he should be glad he had joined the expedition.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
							<p>But when the enemy came and formed in opposing line beneath the city

								horse Polycharmus, the Lacedaemonian commander of cavalry, and
								inflicted very many wounds upon him as he lay, but they also killed
								others, and finally put to flight the cavalry upon the right wing.
								Now as the cavalry fled, the infantry next them also gave way, and
								the whole army, indeed, would have been in danger of being defeated
								had not Derdas with his troop dashed straight for the gates of the

								troops in battle order.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
							<p>When the Olynthian horsemen perceived these movements, being seized
								with fear lest they should be shut out from the gates, they turned
								about and retired in great haste. Then Derdas killed very many of

								also retired into the city; but not many of them were killed,
								because the wall was near.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">

								was breakfasting at Apollonia. When he saw the raid, he kept quiet,
								keeping his horses saddled and bridled and their riders fully armed.

								with his men in good order.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p>And upon seeing him the enemy took to flight. But he, when once he

								about eighty horsemen. And from this day forth the enemy stayed more

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>Now when the Olynthians saw the peltasts sallying forth, they turned
								about, retired quietly, and crossed the river again. The peltasts,

							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile the people of Phlius, partly
								because they had been commended by Agesipolis for giving him a large

								they thought that with Agesipolis abroad Agesilaus would not take
								the field against them, and that it never would happen that both the

								grant any of their rights to the restored exiles.<note

								manner of trial that was, where the wrong-doers were themselves the
								judges, they refused to listen to them at all.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p>Consequently these restored exiles came to Lacedaemon to present
								their charge against the state, and other people from home came with
								them, saying that many even among the citizens thought that the

								sent by the state.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>And those who were thus fined were afraid to return home, but
								remained and protested to the Lacedaemonians, saying: <said direct="true">These men,

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p>And since it seemed that the Phliasians were really acting
								insolently, the ephors called out the ban against them. Now this was

							<p>And when, after the sacrifices at the frontier had proved favourable,

								to aid those who were suffering wrong.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>Finally they said that they would do anything whatsoever, and begged

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
							<p>As they refused to do this, he invaded their land and quickly built a

								many Lacedaemonians said that merely for the sake of a few
								individuals they were making themselves hated by a state of more
								than five thousand men — for the Phliasians held their assemblies in
								plain sight of the people outside the city just for the purpose of

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>Whenever any Phliasians came out of the city either from friendship

								undertake the army training, and to supply money enough for
								provisions; he also urged them to provide arms for all these people
								and not to hesitate to borrow money for this purpose. The exiles
								accordingly carried out his injunctions, and showed as a result more
								than a thousand men in splendid condition of body, well disciplined,
								and extremely well armed; so that the Lacedaemonians finally said
								that they had need of such fellow-soldiers.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Agesilaus, then, was occupied with

								advanced straight from Macedonia and halted near the city of the
								Olynthians. And when no one ventured to come out against him, he
								then laid waste whatever part of the Olynthian country was left
								unravaged, and proceeding into the territory of their allied cities,
								destroyed the corn; but Torone he attacked and captured by
								storm.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>While he was engaged in these operations, at midsummer a burning
								fever seized him. And since he had previously seen the sanctuary of
								Dionysus at Aphytis, a longing took possession of him at this time
								for its shady resting-places and its clear, cool waters. He was
								therefore carried thither, still living, but, nevertheless, on the
								seventh day from the time when he fell sick, he came to his end
								outside the sanctuary. And he was placed in honey and carried home,
								and received the royal burial.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Agesilaus heard of this, he did

								of course lodge together when they are at home. And Agesipolis was a
								man well fitted to converse with Agesilaus about youthful days,
								hunting exploits, horses, and love affairs; besides this he also
								treated Agesilaus with deference in their association together in
								their common quarters, as one would naturally treat an elder. In the
								place, then, of Agesipolis the Lacedaemonians sent out Polybiades to
								Olynthus as governor.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">

								the time<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								Phliasians, by voting to consume half as much food as before and
								carrying out this decision, held out under siege for twice as long a
								time as was to have been expected.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>Furthermore, courage sometimes differs so much from cowardice that a
								certain Delphion, who was regarded as a brilliant man, taking to
								himself three hundred of the Phliasians, was able to hold in check
								those who desired to make peace, was able to shut up and keep under
								guard those whom he distrusted, and had the power to compel the
								masses of the people to go to their posts and by putting sentinels
								over them to keep these people faithful. Frequently also he would
								sally forth with the three hundred picked men and beat off the
								troops on guard at one point and another of the wall of
								circumvallation.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>When, however, these picked men with searching in every way could not

								him to give them safe conduct for going on an embassy to Lacedaemon;
								for they said that they had resolved to<note anchored="true"

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>Agesilaus, however, angered because they treated him as one without
								authority, sent to his friends at home and arranged that the
								decision about Phlius should be left to him, but nevertheless he
								gave safe conduct to the embassy. Then he kept guard with a force
								even stronger than before, in order that no one of the people in the
								city might escape. In spite of this, however, Delphion, and with him
								a branded desperado who had many times stolen away weapons from the
								besiegers, escaped by night.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>But when messengers arrived from Lacedaemon with word that the state

								first place, make inquiry to determine who ought justly to be left
								alive in the city and who ought to be put to death, and, secondly,
								should draw up a constitution under which to conduct the government;
								and until such time as these matters should be settled, he left
								behind him a garrison and six months’ pay for those who composed it.
								After doing all this he dismissed the allies and led his citizen

								Acropolis of Thebes were punished by the very men, unaided, who had
								been thus wronged, although before that time they had not been
								conquered by any single one of all the peoples that ever existed;

									type="date"><date when="-0379">379 B.C.</date></note> How all

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There was a certain Phillidas, who
								acted as secretary to Archias and his fellow polemarchs<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> See note on ii. 25. It seems likely
									that the polemarchs were three in number, although Archias and
									Philippus (see below) are the only ones whom Xenophon mentions
									by name.</note> and in other ways served them, as it seemed,
								most excellently. Now this man went to Athens on a matter of
								business, and there met Melon, one of the Thebans in exile at Athens
								and a man who had been an acquaintance of his even before this time.
								Melon, after learning of the doings of the polemarch Archias and the
								tyrannous rule of Philippus, and finding out that Phillidas hated
								the conditions that existed at home even more than he himself did,
								exchanged pledges with him and came to an agreement as to how
								everything should be managed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
							<p>After this Melon took with him six of the fittest men among the
								exiles, armed with daggers and no other weapon, and in the first
								place proceeded by night into the territory of Thebes; then after
								spending the day in a deserted spot they came to the city gates, as
								if on their way back from the country, at just the time when the
								last returning labourers came in. When they had entered the city,
								they spent that night at the house of a certain Charon, and likewise
								spent the following day there.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>As for Phillidas, since the polemarchs always celebrate a festival of
								Aphrodite upon the expiration of their term of office, he was making
								all the arrangements for them, and in particular, having long ago
								promised to bring them women, and the most stately and beautiful
								women there were in Thebes, he said he would do so at that time. And
								they — for they were that sort of men — expected to spend the night
								very pleasantly.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>Now<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0379"
										>379 B.C.</date></note> when they had dined and with his
								zealous help had quickly become drunk, after they had long urged him
								to bring in their mistresses he went out and brought Melon and his
								followers, having dressed up three of them as matrons and the others
								as their attendants.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>He conducted them all to the anteroom adjoining the treasury of the
								polemarchs’ building, and then came in himself and told Archias and
								his colleagues that the women said they would not enter if any of
								the servants were in the room. At that the polemarchs speedily
								ordered them all to withdraw, while Phillidas gave them wine and
								sent them off to the house of one of their number. Then he led in
								the supposed courtesans and seated them one beside each man. And the
								agreement was, that when they were seated, they should unveil
								themselves and strike at once.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>It was in this way, then, as some tell the story, that the polemarchs
								were killed, while others say that Melon and his followers came in
								as though they were revellers and killed them. After this Phillidas
								took three of his men and proceeded to the house of Leontiades and
								knocking at the door he said that he wished to give him a message
								from the polemarchs. Now it chanced that Leontiades had dined by
								himself and was still reclining on his couch after dinner, while his
								wife sat beside him, working with wool. And believing Phillidas
								trustworthy he bade him come in. When the party had entered, they
								killed Leontiades and frightened his wife into silence. And as they
								went out, they ordered that the door should remain shut; and they
								threatened that if they found it open, they would kill all who were
								in the house.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p>When these things had been done, Phillidas took two of the men and
								went to the<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								keeper of the prison that he was bringing a man from the polemarchs
								who was to be shut up. And as soon as the keeper opened the door,
								they immediately killed him and released the prisoners. Then they
								speedily armed these men with weapons which they took down from the
								portico, and, leading them to the Ampheum,<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb"> The shrine of the Theban hero Amphion.</note>
								ordered them to stand under arms.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>After this they immediately made proclamation to all the Thebans,
								both horsemen and hoplites, to come forth from their houses, saying
								that the tyrants were dead. The citizens, however, so long as night
								lasted, remained quiet out of distrust; but when day came, and what
								had taken place was evident, then both the hoplites and the horsemen
								speedily rushed forth with their arms to lend aid. The returned
								exiles also sent horsemen to fetch the troops of the Athenians who
								were on the borders under two of the generals. And the latter,
								knowing the purpose for which they had sent out the horsemen, came
								to their aid.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when the Lacedaemonian governor in
								the Acropolis heard the proclamation of the night, he at once sent
								to Plataea and Thespiae for help. And the Theban horsemen, upon
								perceiving that the Plataeans were approaching, went out to meet
								them and killed more than twenty of them; then as soon as they had
								re-entered the city after this achievement, and the Athenians from
								the borders had arrived, they made an attack upon the Acropolis.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p>Now when those in the Acropolis realized that they were few in

								being frightened in consequence of these things, they said that they
								would withdraw if the Thebans would allow them to do so in safety,
								keeping their arms. And the Thebans gladly granted what they asked,
								and after making a truce and giving their oaths let them go forth on
								these terms.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>As they were on their way out, however, the citizens seized and
								killed all whom they recognized as belonging to the number of their
								political foes. There were some, indeed, who were spirited away and
								saved by the Athenians who had come from the borders with their
								supporting force. But the Thebans even seized the children of those
								who had been killed, whenever they had children, and slaughtered
								them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Lacedaemonians learned of
								these events, they put to death the governor who had abandoned the
								Acropolis instead of waiting for the relief force, and called out
								the ban against the Thebans. Now Agesilaus said that it was more
								than forty years since he had come of military age, and pointed out
								that just as other men of his age were no longer bound to serve
								outside their own country, so the same law applied to kings also.
								He, then, on this plea would not undertake the campaign. It was not,
								however, for this reason that he stayed at home, but because he well
								knew that if he was in command the citizens would say that Agesilaus
								was making trouble for the state in order that he might give

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>Then after he had arrived at Thespiae, he went on from there to

							<p>Sphodrias, then, set about doing this. Meanwhile Cleombrotus

								Thebans and then departed after doing just as little damage as he
								could.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>But the ephors recalled Sphodrias and brought capital charges against
								him. He, however, out of fear did not obey the summons; but
								nevertheless, although he did not obey and present himself for the
								trial, he was acquitted. And<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0378">378 B.C.</date></note> it seemed
								to many that the decision in this case was the most unjust ever
								known in Lacedaemon. The reason for it was as follows.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Sphodrias had a son Cleonymus, who was
								at the age just following boyhood and was, besides, the handsomest
								and most highly regarded of all the youths of his years. And
								Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, chanced to be extremely fond of
								him. Now the friends of Cleombrotus were political associates of
								Sphodrias, and were therefore inclined to acquit him, but they
								feared Agesilaus and his friends, and likewise those who stood
								between the two parties; for it seemed that he had done a dreadful
								deed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>Therefore Sphodrias said to Cleonymus: <said direct="true">It is within your power, my
								son, to save your father by begging Archidamus to make Agesilaus
								favourable to me at my trial.</said> Upon hearing this Cleonymus gathered
								courage to go to Archidamus and begged him for his sake to become
								the saviour of his father.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>Now when Archidamus saw Cleonymus weeping, he wept with him as he
								stood by his side; and when he heard his request, he replied:
								<said direct="true">Cleonymus, be assured that I cannot even look my father in the
								face, but if I wish to accomplish some object in the state, I
								petition everyone else rather than my father; yet nevertheless,
								since you so bid me, believe that I will use every effort to
								accomplish this for you.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>At that time, accordingly, he went from the public mess-room to his
								home and retired to rest; then he arose at dawn and kept watch, so
								that his father should not leave the house without his notice. But
								when he saw him going out, in the first place, if anyone among the
								citizens was present, he gave way to allow them to converse with
								Agesilaus, and again, if it was a<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0378">378 B.C.</date></note> stranger,
								he did the same, and again he even made way for any one of his
								attendants who wished to address him. Finally, when Agesilaus came
								back from the Eurotas<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> The general
									gathering place of the Spartans was on the banks of the
									Eurotas.</note> and entered his house, Archidamus went away
								without even having approached him. On the next day also he acted in
								the very same way.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>And Agesilaus, while he suspected for what reason he kept going to
								and fro with him, nevertheless asked no question, but let him alone.
								But Archidamus, on the other hand, was eager, naturally enough, to
								see Cleonymus; still, he did not know how he could go to him without
								first having talked with his father about the request that Cleonymus
								had made. And the partisans of Sphodrias, since they did not see
								Archidamus coming to visit Cleonymus, whereas formerly he had come
								often, were in the utmost anxiety, fearing that he had been rebuked
								by Agesilaus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>Finally, however, Archidamus gathered courage to approach Agesilaus
								and say: <said direct="true">Father, Cleonymus bids me request you to save his father;
								and I make the same request of you, if it is possible.</said> And
									Agesilaus answered: <said direct="true">For yourself, I grant you pardon; but how could
								I obtain my own pardon from the state if I failed to pronounce
								guilty of wrong-doing a man who made traffic for himself to the hurt
								of the state, I do not see.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p>Now at the time Archidamus said nothing in reply to these words, but
								yielding to the justice of them, went away. Afterwards, however,
								whether because he had conceived the idea himself or because it had
								been suggested to him by some one else, he went to Agesilaus and
								said: <said direct="true">Father, I know that if Sphodrias had done no wrong, you would
								have acquitted him; but as it is, if he has done something wrong,
								let him for our sakes<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"
										><date when="-0378">378 B.C.</date></note> obtain pardon at
									your hands.</said> And Agesilaus said: <said direct="true">Well, if this should be honourable
								for us, it shall be so.</said> Upon hearing these words Archidamus went
								away in great despondency.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p>Now one of the friends of Sphodrias in conversation with Etymocles,
								said to him: <said direct="true">I suppose,</said> said he, <said direct="true">that you, the friends of
								Agesilaus, are all for putting Sphodrias to death.</said> And Etymocles
									replied: <said direct="true">By Zeus, then we shall not be following the same course as
								Agesilaus, for he says to all with whom he has conversed the same
								thing, — that it is impossible that Sphodrias is not guilty of
								wrong-doing; but that when, as child, boy, and young man, one has
								continually performed all the duties of a Spartan, it is a hard
								thing to put such a man to death; for Sparta has need of such
								soldiers.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p>The man, then, upon hearing this, reported it to Cleonymus. And he,
								filled with joy, went at once to Archidamus and said: <said direct="true">We know now
								that you have a care for us; and be well assured, Archidamus, that
								we in our turn shall strive to take care that you may never have
								cause to be ashamed on account of our friendship.</said> And he did not
								prove false to his words, for not only did he act in all ways as it
								is deemed honourable for a citizen of Sparta to act while he lived,
								but at Leuctra,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> Seven years
									later;cp. VI. iv. 14.</note> fighting in defence of his king
								with Deinon the polemarch, he fell three times and was the first of
								the citizens to lose his life in the midst of the enemy. And while
								his death caused extreme grief to Archidamus, still, as he promised,
								he did not bring shame upon him, but rather honour. It was in this
								way, then, that Sphodrias was acquitted.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the Athenians, those among them

								pointed out to the people that the Lacedaemonians had not only not
								punished Sphodrias, but even commended him, for plotting against
								Athens. Therefore the Athenians furnished Piraeus with gates, set
								about building ships, and gave aid to the Boeotians with all
								zeal.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p>The Lacedaemonians on their side called out the ban against the
								Thebans, and believing that Agesilaus would lead them with more
								judgment than Cleombrotus, requested him to act as commander of the
								army. And he, saying that he would offer no objection to whatever
								the state thought best, made his preparations for the campaign.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>Now he knew that unless one first gained possession of Mount
								Cithaeron, it would not be easy to effect an entrance into the
								country of Thebes; he therefore, upon learning that the Cletorians
								were at war with the Orchomenians and were maintaining a force of
								mercenaries, came to an agreement with them that their mercenary
								force should be turned over to him if he had any need of it.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p>And when his sacrifices at the frontier had proved favourable, before
								he had himself reached Tegea he sent to the commander of the
								mercenaries at Cletor, gave them pay for a month, and ordered them
								to occupy Cithaeron in advance. Meanwhile he directed the
								Orchomenians to cease from war so long as his campaign lasted;
								indeed, if any state undertook an expedition against any other while
								his army was in the field, he said that his first act would be to go
								against that state, in accordance with the resolution of the
								allies.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Agesilaus had crossed Cithaeron
								and had arrived at Thespiae, he made that his base of<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0378">378
										B.C.</date></note> operations and proceeded against the
								country of the Thebans. When he found, however, that the plain and
								the most valuable portions of their territory had been surrounded by
								a protecting trench and stockade, he encamped now here and now
								there, and, leading forth his army after breakfast, laid waste those
								parts of the country which were on his side of the stockade and
								trench. For wherever Agesilaus appeared, the enemy moved along
								within the stockade and kept in his front, for the purpose of
								offering resistance.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
							<p>And once, when he was already withdrawing in the direction of his
								camp, the cavalry of the Thebans, up to that moment invisible,
								suddenly dashed out through the exits which had been made in the
								stockade, and inasmuch as the peltasts of Agesilaus were going away
								to dinner or were making their preparations for doing so, while the
								horsemen were some of them still dismounted and others in the act of
								mounting, the Thebans charged upon them; and they not only struck
								down a large number of the peltasts, but among the horsemen Cleas
								and Epicydidas, who were Spartiatae, one of the Perioeci, Eudicus,
								and some Theban exiles, such as had not yet mounted their
								horses.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
							<p>But when Agesilaus turned about and came to the rescue with the
								hoplites, his horsemen charged against the enemy’s horsemen and the
								first ten year-classes of the hoplites ran along with them to the
								attack. The Theban horsemen, however, acted like men who had drunk a
								little at midday; for although they awaited the oncoming enemy in
								order to throw their spears, they threw before they were within
								range. Still, though they turned about at so great a distance,
								twelve of them were killed.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
							<p>But when Agesilaus had noted that it was always after<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0378">378
										B.C.</date></note> breakfast that the enemy also appeared,
								he offered sacrifice at daybreak, led his army forward as rapidly as
								possible, and passed within the stockade at an unguarded point. Then
								he devastated and burned the region within the enclosure up to the
								walls of the city. After doing this and withdrawing again to
								Thespiae, he fortified their city for the Thespians. There he left
								Phoebidas as governor, while he himself crossed the mountain again
								to Megara, disbanded the allies, and led his citizen troops back
								home.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Phoebidas plundered the
								Thebans by sending out bands of freebooters, while by making raids
								he devastated their land. The Thebans, on their side, desiring to
								avenge themselves, made an expedition with their entire force
								against the country of the Thespians. But when they were within the
								territory of Thespiae, Phoebidas pressed them close with his
								peltasts and did not allow them to stray at any point from their
								phalanx; so that the Thebans in great vexation proceeded to retreat
								more rapidly than they had advanced, and their mule-drivers also
								threw away the produce which they had seized and pushed for home; so
								dreadful a panic had fallen upon the army.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
							<p>Meanwhile Phoebidas pressed upon them boldly, having with him his
								peltasts and giving orders to the hoplites to follow in battle
								order. Indeed, he conceived the hope of putting the Thebans to rout;
								for while he himself was leading on stoutly, he was exhorting the
								others to attack the enemy and ordering the hoplites of the
								Thespians to follow.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44">
							<p>But when the horsemen of the Thebans as they retired came to an
								impassable ravine, they first gathered together and then turned to
								face him, not knowing where they could cross. Now the peltasts were
									few<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0378">378 B.C.</date></note> in number; the foremost
								of them were therefore seized with fear of the horsemen and took to
								flight; but when the horsemen, in their turn, saw this, they applied
								the lesson they had learned from the fugitives and attacked
								them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
							<p>So then Phoebidas and two or three with him fell fighting, and when
								this happened the mercenaries all took to flight. And when as they
								fled they came to the hoplites of the Thespians, these also, though
								previously they had been quite proudly confident that they would not
								give way before the Thebans, took to flight without so much as being
								pursued at all. For by this time it was too late in the day for a
								pursuit. Now not many of the Thespians were killed, but nevertheless
								they did not stop until they got within their wall.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
							<p>As a result of this affair the spirits of the Thebans were kindled
								again, and they made expeditions to Thespiae and to the other cities
								round about them. The democratic factions, however, withdrew from
								these cities to Thebes. For in all of them oligarchical governments
								had been established, just as in Thebes<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb">i.e., formerly;cp. 1.</note>; the result was that
								the friends of the Lacedaemonians in these cities were in need of
								aid. But after the death of Phoebidas the Lacedaemonians merely sent
								over by sea a polemarch and one regiment, and thus kept Thespiae
								garrisoned.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the spring came, however, the
								ephors again<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								against Thebes and, just as before, requested Agesilaus to take
								command. Now since he held the same views as before about invading
									Boeotia,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> See 36 above.</note>
								he sent to the polemarch at Thespiae before even offering the
								sacrifice at the frontier and ordered him to occupy in advance the
								summit overlooking the road<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0377">377 B.C.</date></note> which
								leads over Cithaeron and to guard it until he himself arrived.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48">
							<p>And when he had passed this point and arrived at Plataea, he
								pretended that he was again going to Thespiae first, and sending

								the embassies should await him there; so that the Thebans guarded
								strongly the pass leading from Thespiae into their country.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49">
							<p>But on the following day at daybreak, after offering sacrifices,
								Agesilaus proceeded by the road to Erythrae. And after accomplishing
								in one day a two days’ march for an army, he passed the line of the
								stockade at Scolus before the Thebans returned from keeping guard at
								the place where he had entered on the previous occasion. Having done
								this, he laid waste the region to the east of the city of the
								Thebans, as far as the territory of the Tanagraeans; for at that
								time Hypatodorus and his followers, who were friends of the
								Lacedaemonians, still held possession of Tanagra. After this he
								proceeded to retire, keeping the wall of Tanagra on his left.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50">
							<p>Meanwhile the Thebans came up quietly and formed in line of battle
								against him on the hill called Old Woman’s Breast, with the trench
								and the stockade in their rear, believing that this was a good place
								to risk a battle; for the ground at this point was a rather narrow
								strip and hard to traverse. When Agesilaus observed this, he did not
								lead his army against them, but turned aside and proceeded in the
								direction of the city.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51">
							<p>The Thebans, on the other hand, being seized with fear for their
								city, because it was empty of defenders, abandoned the place where
								they were drawn up and hurried toward the city on the run, by the
								road which leads to Potniae; for this was the safer route.<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0377">377
										B.C.</date></note> And it really seemed that Agesilaus’
								expedient proved a clever one, for though he led his army directly
								away from the enemy, he caused the latter to retire on the run, and
								while the enemy ran past, some of his polemarchs with their
								regiments nevertheless succeeded in charging upon them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52">
							<p>The Thebans, however, hurled their spears from the hill-tops, so that
								Alypetus, one of the polemarchs, was struck and killed; but in spite
								of that the Thebans were put to flight from this hill also.
								Consequently the Sciritans and some of the horsemen climbed the hill
								and showered blows upon the hind-most of the Thebans as they rushed
								past them toward the city.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53">
							<p>As soon as they got near the wall, however, the Thebans turned about;
								and the Sciritans, upon seeing them, fell back at a faster pace than
								a walk. Now not one of them was killed; nevertheless, the Thebans
								set up a trophy, because after climbing the hill the Sciritans had
								retired.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54">
							<p>As for Agesilaus, when it was time for him to do so, he withdrew and
								encamped at the very spot where he had seen the enemy drawn up; then
								on the following day he led his army away by the road to Thespiae.
								But since the peltasts who were mercenaries in the service of the
								Thebans clung boldly at his heels, and kept calling out to Chabrias
								because he was not doing the same, the horsemen of the Olynthians —
								for they were now serving with the Lacedaemonians in accordance with
								their sworn agreement — wheeled about and, once in pursuit of the
								peltasts, chased them on up a slope and killed very many of them;
								for when going up a hill where the riding is good foot-soldiers are
								quickly overtaken by horsemen.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55">
							<p>Now when Agesilaus had arrived at Thespiae, finding<note

								factional strife, and that those who said they were supporters of
								Lacedaemon wanted to put to death their opponents, of whom Menon was
								one, he did not allow this proceeding; but he reconciled them and
								compelled them to give oaths to one another, and then, this being
								accomplished, he came back again by way of Cithaeron, taking the
								road leading to Megara. From there he dismissed the allies and led
								his citizen troops back home.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Thebans were now greatly pinched
								for want of corn, because they had got no crops from their land for
								two years; they therefore sent men and two triremes to Pagasae after
								corn, giving them ten talents. But while they were buying up the
								corn, Alcetas, the Lacedaemonian who was keeping guard in Oreus,
								manned three triremes, taking care that the fact should not be
								reported. And when the corn was on its way from Pagasae, Alcetas
								captured both corn and triremes, and made prisoners of the men, who
								were not fewer than three hundred in number. These men he then shut
								up in the Acropolis, where he himself had his quarters.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57">
							<p>Now since, as the story ran, there was a boy of Oreus, an extremely
								fine lad too, who was always in attendance upon him, Alcetas went
								down from the Acropolis and occupied himself with this boy.
								Accordingly the prisoners, observing his carelessness, seized the
								Acropolis, and the city revolted; so that thereafter the Thebans
								brought in supplies of corn easily.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58">

								was confined<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								was leading his army back from Thebes, and, in Megara, was ascending

								the pain unendurable, a Syracusan surgeon opened the vein at his
								ankle. But when once the blood had begun to flow, it ran night and
								day, and with all they could do they were unable to check the flow
								until he lost consciousness; then, however, it stopped. So it came
								about that after being carried back to Lacedaemon he was ill the

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians, however, when

								the army, his peltasts went on ahead for the purpose of occupying in
								advance the heights above the road. But some of the Thebans and
								Athenians who were already in possession of the summit allowed the
								peltasts to pursue their ascent for a time, but when they were close
								upon them, rose from their concealment, pursued them, and killed
								about forty. After this had happened, Cleombrotus, in the belief
								that it was impossible to cross over the mountain into the country

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the allies gathered together at

								the Lacedaemonian fleet was in the neighbourhood of Aegina, Ceos,
								and Andros. Then the Athenians, realizing the necessity that was

								the Thessalians, large enough to make war upon Jason, the cities
								will revolt from him; for all of them are afraid of the lengths to
								which the man’s power will go. But if you imagine that emancipated

								in the vicinity of Lacedaemon to be employed against the triremes of

								wish being that he might still keep it safe for those who had put it

								with the promise not only to win over the city and make it his
								willing ally, but also to help in establishing him as Tagus. When,
								accordingly, they had exchanged pledges with one another, the

								established by common consent as Tagus of the Thessalians.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>Having become Tagus, he assessed the contingents of cavalry and

								fewer than twenty thousand, and there were peltasts enough to be set

								also manning ships.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>but finally they, too, embarked upon the triremes in great confusion

								so they reached Leucas in safety.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for Iphicrates, when he began his
								voyage around Peloponnesus he went on with all needful preparations
								for a naval battle as he sailed; for at the outset he had left his
								large sails behind him at Athens, since he expected to fight, and
								now, further, he made but slight use of his smaller sails, even if
								the wind was favourable; by making his voyage, then, with the oar,
								he kept his men in better condition of body and caused the ships to
								go faster.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
							<p>Furthermore, whenever the expedition was going to take the noonday or
								the evening meal at any particular spot, he would often draw back
								the head of the column from the shore opposite the place in
								question; then he would turn the line around again, cause the
								triremes to head toward the land, and start them off at a signal to
								race to the shore. It was counted a great prize of victory to be the
								first to get water or anything else they needed, and the first to
								get their meal. On the other hand, those who reached the shore last
								incurred a great penalty in that they came off worse in all these
								points, and in<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0373">373 B.C.</date></note> the fact that they had
								to put to sea again at the same time as the rest when the signal was
								given; for the result was that those who came in first did
								everything at their leisure, while those who came in last had to
								hurry.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
							<p>Again, in setting watches, if he chanced to be taking the midday meal
								in a hostile country, he posted some on the land, as is proper, but
								besides he hoisted the masts on the ships and had men keep watch
								from their tops. These men, therefore, could see much farther, from
								their higher point of view, than those on the level. Further,
								wherever he dined or slept, he would not have a fire inside the camp
								during the night, but kept a light burning in front of his forces,
								so that no one could approach unobserved. Frequently, however, if it
								was good weather, he would put to sea again immediately after
								dining; and if there was a favourable breeze, they sailed and rested
								at the same time, while if it was necessary to row, he rested the
								sailors by turns.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>Again, when he sailed by day, he would lead the fleet, by signals, at
								one time in column and at another in line of battle; so that, while
								still pursuing their voyage, they had at the same time practised and
								become skilled in all the manoeuvres of battle before they reached
								the sea which, as they supposed, was held by the enemy. And although
								for the most part they took both their noonday and their evening
								meals in the enemy’s country, nevertheless, by doing only the
								necessary things, he always got to sea before the enemy’s forces
								arrived to repel him and speedily got under way again.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the time of Mnasippus’ death

								should be ready in all essential respects to do so. For he had not
								heard the news of Mnasippus’ death from any eyewitness, but
								suspected that it was told to deceive him, and hence was on his

								way to keep his men from being either, by reason of the voyage they
								had made, unskilled in the tactics of fighting at sea, or, by reason

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After subduing the cities in

								to find a point from which any who approached the island could be
								seen and the men stationed there to send signals to the city would
								be visible; he then stationed his watchers at that point.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">

								and in case anyone failed to follow, he warned him that he would not
								have occasion to find fault with his punishment. Now when the signal
								came that the triremes were approaching, and when the word was given
								by the herald, the ardour of all was a sight worth seeing; for there
								was no one among those who were to sail who did not run to get
								aboard his ship.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p>When Iphicrates had reached the place where the enemy’s triremes
								were, he found the crews of all save one already disembarked on the

								not to remain there, but had manned his own ship and was sailing out
								to sea. Now although he met the ships of Iphicrates, he nevertheless
								escaped, but all the ships from Syracuse were captured, along with
								their crews.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>Thereupon Iphicrates cut off the beaks and towed the triremes into
								the harbour of Corcyra; as for the crews, he concluded an agreement
								that each man should pay a fixed ransom, with the exception of
								Crinippus the commander, whom he kept under guard, intending either
								to exact a very large ransom or to sell him. Crinippus, however, was
								so mortified that he died by a self-inflicted death, and Iphicrates
								let the rest go, accepting Corcyraeans as sureties for the
								ransoms.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p>Now he maintained his sailors for the most part by having them work
								for the Corcyraeans on their lands; the peltasts, however, and the
								hoplites from his ships he took with him and crossed over to
								Acarnania. There he gave aid to the cities which were friendly, in
								case any of them needed aid, and made war upon the Thyrians, who
								were very valiant men and were in possession of a very strong
								fortress.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
							<p>Furthermore,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								governments of ten here and governments of thirty there; and in the

								according to law, but that they shall be able to hold possession of

								in accordance with the King’s writing; but when you had seized the

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p><said direct="true">Cleombrotus, if you let the Thebans escape without a battle, you
								will be in danger of suffering the uttermost penalty at the hands of
								your state. For they will remember against you not only the time
								when you reached Cynoscephalae and laid waste no part of the country
								of the Thebans, but also the time when, on your later expedition,
								you were beaten back from effecting your entrace, although Agesilaus
								always made his entrance by way of Cithaeron. Therefore if you
								really have a care for yourself or a desire to see your fatherland
								again, you must lead against these men.</said> Such were the words of his
								friends; but his opponents said: <said direct="true">Now is the time when the man will
								make it clear whether he is in truth partial to the Thebans, as
								rumour has it.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cleombrotus, then, as he heard these
								things was spurred on to join battle. The leaders of the Thebans, on
								the other hand, calculated that if they did not fight, the cities
								round about would revolt from them and they would themselves be
								besieged; further, that if the people of Thebes were thus cut off
								from provisions, the city itself would be in danger of turning
								against them. And since many of them had been in exile before, they
								estimated that it was better to die fighting than to be exiled
								again.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>Besides this, they were also somewhat encouraged by the oracle which
								was reported — that the Lacedaemonians were destined to be defeated
								at the spot where stood the monument of the virgins, who are said to
								have killed themselves because they had been violated by certain
								Lacedaemonians. The Thebans accordingly decorated this monument
								before the battle. Furthermore, reports were brought to them<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0371">371
										B.C.</date></note> from the city that all the temples were
								opening of themselves, and that the priestesses said that the gods
								revealed victory. And the messengers reported that from the
								Heracleium the arms also had disappeared, indicating that Heracles
								had gone forth to the battle. Some, to be sure, say that all these
								things were but devices of the leaders.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p>But in the battle, at any rate, everything turned out adversely for
								the Lacedaemonians, while for the other side everything went
								prosperously, even to the gifts of fortune. For it was after the
								morning meal that Cleombrotus held his last council over the battle,
								and drinking a little, as they did, at the middle of the day, it was
								said that the wine helped somewhat to excite them.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
							<p>Again, when both sides were arming themselves and it was already
								evident that there would be a battle, in the first place, after
								those who had provided the market and some baggage-carriers and such
								as did not wish to fight had set out to withdraw from the Boeotian
								army, the Lacedaemonian mercenaries under Hieron, the peltasts of
								the Phocians, and, among the horsemen, the Heracleots and Phliasians
								made a circuit and fell upon these people as they were departing,
								and not only turned them about but chased them back to the camp of
								the Boeotians. Thereby they made the Boeotian army much larger and
								more densely massed than it had been before.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
							<p>In the second place, since the space between the armies was a plain,
								the Lacedaemonians posted their horsemen in front of their phalanx,
								and the Thebans in like manner posted theirs over against them. Now
								the cavalry of the Thebans was in good training as a result of the
								war with the Orchomenians and the war with the Thespians, while the
								cavalry of<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								exceedingly poor at that time.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p>For the richest men kept the horses, and it was only when the ban was
								called out that the appointed trooper presented himself; then he
								would get his horse and such arms as were given him, and take the
								field on the moment’s notice. As for the men, on the other hand, it
								was those who were least strong of body and least ambitious who were
								mounted on the horses.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
							<p>Such, then, was the cavalry on either side. Coming now to the
								infantry, it was said that the Lacedaemonians led each half-company
								three files abreast, and that this resulted in the phalanx being not
								more than twelve men deep.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> i.e.,
									the half-company numbered thirty-six men.</note> The Thebans,
								however, were massed not less than fifty shields deep, calculating
								that if they conquered that part of the army which was around the
								king, all the rest of it would be easy to overcome.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when Cleombrotus began to lead his
								army against the enemy, in the first place, before the troops under
								him so much as perceived that he was advancing, the horsemen had
								already joined battle and those of the Lacedaemonians had speedily
								been worsted; then in their flight they had fallen foul of their own
								hoplites, and, besides, the companies of the Thebans were now
								charging upon them. Nevertheless, the fact that Cleombrotus and his
								men were at first victorious in the battle may be known from this
								clear indication: they would not have been able to take him up and
								carry him off still living, had not those who were fighting in front
								of him been holding the advantage at that time.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
							<p>But when Deinon, the polemarch, Sphodrias, one of the king’s
								tent-companions, and Cleonymus,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0371">371 B.C.</date></note> the son of
								Sphodrias, had been killed, then the royal bodyguard, the so-called
								aides of the polemarch, and the others fell back under the pressure
								of the Theban mass, while those who were on the left wing of the
								Lacedaemonians, when they saw that the right wing was being pushed
								back, gave way. Yet despite the fact that many had fallen and that
								they were defeated, after they had crossed the trench which chanced
								to be in front of their camp they grounded their arms at the spot
								from which they had set forth. The camp, to be sure, was not on
								ground which was altogether level, but rather on the slope of a
								hill. After the disaster some of the Lacedaemonians, thinking it
								unendurable, said that they ought to prevent the enemy from setting
								up their trophy and to try to recover the bodies of the dead, not by
								means of a truce, but by fighting.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
							<p>The polemarchs, however, seeing that of the whole number of the
								Lacedaemonians almost a thousand had been killed; seeing, further,
								that among the Spartiatae themselves, of whom there were some seven
								hundred there, about four hundred had fallen; and perceiving that
								the allies were one and all without heart for fighting, while some
								of them were not even displeased at what had taken place, gathered
								together the most important personages and deliberated about what
								they should do. And as all thought it best to recover the bodies of
								the dead by a truce, they finally sent a herald to ask for a truce.
								After this, then, the Thebans set up a trophy and gave back the
								bodies under a truce.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>With such words, then, he endeavoured to dissuade the Thebans from

							<p>Such, then, were the arguments he urged, but he was acting perhaps

								for the truce; and when the report came that the truce had been
								made, the polemarchs gave orders that after dining all should have

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p>And proceeding with very great difficulty, since they were

								This fact, indeed, made it plain that the Greeks had conceived a

								they were negotiating for a reconciliation. When, however, the

								would come out. Then their adversaries, as soon as they had got them
								in their power, bound them, threw them into a wagon, and carried

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
							<p>Now most of the Arcadians were gathering together at Asea. But since

								in full force. And there were some who tried to persuade Agesilaus

								all possible speed. Now he feared that if he led the way himself,
								the enemy would fall upon his rear; accordingly, while keeping quiet
								and presenting his front toward the enemy, he ordered the men at the
								rear to face about to the right and march along behind the phalanx
								toward him. And in this manner he was at the same time leading them

							<p>When the phalanx had thus been doubled in depth, he proceeded into

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">

								Ischolaus was at Oeum, in Sciritis, commanding a garrison composed
								of emancipated Helots and about four hundred of the youngest of the

									resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0368">368

								a narrow place on the road, thereupon he sent to Archidamus and bade
								him come to his aid. And Archidamus did in fact do so. Then as soon
								as they all arrived at the branch road leading to the country of the
								Eutresians, there were the Arcadians and Argives advancing towards
								Laconia, they also having the intention of shutting off Archidamus
								from his homeward way. He accordingly, at just the point where there
								is a level space at the junction of the road leading to the
								Eutresians and the road to Melea, turned out of his path and formed
								his troops in line for battle.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
							<p>It is said that he also went along in front of the battalions and
								exhorted his men in the following words: <said direct="true">Fellow citizens, let us
								now prove ourselves brave men and thus be able to look people in the

								was when we received it from our fathers; let us cease to feel shame

								used once to be the most highly honoured of all the Greeks.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
							<p>When these words had been spoken, it is said that from a clear sky

									circumstance was of good omen because Heracles was the

								therefore, of all these things, it is reported that the soldiers

								for their leaders to restrain them as they pushed forward to the
								front. And when Archidamus led the advance, only a few of the enemy
								waited till his men came within spear-thrust;<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0368">368

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
							<p>Then as soon as the battle had ended and he had set up a trophy, he
								immediately sent home Demoteles, the herald, to report the greatness
								of his victory and the fact that not so much as one of the
								Lacedaemonians had been slain, while vast numbers of the enemy had
								fallen. And when the people at Sparta heard this, it is said that
								all of them wept, beginning with Agesilaus, the senators, and the
								ephors; so true it is, indeed, that tears belong to joy and sorrow
								alike. On the other hand, both the Thebans and the Eleans were
								almost as well pleased as the Lacedaemonians at the misfortune of
								the Arcadians — so vexed had they become by this time at their
								presumption.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And now the Thebans, who were
								continually planning<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"
										><date when="-0367">367 B.C.</date></note> how they might
								obtain the leadership of Greece, hit upon the idea that if they
								should send to the King of the Persians, they would gain some
								advantage in him. Thereupon they immediately summoned their allies,
								on the pretext that Euthycles, the Lacedaemonian, was also at the
								King’s court; and there went up thither Pelopidas for the Thebans,
								Antiochus, the pancratiast,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> The

								Eleans; an Argive also went with them. And the Athenians, upon
								hearing of this, sent up Timagoras and Leon.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
							<p>When the ambassadors arrived there, Pelopidas enjoyed a great
								advantage with the Persian. For he was able to say that his people
								were the only ones among the Greeks who had fought on the side of
								the King at Plataea, that<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
									type="date"><date when="-0367">367 B.C.</date></note> they had

								he was sailing forth to Asia, had sacrificed before he captured
								Troy.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
							<p>It also contributed greatly toward the winning of honour for
								Pelopidas that the Thebans had been victorious in battle at Leuctra,
								and that they had admittedly ravaged the country of the
								Lacedaemonians. Pelopidas also said that the Argives and Arcadians
								had been defeated by the Lacedaemonians when the Thebans were not
								present with them. And the Athenian, Timagoras, bore witness in his
								behalf that all these things which he said were true, and so stood
								second in honour to Pelopidas.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
							<p>Pelopidas was therefore asked by the King what he desired to have
								written for him; he replied, that Messene should be independent of
								the Lacedaemonians and that the Athenians should draw up their ships
								on the land; that if they refused obedience in these points, the
								contracting parties were to make an expedition against them; and
								that if any city refused to join in such expedition, they were to
								proceed first of all against that city.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
							<p>When these things had been written and read to the ambassadors, Leon
								said in the King’s hearing, <said direct="true">By Zeus, Athenians, it is time for you,
								it seems, to be seeking some other friend instead of the King.</said> And
								when the secretary had interpreted to the King what the Athenian had
								said, he again brought out a further writing: <q type="written">And if the
									Athenians<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								juster than these provisions, let them come to the King and inform

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
							<p>Now when the ambassadors had returned to their several homes,
								Timagoras was put to death by the Athenians on the complaint of Leon
								that he had refused to share quarters with him and had taken counsel
								in all matters with Pelopidas. As for the other ambassadors,
								Archidamus, the Elean, praised the doings of the King, because he
								had honoured Elis above the Arcadians; but Antiochus, because the
								Arcadian League was less regarded, did not accept the royal gifts,
								and reported back to the Ten Thousand<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb"> i.e., the Arcadian assembly.</note> that the King
								had bakers, and cooks, and wine-pourers, and doorkeepers in vast
								numbers, but as for men who could fight with Greeks, he said that
								though he sought diligently he could not see any. Besides this, he
								said that for his part he thought that the King’s wealth of money
								was also mere pretence, for he said that even the golden plane-tree,
								that was forever harped upon, was not large enough to afford shade
								for a grasshopper.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Thebans had called together

								King, and the Persian who bore the document, having shown the King’s
								seal, had read what was written therein, although the Thebans
								directed those who desired to be friends of the King and themselves
								to swear to these provisions, the representatives from the cities
								replied that they had not been sent to give their oaths, but to
								listen; and if the Thebans had any desire for oaths, they bade them
								send to the cities. Indeed the Arcadian, Lycomedes, said this
								besides, that it was not even proper for the congress to be<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0367">367

								refused even to occupy a seat at the congress, but took himself off,
								and with him went all the ambassadors from Arcadia.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
							<p>Accordingly, inasmuch as those who had come together refused to take
								the oath at Thebes, the Thebans sent ambassadors to the cities and
								directed them to swear that they would act in accordance with the

								would hesitate to incur the hatred of themselves and the King at the

								Corinth, their first stopping-place, the Corinthians resisted the
								proposal, and replied that they had no desire for oaths shared with
								the King, then other cities also followed suit, giving their answers
								in the same terms. Thus it was that this attempt on the part of

								end.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Epaminondas, on the other hand,
								wishing to bring over the Achaeans to the side of the Thebans, in
								order that the Arcadians and the other allies might be more inclined
								to give heed to them, decided that he must march forth against
								Achaea. He therefore persuaded Peisias, the Argive, who held the
								position of general at Argos, to occupy Oneum<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb"> A mountain range, south-east of Corinth, over which
									the road from Northern Greece into Peloponnesus passed.</note>
								in advance. And Peisias, after he had learned that the guard over
								Oneum was being maintained carelessly by Naucles, who commanded the
								mercenary troops of the Lacedaemonians, and by Timomachus, the
								Athenian, did indeed seize the hill above Cenchreae by night
									with<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								having provisions for seven days.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
							<p>Within this number of days the Thebans arrived and crossed over
								Oneum, and all the allies thereupon marched against Achaea, under
								the leadership of Epaminondas. Now upon the urgent entreaty which
								the aristocrats of Achaea addressed to him, Epaminondas effected
								through his personal influence an arrangement that their opponents
								were not to banish the aristocrats or to change the form of
								government, but after receiving pledges from the Achaeans that in
								very truth they would be allies and would follow wherever the
								Thebans led the way, he thereupon returned home.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
							<p>When, however, the Arcadians and the Achaean opposition brought
								against him the charge that he had aranged matters in Achaea in the

								resolved to send governors to the Achaean cities. When they arrived
								they drove out the aristocrats, with the assistance of the commons,
								and established democracies in Achaea. But those who had been thus
								exiled speedily banded themselves together, proceeded against each
								one of the cities singly, and as they were not few in number,
								accomplished their restoration and gained possession of the cities.
								Then, since after their restoration they no longer followed a
								neutral course, but fought zealously in support of the
								Lacedaemonians, the Arcadians were hard pressed by the
								Lacedaemonians on the one side and by the Achaeans on the other.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for Sicyon, its government up to

								first with their<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								to the Argives and to the Arcadians that if the richest men should

								opportunity offered, the city would go over to the Lacedaemonians
								again, <said direct="true">while if a democracy is established, be well assured,</said> he
									said, <said direct="true">that the city will remain true to you. If, therefore, you

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
							<p>Accordingly the Arcadians and the Argives, upon hearing these words,

								be on terms of full equality. When they had come together, he bade
								them choose whomsoever they saw fit as generals; and they chose
								Euphron himself, Hippodamus, Cleander, Acrisius, and Lysander. When

								commander.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46">
							<p>And straightway Euphron made some of these mercenaries faithful to

								and banished others, so that he brought everything under his control

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>When, however, the former exiles learned of his journey and his

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><said direct="true">Fellow citizens, we arraign on the

								and the wicked, although they commit them, strive to do them in
								secret, these persons have so far surpassed all mankind in hardihood
								and villainy that in the presence of the very magistrates and in the
								presence of you, who alone have authority to decide who shall die
								and who shall not, they took decision into their own hands and slew
								the man. Therefore if these men do not suffer the extreme penalty,
								who will ever have the courage to visit our city? And what will
								become of the city if any one who so desires is to be allowed to
								slay a man before he has made known for what purpose he has come

										><date when="-0366">366 B.C.</date></note> having shown the
								utmost contempt for our city. It is for you, after you have heard,

								deserve.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the words of the officials;
								as for those who had slain Euphron, all except one denied that they
								had been the perpetrators of the deed; but one had admitted it, and
								began his defence in some such words as these: <said direct="true">Surely, Thebans, to
								feel contempt for you is not possible for a man if he knows that you
								have authority to do with him as you will; in what, then, did I
								trust when I here slew the man? Be well assured that it was first of
								all in the belief that I was doing a just deed, and secondly in the
								thought that you would decide rightly; for I knew that you likewise,
								in dealing with the party of Archias and Hypates,<note

								found to have performed acts like those of Euphron, did not wait for
								a vote, but punished them as soon as you found yourselves able to do

								condemned to death by all mankind.</said></p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
							<p><said direct="true" rend="merge">Was not Euphron also, I ask, guilty under all these heads? In the

								and of gold, and left them empty of all these treasures. Again, who
								could be more manifestly a traitor than Euphron, who was the closest
								of friends to the Lacedaemonians and then chose you in their stead,
								and after he had given you pledges and received pledges from you,
								betrayed you again and handed over the port to your adversaries?
								Once again, was he not beyond question a tyrant, when he made slaves
								not only free men<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date

								put to death and banished and robbed of property, not the people who

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">

								the Acropolis, he got together money and came hither. Now if he had
								been shown to have gathered armed forces with which to attack you,
								you would even feel grateful to me for slaying him; but when he
								provided himself with money instead, and came with the purpose of
								corrupting you by means of this money and persuading you to make him
								lord of the city again, how can I justly be put to death by you for
								inflicting upon the man his due punishment? For whereas those who
								are constrained by arms suffer damage, yet they are not thereby
								shown to be wicked at any rate; but those who are corrupted by money
								in violation of the right not only suffer damage, but at the same

									not been slain justly? Where can such a one show that a

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
							<p>And when the Thebans bade them come, saying that peace would be

								to draw off the besiegers. The Arcadians, however, were not any more
								disposed to stir than before, but disregarded all these doings.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>Then Archidamus, espying a hill over which the Arcadians had carried

								leading the way to this place by a roundabout route, as soon as the
								peltasts who were running on ahead of Archidamus caught sight of the

								stockade, they attacked them, and the cavalry endeavoured to join in
								the attack. The enemy, however, did not give way, but forming
								themselves into a compact body, remained quiet. Then the
								Lacedaemonians attacked again. The enemy did not give way even then,
								but on the contrary proceeded to advance, and by this time there was
								a deal of shouting; Archidamus himself thereupon came to the rescue,
								turning off along the wagon road which runs to Cromnus and leading
								his men in double file, just as he chanced to have them formed.</p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>But when the Lacedaemonians as they retired along the road came out

								order, just as they were, and while inferior in numbers, they were
								in better spirits by far, since they had attacked a foe who
								retreated and had killed men. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand,
								were exceedingly despondent, for they saw that Archidamus was

								had heard, he said, that the Lacedaemonians were on the borders
								under arms and that some of the Arcadians were going to betray Tegea

								rescue, although they were still without breakfast, they and their
								horses as well.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
							<p>Here, again, who would not admire the valour of these men also? For
								although they saw that the enemy were far more numerous, and
								although a misfortune had befallen the horsemen at Corinth, they
								took no account of this, nor of the fact that they were about to
								fight with the Thebans and the Thessalians, who were thought to be
								the best of horsemen, but rather, being ashamed to be at hand and
								yet render no service to their allies, just as soon as they saw
									the<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0362">362 B.C.</date></note> enemy they crashed upon
								them, eagerly desiring to win back their ancestral repute.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
							<p>And by engaging in the battle they did indeed prove the means of
								saving for the Mantineans everything that was outside the wall, but
								there fell brave men among them; and those also whom they slew were
								manifestly of a like sort; for neither side had any weapon so short
								that they did not reach one another therewith. And the Athenians did
								not abandon their own dead, and they gave back some of the enemy’s
								under a truce.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for Epaminondas, on the other hand,
								when he considered that within a few days it would be necessary for
								him to depart, because the time fixed<note anchored="true"
									resp="Loeb"> Apparently either by the Theban government or by
									agreement with the allies.</note> for the campaign had expired,
								and that if he should leave behind him unprotected the people to
								whom he had come as an ally, they would be besieged by their
								adversaries, while he himself would have completely tarnished his
								own reputation, — for with a large force of hoplites he had been
								defeated at Lacedaemon by a few, and defeated likewise in a cavalry
								battle at Mantinea, and through his expedition to Peloponnesus had
								made himself the cause of the union of the Lacedaemonians, the
								Arcadians, the Achaeans, the Eleans, and the Athenians, — he thought
								for these reasons that it was not possible for him to pass by the
								enemy without a battle, since he reasoned that if he were
								victorious, he would make up for all these things, while if he were
								slain, he deemed that such an end would be honourable for one who
								was striving to leave to his fatherland dominion over
								Peloponnesus.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
							<p>Now the fact that Epaminondas himself entertained such thoughts,<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date when="-0362">362
										B.C.</date></note> seems to me to be in no wise remarkable,
								— for such thoughts are natural to ambitious men; but that he had
								brought his army to such a point that the troops flinched from no
								toil, whether by night or by day, and shrank from no peril, and
								although the provisions they had were scanty, were nevertheless
								willing to be obedient, this seems to me to be more remarkable.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
							<p>For at the time when he gave them the last order to make ready,
								saying that there would be a battle, the horsemen eagerly whitened
								their helmets at his command, the hoplites of the Arcadians painted
									clubs<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> The Theban
									device.</note> upon their shields, as though they were Thebans,
								and all alike sharpened their spears and daggers and burnished their
								shields.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
							<p>But when he had led them forth, thus made ready, it is worth while
								again to note what he did. In the first place, as was natural, he
								formed them in line of battle. And by doing this he seemed to make
								it clear that he was preparing for an engagement; but when his army
								had been drawn up as he wished it to be, he did not advance by the
								shortest route towards the enemy, but led the way towards the
								mountains which lie to the westward and over against Tegea, so that
								he gave the enemy the impression that he would not join battle on
								that day.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
							<p>For as soon as he had arrived at the mountain, and when his battle
								line had been extended to its full length, he grounded arms at the
								foot of the heights, so that he seemed like one who was encamping.
								And by so doing he caused among most of the enemy a relaxation of
								their mental readiness for fighting, and likewise a relaxation of
								their readiness as regards their array for battle. It was not until
								he had moved<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0362">362 B.C.</date></note> along successive
								companies to the wing where he was stationed, and had wheeled them
								into line thus strengthening the mass formation of this wing,<note
									anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> The entire army, marching in a long
									column of even width, with Epaminondas at the head,
									<q type="emph">right-faced</q> upon reaching the desired position, thus forming a
									long battle-line, of even, but slight, depth, with Epaminondas
									on the left wing. He wished, however, to increase the depth of
									this wing. He accordingly caused successive companies, from the
									centre and the right wing, to <q type="emph">left face</q> again and march along
									behind the line to the left wing, thus gradually increasing its
									depth.</note> that he gave the order to take up arms and led the
								advance; and his troops followed. Now as soon as the enemy saw them
								unexpectedly approaching, no one among them was able to keep quiet,
								but some began running to their posts, others forming into line,
								others bridling horses, and others putting on breast-plates, while
								all were like men who were about to suffer, rather than to inflict,
								harm.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
							<p>Meanwhile Epaminondas led forward his army prow on, like a trireme,
								believing that if he could strike and cut through anywhere, he would
								destroy the entire army of his adversaries. For he was preparing to
								make the contest with the strongest part of his force, and the
								weakest part he had stationed far back, knowing that if defeated it
								would cause discouragement to the troops who were with him and give
								courage to the enemy. Again, while the enemy had formed their
								horsemen like a phalanx of hoplites, — six deep and without
								intermingled foot soldiers, —</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
							<p>Epaminondas on the other hand had made a strong column of his
								cavalry, also, and had mingled foot soldiers among them, believing
								that when he cut through the enemy’s cavalry, he would have defeated
								the entire opposing army; for it is very hard to find men who will
								stand firm when they see any of their own side in flight. And in
								order to prevent the Athenians on the left wing from coming to
									the<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" type="date"><date
										when="-0362">362 B.C.</date></note> aid of those who were
								posted next to them, he stationed both horsemen and hoplites upon
								some hills over against them, desiring to create in them the fear
								that if they proceeded to give aid, these troops would fall upon
								them from behind.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, he made
								his attack, and he was not disappointed of his hope; for by gaining
								the mastery at the point where he struck, he caused the entire army
								of his adversaries to flee.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
							<p>When, however, he had himself fallen, those who were left proved
								unable to take full advantage thereafter even of the victory; but
								although the opposing phalanx had fled before them, their hoplites
								did not kill a single man or advance beyond the spot where the
								collision had taken place; and although the cavalry also had fled
								before them, their cavalry in like manner did not pursue and kill
								either horsemen or hoplites, but slipped back timorously, like
								beaten men, through the lines of the flying enemy. Furthermore,
								while the intermingled footmen and the peltasts, who had shared in
								the victory of the cavalry, did make their way like victors to the
								region of the enemy’s left wing, most of them were there slain by
								the Athenians.</p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
							<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When these things had taken place, the
								opposite of what all men believed would happen was brought to pass.
								For since well-nigh all the people of Greece had come together and
								formed themselves in opposing lines, there was no one who did not
								suppose that if a battle were fought, those who proved victorious
								would be the rulers and those who were defeated would be their
								subjects; but the deity so ordered it that both parties set up a

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
							<p>neither was found to be any better off, as regards either additional
