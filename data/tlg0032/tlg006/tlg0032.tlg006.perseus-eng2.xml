                                proceeded were burning up fodder and everything else that was of any
                                use. At this time Orontas, a Persian, who was related to the King by

                                had compelled all who deserted from the King to throw away, but also
                                the wicker shields and the wooden Egyptian shields; there were

                                Clearchus ordered the Greeks to get under arms in line of battle
                                just as they were when the battle took place.</p>

                                King was terrified by the approach of the Greeks, was made clear by
                                the following circumstance: although on the day before he had sent
                                and ordered them to give up their arms, he now, at sunrise, sent
                                heralds to negotiate a truce.</p>

                                at the time to be inspecting the ranks, told the outposts to direct
                                the heralds to wait till he should be at leisure.</p>

                                and he himself came forward with the best armed and best looking of
                                his own troops and told the other generals to do likewise.</p>

                                empowered to report the King’s proposals to the Greeks and the

                                had been charged with carrying on these negotiations, was somewhere
                                near. They stated that what the Greeks said seemed to the King
                                reasonable, and that they had now brought guides with them who would
                                lead the Greeks, in case a truce should be concluded, to a place
                                where they could get provisions.</p>

                            <p>Thereupon Clearchus asked whether he was making a truce merely with

                                the others also. <said direct="true">Every man of them,</said> they
                                replied, <said direct="true">until your message is carried to the

                                speedily, so that they could go and get the provisions without being

                                    until the messengers get fearful of our deciding not to conclude
                                    the truce; to be sure,</said> he said, <said direct="true">I

                                had come, he reported that he accepted the truce, and directed them
                                to lead the way immediately to the provisions.</p>

                                but Clearchus, although he had made the truce, kept his army in line
                                of battle on the march, and commanded the rearguard himself. And
                                they kept coming upon trenches and canals, full of water, which
                                could not be crossed without bridges. They made bridges of a kind,
                                however, out of the palm trees which had fallen and others which
                                they cut down themselves.</p>

                                spear in his left hand and in his right a stick, and whenever he
                                thought that anyone of the men assigned to this task was shirking,
                                he would pick out the right man and deal him a blow, while at the
                                same time he would get into the mud and lend a hand himself; the
                                result was that everyone was ashamed not to match him in energy.</p>

                                not a proper time to be irrigating the plain; his suspicion was,
                                then, that the King had let the water into the plain just in order
                                that the Greeks might have before their eyes at the very start many
                                things to make them fearful about their journey.</p>

                                showed all kindness, inviting Clearchus at that time to stay with
                                him and making him his guest at dinner. On the following day, when
                                Clearchus returned to the Greek camp, he not only made it clear that
                                he imagined he was on very friendly terms with Tissaphernes and
                                reported the words which he had used, but he said that those whom
                                Tissaphernes had invited must go to him, and that whoever among the
                                Greeks should be convicted of making false charges ought to be
                                punished, as traitors and foes to the Greeks.</p>

                                opposition to his own leadership and plotting against him, with the

                                prefers toil, provided it be the toil of war; when he may keep his
                                money without risk, he elects to diminish it by carrying on war. As

                                or because mountains or a bridge make it necessary, it is inevitable
                                that the hoplites should be squeezed out of line and should march
                                with difficulty, inasmuch as they are crowded together and are
                                likewise in confusion; the result is that, being in disorder, they
                                are of little service.</p>

                                over a bridge or make any other crossing, every man would hurry, in
                                the desire to be the first one across, and that gave the enemy a

                                from the Greek camp, out of fear that the Greeks might attack them

                            <p>For a Persian army at night is a sorry thing. Their horses are
                                tethered, and usually hobbled also to prevent their running away if
                                they get loose from the tether, and hence in case of any alarm a
                                Persian has to put saddle-cloth and bridle on his horse, and then
                                has also to put on his own breastplate and mount his horse—and all
                                these things are difficult at night and in the midst of confusion.
                                It was for this reason that the Persians encamped at a considerable
                                distance from the Greeks.</p>

                                were desirous of withdrawing and were passing the word along, the
                                order to pack up luggage was proclaimed to the Greek troops within
                                hearing of the enemy. For a time the barbarians delayed their
                                setting out, but when it began to grow late, they went off; for they
                                thought it did not pay to be on the march and arriving at their camp
                                in the night.</p>

                                into the territory of the Drilae, at whose hands they were

                                highlands, the Drilae set fire to such of their strongholds as
                                seemed to them easy to capture, and fell back; and the Greeks could
                                secure nothing except an occasional pig or ox or other animal that
                                had escaped the fire. There was one stronghold, however, which was
                                their metropolis, and into this they had all streamed. Around it was
                                an exceedingly deep ravine, and the approaches to the place were
                                difficult.</p>

                                other property, essayed an attack upon the stronghold; in their
                                train there followed a considerable number of spearmen who had set
                                out after provisions, so that the party that crossed the ravine
                                amounted to more than a thousand men.</p>

                                    there be to supply you with boats?—and similarly impassable is
                                    the Parthenius also, to which you would come if you should get

                                one in fear; a robber approaches; as soon as the sower sees him
                                coming, he snatches up his arms, goes to meet him, and fights with
                                him to save his oxen. The two men do all this in rhythm to the music
                                of the flute. Finally, the robber binds the man and drives off the
                                oxen; or sometimes the master of the oxen binds the robber, and then
                                he yokes him alongside the oxen, his hands tied behind him, and
