				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It occurred to me one day that <placeName
							key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, though among the most thinly
						populated of states, was evidently the most powerful and most celebrated
						city in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; and I fell to
						wondering how this could have happened. But when I considered the
						institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lycurgus, who gave them the laws that they
						obey, and to which they owe their prosperity, I do regard with wonder; and I
						think that he reached the utmost limit of wisdom. For it was not by
						imitating other states, but by devising a system utterly different from that
						of most others, that he made his country pre-eminently prosperous. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First, to begin at the beginning, I will take
						the begetting of children.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The prose
								<title>Constitution of the Lacedaemonians</title> by Critias began
							with the same point. See Introduction 3.</note> In other states the
						girls who are destined to become mothers and are brought up in the approved
						fashion, live on the very plainest fare, with a most meagre allowance of
						delicacies. Wine is either witheld altogether, or, if allowed them, is
						diluted with water. The rest of the Greeks expect their girls to imitate the
						sedentary life that is typical of handicraftsmen — to keep quiet and do
						wool-work. How, then, is it to be expected that women so brought up will
						bear fine children? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But Lycurgus thought the labour of slave women
						sufficient to supply clothing. He believed motherhood to be the most
						important function of freeborn woman. Therefore, in the first place, he
						insisted on physical training for the female no less than for the male sex:
						moreover, he instituted races and trials of strength for women competitors
						as for men, believing that if both parents are strong they produce more
						vigorous offspring. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He noticed, too, that, during the time
						immediately succeeding marriage, it was usual elsewhere for the husband to
						have unlimited intercourse with his wife. The rule that he adopted was the
						opposite of this: for he laid it down that the husband should be ashamed to
						be seen entering his wife’s room or leaving it. With this restriction on
						intercourse the desire of the one for the other must necessarily be
						increased, and their offspring was bound to be more vigorous than if they
						were surfeited with one another. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>In addition to this, he withdrew from men the right to take a wife whenever
						they chose, and insisted on their marrying in the prime of their manhood,
						believing that this too promoted the production of fine children. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p>It might happen, however, that an old man had a young wife; and he observed
						that old men keep a very jealous watch over their young wives. To meet these
						cases he instituted an entirely different system by requiring the elderly
						husband to introduce into his house some man whose physical and moral
						qualities he admired, in order to beget children. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p>On the other hand, in case a man did not want to cohabit with his wife and
						nevertheless desired children of whom he could be proud, he made it lawful
						for him to choose a woman who was the mother of a fine family and of high
						birth, and if he obtained her husband’s consent, to make her the mother of
						his children. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He gave his sanction to many similar
						arrangements. For the wives<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e., at
								<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note> want to
						take charge of two households, and the husbands want to get brothers for
						their sons, brothers who are members of the family and share in its
						influence, but claim no part of the money. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus his regulations with regard to the
						begetting of children were in sharp contrast with those of other states.
						Whether he succeeded in populating <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
							>Sparta</placeName> with a race of men remarkable for their size and
						strength anyone who chooses may judge for himself. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having dealth with the subject of birth, I
						wish next to explain the educational system of Lycurgus, and how it differs
						from other systems.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the other Greek states parents who profess
						to give their sons the best education place their boys under the care and
						control of a moral tutor<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">I have adopted for
							<foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδαγωγός</foreign> the term used at
								<placeName key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName> for a person who has
							charge of, but does not teach, an undergraduate.</note> as soon as they
						can understand what is said to them, and send them to a school to learn
						letters, music and the exercises of the wrestling-ground. Moreover, they
						soften the children’s feet by giving them sandals, and pamper their bodies
						with changes of clothing; and it is customary to allow them as much food as
						they can eat. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lycurgus, on the contrary, instead of leaving
						each father to appoint a slave to act as tutor, gave the duty of controlling
						the boys to a member of the class from which the highest offices are filled,
						in fact to the <q type="soCalled">Warden</q> as he is called. He gave this person authority to
						gather the boys together, to take charge of them and to punish them severely
						in case of misconduct. He also assigned to him a staff of youths provided
						with whips to chastise them when necessary; and the result is that modesty
						and obedience are inseparable companions at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
							>Sparta</placeName>. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p>Instead of softening the boys’ feet with sandals he required them to harden
						their feet by going without shoes. He believed that if this habit were
						cultivated it would enable them to climb hills more easily and descend steep
						inclines with less danger, and that a youth who had accustomed himself to go
						barefoot would leap and jump and run more nimbly than a boy in sandals. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p>And instead of letting them be pampered in the matter of clothing, he
						introduced the custom of wearing one garment throughout the year, believing
						that they would thus be better prepared to face changes of heat and cold.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p>As to the food, he required the prefect to bring with him<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="grc">συμβολεύειν</foreign> is the
							conjecture of F. Portus for <foreign xml:lang="grc"
								>συμβουλεύειν</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>εἴρενα</foreign> that of Schneider for <foreign xml:lang="grc"
										>ἄρρενα.</foreign> The prefect took his meals with the class of
							which he had charge. But Stobaeus’ text runs <foreign xml:lang="grc"
								>σῖτόν γε μὴν τοσοῦτον ἔχειν</foreign> (for which read
						<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσθίειν</foreign>) <foreign
							xml:lang="grc">συνεβούλευεν ὡς</foreign>, <gloss>he recommended them
							to eat so moderately that they</gloss>; and this is probably right.</note> such
						a moderate amount of it that the boys would never suffer from repletion, and
						would know what it was to go with their hunger unsatisfied; for he believed
						that those who underwent this training would be better able to continue
						working on an empty stomach, if necessary, and would be capable of carrying
						on longer without extra food, if the word of command were given to do so:
						they would want fewer delicacies and would accommodate themselves more
						readily to anything put before them, and at the same time would enjoy better
						health. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>He also thought that a diet which made their bodies slim would do more to
						increase their height than one that consisted of flesh-forming food.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the other hand, lest they should feel too
						much the pinch of hunger,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
								><title>Anabasis</title>, 4.6.14.</note> while not giving them the
						opportunity of taking what they wanted without trouble he allowed them to
						alleviate their hunger by stealing something. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p>It was not on account of a difficulty in providing for them that he
						encouraged them to get their food by their own cunning. No one, I suppose,
						can fail to see that. Obviously a man who intends to take to thieving must
						spend sleepless nights and play the deceiver and lie in ambush by day, and
						moreover, if he means to make a capture, he must have spies ready. There can
						be no doubt then, that all this education was planned by him in order to
						make the boys more resourceful in getting supplies, and better fighting
						men.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Someone may ask: </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p>But why, if he believed stealing to be a fine thing, did he have the boy who
						was caught beaten with many stripes? I reply: Because in all cases men
						punish a learner for not carrying out properly whatever he is taught to do.
						So the Spartans chastise those who get caught for stealing badly. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p>He made it a point of honour to steal as many cheeses as possible <del>from the
						altar of Artemis Orthia</del>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">At this altar the
							annual scourging of Spartan boys and youths took place, according to
							Plutarch and Pausanias; but this custom seems to have no connexion with
							that of punishing those who were caught thieving. It is not improbable
							that the whole of this sentence is an interpolation; if not, the text is
							corrupt beyond restoration.</note> but appointed others to scourge the
						thieves, meaning to show thereby that by enduring pain for a short time one
						may win lasting fame and felicity. It is shown herein that where there is
						need of swiftness, the slothful, as usual, gets little profit and many
						troubles. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In order that the boys might never lack a
						ruler even when the Warden was away, he gave authority to any citizen who
						chanced to be present to require them to do anything that he thought right,
						and to punish them for any misconduct. This had the effect of making the
						boys more respectful; in fact boys and men alike respect their rulers above
						everything. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
					<p>And that a ruler might not be lacking to the boys even when no grown man
						happened to be present, he selected the keenest of the prefects, and gave to
						each the command of a division. And so at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
							>Sparta</placeName> the boys are never without a ruler. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think I ought to say something also about
						intimacy with boys, since this matter also has a bearing on education. In
						other Greek states, for instance among the Boeotians, man and boy live
						together, like married people;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
								><title>Symposium</title>, 8.34.</note> elsewhere, among the
						Eleians, for example, consent is won by means of favours. Some, on the other
						hand, entirely forbid suitors to talk with boys. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The customs instituted by Lycurgus were
						opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a
						boy’s soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to
						associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind
						of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy’s
						outward beauty, he banned the connexion as an abomination; and thus he
						caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual
						intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I am not surprised, however, that people
						refuse to believe this. For in many states the laws are not opposed to the
						indulgence of these appetites.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I have now dealt with the Spartan system of
						education, and that of the other Greek states. Which system turns out men
						more obedient, more respectful, and more strictly temperate, anyone who
						chooses may once more judge for himself. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When a boy ceases to be a child, and begins to
						be a lad, others release him from his moral tutor and his schoolmaster: he
						is then no longer under a ruler and is allowed to go his own way. Here again
						Lycurgus introduced a wholly different system. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>For he observed that at this time of life self-will makes strong root in a
						boy’s mind, a tendency to insolence manifests itself, and a keen appetite
						for pleasure in different forms takes possession of him. At this stage,
						therefore, he imposed on him a ceaseless round of work, and contrived a
						constant round of occupation. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p>The penalty for shirking the duties was exclusion from all future honours. He
						thus caused not only the public authorities, but their relations also to
						take pains that the lads did not incur the contempt of their fellow citizens
						by flinching from their tasks. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moreover, wishing modesty to be firmly rooted
						in them, he required them to keep their hands under their cloaks, to walk in
						silence, not to look about them, but to fix their eyes on the ground. The
						effect of this rule has been to prove that even in the matter of decorum the
						male is stronger than the female sex. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p>At any rate you would expect a stone image to utter a sound sooner than those
						lads; you would sooner attract the attention of a bronze figure; you might
						think them more modest even than a young bride in the bridal chamber.<note

					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the care that he bestowed on the

				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For those who had reached the prime of life he
						showed by far the deepest solicitude. For he believed that if these were of
						the right stamp they must exercise a powerful influence for good on the

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p>He saw that where the spirit of rivalry<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
								><title>Cyropaedia</title>, 2.1.22.</note> is strongest among the
						people, there the choruses are most worth hearing and the athletic contests
						afford the finest spectacle. He believed, therefore, that if he could match
						the young men together in a strife of valour, they too would reach a high
						level of manly excellence.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
								><title>Cyropaedia</title>, 7.2.26.</note> I will proceed to

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Ephors, then, pick out three of the very

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here then you find that kind of strife that is
						dearest to the gods, and in the highest sense political — the strife that
						sets the standard of a brave man’s conduct; and in which either party exerts
						itself to the end that it may never fall below its best, and that, when the
						time comes, every member of it may support the state with all his
							might.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><title>Horsemanship</title>,

					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>And they are bound, too, to keep themselves fit, for one effect of the strife
						is that they spar whenever they meet; but anyone present has a right to part
						the combatants. If anyone refuses to obey the mediator the Warden takes him
						to the Ephors; and they fine him heavily, in order to make him realize that
						he must never yield to a sudden impulse to disobey the laws. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To come to those who have passed the time of
						youth, and are now eligible to hold the great offices of state. While
						absolving these from the duty of bestowing further attention on their bodily
						strength, the other Greeks require them to continue serving in the army. But
						Lycurgus established the principle that for citizens of that age, hunting
						was the noblest occupation, except when some public duty prevented, in order
						that they might be able to stand the fatigues of soldiering as well as the
						younger men. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I have given a fairly complete account of the
						institutions of Lycurgus so far as they apply to the successive stages of
						life. I will now try to describe the system that he established for all
						alike. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lycurgus found the Spartans boarding at home
						like the other Greeks, and came to the conclusion that the custom was
						responsible for a great deal of misconduct. He therefore established the
						public messes outside in the open,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Lit.
							<gloss>moved the Syskania out into the open.</gloss> See Introduction 3.</note>
						thinking that this would reduce disregard of orders to a minimum. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p>The amount of food he allowed was just enough to prevent them from getting
						either too much or too little to eat. But many extras are supplied from the
						spoils of the chase; and for these rich men sometimes substitute wheaten
						bread. Consequently the board is never bare until the company breaks up, and
						never extravagantly furnished. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p>Another of his reforms was the abolition of compulsory drinking,<note
							resp="Loeb" anchored="true">At the public meals each had his own cup:
							there was no passing of cups along as at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
								>Athens</placeName> and elsewhere. Critias in
								<title>Athenacus</title>, 10.432 D and 11.463 E.</note> which is the
						undoing alike of body of mind. But he allowed everyone to drink when he was
						thirsty, believing that drink is then most harmless and most welcome.</p>
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now what opportunity did these public messes
						give a man to ruin himself or his estate by gluttony or wine-bibbing? </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
					<p>Note that in other states the company usually consists of men of the same
						age, where modesty is apt to be conspicuous by its absence from the board.
						But Lycurgus introduced mixed companies<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
							>Something appears to be lost after <foreign xml:lang="grc"
								>ἀνέμιξε </foreign>. Schneider suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>ἀνέμιξε τὰς ἡλικίας ὥστε</foreign>, <gloss>mixed the ages, so
							that.</gloss></note> at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, so
						that the experience of the elders might contribute largely to the education
						of the juniors. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
					<p>In point of fact, by the custom of the country the conversation at the public
						meals turns on the great deeds wrought in the state, and so there is little
						room for insolence or drunken uproar, for unseemly conduct or indecent talk.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
					<p>And the system of feeding in the open has other good results. They must needs
						walk home after the meal, and, of course, must take good care not to stumble
						under the influence of drink (for they know that they will not stay on at
						the table); and they must do in the dark what they do in the day. Indeed,
						those who are still in the army are not even allowed a torch to guide them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lycurgus had also observed the effects of the
						same rations on the hard worker and the idler; that the former has a fresh
						colour, firm flesh and plenty of vigour, while the latter looks puffy, ugly
						and weak. He saw the importance of this; and reflecting that even a man who
						works hard of his own will because it is his duty to do so, looks in pretty
						good condition, he required the senior for the time being in every gymnasium
						to take care that the tasks set should be not too small for the rations
						allowed. </p>
				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
					<p>And I think that in this matter too he succeeded. So it would not be easy to

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
					<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is probable also that these same citizens

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">

				</div>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
					<p>For in other states whn a man proves a coward, the only consequence is that

					<p>Often when sides are picked for a game of ball he is the odd man left out: in
