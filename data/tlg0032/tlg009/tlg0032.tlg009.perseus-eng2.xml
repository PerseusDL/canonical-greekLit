                        appreciation of Agesilaus that shall be worthy of his virtue and glory.
                        Nevertheless the attempt must be made. For it would not be seemly that so
                        good a man, just because of his perfection, should receive no tributes of
                        praise, however inadequate. </p>

                        from Heracles<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Agesilaus was twenty-fifth in

                        is traced through the roll of his ancestors, and those no simple citizens,
                        but kings and sons of kings? </p>

                    <p>Nor are they open to the reproach that though they were kings, they ruled
                        over a petty state. On the contrary, as their family is honoured above all
                        in their fatherland, so is their state glorious above all in <placeName
                            key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; thus they are not first in the
                        second rank, but leaders in a community of leaders. </p>

                    <p>On one account his fatherland and his family are worthy to be praised
                        together, for never at any time has the state been moved by jealousy of
                        their pre-eminence to attempt the overthrow of their government, and never
                        at any time have the kings striven to obtain greater powers than were
                        conferred on them originally at their succession to the throne. For this
                        reason, while no other government — democracy, oligachy, despotism or
                        kingdom — can can lay claim to an unbroken existence, this kingdom alone
                        stands fast continually. </p>

                        before his reign began Agesilaus was deemed worthy to be king. For on the
                        death of King Agis there was a struggle for the throne between Leotychidas,
                        as the son of Agis, and Agesilaus, as the son of Archidamus. The state
                        decided in favour of Agesilaus, judging him to be the more eligible in point
                        of birth and character alike. Surely to have been pronounced worthy of the
                        highest privilege by the best men in the mightiest state is proof sufficient
                        of his virtue, at least before he began to reign. </p>

                        his qualities.
                        <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now Agesilaus was still a young man<note

                        time in power when the news leaked out that the king of the Persians was
                        assembling a great navy and army for an attack on the Greeks. </p>

                    <p>While the Lacedaemonians and their allies were considering the matter,
                        Agesilaus declared, that if they would give him thirty Spartans, two
                        thousand newly enrolled citizens, and a contingent of six thousand allies,
                        he would cross to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and try to
                        effect a peace, or, in case the barbarian wanted to fight, would keep him so
                        busy that he would have no time for an attack on the Greeks. </p>

                        wage an offensive rather than a defensive war, and his wish to make the
                        enemy pay for it rather than the Greeks, were enough to arouse an immediate
                        and widespread enthusiasm for his project. But what appealed most to the
                        imagination was the idea of entering on a struggle not to save <placeName
                            key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, but to subdue <placeName

                            >Asia</placeName>. Tissaphernes had sworn the following oath to
                        Agesilaus: <said direct="true">If you will arrange an armistice to last until the return of the
                        messengers whom I will send to the King, I will do my utmost to obtain
                        independence for the Greek cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                            >Asia</placeName></said>; and Agesilaus on his part had sworn to observe the
                        armistice honestly, allowing three months for the transaction. What
                        followed? </p>

                    <p>Tissaphernes forthwith broke his oath, and instead of arranging a peace,
                        applied to the King for a large army in addition to that which he had
                        before. As for Agesilaus, though well aware of this, he none the less
                        continued to keep the armistice. </p>

                    <p>I think, therefore, that here we have his first noble achievement. By showing
                        up Tissaphernes as a perjurer, he made him distrusted everywhere; and,
                        contrariwise, by proving himself to be a man of his word and true to his
                        agreements, he encouraged all, Greeks and barbarians alike, to enter into an
                        agreement with him whenever he wished it. </p>

                            Tissaphernes to send an ultimatum to Agesilaus, threatening was unless
                            he withdrew from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>; and the
                            allies and the Lacedaemonians present made no concealment of their
                            chagrin, believing that the strength of Agesilaus was weaker than the
                            Persian king’s armament. But Agesilaus with a beaming face bade the
                            envoys of Tissaphernes inform their master that he was profoundly
                            grateful to him for his perjury, by which he had gained the hostility of
                            the gods for himself and had made them allies of the Greeks. </p>

                            markets ready stocked. He advised by letter the Greeks of <placeName

                        without cavalry, while <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> was a
                        difficult country for mounted men, and he thought that Agesilaus was wroth
                        with him on account of his deceit. Concluding, therefore, that his estate in
                            <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> was the real object of
                        the coming attack, he sent the whole of his infantry across to that district
                        and took his cavalry round into the plain of the <placeName
                            key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName>, confident that he could ride
                        down the Greeks before they reached the country where cavalry could not

                        consequence became righteous and fair dealing, he showed Tissaphernes to be
                        a child at deception. It was thought, too, that he made shrewd use of this

                        spear-thrust put to flight the force in front of them. As for the Argives,
                        they fled towards Helicon without awaiting the attack of Agesilaus. And now

                        was not the safest. For he might have allowed the men who were trying to
                        break through to pass, and then have followed them and annihilated those in
                        the rear. Instead of doing that he made a furious frontal attack on the
                        Thebans. Thrusting shield against shield, they shoved and fought and killed
                        and fell. There was no shouting, nor was there silence, but the strange
                        noise that wrath and battle together will produce. In the end some of the
                        Thebans broke through and reached Helicon, but many fell during the retreat.

                        to himself. In this belief he tried to engross all the gold, all the silver
                        and all the most costly things in the world. Agesilaus, on the contrary,
                        adopted such a simple style in his home that he needed none of these things.

                        Agesilaus delighted to be constantly visible, believing that, whereas
                        secrecy was becoming to an ugly career, the light shed lustre on a life of

                        the other was glad to make himself accessible to all. And the one affected
                        tardiness in negotiation: the other was best pleased when he could dismiss
                        his suitors quickly with their requests granted. </p>

                        were the tastes of Agesilaus. The Persian king has vintners scouring every
                        land to find some drink that will tickle his palate; an army of cooks
                        contrives dishes for his delight; and the trouble his lackeys take that he
                        may sleep is indescribable. But Agesilaus, thanks to his love of toil,
                        enjoyed any drink that was at hand and any food that came his way; and any
                        place was good enough to give him soft repose. </p>

                            is less appropriate to a dirge than a life of fame and a death
                            well-timed? What more worthy of eulogies than victories most glorious

                        with pride, but gave thanks to the gods. He offered more sacrifices when

                        <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He was wont to look cheerful when in fear, and
