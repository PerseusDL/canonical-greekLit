                                                him. And again, there was not one of the onlookers

                                                whereas those who are possessed of the other gods
                                                have a tendency to be sterner of countenance, more
                                                terrifying of voice, and more vehement, those who
                                                are inspired by chaste Love have a more tender look,
                                                subdue their voices to more gentle tones, and assume
                                                a supremely noble bearing. Such was the demeanour of
                                                Callias at this time under the influence of Love;
                                                and therefore he was an object well worth the gaze
                                                of those initiated into the worship of this god.

                                                business is ruined. For in times past, the reason
                                                why I got invitations to dinner was that I might

                                                merry; but now, what will induce any one to invite
                                                me? For I could no more turn serious than I could
                                                become immortal; and certainly no one will invite me

                                                and heard her vowing that she did, so earnestly that
                                                not only Dionysus but all the bystanders as well
                                                would have taken their oaths in confirmation that
                                                the youth and the maid surely felt a mutual
                                                affection. For theirs was the appearance not of
                                                actors who had been taught their poses but of
                                                persons now permitted to satisfy their
                                                long-cherished desires.

                                                embrace and obviously leaving for the bridal couch,
                                                those who were unwedded swore that they would take
                                                to themselves wives, and those who were already
                                                married mounted horse and rode off to their wives
                                                that they might enjoy them. As for Socrates and the
                                                others who had lingered behind, they went out with
                                                Callias to join Lycon and his son in their walk.
