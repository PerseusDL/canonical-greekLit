<stage>On the sea-shore, in the Tauric Chersonese, near a temple of Artemis.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Iphigenia</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">Pelops, son of Tantalus, coming to <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> with swift horses, married Oenomaus’ daughter, and she gave birth to Atreus, whose children are Menelaus and Agamemnon; from him I was born, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">his child Iphigenia, by the daughter of Tyndareus. Where Euripus rolls about its whirlpools in the frequent winds and twists the darkening waves, my father sacrificed me to Artemis for Helen’s sake, or so he thought, in the famous clefts of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">For there lord Agamemnon mustered his expedition of a thousand ships of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, wanting to take the crown of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> in glorious victory and avenge the outrage to Helen’s marriage, doing this favor for Menelaus. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">But when he met with dreadful winds that would not let him sail, he went to burnt sacrifices, and Calchas had this to say: <q type="spoken">Lord and general of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, Agamemnon, you will not set free your ships from land until Artemis has your daughter Iphigenia</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">as a victim. For you once vowed to sacrifice to the torch-bearing goddess the most beautiful creature brought forth that year; then your wife, Clytemnestra, bore a child in your house—ascribing the prize of beauty to me—whom you must sacrifice.</q> And by the craft of Odysseus, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">they took me from my mother, pretending a marriage with Achilles. I came to <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>; held up high over the altar, I, the unhappy one, was about to die by the sword; but Artemis gave the Achaeans a deer in exchange for me and stole me from them; conducting me through the bright air, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">she settled me here in the land of the Taurians. A barbarian rules this land of barbarians: Thoas, who runs as quickly as the flight of birds, and so he received his name for his swiftness of foot. Artemis has made me the priestess in this temple. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">Here I begin the rites, which the goddess delights in, of a banquet noble in name only—I am silent as to the rest, for I fear the goddess— <del>for I sacrifice, by a custom of the city established earlier, any Hellene who comes to this land.</del> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">But others carry out the sacrifices, not to be spoken of, within the temple of the goddess.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="42"/>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="42">But the strange visions which the night brought with it, I will tell to the air, if that is any relief. I dreamed that I had left this land </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">to live in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and to sleep in the midst of the maidens’ rooms; but the earth’s back was shaken by a tossing swell. When I escaped and stood outside, I saw the cornice of the house fall, and the whole roof hurled in ruins on the ground, from the highest pillars. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">One support of my father’s house was left, I thought, and it had yellow locks of hair waving from its capital, and took on human voice. In observance of the art of slaughtering strangers that I practice here, I gave it holy water as if it were about to die, while I wept. </l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="55">This is my interpretation of this dream: Orestes, whom I consecrated by my rites, is dead. For male children are the supports of the house; and those whom I purify with holy water die. <del>I cannot connect this dream to my friends,</del></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60"><del>for Strophius, when I perished, had no son.</del> Now I wish to give libations to my brother, though he is absent from me—for I would be able to do this—with the attendants given me by the king, Hellene women. But why </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">are they not yet here? I will go inside this temple of the goddess where I live. <stage>Exit Iphigenia.</stage>

<sp><speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="77">O Phoebus, where have you again brought me into the snare, by your oracles, since I avenged my father’s blood by the murder of my mother, and was driven by successive Furies, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">a fugitive, away from the land, and completed many winding courses; and coming to you I asked how I might arrive at an end to whirling madness and my labors, which I have carried out, wandering all over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. . . .  </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">And you told me to go to the boundaries of the Tauric land,  where Artemis, your sister, has an altar, and to take the statue of the goddess, which is said here to have fallen to this temple from heaven; and, taking it by craft of some stroke of luck, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">to complete the venture by giving it to the Athenian land—what was to come next was not spoken of—and if I did this, I would have rest from my labors.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="93"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="93">I have come here, obedient to your words, to an unknown, inhospitable land. I ask you, </l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="95">Pylades, for you are my accomplice in this task, what shall we do? You see that the surrounding walls are high; shall we ascend the steps leading up to the house? But how might we escape notice? Or loosening the bronze bars of the door with levers, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">of which we know nothing? If we are caught opening the gates and contriving an entrance, we shall die. No, but before we die, let us escape on the ship in which we sailed here.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pylades</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="104">Flight is not to be endured, nor are we accustomed to it, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="105">and we must not bring reproach on the god’s oracle; let us leave the temple and hide in a cave which the black sea washes with its moisture—far from the ship, so that no one, seeing it, may tell the ruler, and then seize us by force. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="110">But when the eye of gloomy night comes on, then we must dare to take the polished statue from the shrine, by any means. See where between the triglyphs there is an empty space to let ourselves down. The brave endure their labors, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="115">the cowardly are worth nothing at all.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="116">Yes, we did not come on a long sea voyage only to undertake a return home before the end; but you have spoken wel, we must obey. We should go wherever we can hide and escape notice. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">For it will not be the god’s fault if his sacred oracle falls to the ground without effect. We must endure. <stage>Exeunt Orestes and Pylades.</stage></l></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Herdsman</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="260">When we were driving the cattle, that feed in the forest, into the sea that flows through the Symplegades, there was a broken cleft, hollowed by the constant surge of waves, shelter for those who hunt the purple-fish. Here one of the herdsmen saw two youths, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="265">and made a retreat on tip-toe. He said: <q>Don’t you see them? These are deities that sit there.</q> One of us, who revered the gods, lifted up his hands and prayed, as he saw them: </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="270"><q>O son of the sea-goddess Leukothea,  guardian of ships, lord Palaemon, be propitious to us! Or do you sit on our shores, twin sons of Zeus? Or the darlings of Nereus, father of the chorus of fifty Nereids?</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="275">Another, who was foolish and bold in his lawlessness, laughed at the prayers and asserted that ship-wrecked sailors were sitting on the cliff, in fear of our custom, having heard that we sacrifice strangers here.</l> 
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="279">Most of us thought that he spoke well, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="280">and that we ought to hunt down the customary offerings to the goddess. At this moment, one of the strangers left the rock, and stood, shaking his head up and down and groaning, with hands trembling, wandering in madness; and like a hunter, he cried aloud: </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="285"><q type="spoken">Pylades, do you see her? Don’t you see hell’s dragon, how she wants to kill me, fringed with her dreadful vipers against me? and the one who breathes fire and slaughter from her robe and wings her way, my mother</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="290"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">in her arms—the rocky mass, how she hurls it at me! Ah, she will kill me! Where can I escape?</q></l> 
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="291a">We could not see these shapes; but he alternated the sounds of sheep and howling of dogs . . .  to send forth the Furies’ imitations.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="295"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="295">Astonished, we cowered together and sat in silence; but he drew his sword and rushed like a lion into the midst of our cattle, striking their flanks with his iron sword and thrusting it into their sides, thinking in this way to ward off the Furies, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="300">so that the waves of the sea blossomed red with blood. And all of us, as we saw our herds falling and ravaged, took arms, blew our conch shells, and collected the neighbors; for we thought cowherds would make a poor fight of it </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="305">against well-grown and young foreigners. After a long time, our numbers were complete. But the stranger fell down, his pulsing beat of madness gone, his chin dripping with foam; when we saw him, so conveniently fallen, each of us went to work, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="310">hurling and striking at him.  The other stranger wiped off the foam and tended his body, covering him with a finely-woven robe, looking out for the attacking blows, treating his friend kindly with his care. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="315">The stranger, now in his senses, started up from his fall and realized the surge of enemies close at hand and the present danger to them both, with a groan; we did not let up our attack with stones, pressing hard from all sides. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="320">Then we heard his dreadful exhortation: <q type="spoken">Pylades, we shall die, but let us die with glory; draw your sword, and follow me.</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="323">But when we saw our enemies brandishing their two swords, we fled and filled up the rocky glens. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="325">But while some would flee, others pressed on and attacked them; if they drove those back, the ones who had just given way struck them with stones again. But it was hard to believe; with so many hands, no one succeeded in hitting these offerings to the goddess. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="330">We got the better of them with difficulty; not by daring, but by surrounding them in a circle, with stones we took away their swords; they sank on their knees to the ground, in weariness. Then we brought them to the lord of this land. He saw them, and at once </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="335">sent them to you, for purification and slaughter. You have prayed for such sacrificial victims as these strangers, lady; if you destroy them, <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> will make atonement for your murder and pay the penalty for the sacrifice in <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>.</l></sp>

    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="378">My unhappy Orestes, if you are dead, what glories have you left, what achievements of a father! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="380">I blame the goddess’ subtleties; whichever mortal has engaged in murder, or has touched a woman in childbirth or a corpse, she drives from her altars, thinking him impure; but she herself delights in human sacrifices. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="385">It is not possible that Leto, the wife of Zeus, gave birth to such folly. I judge that the feast prepared by Tantalus for the gods is not to be believed, that they fed on the flesh of his son; and I think that the people here, who are themselves killers of men, </l>

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="939"/>

<sp><speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="939">I will tell you; this is the beginning of my many troubles. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="940">When my mother’s evil deeds, that I cannot speak of, came into my hands, I was driven to flight by the Furies’ pursuit; then Loxias sent me to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to stand trial with the goddesses who may not be named. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="945">For there is a holy tribunal there, which Zeus once established for Ares, when his hands were stained with blood-pollution. I came there . . . at first, no host would willingly take me in, as one hated by the gods; then some who felt shame offered me a table apart, as a guest, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="950">themselves being under the same roof, and in silence they kept me from speaking, so that I might be apart from them in food and drink, and into each private cup they poured an equal measure of wine and had their delight. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="955">And I did not think it right to blame my hosts, but I grieved in silence and seemed not to know, while I sighed deeply, that I was the murderer of my mother. I hear that my misfortunes have become a festival at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and they still hold this custom </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="960">and the people of Pallas honor the cup that belongs to the Feast of Pitchers. When I came to the hill of Ares to stand my trial, I took one seat, and the eldest of the Furies took the other. I spoke and heard arguments on the murder of my mother, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="965">and Phoebus saved me by bearing witness; Pallas counted out equal votes for me; and I went away victorious in my ordeal of blood. Some of the Furies who sat there, persuaded by the judgment, marked out a holy place for themselves beside this very tribunal; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="970">but others were not persuaded by the law, and drove me always in vagabond courses until I came to the holy plain of Phoebus in turn. Stretched out before his shrine and fasting, I swore to break off my life and die there, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="975">if Phoebus, who had destroyed me, did not save me. And then Phoebus cried out a golden voice from the tripod, and sent me here, to get the image Zeus hurled down, and set it up in Athena’s land. But what he marked out for my safety </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="980">you must help me with; for if we possess the statue of the goddess, I will be released from madness and will put you on my ship of many oars and establish you again in <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>. But, my beloved sister, save our father’s house and save me; </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="995">and save our house. But I worry about concealment from the goddess and the king, when he finds the stone pedestal empty of the statue. How will I escape death? What argument will I have? But if this one thing happens all together, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1000">that you take the statue and bear me away on your lovely ship, the venture is a noble one. If I am separated from this, I am lost, but you might settle your affairs well and have a safe return. Indeed, I do not shrink from it, not even if I must die </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1005">to save you. No, for when a man dies and is gone from the home, he is longed for; but women are powerless.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Orestes</speaker>

<l resp="perseus" n="1010">I will bring you home, if I myself escape from here, or if I die, I will remain here with you. Listen to what I think: if Artemis were hostile to this, how could Loxias have prophesied that I would take the statue of the goddess to Pallas’ city . . . </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1327">When we came to the sea-shore, where Orestes’ ship was moored in hiding, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1330">Agamemnon’s daughter motioned to those of us you sent with the strangers’ bonds to stand far off, as if her sacrifice of purifying flame, that she had come for, were secret. But she went on alone, holding the strangers’ chains in her hands, behind them. Your servants, lord, were suspicious, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1335">but we allowed it. After a while, so that we might think that she was accomplishing something, she raised a shout, and chanted strange songs and spells, as if she were washing off the pollution of murder. When we had sat a long time, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1340">it occurred to us that the strangers, loosed from their bonds, might kill her and escape by flight. But we were afraid of seeing what we ought not, and sat in silence. But at length we all resolved to go where they were, although we were not allowed.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1345">There we saw a Hellene ship, winged with ready blade for the stroke, and at the oar-locks were fifty rowers with their oars; the two youths stood by the stern, freed from their chains. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1350">Some were holding the prow in place with poles; others were fastening the anchor from the cat-heads; others were drawing the stern-cables through their hands, and making haste to let down the ladders into the sea for the strangers. Without sparing ourselves, when we saw </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1355">their treacherous wiles, we seized the priestess and the cables, and tried to draw the ship’s rudder-oars out through their holes. Then there was a debate: <q type="spoken">What is your reason for carrying the statue and the priestess away from the land by theft?</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1360"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Who is your father, who are you, to smuggle her away?</q> He said: <q>Know that I am Orestes, her brother, Agamemnon’s son, and I have come to take my sister, whom I lost from her home.</q></l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1364"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="1364">But we held her no less, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1365">and were leading her to you by force, for which I received these dreadful blows on my cheeks; they had no swords, nor did we. Both the youths gave rattling blows with their fists, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1370">darting their limbs against our sides and breasts, so that as soon as we joined battle, we were worn out. We were fleeing to the cliff, stamped with dreadful marks, some with bloody wounds on their heads, others on their eyes; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1375">when we stood on the on the heights, we fought more cautiously and hurled rocks at them. But, standing on the stern, the archers with their arrows kept us off and drove us away. And now an immense swelling wave ran the ship aground, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1380">and the maiden was afraid to get her feet wet. Orestes bore his sister on his left arm, going into the sea and quickly up the ladder, and he set her on the ship, along with the statue of Zeus’ daughter, fallen from heaven. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1385">From the middle of the ship, he cried out: <q>Sailors of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, seize the ship with the oars and make the waves white with foam; for we possess those things for which we sailed the inhospitable straits, within the clashing rocks.</q></l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1390"/>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1390">They gave a cheerful shout, and struck the salt wave. The ship, while it was within the harbor, was headed for the mouth; but when it had crossed, it met with a violent swell aand was hard pressed; and the wind, rising with sudden dreadful gusts, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1395">forced it astern. They beat the waves strongly; but the swell was driving the ship back towards the land. Agamemnon’s daughter stood up and prayed: <q type="spoken">O daughter of Leto, bring me, your priestess, safely to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1400"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">from this barbaric land, and forgive my thefts. For you, goddess, love your brother; believe that I love mine also.</q> The sailors shouted the paean in response to her prayer, and applied their naked shoulders </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1405">to the oars, at the command. But the ship came nearer and nearer to the rocks; some of us rushed into the sea, others grasped the woven ropes. And I set out here to you at once, lord, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1410">to tell you what has happened there. But go, take chains and nets with you; for if the swell does not become calm, there is no hope of safety for the strangers. </l>
