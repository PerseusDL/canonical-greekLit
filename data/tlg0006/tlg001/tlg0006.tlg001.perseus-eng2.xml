          <stage>Scene. — Mount Aetna in Sicily, before the cave of the Cyclops.</stage> 
       <sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
          <l resp="perseus" n="1">O Bromius, unnumbered are the toils I bear because of thee, no less now than when I was young and hale; first, when thou wert driven mad by Hera and didst leave the mountain nymphs, thy nurses; </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="5">next, when in battle with earth-born spearmen I stood beside thee on the right as squire, and slew Enceladus, smiting him full in the middle of his targe with my spear. Come, though, let me see; must I confess ’twas all a dream? No, by Zeus! since I really showed his spoils to the Bacchic god. </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="10">And now am I enduring to the full a toil still worse than those. For when Hera sent forth a race of Tyrrhene pirates against thee, that thou mightest be smuggled far away, I, as soon as the news reached me, sailed in quest of thee with my children; and, taking the helm </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="15">myself, I stood on the end of the stern and steered our trim craft; and my sons, sitting at the oars, made the grey billows froth and foam as they sought thee, my liege. But just as we had come nigh Malea in our course, an east-wind blew upon the ship </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="20">and drove us hither to the rock of Aetna, where in lonely caverns dwell the
                  one-eyed children of ocean’s god, the murdering Cyclopes. Captured by one of them
                  we are slaves in his house; Polyphemus they call him whom we serve; </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="25">and instead of Bacchic revelry we are herding a godless Cyclops’s flocks; and so it is my children, striplings as they are, tend the young thereof on the edge of the downs; while my appointed task is to stay here and fill the troughs and sweep out the cave, </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="30">or wait <pb xml:id="p.448"/> upon the ungodly Cyclops at his impious feasts. His orders now compel obedience; I have to scrape out his house with the rake you see, so as to receive the Cyclops, my absent master, </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="35">and his sheep in clean caverns. <milestone unit="para"/>But already I see my children driving their browsing flocks towards me. <milestone unit="para"/>What means this? is the beat of feet in the Sicinnis dance the same to you now as when ye attended the Bacchic god in his revelries </l> 
          <l resp="perseus" n="40">and made your way with dainty steps to the mask of lyres to the halls of Althaea?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker> 
   <milestone unit="strophe"/><l resp="perseus" n="41">Offspring of well-bred sires and dams, pray whither wilt thou be gone from me to the rocks? Hast thou not here a gentle breeze, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="45">and grass to browse, and water from the eddying stream set near the cave in troughs? and are not thy young ones bleating for thee?</l>
   <milestone unit="mesode"/>
   <l resp="perseus" n="49"><milestone unit="para"/>Pst! pst! wilt thou not browse here, </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="50">here on the dewy slope? Ho? ho! ere long will I cast a stone at thee. Away, away! O horned one, to the fold-keeper of the Cyclops, the country-ranging shepherd. </l> 
   <milestone unit="antistrophe"/>
   <l resp="perseus" n="55">Loosen thy bursting udder; welcome to thy teats the kids, whom thou leavest in the
                  lambkins’ pens. Those little bleating kids, asleep the livelong day, miss thee; </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="60">wilt then leave at last the rich grass pastures on the peaks of Aetna and enter the fold? <gap reason="lost"/>
   <milestone unit="epode"/>
   <milestone unit="para"/>Here we have no Bromian god; no dances here, or Bacchantes thyrsus-bearing;</l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="65">no roll of drums, or drops of sparkling wine by gurgling founts; nor is it now with Nymphs in Nysa I sing a song of Bacchus, Bacchus! </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="70">to the queen of love, in quest of whom I once sped on with Bacchantes, white of foot. <milestone unit="para"/>Dear friend, dear Bacchic god, whither art roaming alone, </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="75">waving thy auburn locks, while I, thy minister, do service to the one-eyed Cyclops, a slave and wanderer I, </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="80">clad in this wretched goat-skin dress, severed from thy love?</l> 
</sp>
 
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="82">Hush, children! and bid our servants fold the flocks in the rock-roofed cavern.</l></sp>
<pb xml:id="p.449"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="84"><stage>(To Servants.)</stage> Away! <stage>(To Silenus.)</stage> But prithee, why such haste, father?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="85">I see the hull of a ship from Hellas at the shore, and men, that wield the oar, on their way to this cave with some chieftain. About their necks they carry empty vessels and pitchers for water; they are in want of food. Luckless strangers! </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="90">who can they be? They know not what manner of man our master Polyphemus is, to have set foot here in his cheerless abode and come to the jaws of the cannibal Cyclops in an evil hour. But hold ye your peace, that we may inquire </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="95">whence they come to the peak of Sicilian Aetna.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="96">Pray tell us, sirs, of some river-spring whence we might draw a draught to slake our thirst, or of someone willing to sell victuals to mariners in need. <milestone unit="para"/>Why, what is this? We seem to have chanced upon a city of the Bromian god; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="100">here by the caves I see a group of Satyrs. To the eldest first I bid <q type="spoken">All hail!</q></l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="102">All hail, sir! tell me who thou art, and name thy country.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="103">Odysseus of Ithaca, king of the Cephallenians’ land.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="104">I know him for a prating knave, one of Sisyphus’ shrewd offspring.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="105">I am the man; abuse me not.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="106">Whence hast thou sailed hither to Sicily?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="107">From Ilium and the toils of Troy.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="108">How was that? didst thou not know the passage to thy native land?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="109">Tempestuous winds drove me hither against my will.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="110">God wot! thou art in the same plight as I am.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="111">Why, wert thou too drifted hither against thy will?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="112">I was, as I pursued the pirates who carried Bromius off.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="113">What land is this and who are its inhabitants?</l></sp>
<pb xml:id="p.450"/>         
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="114">This is mount Aetna, the highest point in Sicily.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="115">But where are the city-walls and ramparts?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="116">There are none; the headlands, sir, are void of men.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="117">Who then possess the land? the race of wild creatures?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="118">The Cyclopes, who have caves, not roofed houses.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="119">Obedient unto whom? or is the power in the people’s hands?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="120">They are rovers; no man obeys another in anything.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="121">Do they sow Demeter’s grain, or on what do they live?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="122">On milk and cheese and flesh of sheep.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="123">Have they the drink of Bromius, the juice of the vine?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="124">No indeed! and thus it is a joyless land they dwell in.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="125">Are they hospitable and reverent towards strangers?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="126">Strangers, they say, supply the daintiest meat.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="127">What, do they delight in killing men and eating them?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="128">No one has ever arrived here without being butchered.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="129">Where is the Cyclops himself? inside his dwelling?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="130">He is gone hunting wild beasts with hounds on Aetna.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="131">Dost know then what to do, that we may be gone from the land?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="132">Not I, Odysseus; but I would do anything for thee.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="133">Sell us food, of which we are in need.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="134">There is nothing but flesh, as I said.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="135">Well, even that is a pleasant preventive of hunger.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="136">And there is cheese curdled with fig-juice, and the milk of kine.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="137">Bring them out; a man should see his purchases.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="138">But tell me, how much gold wilt thou give me in exchange?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="139">No gold bring I, but Dionysus’ drink.</l></sp>
          <pb xml:id="p.451"/>             
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="140">Most welcome words! I have long been wanting that.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="141">Yes, it was Maron, the god’s son, who gave me a draught.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="142">What! Maron whom once I dandled in these arms?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="143">The son of the Bacchic god, that thou mayst learn more certainly.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="144">Is it inside the ship, or hast thou it with thee?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="145">This, as thou seest, is the skin that holds it, old sir.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="146">Why, that would not give me so much as a mouthful.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="147">This, and twice as much again as will run from the skin.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="148">Fair the rill thou speakest of, delicious to me.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="149">Shall I let thee taste the wine unmixed, to start with?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="150">A reasonable offer; for of a truth a taste invites the purchase.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="151">Well, I haul about a cup as well as the skin.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="152"> Come, let it gurgle in, that I may revive my memory by a pull at it.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<l n="153" part="I">There then!</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l n="153b" part="F">Ye gods! what a delicious scent it has!</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l n="154" part="I">What! didst thou see it?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l n="154b" part="F">No, i’ faith, but I smell it.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="155">Taste it then, that thy approval may not stop at words.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="156">Zounds! Bacchus is inviting me to dance; ha! ha!</l>
</sp>   
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="158">Did it not gurgle finely down thy throttle?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="159">Aye that it did, to the ends of my fingers.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>         
<l resp="perseus" n="160">Well, we will give thee money besides.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>          
<l resp="perseus" n="161">Only undo the skin, and never mind the money.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>         
<l resp="perseus" n="162">Bring out the cheeses then and lambs.</l></sp>
     
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>  
   <l resp="perseus" n="163">I will do so, with small thought of any master. For let me have a single cup of that and I would turn madman, </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="165">giving in exchange for it the flocks of every Cyclops and then throwing myself into the sea from the Leucadian <pb xml:id="p.452"/> rock, once I have been well drunk and smoothed out my wrinkled brow. For if a man rejoice not in his drinking, he is mad; for in drinking there is love </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="170">with all its frolic, and dancing withal, and oblivion of woe. Shall not I then purchase so rare a drink, bidding the senseless Cyclops and his central eye go hang?	<stage>Exit	Silenus.</stage></l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>  
   <l resp="perseus" n="175">Hearken, Odysseus, let us hold some converse with thee.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="176">Well, do so; ours is a meeting of friends.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="177">Did you take Troy and capture the famous Helen?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="178">Aye, and we destroyed the whole family of Priam.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="179">After capturing your blooming prize, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="180">were all of you in turn her lovers? for she likes variety in husbands; the traitress! the sight of a man with embroidered breeches on his legs and a golden chain about his neck so fluttered her, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="185">that she left Menelaus, her excellent little husband. Would there had never been a race of women born into the world at all, unless it were for me alone!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
   <l resp="perseus" n="188"><stage>(reappearing with food.)</stage> Lo! I bring you fat food from the flocks, king Odysseus, the young of bleating sheep </l>  
   <l resp="perseus" n="190">and cheeses of curdled milk without stint. Carry them away with you and be gone from the cave at once, after giving me a drink of merry grape-juice in exchange.</l></sp> 
   
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="193">Alack! yonder comes the Cyclops; what shall we do?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>  
   <l resp="perseus" n="194">Then truly are we lost, old sir! whither must we fly?</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="195">Inside this rock, for there ye may conceal yourselves.</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Odysseus</speaker>  
   <l resp="perseus" n="196">Dangerous advice of thine, to run into the net!</l></sp>
          
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>         
   <l resp="perseus" n="197">No danger; there are ways of escape in plenty in the rock.</l></sp>

   <l resp="perseus" n="290">for we preserved thy sire, O king, in possession of his temple-seats deep in the nooks of Hellas; and the sacred port of Taenarus and Malea’s furthest coves remain unharmed; and Sunium’s rock, the silver-veined, sacred to Zeus-born Athena, still is safe, </l>

   <l resp="perseus" n="300">still it is a custom amongst mortal men to receive shipwrecked sailors as their suppliants and show them hospitality and help them <pb xml:id="p.456"/> with raiment; not that these should fill thy jaws and belly, their limbs transfixed with spits for piercing ox-flesh. The land of Priam hath emptied Hellas quite enough, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="305">drinking the blood of many whom the spear laid low, with the ruin it has brought on widowed wives, on aged childless dames, and hoary-headed sires; and if thou roast and consume the remnant,—a meal thou wilt rue,—why, where shall one turn? Nay, be persuaded by me, Cyclops; </l>

   <l resp="perseus" n="382">When we had entered yonder rocky abode, he lighted first a fire, throwing logs of towering oak upon his spacious hearth, </l> 
   <l resp="perseus" n="385">enough for three waggons to carry as their load; next, close by the blazing flame, he placed his couch of pine-boughs laid upon the floor, and filled a bowl of some ten firkins, pouring white milk thereinto, after he had milked his kine; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="390">and by his side he put a can of ivy-wood, whose breadth was three cubits and its depth four maybe; [next he set his brazen pot a-boiling on the fire,<note resp="editor">This line is clearly out of place as it stands; it has been proposed to place it either after line 385 or 395, after either of which it would be appropriate.</note>] spits too he set beside him, fashioned of the branches of thorn, their points hardened in the fire and the rest of them trimmed with the hatchet, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="395">and the blood-bowls of Aetna for the axe’s edge.<note resp="editor">i.e., to catch the blood as the axe strikes, but the expression is a curious one. Kirchhoff gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνάθους</foreign>, in apposition to <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφαγεῖα</foreign>, taking this apparently to mean <gloss>slaughtering tools.</gloss></note>  Now when that hell-cook, god-detested, had everything quite ready, he caught up a pair of my companions and proceeded deliberately to cut the throat of one of them over the yawning brazen pot; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="400">but the other he clutched by the tendon of his heel, and, striking him against a sharp point of rocky stone, dashed out his brains; then, after hacking the fleshy parts with glutton cleaver, he set to grilling them, but the limbs he threw into his cauldron to seethe.</l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="405">And I, poor wretch, drew near with streaming eyes and waited on the Cyclops; but the others kept cowering like frightened birds in crannies of the rock, and the blood <pb xml:id="p.459"/> forsook their skin. Anon, when he had gorged himself upon my comrades’ flesh and </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="410">had fallen on his back, breathing heavily, there came a sudden inspiration to me. I filled a cup of this Maronian wine and offered him a draught, saying, <q type="spoken">Cyclops, son of Ocean’s god, see here what heavenly drink the grapes of Hellas yield,</q> </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="415"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">glad gift of Dionysus.</q> He, glutted with his shameless meal, took and drained it at one draught, and, lifting up his hand, he thanked me thus, <q type="spoken">Dearest to me of all my guests! fair the drink thou givest me to crown so fair a feast.</q></l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="420">Now when I saw his delight, I gave him another cup, knowing the wine would make him rue it, and he would soon be paying the penalty. Then he set to singing; but I kept filling bumper after bumper and heating him with drink. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="425">So there he is singing discordantly amid the weeping of my fellow-sailors, and the cave re-echoes; but I have made my way out quietly and would fain save thee and myself, if thou wilt. Tell me then, is it your wish, or is it not, to fly from this unsocial wretch </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="430">and take up your abode with Naiad nymphs in the halls of the Bacchic god? Thy father within approves this scheme; but there! he is powerless, getting all he can out of his liquor; his wings are snared by the cup as if he had flown against bird-lime, and he is fuddled; but thou art young and lusty; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="435">so save thyself with my help and regain thy old friend Dionysus, so little like the Cyclops.</l></sp>
