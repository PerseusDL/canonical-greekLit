<l resp="perseus" n="49">Leda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">Phoebe, Clytemnestra my wife, and Helen; the foremost of the favored sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> came to woo Helen; but terrible threats of spilling his rival’s blood were uttered by each of them, if he should fail to win the girl.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity, whether to give her or not, how he might best succeed. This thought occurred to him: the suitors should swear to each other and join right hands and pour libations</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">with burnt-sacrifice, binding themselves by this curse: whoever wins the child of Tyndareus for wife, they will assist that man, in case a rival takes her from his house and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and march against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">Hellene no less than barbarian.</l> 
 <l resp="perseus" n="66" rend="indent">Now when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom<note resp="Coleridge">Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτῳ</foreign> with Boissonade and Monk.

<l resp="perseus" n="70">Her choice fell on Menelaus; would she had never taken him! Then there came to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> from the Phrygians the man who, <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> legend says, judged the goddesses’ dispute; in robes of gorgeous hue, ablaze with gold, in true barbaric pomp;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">and he, finding Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off, in mutual desire, to his steading on Ida. Goaded to frenzy, Menelaus flew through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, invoking the ancient oath exacted by Tyndareus and declaring the duty of helping the injured husband.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="85">since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still remained at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> weatherbound. In our perplexity, we asked Calchas, the seer,</l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="90">and he answered that we should sacrifice my own child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose home is in this land, and we would sail and sack the Phrygians’ capital [if we sacrificed her, but if we did not, these things would not happen].<note resp="Coleridge">Nauck rejects l. 93.</note> When I heard this, I commanded Talthybius</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">with loud proclamation to disband the whole army, as I could never bear to slay my daughter. Whereupon my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">bidding her despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, at the same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName>. Yes, this was the inducement I offered my wife,</l>

 <l resp="perseus" n="21">Yes, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition,<note resp="Coleridge"><foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φιλότιμον</foreign> of the MSS., but the verse is probably corrupt, being regarded by Hermann and Dindorf as a gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>.</note> sweet though it seems, brings sorrow with its near approach. At one time the unsatisfied claims of the gods</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">upset our life, at another the numerous peevish fancies of our subjects shatter it.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Old man</speaker>

<l resp="perseus" n="30">Atreus begot you, Agamemnon; but you must experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as you are. Even though you like it not, this is what the gods decree. But you, after letting your taper spread its light abroad,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">write the letter which is still in your hands and then erase the same words again, sealing and reopening the tablet, then flinging it to the ground with floods</l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="40">of tears, and leaving nothing undone in your aimless behavior to stamp you mad. What is it that troubles you? what news is there affecting you,<note resp="Coleridge"><foreign xml:lang="grc">περί σοι</foreign>, but Monk’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρα σοι</foreign>, <q type="translation">what news has reached thee?</q> is a plausible emendation.</note> king?

<l resp="perseus" n="1540">Dear mistress, you shall learn all clearly; from the outset will I tell it, unless my memory fails me somewhat and confuses my tongue in its account. As soon as we reached the grove of Artemis, the child of Zeus, and the flowery meadows,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1545">where the Achaean troops were gathered, bringing your daughter with us, at once the Argive army began assembling; but when king Agamemnon saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1550">from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by her father, spoke thus: <q type="spoken">O my father, here I am; willingly I offer my body for my country and all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>,</q></l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="1555"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">that you may lead me to the altar of the goddess and sacrifice me, since this is Heaven’s ordinance. May good luck be yours for any help that I afford! and may you obtain the victor’s gift and come again to the land of your fathers. So then let none of the Argives lay hands on me,</q></l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="1560"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">for I will bravely yield my neck without a word.</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1561" rend="indent">She spoke; and each man marvelled, as he heard the maiden’s brave speech. But in the midst Talthybius stood up, for this was his duty, and bade the army refrain from word or deed;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1565">and Calchas, the seer, drawing a sharp sword from its scabbard laid it in a basket of beaten gold, and crowned the maiden’s head. Then the son of Peleus, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1570">uttering these words: <q type="spoken">O Artemis, you child of Zeus, slayer of wild beasts, that wheel your dazzling light amid the gloom, accept this sacrifice which we, the army of the Achaeans and Agamemnon with us, offer to you, pure blood from a beautiful maiden’s neck;</q></l>

Each one of us distinctly heard the sound of a blow,<note resp="Coleridge">Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">πληγῆς σαφῶς γὰρ πᾶς τις ᾔσθετο κτύπον</foreign> (Weil).</note> but none saw the spot where the maiden vanished.

<l resp="perseus" n="1585">at the sight of a marvel all unlooked for, due to some god’s agency, and passing all belief, although it was seen; for there upon the ground lay a deer of immense size, magnificent to see, gasping out her life, with whose blood the altar of the goddess was thoroughly bedewed.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1590">Then spoke Calchas thus—his joy you can imagine—<q type="spoken">You captains of this leagued Achaean army, do you see this victim, which the goddess has set before her altar, a mountain-roaming deer? This is more welcome to her by far than the maid,</q></l>
