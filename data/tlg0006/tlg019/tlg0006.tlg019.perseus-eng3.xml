<l resp="perseus" n="45">move clamorously by night, eager for fresh orders; for never before has the sea-faring company been so alarmed. And so I was suspicious of what might happen </l>

<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="52">In good season you come, although your tidings are full of terror; for those men are bent on giving me the slip and stealing away from this land in their ships by night; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">their midnight signalling pleases me. Ah! Fortune, to rob me in my hour of triumph, a lion of his prey, before this spear had made an end of the whole <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army in one line! Yes, if the sun’s bright lamp had not withheld </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">his light, I would not have stayed my victor’s spear, before I had fired their ships and made my way from tent to tent, drenching this hand in Achaean blood. I was eager to make a night attack and take advantage of the stroke of luck sent by heaven; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">but those wise seers of mine, who have heaven’s will so pat, persuaded me to wait for dawn, and then leave not one Achaean in the land. But those others do not await the counsels of my soothsayers; darkness turns runaways to heroes. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">But we must now without delay pass this word to the army to take up arms and cease from slumber, so that many an Achaean, as he leaps aboard his ship, shall be smitten through the back and sprinkle the ladders with blood, and others shall be fast bound with cords </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">and learn to till our Phrygian fields.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="76">You hasten, Hector, before you know clearly what is happening; for we do not know for certain whether the men are flying.</l></sp>
<sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="78">What other reason did the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army have to kindle fires?</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="79">I do not know; I am very suspicious.</l></sp>

<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="87">Hector, why have the sentinels in terror made their way through the army at night to your couch to hold a midnight conclave and disturb the army?</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">Encase yourself in your armor, Aeneas.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="91">What is it? Have tidings come of some secret stratagem set on foot during the night by the foe?</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="93">The men are flying, and going aboard their ships.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="94">What sure proof can you give of this?</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">The whole night they are kindling blazing torches; I think they will not wait for tomorrow, but after lighting brands upon their ships’ decks will leave this land and fly to their homes.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="99">And you, why do you gird on your sword?</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">With my spear I will stop them even as they fly and leap aboard their ships, and my hand shall be heavy upon them; for it is shameful in us, yes, and cowardly as well as shameful, when the god gives them into our hands, to let our foes escape without battle, after all the injuries they have done us.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="105">Would you were as sage as you are bold! But, to be sure, among mortals the same man is not dowered by nature with universal knowledge; each has his special gift appointed him, yours is battle, another’s is sage counsel. You are excited to hear that the Achaeans are </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="110">lighting blazing torches, and you would lead on our troops across the ditches in the calm still night. Now after crossing the deep yawning trench, supposing you should find the enemy are not flying from the land, but are awaiting your onset, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="115">beware lest you suffer defeat and so never reach this city again; for how will you pass the palisades in a rout? And how shall your charioteers cross the bridges without dashing the axles of their cars to pieces? And, if victorious, you have next the son of Peleus to engage; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">he will never allow you to cast the firebrand on the fleet or harry the Achaeans, as you believe. No, for that man is fierce as fire, a very tower of might. Let us rather then leave our men to sleep calmly under arms after the weariness of battle, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="125">while we send, as I advise, whoever will volunteer to spy upon the enemy; and if they really are preparing to fly, let us arise and fall upon the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army, but if this signalling is a trap to catch us, we shall discover from the spy the enemy’s designs </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="130">and take counsel; such is my advice, lord.</l></sp>

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="131"/>
<div type="textpart" subtype="strophe">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="131">It pleases me well; so change your mind and adopt this counsel. I do not love hazardous commands in generals. What is better than for a swift-footed spy to approach the ships </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="135">and learn why our foes are lighting fires in front of their naval station?</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="137">Since this finds favor with you all, prevail. <stage>To Aeneas.</stage> Go and calm the allies; perhaps the army hearing of our midnight council is disturbed. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="140">Mine shall it be to send one forth to spy upon the foe. And if I discover any plot among them, you shall fully hear of it and be present to learn the report; but in case they are starting off in flight, with eager ear await the trumpet’s call, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="145">for then I will not stay, but will this very night engage the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army there where their ships are hauled up.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="147">Send out the spy at once; there’s safety in your counsels now. And you shall find me steadfast at your side, whenever occasion calls.</l></sp>

<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="149">What Trojan of those present in council </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="150">volunteers to go and spy on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet? Who will be that patriot? Who says yes? I myself cannot at every point serve my country and my friends in arms.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="154">I for my country will gladly run this risk </l>

<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="158">True to his name indeed, his country’s friend is Dolon. Your father’s house was famed before, </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="185">for they are immortal and born from immortals, who bear the son of Peleus on his headlong course. Poseidon, lord of the ocean, broke them and gave them to Peleus, so runs the legend. Yet, for I urged you on, I will not break my word; I will give to you </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="760">though to the living it may add dignity and honor for their house. But we have died foolishly and without glory. No sooner had great Hector given us our quarters and told us the password than we lay down to sleep upon the ground, overcome by weariness. No guard our army set </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="765">to watch by night, nor were our arms set in array, nor were the whips hung ready on the horses’ yokes, for our prince was told that you were masters now, and had encamped hard on their ships; so carelessly we threw ourselves down to sleep. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="770">Now I with thoughtful mind awoke from my slumber, and with ungrudging hand measured out the horses’ feed, expecting to harness them at dawn for the fray; through the thick gloom two men I see roaming around our army. But when I roused myself </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="775">they crouched low and were gone once more; and I called out to them to keep away from the army, for I thought they might be thieves from our allies. Nothing from them, so I too said no more, but came back to my couch and slept again.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="780">And as I slept a strange fancy came over me: those horses that I had reared and used to drive, stationed at Rhesus’ side, I saw, I thought as in a dream, with wolves mounted on their backs; and these with their tails lashed the horses’ flanks </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="785">and urged them on, while they snorted and breathed fury from their nostrils, striving in terror to unseat their riders. Up I sprang to defend the horses from the brutes, for the horror of the night scared me. Then as I raised my head I heard the groans of dying men, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="790">and a warm stream of new-shed blood bespattered me, beside my murdered master as he died. To my feet I start, but all unarmed; and as I peer about and grope to find my sword, a stalwart hand from somewhere near struck me with a sword </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="795">beneath the ribs. I felt the sword-thrust, the deep gaping wound it gave me. Down on my face I fell, while they fled clean away with horses and chariot. Oh, oh! Tortured with pain, too weak to stand, a piteous object! </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="915">Many indeed are the wounds, Thamyris, son of Philammon, that you have inflicted on my heart, in your life and in your death. Yes, for it was your pride, your own undoing, and your rivalry with the Muses that made me mother of this poor son of mine. For as I crossed the river’s streams </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="920">I came too near to Strymon’s fruitful couch, that day we Muses came to the brow of Mount Pangaeus with its soil of gold, furnished forth with all our music for one great trial of minstrel skill with that clever Thracian bard; and we blinded him, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="925">Thamyris, the man who often reviled our craft.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="926">And then, when I gave birth to you, because I felt shame of my sisters and my virginity, I sent you to the swirling stream of your father, the river; and Strymon did not entrust your nurture to mortal hands, but to the fountain nymphs. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="930">There you were reared most fairly by the maiden nymphs, and you ruled over <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, a leader among men, my child. So long as you ranged your native land in quest of bloody deeds of prowess I did not fear for your death; but I forbade you to set out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="935">in my knowledge of your doom; but Hector’s sages and those countless embassies persuaded you to go and help your friends.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="938">This was your doing, Athena; you alone are to blame for his death —neither Odysseus nor the son of Tydeus </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="940">had anything to do with it—do not think it has escaped my eye. And yet we sister Muses do special honor to your city, your land we chiefly haunt; and those dark mysteries with their torch processions were revealed by Orpheus, cousin of this dead man </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="945">whom you have slain. Musaeus, too, your holy citizen, of all men most advanced in lore, was trained by Phoebus and us, the nine sisters. And here is your reward for this; in my arms I hold my child and mourn for him. I’ll bring to you no other learned man.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="952">I knew it; it needed no seer to say that he had perished by the arts of Odysseus. Now I, when I saw the Hellene army camped </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="955">in my land, of course would not hesitate to send heralds to my friends, bidding them come and help my country; and so I sent, and he as in duty bound came to share my toils. I do not at all rejoice to see him dead. And now I am ready to raise a tomb for him </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="960">and burn at his pyre great store of fine raiment; for he came as a friend and in sorrow he is going away.</l></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Muse</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="962">He shall not go into earth’s dark soil; so earnest a prayer will I address to the bride of the nether world, the daughter of the goddess Demeter, giver of increase, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="965">to release his soul; and, debtor as she is to me, show that she honors the friends of Orpheus. And to me for the rest of time he will be as one who is dead and does not see the light; for never again will he meet me or see his mother; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="970">but he will lie hidden in a cavern of the land with veins of silver, restored to life, a deified man, just as the prophet of Bacchus dwelt in a grotto beneath Pangaeus, a god whom his votaries honored.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="974">Lightly now shall I feel the grief of the sea-goddess, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="975">for her son too must die. First then for you we sisters must chant our dirge, and then for Achilles when Thetis mourns some day. Pallas, your slayer, shall not save him; so true the shaft Loxias keeps in his quiver for him. </l>
