		<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
		<p>THIS short play needs rather a long introduction. It has had the bad fortune to become a literary problem, and almost all its few readers are so much occupied with the question whether it can be the work of Euripides—and if not his, whose?—that they seldom allow themselves to take it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous piece, not particularly profound or subtle, but always full of movement and life and possessing at least one or two scenes of great and penetrating beauty.</p> 
		<p>The outlines of the <title>Rhesus</title> Question are these. The <title>Rhesus</title> appears in the MSS. of Euripides; we know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or Records of Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the name; some passages in it are quoted by early Alexandrian writers as from <q type="emph">the Rhesus of Euripides;</q> no passage is quoted under any other name. This seems about as strong as external evidence need be. Yet the ancient introduction to the play mentions that <q type="written">some think the play spurious,</q> and expresses the odd opinion that <q type="written">it suggests rather the Sophoclean style.</q> Further, it tells us that, besides the present opening scene, there were extant two different prologues, one of which was <q type="written">quite prosy and perhaps concocted by the actors.</q> This seems to show that the Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first time to collect the complete works of Euripides, some two centuries after his death, found this play current as <q type="soCalled">Euripides’ <title>Rhesus</title>,</q> but that it was credited with three different openings and that its style was felt to be somehow peculiar. </p>
		<p>The peculiarity of style is incontestable. It does not to our judgment suggest Sophocles. It suggests a young man imitating Aeschylus, and it has a great number of Euripidean expressions. Hermann, who collected what he took to be <q type="soCalled">imitations</q> of early poets in the Rhesus, noted only 25 of Sophocles, 38 of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides. </p>
		<p>Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet, naturally influenced by his great forerunners? Hardly: because, with a few exceptions, the verse and diction of the <title>Rhesus</title>, are markedly early in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction direct and rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly relevant. In Euripides’ later years Drama was moving rapidly away from all these things and, as far as we can judge, continued so moving after his death. If the <title>Rhesus</title> is a post-classical play it can hardly be honest fourth-century work: it must be deliberately archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian spirit if not actually of the Alexandrian age. This is what Hermann believed. But unfortunately it is not a bit more like our fragments of Alexandrian tragedy than it is like the Medea; and, further, if it is an Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed in deceiving the Alexandrian critics, detectives specially trained for this kind of work? </p>
		<p>Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by accepting the external evidence as true. The famous critic, Crates, of the second century B.C., happens to mention—in excuse of what he took to be a slip in the poet’s astronomy—that the <title>Rhesus</title> of Euripides was a youthful work. Now the earliest dated tragedy of Euripides that we possess is the <title>Alcestis</title>, B.C. <date when="-0438">438</date>, written when he was about forty-six. His style may well have been considerably different fifteen or twenty years earlier, and must certainly have been much under the influence of Aeschylus. So far, so good. Then what of the other difficulties, the three different opening scenes and the few passages of late phrasing or technique? One obvious explanation suits both. The three different openings pretty clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than once after the poet’s death and adapted by the producer for each occasion. This happened to many plays of Euripides, and in one case we even know the name of the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of the poet. Among other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of the <title>Iphigenia in <placeName key="tgn,5004252">Aulis</placeName></title>. And in this connexion we can hardly help noticing that the <title>Iphigenia in <placeName key="tgn,5004252">Aulis</placeName></title>, like the <title>Rhesus</title> and like no other Greek tragedy, has two alternative openings, one a dull prologue and one a lyrical scene in anapaests under the stars. The general style of the two plays is utterly different; the <title>Iphigenia</title> is most typically late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had both passed at some time through the same revising hand.</p>
		<p>This hypothesis seems to work well. But one difficulty remains. </p>
		<p>We have so far gone on the supposition that Euripides at twenty-five or thirty perhaps wrote very differently from Euripides at forty-six, and that the manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of his later life. There is nothing improbable in this suggestion, but have we any evidence? Yes, a very little, and unfortunately it does not say what we want. We have some fragments—twenty lines altogether—preserved from the <title>Peliades</title>, with which Euripides won his first victory in the year <date when="-0455">455</date>, seventeen years before the <title>Alcestis</title>, and as far as they go they are just in his ordinary manner—a good deal more so, in fact, than much of the <title>Alcestis</title> is. Let us face this difficulty.</p> 
		<p>The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible, lucid, antithetic, studiously simple in vocabulary and charged with philosophic reflection. If we look in his extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of the <title>Rhesus</title>, which is comparatively terse, rich, romantic, not shrinking from rare words and strong colour and generally untinged by philosophy, we shall find the nearest approach to it in the <title>Cyclops</title>. Next to the <title>Cyclops</title> I am not sure what play would come, but the <title>Alcestis</title> would not be far off. It has especially several Epic forms which cannot be paralleled in tragedy. Now the conjunction of these two plays with the <title>Rhesus</title> is significant. The three seem to be three earliest of the extant plays; they are also—if we count the Heraclidae as mutilated—the three shortest. But, what is more important, the <title>Cyclops</title> is not a tragedy but a satyr-play, and the <title>Alcestis</title> is a tragedy of a special sort, written to take the place of a satyr-play. It is a tragedy with some half grotesque figures and a fantastic atmosphere.</p> 
		<p>This is no place for a close analysis of the diction of the various works of Euripides; but taking one rough test, just for what it is worth, we may try to count the number of words in each play which are not found elsewhere in Euripides. The <title>Medea</title>, a central sort of play, has in its 1419 lines 103 such words. The <title>Alcestis</title>, with 1163 lines, has 122; the <title>Rhesus</title>, with less than 1000 lines, has 177; the <title>Cyclops</title>, with only 701 lines, has actually 220. This calculation is doubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth very little until it is carefully analysed. But on the whole it accords with my general impression that the <title>Rhesus</title> in its variation from the Euripidean norm goes further than the <title>Alcestis</title>, and not so far as the <title>Cyclops</title>, and goes in very much the same direction. I feel in the <title>Rhesus</title> a good deal of that curious atmosphere, not exactly comic, but wild and extravagant, which the Greeks felt to be suited to the Satyr horde; the atmosphere normally breathed by the one-eyed Giant of the cavern on volcanic <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>, or the drunken and garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death and cracks his ribs for him at midnight among the tombs. The whole scene and setting of the <title>Rhesus</title>; the man-wolf crawling away into the darkness and his two enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness with his bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king with his round targe that shines by night and his horses whiter than the snow; the panic of the watch, the vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess disguised as another goddess, the thrilling half-farcical scene where the spy Odysseus is actually caught and befools his captors: these things are not of course comic, like some incidents in the <title>Cyclops</title>. They belong to tragedy; but they are near the outside limit of the tragic convention, and would perhaps be most at home in a pro-satyric tragedy like the <title>Alcestis</title>.</p> 
		<p>In the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting the external evidence which makes this play a work of Euripides, if we suppose it to be an early pro-satyric play which was produced again after the poet’s death by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary. Most scholars, however, prefer to think it simply an archaistic work of the fourth century. </p>
		<p>On this theory the Alexandrians when looking for the <title>Rhesus</title> of Euripides found an anonymous play called <title>Rhesus</title> and accepted it for what it was worth. The Prologues mentioned in the argument would perhaps belong to other plays of the same name; one, no doubt, to the real play of Euripides. The rich and severe style may, for all we know—for direct evidence fails us—be the natural work of some reactionary archaistic school about the time of Plato or Aristotle. The same date might well be indicated by the great interest our play takes in the <title>Iliad</title>, and by its almost <q type="emph">Alexandrian</q> use of the gods as ornamental machinery. I cannot call such a theory improbable; but it really amounts to rejecting the external evidence in order to place the Rhesus in a period of tragic style of which we happen to know nothing. It is certainly not confirmed by the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes or Chairemon.</p> 
		<p>And, if one is to venture into more speculative and subjective arguments, I find it rather hard to think of any lyric poet except Euripides who could have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about the Nightingale in the Watchers’ Song; of any playwright except Euripides who would have ended a play of gallant martial adventure with the vision of a solitary mother clasping her dead son. There are many other passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing in the dark that heralds the entry of the wounded Thracian, and the final passing out of the army to its certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped genius than common imitative mediocrity. If a nameless fourth-century poet wrote this play, I think we should have heard more of him. </p>
		<p>The story of the play is taken straight from the Doloneia, an Epic rhapsody which now takes its place as the Tenth Book of the <title>Iliad</title>, but was very likely independent in the time of Euripides (<title>Rise of the Greek Epic</title>, p. 313 f.). The play seems in one or two points to follow a more archaic model than the version in our Homer. (See notes on l. 150 and 1. 175.) </p>
		<p>In Rhesus himself—the name is said to be the Thracian form of rex<note resp="editor">Perdrizet, Cultes et Mythes de Pangée, p. 17</note>—we seem to have the traditional divine king of the Thracian tribes about Pangaion, seen through the eyes of Greek romance. He is the son of the greatest of Rivers and the Muse of the Mountain: she is simply <q type="emph">The Muse,</q> otherwise nameless, and we are lost if we try to bind her down to the identity of any Greek goddess. Like many Thracian heroes Rhesus has a dash of the Sun-god in him, the burning targe, the white horses and the splendour. Like them he is a boaster and  a deep drinker, a child of battle and of song. Like other divine kings he dies in his youth and strength, and keeps watch over his people from some <q type="emph">feasting presence, full of light,</q> where he lies among the buried silver-veins of Pangaion. If the uttermost need comes, doubtless he will wake again. When the Athenians began making their dangerous settlements on the coast of Thrace—ten thousand settlers were massacred by Rhesus’s people about <date when="-0465">465</date> B.C.: <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> not fully established till 437—they found the legend of Rhesus in the air, and eventually they thought it prudent to send for his hallowed bones from the <placeName key="tgn,7002331">Troad</placeName>, where they were supposed to be buried, and give them a tomb in the Athenian colony. Possibly that pacified him. And his legend in the mouth of the poets seemed perhaps like the story of his own mountaineers, multitudes of strong men, stormy and chivalrous, terrible in onset, who somehow in the end melted away before the skill and persistent courage of a civilised Greek city.</p></note>

<note resp="editor" place="inline">The date and authorship of the play are unknown; it probably belongs to the Fifth Century B.C., and is attributed to Euripides.</note>
<note resp="editor" place="inline">THE play presupposes a knowledge of the Iliad in some form, if not exactly in the form which it now wears. We are not only supposed to know that Hector, son of Priam, leads the Trojans and their allies (<q type="written">Trojans, and Lycians, and Dardans bold</q>: in tragedy they are also called Phrygians) in defence against the Greeks—Argives, Achaeans, Hellênes—under Agamemnon, king of men, and his brother Menelaüs, husband of Helen. This sort of supposition is usual in all Greek tragedy. It merely means that the poet takes for granted the main outlines of the heroic saga. But in this play we are also supposed to take up the story as it stands at the opening of the Doloneia or Tenth Book of the <title>Iliad</title>. Indeed one might almost say that the <title>Rhesus</title> is simply the Doloneia turned into drama and set in the Trojan camp. The only other play that is taken straight from Homer is the Satyr-play, <title>Cyclops</title>, which tells the story of <title>Odyssey</title> IX., but it is likely enough that if we possessed more of the earlier epic literature we should find many other plays closely hugging their traditional sources.—The Trojans are camping out on the field of battle, close to the Greek lines. Hector, always ready for danger, seems to have his tent or log-hut set up quite in the van, just behind the outposts. In Il. X. 415 ff. he is holding counsel with the other chieftains <q type="written">away from the throng</q>; the allies are taking their sleep and trusting to the Trojans, who keep awake in groups round the camp fires; no watchword is mentioned.</note>

There is no great disturbance in the Greek camp in the Doloneia; there is a gathering of the principal chiefs, a visit to the Guards, and the despatch of the two spies, but no general tumult such as there is in Book II. One cannot help wondering whether our playwright found in his version of the Doloneia a description of fires in the Greek camp, such as our Eighth Book has of those in the Trojan camp. The object might be merely protection against a night attack, or it might be a wish to fly, as Hector thinks.

<l n="105">Brother, I would thy wit were like thy spear!<note resp="editor">P. 8, 1. 105, Brother!

On the stage every quality that is characteristic is apt to be over-emphasized, all that is not characteristic neglected.  Hence on the Attic stage Odysseus is more crafty, Ajax and Diomedes more blunt, Menelaus more unwarlike and more uxorious than in Homer.  This speech of Aeneas, though not inapposite, is rather didactic—a fault which always remained a danger to Euripides.</note></l>

<sp><speaker>DOLON</speaker><note resp="editor">P. 10, l. 150 ff., Dolon.]—The name is derived from <emph>dolos</emph>, <q type="gloss">craft.</q> In our version of Homer Dolon merely wears, over his tunic, the skin of a grey wolf. He has a leather cap and a bow.  In the play he goes, as Red Indian spies used to go, actually disguised as a wolf, on all fours in a complete wolf-skin. The same version is found on the <placeName key="tgn,7004333">Munich</placeName> cylix of the early vase-painter Euphronius (about 500 B.C.), in which Dolon wears a tight-fitting hairy skin with a long tail. The plan can of course only succeed in a country where wild animals are common enough to be thought unimportant. The playwright has evidently chosen a more primitive and romantic version of the story; the Homeric reviser has, as usual, cut out what might seem ridiculous. (See J. A. K. Thomson in Classical Review, xxv. pp. 238 f.).</note>

<sp><speaker>CHORUS.<note resp="editor">P. 15, 11. 225-263, Chorus.]—Apollo is appealed to as a God of Thymbra in the Troad, of Delos the Ionian island, and of Lycia in the South of Asia Minor; the god of Asiatics and barbaroi, the enemy of the Achaeans. This is also to a great extent the conception of Apollo in the Iliad, where he fights for Troy and is Hector’s special patron. The sudden ferocity towards Helen in the last strophe is quite in the manner of Euripides; cf. Trojan Women, 1107 ff. (p. 65), 766 ff. (p. 49), and often; also Iph. Taur.  438 ff. (p. 21), where her name comes somewhat as a surprise.  The stage directions here are of course conjectural: it does not seem likely that the playwright, having made Dolon describe his wolf’s disguise in detail, would waste the opportunity of making him crawl off in it.

<sp><speaker>HECTOR.
<note resp="editor"><p>P. 23, 11. 394-453, Speeches of Hector and Rhesus.] —The scene reads to me like a rather crude and early form of the celebrated psychological controversies of Euripides. It is simple, but spirited and in character. The description of Thracian fighting again suggests personal knowledge, and so does the boasting. The Thracians apparently bound themselves with heroic boasts before battle much as Irish and Highland chieftains sometimes did, or as the Franks did with their gabs. (See, e.g., Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne, as described in Gaston Paris, Litt. du Moyen Age, I. p. 122 ff.) It was a disgrace if you did not fulfil your gab afterwards.</p> 
<p>Rhesus’s defence is apparently true, though in a modern play one would have expected some explanation of the rather different story that his mother tells, l. 933 ff., p. 51. Perhaps he did not realise how she was holding him back. In any case ancient technique prefers to leave such details unsettled: cf., for instance, Helen’s speech in the Trojan Women, in which the false is evidently mixed up with the true, and they are never separated afterwards.</p></note>

Rhesus shows the simple courage of a barbarian in his contempt for the ruses of Odysseus, the brutality of a barbarian in the methods of punishment he proposes.  Such proposals would disgust a Greek; it looks as if they displeased Hector. In any case his abruptness here, and his careful indication of the place where the Thracians are to sleep, far from the rest of the camp, have some dramatic value for the sequel.</note> </l></sp></div></div>

<stage>Exeunt HECTOR and RHESUS and Attendants. The Guards, who have been below, come forward sleepily from the camp fire, and sit watching by HECTOR’S tent.</stage>

<div type="textpart" subtype="strophe">
<sp><speaker>CHORUS.<note resp="editor"><p>Pp. 28-30, 11. 527-564, Stars and Nightingale chorus.]—The beauty of these lines in the Greek is quite magical, but the stage management of the scene is difficult. Apparently Hector (1. 523) bids the Guards come forward from where they are and wait nearer the front for Dolon; obeying this they come up from the orchestra, we may suppose, to the stage. Then watching somewhere near Hector’s tent they partly express, in the usual song, the lyrical emotion of the night, partly they chat about Dolon and the order of the watches. The scene is technically very interesting with its rather abrupt introduction of realism into the high convention of tragedy. Meantime the Trojans’ time of watch is over and the Lycians, who ought to watch next, have not come. In a modern army it would of course be the duty of the new watch to come and relieve the old; in an ancient barbaric army—characteristically—the old watch had to go and wake the new. You could not, one must suppose, trust them to take their turn otherwise. At the end of the first strophe a Guard suggests that they should rouse the Lycians; at the end of the second the Leader definitely gives the word to do so. The Guards go, and so the stage (and orchestra) is left empty.</p>
<p>This is plain enough; but why were the Guards brought away from their original position—from the orchestra to the stage? Probably to allow the Greek spies to pass on towards the Thracian camp by a different and unoccupied way, not by the way which the Guards had just taken.</p>
<p>The story of the Nightingale is well known: she was Philomêla, or in the older story Procnê, an Athenian princess, wedded to the faithless Thracian king, Têreus.  In a fury of vengeance on her husband she slew their only son, Itys or Itylus, and now laments him broken-hearted for ever.</p> </note></speaker>

<stage>The Guards pass out to waken the Lycians. The stage is empty and dark except for the firelight, when a whisper is heard at the back. Presently enter ODYSSEUS and DIOMEDE in dull leather armour, DIOMEDE carrying at his belt DOLON’S wolf-skin and mask.</stage>

<sp><speaker>ODYSSEUS.</speaker>
<l n="565">Diomede, hist!—A little sound of arms<note resp="editor"><p>P. 31, 1. 567 ff., Odysseus and Diomedes.]—Observe how we are left gradually to discover that they have met and killed Dolon. They enter carrying, as far as we can make out, a wolf-skin that looks like his: they had evidently spoken to him, 11. 572, 575: it is his and they have killed him—l. 592 f.</p>
 <p>All the Odysseus-Diomedes scenes have something unusual about them, something daring, turbulent, and perhaps lacking in dramatic tact. The silent rush on Hector’s empty tent is hard to parallel. The cruel Athena is Euripidean; but her appearance in the midst of the action is startling, though it may be paralleled from Sophocles’ Ajax. In Euripides Gods are generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away from the ordinary action. (The vision of Iris and Lyssa in the middle of the Heracles has at least the stage clear of mortals and the Chorus apparently in a kind of dream.) Again the conception of Athena pretending to be Cypris is curious.  The disguised Athena is common in the Odyssey, but she does not disguise herself as another goddess. (It is sometimes held that this scene requires four actors, which would be a decisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so.  The actor who took Odysseus could easily get round in time to take Paris also—especially if he made his exit at 1. 626, before Athena sees Paris. And the Greek stage had no objection to such doubling.) Lastly, the scene of turmoil between the spies and the Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though it would suit well in a pro-satyric play.

If they bring it with them they must probably do something with it, and to hang it where it may give Hector a violent start seems the natural proceeding.

On a modern stage it could be worked as follows:—The Goddess will be behind a gauze, so that she is invisible when only the lights in front of the gauze are lit, but visible when a light goes up behind it. She will first appear with helmet and spear in some hard light; then disappear and be rediscovered in the same place in a softer light, the helmet and spear gone and some emblems of Cypris—say a flower and a dove—in their place.

<sp><speaker>THRACIAN.<note resp="editor">P. 44, ll. 756-803. This fine vivid speech has something  of the famous Euripidean Messenger-Speeches in it; though they are apt to be much longer and also are practically never spoken by a principal in the action, always by a subordinate or an onlooker. Cf. the speech of the Messenger-Shepherd above, p. 17 f. An extreme sharpness of articulation is characteristic of Euripides’ later work: each speech, each scene, each effect is isolated and made complete in itself. The Messenger prepares his message, relates his message and goes, not mixing himself up in the further fortunes of the drama. But this extreme pursuit of lucidity and clear outlines is not nearly so marked in the early plays: in the Cyclops the Messenger’s speech is actually spoken by Odysseus, 11. 382-436, and the Serving Man and Serving Maid in the Alcestis are not mere abstract Messengers.</note></speaker>

<l n="915">O conquered Thamyris, is this thy bane<note resp="editor"><p>P. 51, 1. 915. The speech of the Muse seems like the writing of a poet who is, for the moment, tired of mere drama, and wishes to get back into his own element.  Such passages are characteristic of Euripides.—The death of Rhesus seems to the Muse like an act of vengeance from the dead Thamyris, the Thracian bard who had blasphemied the Muses and challenged them to a contest of song. They conquered him and left him blind, but still a poet. The story in Homer is more terrible, though more civilised: <q type="written">They in wrath made him a maimed man, they took away his heavenly song and made him forget his harping.</q></p>
<p>Thamyris, the bard who defied Heaven; Orpheus, the bard, saint, lover, whose severed head still cried for his lost Eurydice; Musaeus, the bard of mystic wisdom and initiations—are the three great legendary figures of this Northern mountain minstrelsy.</p></note></l>
<l n="916">Returned from death to pierce my heart again?</l>
<l n="917">Thy pride it was, and bitter challenge cast</l>
<l n="918">’Gainst all the Muses, did my flesh abase</l>
<l n="919">To bearing of this Child, what time I passed</l>
<l n="920">Through the deep stream and looked on Strymon’s face,</l>
<l n="921">And felt his great arms clasp me, when to old</l>
<l n="922">Pangaion and the earth of hoarded gold</l>
<l n="923">We Sisters came with lutes and psalteries,</l>
<l n="924">Provoked to meet in bitter strife of song</l>
<l n="925">That mountain wizard, and made dark the eyes</l>
<l n="925a">Of Thamyris, who wrought sweet music wrong.</l>
<l n="926">I bore thee, Child; and then, in shame before</l>
<l n="927">My sisterhood, my dear virginity,</l>
<l n="927a">I stood again upon thy Father’s shore</l>
<l n="928">And cast thee to the deeps of him; and he</l>
<l n="929">Received and to no mortal nursing gave</l>
<l n="929a">His child, but to the Maidens of the Wave.</l>
<l n="930">And well they nursed thee, and a king thou wast</l>
<l n="931">And first of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> in war; yea, far and near</l>
<l n="932">Through thine own hills thy bloody chariot passed,</l>
<l n="933">Thy battered helm flashed, and I had no fear;</l>
<l n="934">Only to Troy I charged thee not to go:</l>
<l n="935">I knew the fated end: but Hector’s cry,</l>
<l n="936">Borne overseas by embassies of woe,</l>
<l n="937">Called thee to battle for thy friends and die.</l>
<l n="938">And thou, Athena—nothing was the deed</l>
<l n="939">Odysseus wrought this night nor Diomede—</l>
<l n="940">’Tis thine, all thine; dream not thy cruel hand</l>
<l n="941">Is hid from me! Yet ever on thy land</l>

<l n="950">Hector, thou hearest. We were guiltless here,<note resp="editor">P. 52, l. 950. These short speeches between Hector and the Leader of the Guard make a jarring note in the midst of the Muse’s lament. Perhaps it would not be so if we knew how the play was produced, but at present this seems like one of several marks of comparative crudity in technique which mark the play, amid all its daring and inventiveness.</note></l>

<l n="962">My son shall not be laid in any grave<note resp="editor"><p>P. 52, 1. 962 ff., My son shall not be laid in any grave.]—Like other Northern barbaric princes, such as Orpheus (1. 972 below) and Zalmoxis (Herodotus, iv.  95) and Holgar the <placeName key="tgn,1123294">Dane</placeName>, Rhesus lies in a hidden chamber beneath the earth, watching, apparently, for the day of uttermost need when he must rise to help his people. There is no other passage in Greek tragedy where such a fate is attributed to a hero, though the position of Darius in the <title>Persae</title> and Agamemnon in the <title>Choephori</title> or the <title>Electra</title> is in some ways analogous.</p>
 <p>The last lines of the Muse have a very Euripidean ring: cf. <title>Medea</title>, l. 1090 (p. 61, <q type="written">My thoughts have roamed a cloudy land</q>), <title>Alcestis</title>, 1. 882.</p></note></l>

<l n="983">The dead man sleepeth in his mother’s care;<note resp="editor">P. 54, 11. 983-end. This curious and moving end—not in death or peace but in a girding of tired men to greater toil—reminds one of the last words of <title>The Trojan Women</title>: <q type="written">Forth to the long Greek ships And the sea’s foaming,</q> and the last words of the Chanson de Roland there quoted.  The Trojans evidently go forth under the shadow of disaster, though with firmness and courage. The stage direction is of course purely conjectural. If Diomedes left some sign of Dolon’s death for Hector to see, as he probably must have done, then Hector must at some time or other see it. If so, this seems to be the place.  </note></l>
