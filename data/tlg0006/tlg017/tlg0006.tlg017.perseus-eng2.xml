<speaker>Dionysus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">I, the son of Zeus, have come to this land of the Thebans—Dionysus, whom once Semele, Kadmos’ daughter, bore, delivered by a lightning-bearing flame. And having taken a mortal form instead of a god’s, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">I am here at the fountains of Dirke and the water of Ismenus. And I see the tomb of my thunder-stricken mother here near the palace, and the remnants of her house, smouldering with the still living flame of Zeus’ fire, the everlasting insult of Hera against my mother. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">I praise Kadmos, who has made this place hallowed, the shrine of his daughter; and I have covered it all around with the cluster-bearing leaf of the vine.
I have left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians, the sun-parched plains of the Persians, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">and the Bactrian walls, and have passed over the wintry land of the Medes, and blessed <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, and all of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> which lies along the coast of the salt sea with its beautifully-towered cities full of Hellenes and barbarians mingled together; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20">and I have come to this Hellene city first, having already set those other lands to dance and established my mysteries there, so that I might be a deity manifest among men. In this land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, I have first excited <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to my cry, fitting a fawn-skin to my body and </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">taking a thyrsos in my hand, a weapon of ivy. For my mother’s sisters, the ones who least should, claimed that I, Dionysus, was not the child of Zeus, but that Semele had conceived a child from a mortal father and then ascribed the sin of her bed to Zeus, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">a trick of Kadmos’, for which they boasted that Zeus killed her, because she had told a false tale about her marriage. Therefore I have goaded them from the house in frenzy, and they dwell in the mountains, out of their wits; and I have compelled them to wear the outfit of my mysteries. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">And all the female offspring of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, as many as are women, I have driven maddened from the house, and they, mingled with the daughters of Kadmos, sit on roofless rocks beneath green pines. For this city must learn, even if it is unwilling, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">that it is not initiated into my Bacchic rites, and that I plead the case of my mother, Semele, in appearing manifest to mortals as a divinity whom she bore to Zeus.
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="43"/>
Now Kadmos has given his honor and power to Pentheus, his daughter’s son, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">who fights against the gods as far as I am concerned and drives me away from sacrifices, and in his prayers makes no mention of me, for which I will show him and all the Thebans that I was born a god. And when I have set matters here right, I will move on to another land, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">revealing myself. But if ever the city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> should in anger seek to drive the the Bacchae down from the mountains with arms, I, the general of the Maenads, will join battle with them. On which account I have changed my form to a mortal one and altered my shape into the nature of a man. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">But, you women who have left Tmolus, the bulwark of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, my sacred band, whom I have brought from among the barbarians as assistants and companions to me, take your drums, native instruments of the city of the Phrygians, the invention of mother Rhea and myself, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">and going about this palace of Pentheus beat them, so that Kadmos’ city may see. I myself will go to the folds of Kithairon, where the Bacchae are, to share in their dances.

<l resp="perseus" n="180">I have come prepared with this equipment of the god. For we must extol him, the child of my daughter, <del>Dionysus, who has appeared as a god to men</del> as much as is in our power. Where must I dance, where set my feet </l>

<sp>
<speaker>Pentheus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="215">I happened to be at a distance from this land, when I heard of strange evils throughout this city, that the women have left our homes in contrived Bacchic rites, and rush about in the shadowy mountains, honoring with dances </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="220">this new deity Dionysus, whoever he is. I hear that mixing-bowls stand full in the midst of their assemblies, and that they each creep off different ways into secrecy to serve the beds of men, on the pretext that they are Maenads worshipping; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="225">but they consider Aphrodite before Bacchus.
As many of them as I have caught, servants keep in the public strongholds with their hands bound, and as many as are absent I will hunt from the mountains, <del>I mean Ino and Agave, who bore me to Echion, and</del> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="230"><del>Autonoe, the mother of Actaeon.</del>  And having bound them in iron fetters, I will soon stop them from this ill-working revelry. And they say that some stranger has come, a sorcerer, a conjuror from the Lydian land, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="235">fragrant in hair with golden curls, having in his eyes the wine-dark graces of Aphrodite. He is with the young girls day and night, alluring them with joyful mysteries. If I catch him within this house, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="240">I will stop him from making a noise with the thyrsos and shaking his hair, by cutting his head off.
That one claims that Dionysus is a god, claims that he was once stitched into the thigh of Zeus—Dionysus, who was burnt up with his mother by the flame of lightning, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="245">because she had falsely claimed a marriage with Zeus. Is this not worthy of a terrible death by hanging, for a stranger to insult me with these insults, whoever he is?
But here is another wonder—I see Teiresias the soothsayer in dappled fawn-skins </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="250">and my mother’s father—a great absurdity—raging about with a thyrsos. I shrink, father, from seeing your old age devoid of sense. Won’t you cast away the ivy? Grandfather, will you not free your hand of the thyrsos? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="255">You persuaded him to this, Teiresias. Do you wish, by introducing another new god to men, to examine birds and receive rewards for sacrifices? If your gray old age did not defend you, you would sit in chains in the midst of the Bacchae, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="260">for introducing wicked rites. For where women have the delight of the grape-cluster at a feast, I say that none of their rites is healthy any longer.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="266"> Whenever a wise man takes a good occasion for his speech, it is not a great task to speak well. You have a rapid tongue as though you were sensible, but there is no sense in your words. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="270">A man powerful in his boldness, one capable of speaking well, becomes a bad citizen in his lack of sense. This new god, whom you ridicule, I am unable to express how great he will be throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. For two things, young man, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="275">are first among men: the goddess Demeter—she is the earth, but call her whatever name you wish; she nourishes mortals with dry food; but he who came afterwards, the offspring of Semele, discovered a match to it, the liquid drink of the grape, and introduced it </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="280">to mortals. It releases wretched mortals from grief, whenever they are filled with the stream of the vine, and gives them sleep, a means of forgetting their daily troubles, nor is there another cure for hardships. He who is a god is poured out in offerings to the gods, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="285">so that by his means men may have good things.
    And do you laugh at him, because he was sewn up in Zeus’ thigh? I will teach you that this is well: when Zeus snatched him out of the lighting-flame, and led the child as a god to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="290">Hera wished to banish him from the sky, but Zeus, as a god, had a counter-contrivance.

But in time, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="295">mortals say that he was nourished in the thigh of Zeus, changing the word, because a god he had served as a hostage for the goddess Hera, and composing the story. <note anchored="true" resp="unknown">The account given in lines 292f. of the development of this legend is based on the similarity between the Greek words for hostage (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμηρος</foreign>) and thigh (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μηρός</foreign>).</note>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="298"/>
But this god is a prophet—for Bacchic revelry and madness have in them much prophetic skill. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="300">For whenever the god enters a body in full force, he makes the frantic to foretell the future. He also possesses a share of Ares’ nature. For terror sometimes flutters an army under arms and in its ranks before it even touches a spear; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="305">and this too is a frenzy from Dionysus. You will see him also on the rocks of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, bounding with torches through the highland of two peaks, leaping and shaking the Bacchic branch, mighty throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. But believe me, Pentheus;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="310">do not boast that sovereignty has power among men, nor, even if you think so, and your mind is diseased, believe that you are being at all wise. Receive the god into your land, pour libations to him, celebrate the Bacchic rites, and garland your head.
Dionysus will not compel women </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="315">to be modest in regard to Aphrodite, but in nature <del>modesty dwells always</del> you must look for that. For she who is modest will not be corrupted in Bacchic revelry. Do you see? You rejoice whenever many people are at your gates, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="320">and the city extols the name of Pentheus. He too, I think, delights in being honored. Kadmos, whom you mock, and I will crown our heads with ivy and dance, a gray yoke-team but still we must dance; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="325">and I will not be persuaded by your words to fight against the god. For you are mad in a most grievous way, and you will not be cured by drugs, nor are you sick without them.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="335">so that Semele might seem to have borne a god, and honor might come to all our race. You see the wretched fate of Actaeon, who was torn apart in the meadows by the blood-thirsty hounds he had raised, </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="677">The herds of grazing cattle were just climbing up the hill, at the time when the sun sends forth its rays, warming the earth. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="680">I saw three companies of dancing women, one of which Autonoe led, the second your mother Agave, and the third Ino. All were asleep, their bodies relaxed, some resting their backs against pine foliage, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="685">others laying their heads at random on the oak leaves, modestly, not as you say drunk with the goblet and the sound of the flute, hunting out Aphrodite through the woods in solitude.
Your mother raised a cry, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="690">standing up in the midst of the Bacchae, to wake their bodies from sleep, when she heard the lowing of the horned cattle. And they, casting off refreshing sleep from their eyes, sprang upright, a marvel of orderliness to behold, old, young, and still unmarried virgins. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="695">First they let their hair loose over their shoulders, and secured their fawn-skins, as many of them as had released the fastenings of their knots, girding the dappled hides with serpents licking their jaws. And some, holding in their arms a gazelle or wild </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="700">wolf-pup, gave them white milk, as many as had abandoned their new-born infants and had their breasts still swollen. They put on garlands of ivy, and oak, and flowering yew. One took her thyrsos and struck it against a rock, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="705">from which a dewy stream of water sprang forth. Another let her thyrsos strike the ground, and there the god sent forth a fountain of wine. All who desired the white drink scratched the earth with the tips of their fingers and obtained streams of milk; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="710">and a sweet flow of honey dripped from their ivy thyrsoi; so that, had you been present and seen this, you would have approached with prayers the god whom you now blame.
We herdsmen and shepherds gathered in order to </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="715">debate with one another concerning what strange and amazing things they were doing. Some one, a wanderer about the city and practised in speaking, said to us all: <q type="spoken">You who inhabit the holy plains of the mountains, do you wish to hunt </q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="720"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Pentheus’ mother Agave out from the Bacchic revelry and do the king a favor?</q> We thought he spoke well, and lay down in ambush, hiding ourselves in the foliage of bushes. They, at the appointed hour, began to wave the thyrsos in their revelries, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="725">calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice. The whole mountain revelled along with them and the beasts, and nothing was unmoved by their running.
 <milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="728"/>
Agave happened to be leaping near me, and I sprang forth, wanting to snatch her, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="730">abandoning the ambush where I had hidden myself. But she cried out: <q type="spoken">O my fleet hounds, we are hunted by these men; but follow me! follow armed with your thyrsoi in your hands!</q>
We fled and escaped </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="735">from being torn apart by the Bacchae, but they, with unarmed hands, sprang on the heifers browsing the grass. and you might see one rending asunder a fatted lowing calf, while others tore apart cows. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="740">You might see ribs or cloven hooves tossed here and there; caught in the trees they dripped, dabbled in gore. Bulls who before were fierce, and showed their fury with their horns, stumbled to the ground, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="745">dragged down by countless young hands. The garment of flesh was torn apart faster then you could blink your royal eyes. And like birds raised in their course, they proceeded along the level plains, which by the streams of the Asopus </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="750">produce the bountiful Theban crop. And falling like soldiers upon Hysiae and Erythrae, towns situated below the rock of Kithairon, they turned everything upside down. They were snatching children from their homes; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="755">and whatever they put on their shoulders, whether bronze or iron, was not held on by bonds, nor did it fall to the ground. They carried fire on their locks, but it did not burn them. Some people in rage took up arms, being plundered by the Bacchae, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="760">and the sight of this was terrible to behold, lord. For their pointed spears drew no blood, but the women, hurling the thyrsoi from their hands, kept wounding them and turned them to flight—women did this to men, not without the help of some god. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="765">And they returned where they had come from, to the very fountains which the god had sent forth for them, and washed off the blood, and snakes cleaned the drops from the women’s cheeks with their tongues.
Receive this god then, whoever he is, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="770">into this city, master. For he is great in other respects, and they say this too of him, as I hear, that he gives to mortals the vine that puts an end to grief. Without wine there is no longer Aphrodite or any other pleasant thing for men.

<l resp="perseus" n="850">Let us punish him. First drive him out of his wits, send upon him a dizzying madness, since if he is of sound mind he will not consent to wear women’s clothing, but driven out of his senses he will put it on. I want him to be a source of laughter to the Thebans, led through the city in </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="855">women’s guise after making such terrible threats in the past. But now I will go to fit on Pentheus the dress he will wear to the house of Hades, slaughtered by his mother’s hands. He will recognize the son of Zeus, </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1043">When we left the dwellings of the Theban land and crossed the streams of Asopus, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1045">we began to ascend the heights of Kithairon, Pentheus and I—for I was following my master—and the stranger who was our guide to the sight. First we sat in a grassy vale, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1050">keeping our feet and voices quiet, so that we might see them without being seen. There was a little valley surounded by precipices, irrigated with streams, shaded by pine trees, where the Maenads were sitting, their hands busy with delightful labors. Some of them were crowning again </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1055">the worn thyrsos, making it leafy with ivy, while some, like colts freed from the painted yoke, were singing a Bacchic melody to one another. And the unhappy Pentheus said, not seeing the crowd of women: <q type="spoken">Stranger,</q> </l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="1060"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">from where we are standing I cannot see these false Maenads. But on the hill, ascending a lofty pine, I might view properly the shameful acts of the Maenads.</q>
 And then I saw the stranger perform a marvelous deed. For seizing hold of the lofty top-most branch of the pine tree, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1065">he pulled it down, pulled it, pulled it to the dark earth. It was bent just as a bow or a curved wheel, when it is marked out by a compass, describes a circular course <note anchored="true" resp="unknown">The sense of the text here is not clear. The translation (which follows Dodds) assumes that the <q type="mentioned">curved wheel</q> is not a hollow circle connected to the hub by spokes, but a single piece of wood which has been cut into the shape of a circle. In the action described, a peg (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τόρνος</foreign>) is fixed into the center of the word-section. A string with a piece of chalk on one end is then attached to the peg, and the chalk, held tight against the string, is able to mark out an even circle. The bending of the tree thus resembles the circular path taken by the chalk.</note>: in this way the stranger drew the mountain bough with his hands and bent it to the earth, doing no mortal’s deed. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1070">He sat Pentheus down on the pine branch, and let it go upright through his hands steadily, taking care not to shake him off. The pine stood firmly upright into the sky, with my master seated on its back. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1075">He was seen by the Maenads more than he saw them, for sitting on high he was all but apparent, and the stranger was no longer anywhere to be seen, when a voice, Dionysus as I guess, cried out from the air: <q type="spoken">Young women,</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1080"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">I bring the one who has made you and me and my rites a laughing-stock. Now punish him!</q> And as he said this a light of holy fire was placed between heaven and earth.
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1084"/>
The air became quiet and the woody glen </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1085">kept its leaves silent, nor would you have heard the sounds of animals. But they, not having heard the sound clearly, stood upright and looked all around. He repeated his order, and when the daughters of Kadmos recognized the clear command of Bacchus, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1090">they rushed forth, swift as a dove, running with eager speed of feet, his mother Agave, and her sisters, and all the Bacchae. They leapt through the torrent-streaming valley and mountain cliffs, frantic with the inspiration of the god. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1095">When they saw my master sitting in the pine, first they climbed a rock towering opposite the tree and began to hurl at him boulders violently thrown. Some aimed with pine branches and other women hurled their thyrsoi through the air </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1100">at Pentheus, a sad target indeed. But they did not reach him, for the wretched man, caught with no way out, sat at a height too great for their eagerness. Finally like lightning they smashed oak branches and began to tear up the roots of the tree with ironless levers. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1105">When they did not succeed in their toils, Agave said: <q type="spoken">Come, standing round in a circle, each seize a branch, Maenads, so that we may catch the beast who has climbed aloft, and so that he does not make public the secret dances of the god.</q> They applied countless hands </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1110">to the pine and dragged it up from the earth. Pentheus fell crashing to the ground from his lofty seat, wailing greatly: for he knew he was in terrible trouble.
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1114"/>
His mother, as priestess, began the slaughter, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1115">and fell upon him. He threw the headband from his head so that the wretched Agave might recognize and not kill him. Touching her cheek, he said: <q type="spoken">It is I, mother, your son, Pentheus, whom you bore in the house of Echion.</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1120"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Pity me, mother, and do not kill me, your child, for my sins.</q>
But she, foaming at the mouth and twisting her eyes all about, not thinking as she ought, was possessed by Bacchus, and he did not persuade her. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1125">Seizing his left arm at the elbow and propping her foot against the unfortunate man’s side, she tore out his shoulder, not by her own strength, but the god gave facility to her hands. Ino began to work on the other side, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1130">tearing his flesh, while Autonoe and the whole crowd of the Bacchae pressed on. All were making noise together, he groaning as much as he had life left in him, while they shouted in victory. One of them bore his arm, another a foot, boot and all. His ribs were stripped bare </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1135">from their tearings. The whole band, hands bloodied, were playing a game of catch with Pentheus’ flesh.
His body lies in different places, part under the rugged rocks, part in the deep foliage of the woods, not easy to be sought. His miserable head, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1140">which his mother happened to take in her hands, she fixed on the end of a thyrsos and carries through the midst of Kithairon like that of a savage lion, leaving her sisters among the Maenads’ dances. She is coming inside these walls, preening herself </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1145">on the ill-fated prey, calling Bacchus her fellow hunter, her accomplice in the chase, the glorious victor—in whose service she wins a triumph of tears.
And as for me, I will depart out of the way of this calamity before Agave reaches the house. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1150">Soundness of mind and reverence for the affairs of the gods is best; and this, I think, is the wisest possession for those mortals who adopt it.
