            <stage>Scene.—Before the Palace of Creon at Corinth.</stage>
     <sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
      <l n="1" rend="indent">Ah! would to Heaven the good ship Argo ne’er had sped its course to the Colchian land through the misty blue Symplegades, nor ever in the glens of Pelion the pine been felled to furnish with oars the chieftain’s hands, </l> 
      <l resp="perseus" n="5">who went to fetch the golden fleece for Pelias; for then would my own mistress Medea never have sailed to the turrets of Iolcos, her soul with love for Jason smitten, nor would she have beguiled the daughters of Pelias </l> 
       <l resp="perseus" n="10">to slay their father and come to live here in the land of Corinth with her husband and children, where her exile found favour with the citizens to whose land she had come, and in all things of her own accord was she at one with Jason, the greatest safeguard this </l>
        <l resp="perseus" n="15">when wife and husband do agree; but now their love is all turned to hate, and tenderest ties are weak. For Jason hath betrayed his own children and my mistress dear for the love of a royal bride, for he hath wedded the daughter of Creon, lord of this land.</l> 
        <l resp="perseus" n="20">While Medea his hapless wife, thus scorned, appeals to the oaths he swore, recalls the strong pledge his right hand gave, and bids heaven be witness what requital she is finding from Jason. And here she lies fasting, yielding her body to her grief, </l>
        <l resp="perseus" n="25">wasting away in tears ever since she learnt that she was wronged by her husband, never lifting her eye nor raising her face from off the ground; and she lends as deaf an ear to her friend’s warning as if she were a rock or ocean billow, save when she turns her snow-white neck aside </l>
        <l resp="perseus" n="30">and softly to herself bemoans her father dear, her country and her home, which <pb xml:id="p.34"/> she gave up to come hither with the man who now holds her in dishonour. She, poor lady, hath by sad experience learnt how good a thing it is </l>
        <l resp="perseus" n="35">never to quit one’s native land. And she hates her children now and feels no joy at seeing them; I am afeard she may contrive some untoward scheme; for her mood is dangerous nor will she brook her cruel treatment; full well I know her, and I much do dread </l> 
        <l resp="perseus" n="40">that she will plunge the keen sword through their heart, stealing without a word into the chamber where their marriage couch is spread, or else that she will slay the prince and bridegroom too, and so find some calamity still more grievous than the present; for dreadful is her wrath; </l>
        <l resp="perseus" n="45">verily the man that doth incur her hate will have no easy task to raise o’er her a song of triumph. Lo! where her sons come hither from their childish sports; little they reck of their mother’s woes, for the soul of the young is no inend to sorrow.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="49" rend="indent">Why dost thou, so long my lady’s own handmaid, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">stand here at the gate alone, loudly lamenting to thyself the piteous tale? how comes it that Medea will have thee leave her to herself?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="53" rend="indent">Old man, attendant on the sons of Jason, our masters’ fortunes when they go awry make good slaves grieve</l> 
<l resp="perseus" n="55">and touch their hearts. Oh! I have come to such a pitch of grief that there stole a yearning wish upon me to come forth hither and proclaim to heaven and earth my mistress’s hard fate.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="59" rend="indent">What! has not the poor lady ceased yet from her lamentation?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="60" rend="indent">Would I were as thou art! the mischief is but now beginning; it has not reached its climax yet.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="61" rend="indent">O foolish one, if I may call my mistress such a name; how little she recks of evils yet more recent!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="63" rend="indent">What mean’st, old man? grudge not to tell me.

<pb xml:id="p.35"/></l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="64" rend="indent">’Tis naught; I do repent me even of the words I have spoken.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="65" rend="indent">Nay, by thy beard I conjure thee, hide it not from thy fellow-slave; I will be silent, if need be, on that text.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="67" rend="indent">I heard one say, pretending not to listen as I approached the place where our greybeards sit playing draughts<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">πεσσοὺς</foreign> literally the game itself; here; explained by the Scholiast as the place where it was habitually played.</note> near Pirene’s sacred spring, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">that Creon, the ruler of this land, is bent on driving these children and their mother from the boundaries of Corinth; but I know not whether the news is to be relied upon, and would fain it were not.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="74" rend="indent">What! will Jason brook such treatment of his sons, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">even though he be at variance with their mother?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="76" rend="indent">Old ties give way to new; he bears no longer any love to this family.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="78" rend="indent">Undone, it seems, are we, if to old woes fresh ones we add, ere we have drained the former to the dregs.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="80" rend="indent">Hold thou thy peace, say not a word of this; ’tis no time for our mistress to learn hereof.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="82" rend="indent">O children, do ye hear how your father feels towards you? Perdition catch him, but no! he is my master still; yet is he proved a veiy traitor to his nearest and dearest.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<l n="85" rend="indent">And who ’mongst men is not? Art learning only now, that every single man cares for himself more than for his neighbour, some from honest, motives, others for mere gain’s sake? seeing that to indulge his passion their father has ceased to love these children.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="89" rend="indent">Go, children, within the house; all will be well. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">Do thou keep them as far away as may be, and bring them not near their mother in her evil hour. For ere this have I seen her eyeing them savagely, as though she were minded <pb xml:id="p.36"/> to do them some hurt, and well I know she will not cease from her fury till she have pounced on some victim. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">At least may she turn her hand against her foes, and not against her friends.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="96" rend="indent"><stage>(within).</stage> Ah, me! a wretched suffering woman I! O would that I could die!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="98" rend="indent">’Tis as I said, my dear children; wild fancies stir your mother’s heart, wild fury goads her on.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" n="100">Into the house without delay, come not near her eye, approach her not, beware her savage mood, the fell tempest of her reckless heart.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" n="105">In, in with what speed ye may. For ’tis plain she will soon redouble her fury; that cry is but the herald of the gathering storm-cloud whose lightning soon will flash; what will her proud restless </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="110">soul, in the anguish of despair, be guilty of?	<stage>[Exit Attendant with the children.</stage></l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="111" rend="indent"><stage>(within).</stage> Ah, me! the agony I have suffered, deep enough to call for these laments! Curse you and your father too, ye children damned, sons of a doomed mother! Ruin seize the whole family!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="115" rend="indent">Ah me! ah me! the pity of it! Why, pray, do thy children share their father’s crime? Why hatest thou them? Woe is you, poor children, how do I grieve for you lest ye suffer some outrage! Strange are the tempers of princes, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">and maybe because they seldom have to obey, and mostly lord it over others, change they their moods with difficulty. ’Tis better then to have been trained to live on equal terms. Be it mine to reach old age, not in proud pomp, but in security! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="125">Moderation wins the day first as a better word for men to use, and likewise it is far the best course for them to pursue; but greatness that doth o’erreach itself, brings no blessing to mortal men; but pays a penalty of greater ruin whenever </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="130">fortune is wroth with a family.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="131" rend="indent">I heard the voice, uplifted loud, of our poor Colchian lady, nor yet is she quiet; speak, aged dame, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="135">for as I stood by the house with double gates I heard a voice of <pb xml:id="p.37"/> weeping from within, and I do grieve, lady, for the sorrows of this house, for it hath won my love.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="139" rend="indent">’Tis a house no more; all that is passed away long since; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="140">a royal bride keeps Jason at her side, while our mistress pines away in her bower, finding no comfort for her soul in aught her friends can say.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="143b" part="Y" rend="indent"><stage>(within).</stage> Oh, oh! Would that Heaven’s levin bolt would cleave this head in twain! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="145">What gain is life to me? Woe, woe is me! O, to die and win release, quitting this loathed existence!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="148" rend="indent">Didst hear, O Zeus, thou earth, and thou, O light, the piteous note of woe </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="150">the hapless wife is uttering? How shall a yearning for that insatiate<note resp="editor">So MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπλήστου</foreign>. Elmsley, whom many editors have followed, proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπλάτου</foreign> = <q type="gloss">terrible.</q></note> resting-place ever hasten for thee, poor reckless one, the end that death alone can bring? Never pray for that. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="155">And if thy lord prefers a fresh love, be not angered with him for that; Zeus will judge ’twixt thee and him herein. Then mourn not for thy husband’s loss too much, nor waste thyself away.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="160" rend="indent"><stage>(within).</stage> Great Themis, and husband<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πότνι’ Ἄρτεμι</foreign>, corrupt and pointless. The reading here adopted by the translator is <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πόσις, ἄρτι με</foreign>, suggested by Munro (Journal of Philology, No. 22, p. 275) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόσις</foreign> = Zeus.</note> of Themis, behold what I am suffering now, though I did bind that accursed one, my husband, by strong oaths to me? O, to see him and his bride some day brought to utter destruction, they and their house with them, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="165">for that they presume to wrong me thus unprovoked. O my father, my country, that I have left to my shame, after slaying my own brother.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="168" rend="indent">Do ye hear her words, how loudly she adjures Themis, oft invoked, and Zeus, whom </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="170">men regard as keeper of their oaths? On no mere trifle surely will our mistress spend her rage.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="173" rend="indent">Would that she would come forth for us to see, and <pb xml:id="p.38"/></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="175">listen to the words of counsel we might give, if haply she might lay aside the fierce fury of her wrath, and her temper stern. Never be my zeal at any rate denied my friends! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="180">But go thou and bring her hither outside the house, and tell her this our friendly thought; haste thee ere she do some mischief to those inside the house, for this sorrow of hers is mounting high.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<l n="184" rend="indent">This will I do; but I have my doubts whether I shall persuade </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="185">my mistress; still willingly will I undertake this trouble for you; albeit, she glares upon her servants with the look of a lioness with cubs, whenso anyone draws nigh to speak to her. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="190">Wert thou to call the men of old time rude uncultured boors thou wouldst not err, seeing that they devised their hymns for festive occasions, for banquets, and to grace the board, a pleasure to catch the ear, shed o’er our life, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="195">but no man hath found a way to allay hated grief by music and the minstrel’s varied strain, whence arise slaughters and fell strokes of fate to o’erthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely a gain, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="200">to heal men’s wounds by music’s spell, but why tune they their idle song where rich banquets are spread? for of itself doth the rich banquet, set before them, afford to men delight.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="204" rend="indent">I heard a bitter cry of lamentation! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="205">loudly, bitterly she calls on the traitor of her marriage bed, her perfidious spouse; by grievous wrongs oppressed she invokes Themis, bride of Zeus, witness of oaths, who brought her </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="210">unto Hellas, the land that fronts the strand of Asia, o’er the sea by night through ocean’s boundless gate.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="214" rend="indent">From the house I have come forth, Corinthian ladies, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="215">for fear lest you be blaming me;<note resp="editor">To extract any satisfactory meaning from this passage, as it stands in our editions, seems an almost impossible task, to judge from the attempts at present made. I have not ventured to alter Paley’s text, or proposed interpretation, unsatisfactory as it seems to me. Verrall’s emendations, though bold in the extreme, do at least make the Greek intelligible, and to his ingenious note I would refer the curious.</note> for well I know that amongst men many by showing pride have gotten them <pb xml:id="p.39"/> an ill name and a reputation for indifference, both those who shun men’s gaze and those who move amid the stranger crowd, and likewise they who choose a quiet walk in life. For there is no just discernment in the eyes of men, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="220">for they, or ever they have surely learnt their neighbour’s heart, loathe him at first sight, though never wronged by him; and so a stranger most of all should adopt a city’s views; nor do I commend that citizen, who, in the stubbornness of his heart, from churlishness resents the city’s will.</l>

<l n="225" rend="indent">But on me hath fallen this unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; ruined I am, and long to resign the boon of existence, kind friends, and die. For he who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned out the veriest villain, my own husband. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="230">Of all things that have life and sense we women are the most hapless creatures; first must we buy a husband at an exorbitant price, and o’er ourselves a tyrant set which is an evil worse than the first; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="235">and herein lies the most important issue, whether our choice be good or bad. For divorce is discreditable to women, nor can we disown our lords. Next must the wife, coming as she does to ways and customs new, since she hath not learnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner’s eye to see </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="240">how best to treat the partner of her life. If haply we perform these tasks with thoroughness and tact, and the husband live with us, without resenting the yoke, our life is a happy one; if not, ’twere best to die. But when a man is vexed with what he finds indoors, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="245">he goeth forth and rids his soul of its disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of like age; whilst we must needs regard his single self.</l>

<l n="249" rend="indent">And yet they say we live secure at home, while they are at the wars, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="250">with their sorry reasoning, for I would gladly take my stand in battle array three times o’er, than once give <pb xml:id="p.40"/> birth. But enough! this language suits not thee as it does me; thou hast a city here, a father’s house, some joy in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, </l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="255">but I am destitute, without a city, and therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a foreign shore, with no mother, brother, or kinsman in whom to find a new haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and only this I wish to win from thee,—</l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="260">thy silence, if haply I can some way or means devise to avenge me on my husband for this cruel treatment, and on the man who gave to him his daughter, and on her who is his wife. For though a woman be timorous enough in all else, and as regards courage, a coward at the mere sight of steel, </l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="265">yet in the moment she finds her honour wronged, no heart is filled with deadlier thoughts than hers.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
   <l n="267" rend="indent">This will I do; for thou wilt be taking a just vengeance on thy husband, Medea. That thou shouldst mourn thy lot surprises me not. But lo! I see Creon, king of this land coming hither, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="270">to announce some new resolve.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
   <l n="271" rend="indent">Hark thee, Medea, I bid thee take those sullen looks and angry thoughts against thy husband forth from this land in exile, and with thee take both thy children and that without delay, for I am judge in this sentence, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="275">and I will not return unto my house till I banish thee beyond the borders of the land.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
   <l n="277" rend="indent">Ah, me! now is utter destruction come upon me, unhappy that I am! For my enemies are bearing down on me full sail, nor have I any landing-place to come at in my trouble. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="280">Yet for all my wretched plight I will ask thee, Creon, wherefore dost thou drive me from the land?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
   <l n="282" rend="indent">I fear thee,—no longer need I veil my dread ’neath words,—lest thou devise against my child some cureless ill. Many things contribute to this fear of mine; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="285">thou art a witch by nature, expert in countless sorceries, and thou art <pb xml:id="p.41"/> chafing for the loss of thy husband’s affection. I hear, too, so they tell me, that thou dost threaten the father of the bride, her husband, and herself with some mischief; wherefore I will take precautions ere our troubles come. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="290">For ’tis better for me to incur thy hatred now, lady, than to soften my heart and bitterly repent it hereafter.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
   <l n="292" rend="indent">Alas! this is not now the first time, but oft before, O Creon, hath my reputation injured me and caused sore mischief. Wherefore whoso is wise in his generation ought </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="295">never to have his children taught to be too clever; for besides the reputation they get for idleness, they purchase bitter odium from the citizens. For if thou shouldst import new learning amongst dullards, thou will be thought a useless trifler, void of knowledge; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="300">while if thy fame in the city o’ertops that of the pretenders to cunning knowledge, thou wilt win their dislike. I too myself share in this ill-luck. Some think me clever and hate me, <del>others say I am too reserved, and some the very reverse</del>;<note resp="editor">This line is inclosed by most editors in brackets as an interpolation from 808 below, where it is in place.</note> </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="305">others find me hard to please and not so very clever after all. Be that as it may, thou dost fear me lest I bring on thee something to mar thy harmony. Fear me not, Creon, ray position scarce is such that I should seek to quarrel with princes. Why should I, for how hast thou injured me? Thou hast betrothed thy daughter </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="310">where thy fancy prompted thee. No, ’tis my husband I hate, though I doubt not thou hast acted wisely herein. And now I grudge not thy prosperity; betroth thy child, good luck to thee, but let me abide in this land, for though I have been wronged </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="315">I will be still and yield to my superiors.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
   <l n="316" rend="indent">Thy words are soft to hear, but much I dread lest thou art devising some mischief in thy heart, and less than ever do I trust thee now; for a cunning woman, and man likewise, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="320">is easier to guard against when quick-tempered <pb xml:id="p.42"/> than when taciturn. Nay, begone at once! speak me no speeches, for this is decreed, nor hast thou any art whereby thou shalt abide amongst us, since thou hatest me.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="324" rend="indent">O, say not so! by thy knees and by thy daughter newly-wed, I do implore!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
<l n="325" rend="indent">Thou wastest words; thou wilt never persuade me.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="326" rend="indent">What, wilt thou banish me, and to my prayers no pity yield?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
<l n="327" rend="indent">I will, for I love not thee above my own family.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="328" rend="indent">O my country! what fond memories I have of thee in this hour!</l></sp>

   <l resp="perseus" n="395">By that dread queen whom I revere before all others and have chosen to share my task, by Hecate who dwells within my inmost chamber, not one of them shall wound my heart and rue it not. Bitter and sad will I make their marriage for them; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="400">bitter shall be the wooing of it, bitter my exile from the land. Up, then, Medea, spare not the secrets of thy art in plotting and devising; on to the danger.

   <l resp="perseus" n="420">no more shall the foul tongue of slander fix upon us. The songs of the poets of old shall cease to make our faithlessness their theme. Phoebus, lord of minstrelsy, hath not implanted in our mind </l>

<sp><speaker>Jason</speaker>
   <l n="446" rend="indent">It is not now I first remark, but oft ere this, how unruly a pest is a harsh temper. For instance, thou, hadst thou but patiently endured the will of thy superiors, mightest have remained here in this land and house, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="450">but now for thy idle words wilt thou be banished. Thy words are naught to roe. Cease not to call Jason basest of men; but for those words thou hast spoken against our rulers, count it all gain that exile is thy only punishment. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="455">I ever tried to check the outbursts of the angry monarch, and would have had thee stay, but thou wouldst not forego thy silly rage, always reviling our rulers, and so thou wilt be banished. Yet even after all this I weary not of my goodwill, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="460">but am come with thus much forethought, lady, that thou mayst not be destitute nor want for aught, when, with thy sons, thou art cast out. Many an evil doth exile bring in its train with it; for even though thou hatest me, never will I harbour hard thoughts of thee.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
   <l n="465" rend="indent">Thou craven villain (for that is the only name my tongue can find for thee, a foul reproach on thy unmanliness)! comest thou to me, thou, most hated foe of gods, of me, and of all mankind? Tis no proof of courage or hardihood </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="470">to confront thy friends after injuring them, but that worst of all human diseases—loss of shame. Yet hast thou done well to come; for I shall ease ray soul by reviling thee, and thou wilt be vexed at my recital. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="475">I will begin at the very beginning. I saved thy life, as every Hellene knows who sailed with thee aboard the good ship Argo, when thou wert sent to tame and yoke fire-breathing bulls, and to sow the deadly tilth. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="480">Yea, and I slew the dragon which guarded the golden fleece, keeping sleepless watch o’er it with many <pb xml:id="p.46"/> a wreathed coil, and I raised for thee a beacon of deliver arice. Father and home of my free will I left and came with thee to Iolcos, ’neath Pelion’s hills, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="485">for my love was stronger than my prudence. Next I caused the death of Pelias by a doom most grievous, even by his own children’s hand, beguiling them of all their fear. All this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast me over, taking to thyself another wife, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="490">though children have been bom to us. Hadst thou been childless still, I could have pardoned thy desire for this new union. Gone is now the trust I put in oaths. I cannot even understand whether thou thinkest that the gods of old no longer rule, or that fresh decrees are now in vogue amongst mankind, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="495">for thy conscience must tell thee thou hast not kept faith with me. Ah! poor right hand, which thou didst often grasp. These knees thou didst embrace! All in vain, I suffered a traitor to touch me! How short of my hopes I am fallen! But come, I will deal with thee as though thou wert my friend. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="500">Yet what kindness can I expect from one so base as thee? but yet I will do it, for my questioning will show thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father’s house, to my own country, which I for thee deserted to come hither? to the hapless daughters of Pelias? A glad </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="505">welcome, I trow, would they give me in their home, whose father’s death I compassed! My case stands even thus: I am become the bitter foe to those of mine own home, and those whom I need ne’er have wronged I have made mine enemies to pleasure thee. Wherefore to reward me for this thou hast made me doubly blest in the eyes of many a wife in Hellas; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="510">and in thee I own a peerless, trusty lord. O woe is me, if indeed I am to be cast forth an exile from the land, without one friend; one lone woman with her babes forlorn! Yea, a fine reproach to thee in thy bridal hour, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="515">that thy children and the wife who saved thy life are beggars and vagabonds! O Zeus! why hast thou granted unto man clear signs to know the sham in <pb xml:id="p.47"/> gold, white on man’s brow no brand is stamped whereby to gauge the villain’s heart?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="520" rend="indent">There is a something terrible and past all cure, when quarrels arise ’twixt those who are near and dear.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jason</speaker>
<l n="522" rend="indent">Needs must I now, it seems, turn orator, and, like a good helmsman on a ship with close-reefed sails, weather </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="525">that wearisome tongue of thine. Now, I believe, since thou wilt exaggerate thy favours, that to Cypris alone of gods or men I owe the safety of my voyage. Thou hast a subtle wit enough; yet were it a hateful thing for me </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="530">to say that the Love-god constrained thee by his resistless shaft to save my life. However, I will not reckon this too nicely; ’twas kindly done, however thou didst serve me. Yet for my safety </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="535">hast thou received more than ever thou gavest, as I will show. First, thou dwellest in Hellas, instead of thy barbarian land, and hast learnt what justice means find how to live by law, not by the dictates of brute force; and all the Hellenes recognize thy cleverness, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="540">and thou hast gained a name; whereas, if thou hadst dwelt upon the confines of the earth, no tongue had mentioned thee. Give me no gold within my halls; nor skill to sing a fairer strain than ever Orpheus sang, unless therewith my fame be spread abroad! </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="545">So much I say to thee about my own toils, for ’twas thou didst challenge me to this retort. As for the taunts thou urgest against my marriage with the princess, I will prove to thee, first, that I am prudent herein, next chastened in my love, and last a powerful friend </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="550">to thee and to thy sons; only hold thy peace. Since I have here withdrawn from Iolcos with many a hopeless trouble at my back, what happier device could I, an exile, frame than marriage with the daughter of the king? </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="555">’Tis not because I loathe thee for my wife—the thought that rankles in thy heart; ’tis not because I am smitten with desire fot a new bride, nor yet that I am eager to vie with others in begetting many children, for those we have are quite enough, and I do not complain. Nay, ’tis <pb xml:id="p.48"/> that we—and this is most important—</l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="560">may dwell in comfort, instead of suffering want (for well I know that every whilom friend avoids the poor), and that I might rear my sons as doth befit my house; further, that I might be the father of brothers for the children thou hast born, and raise these to the same high rank, uniting the family in one,—</l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="565">to my lasting bliss. Thou, indeed, hast no need of more children, but me it profits to help my present family by that which is to be. Have I miscarried here? Not even thou wouldest say so unless a rival’s charms rankled in thy bosom. No, but you women have such strange ideas, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="570">that you think all is well so long as your married life runs smooth; but if some mischance occur to ruffle your love, all that was good and lovely erst you reckon as your foes. Yea, men should have begotten children from some other source, no female race existing; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="575">thus would no evil ever have fallen on mankind.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l n="576" rend="indent">This speech, O Jason, hast thou with specious art arranged; but yet I think—albeit in saying so I betray indiscretion—that thou hast sinned in casting over thy wife.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
   <l n="579" rend="indent">No doubt I differ from the mass of men on many points; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="580">for, to my mind, whoso hath skill to fence with words in an unjust cause, incurs the heaviest penalty; for such an one, confident that he can cast a decent veil of words o’er his injustice, dares to practise it; and yet he is not so very clever after all. So do not thou put forth thy specious pleas </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="585">and clever words to me now, for one word of mine will lay thee low. Hadst thou not had a villain’s heart, thou shouldst have gained my consent, then made this match, instead of hiding it from those who loved thee.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jason</speaker>
   <l n="588" rend="indent">Thou wouldest have lent me ready aid, no doubt, in this proposal, if I had told thee of my marriage, seeing that not even now </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="590">canst thou restrain thy soul’s hot fury.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>
<l n="591" rend="indent">This was not what restrained thee; but thine eye was turned towards old age, and a foreign wife began to appear discreditable to thee.

   <l n="593" rend="indent">Be well assured of this: ’twas not for the woman’s sake I wedded the king’s daughter, my present wife; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="595">but, as I have already told thee, I wished to insure thy safety and to be the father of royal sons bound by blood to my own children—a bulwark to our house.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>

   <l resp="perseus" n="610">But, if thou wilt of my fortune somewhat take for the children or thyself to help thy exile, say on; for I am ready to grant it with ungrudging hand, yea and to send tokens to my friends elsewhere who shall treat thee well.

<sp><speaker>Medea</speaker>

   <l n="1136" rend="indent">When the children twain whom thou didst bear <pb xml:id="p.64"/> came with their father and entered the palace of the bride, right glad were we thralls who had shared thy griefs, for instantly from ear to ear a rumour spread </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1140">that thou and thy lord had made up your former quarrel. One kissed thy children’s hands, another their golden hair, while I for very joy went with them in person to the women’s chambers. Our mistress, whom now we do revere in thy room, </l>

   <l resp="perseus" n="1155"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">to remit these children’s exile.</q> Soon as she saw the ornaments, no longer she held out, but yielded to her lord in all; and ere the father and his sons were far from the palace gone, she took the broidered robe and put it on, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1160">and set the golden crown about her tresses, arranging her hair at her bright mirror, with many a happy smile at her breathless counterfeit. Then rising from her seat she passed across the chamber, tripping lightly on her fair white foot, </l>

   <l resp="perseus" n="1170">and sinks upon a seat scarce soon enough to save herself from falling to the ground. An aged dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from Pan<note resp="editor">Any sudden seizure was ascribed to Pan’s agency.</note> or some god sent, raised a cry of prayer, till from her mouth she saw the foam-flakes issue, her eyeballs </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1175">rolling in their sockets, and all the blood her <pb xml:id="p.65"/> face desert; then did she raise a loud scream far different fiom her former cry. Forthwith one handmaid rushed to her father’s house, another to her new bridegroom to tell his bride’s sad fate, </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1180">and the whole house echoed with their running to and fro.

   <l resp="perseus" n="1185">for against her a twofold anguish was warring. The chaplet of gold about her head was sending forth a wondrous stream of ravening flame, while the fine raiment, thy children’s gift, was preying on the hapless maiden’s fair white flesh; </l>

   <l resp="perseus" n="1195">Then to the earth she sinks, by the cruel blow o’ercome, past all recognition now save to a father’s eye; for her eyes had lost their tranquil gaze, her face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown of her head blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1200">and from her bones the flesh kept peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e’en as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome sight to see.

   <l resp="perseus" n="1205">unto the house, all unwitting of her doom, and stumbles o’er the dead, and loud he cried, and folding his arms about her kissed her, with words like these the while, <q type="spoken">O my poor, <pb xml:id="p.66"/> poor child, which of the gods hath destroyed thee thus foully? Who is robbing me of thee, old as I am and </q></l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1210"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">ripe for death? O my child, alas! would I could die with thee!</q> He ceased his sad lament, and would have raised his aged frame, but found himself held fast by the finespun robe as ivy that clings to the branches of the bay, and then ensued a fearful struggle. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1215">He strove to rise, but she still held him back; and if ever he pulled with all his might, from off his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, and breathed forth his soul in awful suffering; for he could no longer master the pain. </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1220">So there they lie, daughter and aged sire, dead side by side, a grievous sight that calls for tears. And as for thee, I leave thee out of my consideration, for thyself must discover a means to escape punishment. Not now for the first time I think this human life a shadow; </l>
   <l resp="perseus" n="1225">yea, and without shrinking I will say that they amongst men who pretend to wisdom and expend deep thought on words do incur a serious charge of folly; for amongst mortals no man is happy; wealth may pour in and make </l>
