<l resp="perseus" n="1">From the depths of salt <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> floods I, Poseidon, have come, where choirs of Nereids dance in a graceful maze; for since the day that Phoebus and I with exact measurement </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">set towers of stone about this land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and ringed it round, never from my heart has passed away a kindly feeling for my Phrygian town, which now is smouldering and overthrown, a prey to <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> might. For, from his home beneath <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed army, and sent it within the battlements, a deadly statue;<del>from which in days to come men shall tell of the Wooden Horse, with its hidden load of warriors.</del> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">Groves stand forsaken and temples of the gods run down with blood, and at the altar’s very base, before the god who watched his home, Priam lies dead. While to Achaean ships great store of gold and Phrygian spoils are being conveyed, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20">and they who came against this town, those sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, only wait a favoring breeze to follow in their wake, that after ten long years they may with joy behold their wives and children. Vanquished by Hera, <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> goddess, and by Athena, who helped to ruin <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">I am leaving <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, that famous town, and my altars; for when dreary desolation seizes on a town, the worship of the gods decays and tends to lose respect. Scamander’s banks re-echo long and loud the screams of captive maids, as they by lot receive their masters. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30"><placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> takes some, and some the people of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>; others are assigned to Theseus’ sons, the Athenian chiefs. And such of the Trojan women as are not portioned out are in these tents, set apart for the leaders of the army; and with them Spartan Helen, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">daughter of Tyndareus, justly counted among the captives. And if you would see that queen of misery, Hecuba, you can; for there she lies before the gates, weeping many tears for many sorrows; at Achilles’ tomb, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">without her knowledge, her daughter Polyxena has died most piteously; Priam is gone, and her children too; Cassandra, whom the lord Apollo left to be a virgin, frenzied maid, has been forced by Agamemnon, in contempt of the god’s ordinance and of piety, to a dishonored wedlock. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">Farewell, O city once prosperous! farewell, you ramparts of polished stone! if Pallas, daughter of Zeus, had not decreed your ruin, you would be standing firmly still.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="48">May I address the mighty god whom the gods revere and who to my own father is very near in blood, </l>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="51">You may; for over the soul the ties of kin exert no feeble spell, great queen Athena.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="53">For your forgiving mood my thanks! I have messages to impart affecting both yourself and me, lord.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">Do you bring fresh tidings from some god, from Zeus, or from some lesser power?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="57">From none of these; but on behalf of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, whose soil we tread, I have come to seek your mighty aid, to make it one with mine.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="59">What! have you laid your former hate aside </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">to take compassion on the town now that it is burnt to ashes?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="61">First go back to the former point; will you make common cause with me in the scheme I purpose?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="63">Yes, surely; but I want to learn your wishes, whether you have come to help Achaeans or Phrygians.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">I wish to give my former foes, the Trojans, joy, and on the Achaean army impose a bitter return.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="67">Why do you leap thus from mood to mood? Your love and hate both go too far, on whomever centred.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="69">Do you not know the insult done to me and to the shrine I love?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">I do: when Aias dragged away Cassandra by force.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="71">Yes, and the Achaeans did nothing, said nothing to him.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="72">And yet it was by your mighty aid they sacked <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="73">For which cause I would join with you to do them harm.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="74">My powers are ready at your will. What is your intent?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">I will impose on them a return that is no return.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="76">While they stay on shore, or as they cross the salt sea?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Athena</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="77">When they have set sail from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> for their homes. On them will Zeus also send his rain and fearful hail, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">and inky tempests from the sky; and he promises to grant me his thunder-bolts to hurl on the Achaeans and fire their ships. And you, for your part, make the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> strait to roar with mighty billows and whirlpools, and fill <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>’s hollow bay with corpses, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">that Achaeans may learn henceforth to reverence my temples and regard all other deities.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="87">So shall it be, for this favor needs only a few words. I will vex the broad <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> sea; and the beach of Myconos and the reefs round <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">Scyros and <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> too, and the cliffs of Caphareus shall be strewn with many a corpse. You go to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and taking from your father’s hand his lightning bolts, keep careful watch against the hour when <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>’ army lets slip its cables. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">A fool is he who sacks the towns of men, with shrines and tombs, the dead man’s hallowed home, for at the last he makes a desert round himself and dies.</l></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="243">Each warrior took his prize in turn; you were not all at once assigned.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="247">Then tell me, whose prize is my daughter, hapless Cassandra?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="252">No, to share with him his stealthy love.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="253">What! Phoebus’ virgin-priestess, to whom the god with golden locks granted the gift of maidenhood?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="255">The dart of love has pierced his heart, love for the frenzied maid.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>

<l resp="perseus" n="262">Do you mean Polyxena, or whom do you inquire about?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="263">Yes, that one; to whom has the lot assigned her?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="269">What wild words are these? Please tell me, is she still alive?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="270">Her fate is one that sets her free from trouble.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Talthybius</speaker>

Ah, my child! how little did I ever dream that such would be your marriage, a captive, and of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> too! Give up the torch to me; you do not bear its blaze aright in your wild frantic course, nor have your afflictions left you in your sober senses, </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="355">and if you find me unwilling at all, thrust me there by force; for if Loxias is indeed a prophet, Agamemnon, that famous king of the Achaeans, will find in me a bride more vexatious than Helen. For I will slay him and lay waste his home </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="360">to avenge my father’s and my brothers’ death. But let that go; I will not tell of that axe which shall sever my neck and the necks of others, or of the conflict ending in a mother’s death, which my marriage shall cause, nor of the overthrow of Atreus’ house. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="365">But I, for all my frenzy, will so far rise above my frantic fit, that I will prove this city happier far than those Achaeans, who for the sake of one woman and one passion have lost a countless army in hunting Helen. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="370">Their captain too, whom men call wise, has lost for what he hated most what most he prized, yielding to his brother for a woman’s sake—and she was willing and not taken by force—the joy he had of his own children in his home. For from the day that they landed upon Scamander’s strand, their doom began, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="375">not for loss of stolen frontier nor yet for fatherland with high towers; whomever Ares took, those never saw their children again, nor were they shrouded for the tomb by hand of wife, but in a foreign land they lie. At home the case was still the same; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="380">wives were dying widows, parents were left childless in their homes, having reared their sons for others, and none is left to make libations of blood upon the ground before their tombs. Truly to such praise as this their army can make an ample claim. It is better to pass by their shame in silence, nor may mine be the Muse </l>

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="386"/>

<l resp="perseus" n="390">their funeral rites all duly paid by duteous hands. And all such Phrygians as escaped the warrior’s death lived always day by day with wife and children by them, joys the Achaeans had left behind. As for Hector and his griefs, hear how the case stands; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="395">he is dead and gone, but still his fame remains as bravest of the brave, and this was a result of the Achaeans’ coming; for had they remained at home, his worth would have gone unnoticed. And <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> married the daughter of Zeus, whereas, had he never done so, the alliance he made in his family would have been forgotten. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="400">Whoever is wise should fly from making war; but if he come to this, a noble death will crown his city with glory, a coward’s end with shame. Therefore, mother, you should not pity your country or my bed, for this my marriage </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="640">feels his spirit straying from the scene of former joys. Now that child of yours is dead as though she never had seen the light, and little she knows of her calamity; whereas I, who aimed at a fair repute, though I won a higher lot than most, yet missed my luck in life. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="645">For all that stamps the wife a woman chaste, I strove to do in <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>’s home.

<l resp="perseus" n="650">therefore I gave up any longing to do so, and stayed within my house; nor would I admit indoors the clever gossip women love, but conscious of a heart that told an honest tale I was content. And ever would I keep a silent tongue and modest eye before my husband; </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="925">so Pallas offered him command of all the Phrygians, and the destruction of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>; Hera promised he should spread his dominion over <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the utmost bounds of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, if he would decide for her; but Cypris spoke in rapture of my loveliness, </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="940">With no small goddess at his side he came, my evil genius, call him Alexander or <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, as you will; and you, villain, left him behind in your house, and sailed away from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1015">And yet often I advised you saying, <q>Get away, daughter; my sons will take other brides, and I will belp you to steal away, and convey you to the Achaean fleet; oh, end the strife between us and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>!</q> But this was bitter to you. </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1275">Yet, you aged foot, make one painful struggle to haste, that I may say a farewell to this wretched town. O <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, that before had such a grand career among barbarian towns, soon will you be bereft of that splendid name. They are burning you, and leading us even now from our land </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1280">to slavery. O gods! Yet why do I call on the gods? They did not hearken ever before to our call. Come, let us rush into the flames, for to die with my country in its blazing ruin would be a noble death for me.</l></sp>
