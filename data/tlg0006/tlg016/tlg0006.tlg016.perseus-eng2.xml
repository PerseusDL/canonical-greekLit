<stage>Before the royal palace at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. Orestes lies sleeping on a couch in the background.</stage>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">There is nothing so terrible to describe, or suffering, or heaven-sent affliction, that human nature may not have to bear the burden of it. The blessed Tantalus—and I am not now taunting him with his misfortunes— </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">Tantalus, the reputed son of Zeus, flies in the air, quailing at the rock which looms above his head; paying this penalty, they say, for the shameful weakness he displayed in failing to keep a bridle on his lips, when admitted by gods, though he was a man, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">to share the honors of their feasts like one of them. </l>
 <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="11">He begot Pelops, the father of Atreus, for whom the goddess, when she had carded her wool, spun a web of strife—to make war with his own brother Thyestes. But why need I retrace that hideous tale? </l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="15">Well, Atreus slew Thyestes’ children and feasted him on them. Atreus, now; I pass over intermediate events; from Atreus and Aerope of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> were born the famous Agamemnon, if he really was famous, and Menelaus. Now Menelaus married Helen, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20">the gods’ abhorrence; while lord Agamemnon married Clytemnestra, notorious in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>; and we three daughters were born: Chrysothemis, Iphigenia, and myself, Electra; also a son Orestes; all from that one accursed mother, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">who slew her husband, after snaring him in an inextricable robe. Her reason a maiden’s lips may not declare, and so I leave it unclear for the world to guess at. What need for me to charge Phoebus with wrong-doing? Though he persuaded Orestes </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">to slay his own mother, a deed that few approved. Still it was his obedience to the god that made him kill her; I had a share in the murder, in so far as a woman could, <del>and Pylades, who helped us to bring it about.</del></l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="34"/>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="34">After this my poor Orestes, wasting away in a cruel disease, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">lies fallen on his couch, and it is his mother’s blood that drives him round and round in frenzied fits; I am ashamed to name the goddesses, whose terrors are chasing him—the Eumenides. It is now the sixth day </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">since the body of his murdered mother was committed to the cleansing fire; since then no food has gone down his throat, nor has he washed his skin; but wrapped in his cloak he weeps in his lucid moments, whenever the fever leaves him; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">at other times he bounds headlong from his couch, as a colt when it is loosed from the yoke. This city of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> has decreed that no man give us shelter in home or hearth, or speak to matricides like us; and this is the fateful day on which the Argives will take a vote, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">whether we are both to die by stoning. <del>or to whet the steel and plunge it in our necks.</del> There is, it is true, one hope of escape from death: Menelaus has landed from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; his fleet now crowds the haven of <placeName key="tgn,7011013">Nauplia</placeName> where he has come to anchor on the shore, returned at last from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">after ceaseless wanderings; but Helen, that so-called lady of sorrows, he has sent on to our palace, waiting for the night, lest any of those parents whose sons died at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> might see her if she went by day, and set to stoning her. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">Within she sits, weeping for her sister and the calamities of her family, and yet she has still some solace in her woe; for Hermione, the child she left at home when she sailed for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the maid whom Menelaus brought from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">and entrusted to my mother’s keeping, is still a cause of joy to her and a reason to forget her sorrows.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="67">I am watching each approach, until I see Menelaus arriving; for unless we find some safety from him, we have only a feeble anchor to ride on otherwise. </l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="70">A helpless thing, an unlucky house!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="71">Daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, unhappy Electra, a maiden for so long, how is it with you and your brother, this ill-starred Orestes who slew his mother? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">For referring the sin as I do to Phoebus, I incur no pollution by addressing you; and yet I am truly sorry for the death of my sister Clytemnestra, whom I never saw after I was driven by heaven-sent frenzy to sail as I did to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">but now that I am parted from her, I bewail our misfortunes.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="81">Helen, why should I speak of that which your own eyes can see? <del>Agamemnon’s house in misfortune?</del></l>  
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="83">Beside his wretched corpse I sit, sleepless—for corpse he is, so faint his breath— </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">not that I reproach him with his sufferings; but you are highly blessed and your husband too. <del>you have come upon us in the hour of adversity</del></l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="88">How long has he lain in this way on the couch?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="89">Ever since he spilt his mother’s blood.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">Unhappy wretch! unhappy mother! what a death she died.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="91">Unhappy enough to succumb to his misery.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="92">By the gods, would you hear me a moment, maiden?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="93">Yes, with such leisure as this watching over a brother leaves.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="94">Will you go for me to my sister’s tomb?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">Would you have me seek my mother’s tomb? Why?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="96">To carry an offering of hair and a libation from me.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="97">Isn’t it right for you to go to the tomb of one you love?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="98">No, for I am ashamed to show myself in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="99">A late repentance surely for one who left her home so shamefully then.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">You have told the truth, but your telling is not kind to me.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="101">What is this supposed shame before the eyes of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> that possesses you?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="102">I am afraid of the fathers of those who lie dead at <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="103">Good cause for fear; your name is on every tongue in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="104">Then free me of my fear and grant me this favor.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="105">I could not bear to look upon my mother’s grave.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="106">And yet it would be shame indeed for servants to bear these offerings.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="107">Then why not send your daughter Hermione?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="108">It is not good for maidens to go into a crowd.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="109">And yet she would be repaying her dead foster-mother’s care.</l></sp>

Take these libations and these tresses of mine in your hands, and go pour round Clytemnestra’s tomb </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="115">a mingled cup of honey, milk, and frothing wine; then stand upon the heaped-up grave, and say this: <q type="spoken">Helen, your sister, sends you these libations as her gift, fearing herself to approach your tomb from terror of the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> mob</q> and bid her harbor kindly thoughts </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">towards me and you and my husband; towards these two wretched sufferers, too, whom the gods have destroyed. And promise that I will pay in full whatever funeral gifts are due from me to a sister. Now go, my child, and hurry; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="125">and soon as you have made the libations at the tomb, think of your return.
<stage>Exit Helen.</stage></l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="128">Did you see how she cut off her hair only at the ends, to preserve its beauty? She is the same woman as of old. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="130">May the gods hate you! for you have proved the ruin of me and my brother and all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="132">Alas! here are my friends once more, coming to unite their plaintive dirge with mine; they will soon put an end to my brother’s peaceful sleep, and cause my tears to flow </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="544">Old man, I am afraid to speak before you, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="545">in a matter where I am sure to grieve you to the heart. I am unholy because I killed my mother, I know it, yet holy on another count, because I avenged my father. Only let your years, which frighten me from speaking, set no barrier in the path of my words, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="550">and I will go forward; but now I fear your gray hairs.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="551">What ought I to have done? Set one thing against another. My father begot me; your daughter gave me birth, being the field that received the seed from another; for without a father no child would ever be born. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="555">So I reasoned that I ought to stand by the author of my being rather than the woman who undertook to rear me. Now your daughter—I am ashamed to call her mother—came to a man’s bed in a private and unchaste wedding; I speak against myself when I speak </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="560">badly of her, yet I will speak. Aegisthus was her secret husband in the home; I killed him, and I sacrificed my mother, an unholy  crime, no doubt, but done to avenge my father.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="564">Now, as regards the matters for which I deserve to be stoned as you threatened, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="565">hear the service I am conferring on all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. For if women become so bold as to murder their husbands, taking refuge in their children, with the mother’s breast to catch the pity, they would think nothing of destroying their husbands </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="570">on any charge whatsoever. But I, by a horrible crime, as you boast it to be, have put an end to this custom. I hated my mother and killed her justly. She was false to her husband when he was gone from his home to fight for all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> at the head of its armies, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="575">and she did not keep his bed undefiled; and when her sin had found her out, she did not impose punishment on herself, but, to avoid paying the penalty to her husband, punished my father by death. By the gods! it is not a good time for me to mention the gods, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="580">when defending the charge of murder; but if I consented by my silence to my mother’s conduct, what would the murdered man have done to me? Would he not now in hatred be tormenting me with the Furies? Or does my mother have goddesses as allies, but he does not, in his deeper wrong? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="585">You, yes! you, old man, have been my ruin by begetting a wicked daughter; for it was owing to her audacious deed that I lost my father and became my mother’s murderer.</l> 
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="588">You see, Telemachus did not kill the wife of Odysseus, because she did not marry husband upon husband, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="590">but the marriage-bed remained untainted in her home.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="591"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="591">And you see Apollo, who makes the navel of the earth his home, dispensing to mortals unerring prophecies, whom we obey in all he says; I killed my mother in obedience to him. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="595">Find him guilty of the crime, slay him; his was the sin, not mine. What ought I to have done? or is the god not competent to expiate the pollution when I refer it to him? Where then should anyone flee, if he will not rescue me from death after giving his commands? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="600">Do not say that the deed was done badly, but unfortunately for the ones who did it.</l> 
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="602">A blessed life those mortals lead who make wise marriages; but those for whom it does not fall out well are unfortunate in their public and private concerns.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="615">She deserves to die even more than you, for it was she who embittered you against your mother, always carrying tales to your ear to increase your hate the more, announcing dreams from Agamemnon, and  Aegisthus’ bed, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="620">may the gods in Hades loathe it! for even here on earth it was bitter; till she set the house ablaze with fires never kindled by Hephaestus.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="622">Menelaus, I tell you this, and I will do it, too: if you then consider my hatred or our marriage connection of any account, do not ward off this man’s doom in defiance of the gods, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="625">but leave him to be stoned to death by the citizens, or do not set foot on Spartan land. Remember you have been told all this, and do not choose the ungodly as friends, pushing aside the more righteous. Servants, lead me from this house.

  <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="646">I have done wrong; I ought to have a little wrong-doing from you to requite that evil, for my father Agamemnon also did wrong in gathering the Hellenes and going to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, not that he had sinned himself, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="650">but he was trying to find a cure for the sin and wrong-doing of your wife. So this is one thing you are bound to pay me back. For he really gave his life, as friends should, toiling hard in battle with you, so that you might have your wife again. </l>
  <l resp="perseus" n="655">Pay back to me the same thing you got there. For one day exert yourself, on my behalf standing up in my defense, not ten full years.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="658">As for what <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> took, the sacrifice of my sister, I let you have that; do not kill Hermione. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="660">For in my present plight, you must have an advantage over me and I must pardon it. But give to my miserable father my life and the life of my sister, a maiden so long; for by my death I shall leave my father’s house without an heir.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="665">You will say it is impossible. That’s the point; friends are bound to help friends in trouble. But when fortune gives of its best, what need of friends? For the god’s help is enough of itself when he is willing to give it.</l>

Imagine that the dead man in his grave </l>

<sp><speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="682">Orestes, you are a man for whom I have a deep regard, and I want to take part in your troubles; it is a duty, too, to help relatives bear their ills, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="685">by dying or killing enemies, if god gives the power to do so. I wish I had that power granted me by the gods. For I have come quite destitute of allies, after my long weary wanderings, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="690">with the small strength of my surviving friends. We should never get the better of Pelasgian Argos by fighting; if we should prevail by soothing speeches, we will come to some hope there. For how can you win a great cause by small </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="695"><del>efforts? It is foolish even to wish it.</del></l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="696">For when the people fall into a vigorous fury, they are as hard to quench as a raging fire; but if you gently slacken your hold and yield a little to their tension, cautiously watching your opportunity, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="700">they may possibly calm down; if their gusts abate, you may obtain whatever you want from them easily. They have pity, and a hot temper too, an invaluable quality if you watch it closely. So for you I will go and try to persuade Tyndareus </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="705">and the city to moderation. A ship also dips if its sheet is hauled too taut, but rights itself again if it is let go.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="708">The god hates excessive eagerness, and the citizens do also; I must save you, I don’t deny it, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="710">by cleverness, not by violence against those who are stronger.

<sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="866">I had just come from the country and was entering the gates, needing to learn what was decided about you and Orestes, for I was always well disposed to your father when he was alive, and it was your house that reared me, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="870">poor indeed, yet loyal in the service of friends. I saw a crowd going and taking their seats on the height, where they say Danaus first gathered his people for a meeting, making amends to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>. So, when I saw the throng, I asked a citizen: </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="875"><q type="spoken">What news in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>? Tidings of the enemy haven’t ruffled the city of Danaus, have they?</q> But he said: <q type="spoken">Don’t you see Orestes there, on his way to he tried for his life?</q> I saw an unexpected sight, which I wish I had not seen, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="880">Pylades and your brother approaching together, the one with his head down, weakened by sickness; the other sharing his friend’s sorrow like a brother, tending his illness with constant care.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="884">Now when the Argives were fully gathered, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="885">a herald rose and said: <q type="spoken">Who wishes to give his opinion whether Orestes should be slain or not for the murder of his mother?</q> Then up stood Talthybius, who helped your father sack the Phrygians. He spoke out of both sides of his mouth, a mere tool of those in power as he always is, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="890">expressing high admiration for your father, but not praising your brother, urging his crooked sentiments in specious words, that it would establish laws as to parents that are not good;  and all the while he was darting lively glances at  the friends of Aegisthus. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="895">Such is that tribe; heralds always trip across to the lucky side; the one who has power in the city or a post in the government is their friend.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="898">After him lord Diomedes made a speech; he said they should not kill you and your brother, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="900">but keep clear of guilt by punishing you with exile. Some roared out that his words were good, but others disapproved.</l> 
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="902">Next stood up a fellow, who cannot close his lips; one whose impudence is his strength; an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>, but not of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, forced on us; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="905">confident in bluster and ignorant free speech, and plausible enough to involve them in some mischief sooner or later; <del>for whenever a man with a pleasing trick of speech, but of unsound principles, persuades the mob, it is a serious evil to the state; but those who give sound and sensible advice on all occasions,</del> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="910"><del>if not immediately useful to the state, yet prove so afterwards. And this is the way in which to regard a party leader; for the position is much the same in the case of an orator and a man in office.</del> He was for stoning you and Orestes to death, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="915">but it was Tyndareus who kept suggesting arguments of this kind to him as he urged the death of both of you.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="917">Another then stood up and said the opposite; he was not handsome in appearance, but a brave man, rarely coming in contact with the town or the circle in the market-place; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="920">a farmer—and they are the only ones who preserve our land—but clever, and eager to grapple with the arguments, his character without a blemish, his walk in life beyond reproach. He said that they should crown Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, for showing his willingness to avenge a father </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="925">by the murder of a wicked and godless woman who would prevent men from taking up arms and going on foreign service, if those who remain behind, corrupt and seduce wives left at home to keep house. </l>

Now since in any case I must breathe my last, I want to do something to my enemies before my death, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1165">so that I may requite with ruin those who betrayed me, and so that those who made me suffer may grieve. Yes! I am the son of Agamemnon, who was considered worthy to rule <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, no tyrant but yet god-like in power; I will not disgrace him </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1195">If Menelaus, when he sees Helen fallen in her blood, tries to save you to insure the girl’s life, allow him to take his daughter to his arms; but if he makes no effort to curb the angry outburst and leaves you to die, then cut the maiden’s throat. </l>
