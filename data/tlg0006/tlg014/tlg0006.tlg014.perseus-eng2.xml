<stage>Scene.— Tomb of Proteus in the island of Pharos.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">These are the lovely pure streams of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, which waters the plain and lands of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, fed by white melting snow instead of rain from heaven. Proteus was king of this land when he was alive,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">living on the island of Pharos and lord of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and he married one of the daughters of the sea, Psamathe, after she left Aiakos’ bed. She bore two children in his palace here: a son Theoklymenos, <del>because he spent his life in reverence of the gods,</del></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">and a noble daughter, her mother’s pride, called Eido in her infancy. But when she came to youth, the season of marriage, she was called Theonoe; for she knew whatever the gods design, both present and to come,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">having received this honor from her grandfather Nereus.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="16">My own fatherland, <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, is not without fame, and my father is Tyndareus; but there is indeed a story that Zeus flew to my mother Leda, taking the form of a bird, a swan,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20">which accomplished the deceitful union, fleeing the pursuit of an eagle, if this story is true. My name is Helen; I will tell the evils I have suffered. For the sake of beauty, three goddesses came to a deep valley on <placeName key="tgn,1105013">Mount Ida</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">Hera and Kypris, and the virgin daughter of Zeus, wishing to have the judgment of their loveliness decided. Kypris offered my beauty, if misfortune is beautiful, for <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> to marry, and so she won. <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, the shepherd of Ida, left his ox-stalls</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">and came to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, to have me in marriage.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="31"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="31">But Hera, indignant at not defeating the goddesses, made an airy nothing of my marriage with <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>; she gave to the son of king Priam not me, but an image, alive and breathing, that she fashioned out of the sky and made to look like me;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">and he thinks he has me—an idle fancy, for he doesn’t have me. And in turn the plans of Zeus added further troubles to these; for he brought a war upon the land of the Hellenes and the unhappy Phrygians, so that he might lighten mother earth</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">of her crowded mass of mortals, and bring fame to the bravest man of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. So I was set up as the Hellenes’ spear-prize, to test the courage of the Trojans; or rather not me, but my name. Hermes caught me up in the folds of the air and</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">hid me in a cloud—for Zeus was not neglectful of me—and he set me down here in the house of Proteus, having selected the most self-controlled of all mankind, so that I might keep my bed pure for Menelaos. And so I am here, while my wretched husband</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">has gathered an army and gone over to the towers of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName> to hunt down and recover me. And many lives have been lost for my sake by the streams of Skamandros; and I who have endured all this am accursed, and have in appearance betrayed my husband</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">and brought a great war to the Hellenes. Why then am I still alive? I heard the god Hermes declare that I would yet live in the glorious country of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, with my husband—for Hermes knew I never went to Ilion—so that I would not go to bed with another man.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">Well, as long as Proteus saw this light of the sun, I was safe from marriage; but now that he is hidden in the dark earth, the dead man’s son hunts after a marriage with me. But I, out of regard to my husband of long ago, am throwing myself down as a suppliant before this tomb of Proteus,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">for him to keep my bed safe for my husband, so that, if I bear a name infamous throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, at least my body may not incur disgrace here.
</l></sp>

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="68"/>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="68">Who holds power over this fortified house? The dwelling is worthy of comparison with Ploutos’,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">its royal enclosures and towering buildings. Ah! Oh gods, what sight is here? I see the hateful deadly likeness of the woman who ruined me and all the Achaeans. May the gods spurn you, so much do you look like</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">Helen! If I were not in a foreign land, you would have died by this well-aimed arrow as a reward for your likeness to the daughter of Zeus.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="78">What is it, poor man—who are you, that you have turned away from me and loathe me for the misfortunes of that one?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">I was wrong; I gave way to my anger more than I should, for all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> hates that daughter of Zeus. Forgive me for what I said, lady.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="83">Who are you? Where have you come from, to visit this land?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="84">I am one of those unfortunate Achaeans, lady.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">Then it is no wonder that you loathe Helen. But who are you and where do you come from? Whose son should I call you?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="87">My name is Teucer, my father is Telamon, and <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> is the land that nurtured me.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="89">Then why are you visiting these lands of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">I am an exile, driven out of my native land.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="91">You must be unhappy! Who banished you from your fatherland?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="92">My father Telamon. Could you find anyone closer to me?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="93">But why? This matter is surely an unfortunate one.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="94">The death of my brother Aias at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was my ruin.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">How so? You didn’t take his life with your sword, did you?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="96">He threw himself on his own sword and died.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="97">Was he mad? For what sensible man would dare such a thing?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="98">Do you know a certain Achilleus, the son of Peleus?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="99">Yes; he came to woo Helen once, so I hear.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">When he died, he left a contest for his armor to his allies.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="101">Well, if he did, what harm is this to Aias?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="102">When someone else got the arms, he took his own life.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="103">Then are you ill through his suffering?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="104">Yes, because I did not die together with him.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="105">So you went to the famous city of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, stranger?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="106">Yes, and by helping to sack it, I destroyed myself as well.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="107">Has it already been set alight and completely consumed by fire?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="108">So that not even a trace of the walls is evident.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="109">O miserable Helen! Because of you, the Phrygians have been destroyed.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="110">And also the Achaeans; great evils have been committed.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="111">How long is it since the city was sacked?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="112">Almost seven years have gone full circle, with their harvests.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="113">And how much longer were you waiting at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="114">For many months; the moon held its course through ten years.</l></sp>

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="115"/>
<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="115">And did you capture the Spartan woman?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="116">Menelaos caught her by the hair to drag her away.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="117">Did you yourself see the wretched creature? Or do you speak from hearsay?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="118">I saw her with my own eyes, just as I see you, no less.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="119">Consider whether you had some fancy, sent by the gods.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">Think of some other topic, not that woman still!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="121">Are you so sure this fancy was reliable?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="122">I saw it with my own eyes; and the mind has sight.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="123">Is Menelaos already at home with his wife?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="124">No; he is neither in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> nor by the streams of the Eurotas.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="125">Alas! This is evil news for those to whom you bring it.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="126">He is said to have disappeared with his wife.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="127">Wasn’t there the same passage for all the Argives?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="128">Yes; but a tempest scattered them in every direction.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="129">On which surface of the salty ocean?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="130">While they were crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> in mid-channel.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="131">And from that time does no one know of Menelaos’ arrival?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="132">No one; but throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> he is reported to be dead.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="133">I am wholly lost. Is the daughter of Thestius alive?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="134">You speak of Leda? She is dead and gone, indeed.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="135">It wasn’t Helen’s disgraceful fame that killed her, surely?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="136">Yes, they say she tied a noose around her noble neck.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="137">Are the sons of Tyndareus still alive or not?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="138">They are dead, and not dead: it is a double story.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="139">Which report is the stronger? I am so unhappy at these evils!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="140">Men say that they are gods in the likeness of stars.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="141">That is good news; but what is the other story?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="142">That they killed themselves because of their sister. But enough of such talk! I do not need to grieve twice. As to why I came to this royal palace,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="145">wanting to see the prophetess Theonoe, you be my patron, so I might obtain an oracle: how I should steer a favorable course to the island of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, where Apollo has declared I am to live, giving it the island name of</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="150"><placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in honor of that fatherland over there.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="151">The voyage itself will explain that, stranger; leave this land and escape, before the son of Proteus, the ruler of this land, catches sight of you; now he is away with his trusty hounds tracking his savage quarry to the death;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="155">for he kills every visitor from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> that he catches. Do not seek to learn his reason, and I will not say; for how could I help you?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="158">Lady, you have spoken well. May the gods grant you a return for your kindness!</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="160">Although you have a body like Helen’s, your heart is not like hers, but very different. May she die miserably, and never reach the streams of Eurotas! But may you always have good fortune, lady.</l></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Helen</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="255">Dear friends, to what a fate am I yoked? Did my mother bear me as a wonder to mankind? <del>For no other woman, Hellene or barbarian, gives birth to a white vessel of chicks, in which they say Leda bore me to Zeus.</del></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="260">My life and all I do is a wonder, partly because of Hera, and partly my beauty is to blame. If only I could be rubbed out like a painting, and have again in turn a plainer form instead of beauty, and the Hellenes would have forgotten the evil fate that I now have,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="265">and would remember what part of my life is not evil, as they now remember what is.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="267">When someone looks to one event only, and is ill-treated by the gods, it is hard, but all the same it can be borne. But I am involved in countless troubles.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="270">First, although I never acted wrongly, my good name is gone. And this trouble is stronger than the reality, if someone incurs blame for wrongs that are not his own. Next, the gods have removed me from my native country to barbarian habits, and bereft of friends</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="275">I have become a slave although I am free by birth; for among barbarians all are slaves except one. And the only anchor of my fortunes is gone, the hope that my husband would come one day and free me of my woes—he is dead, he no longer exists.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="280"> My mother is dead, and I am called her murderer—unjustly, but that injustice is mine to bear; while the one who was born the glory of the house, my daughter, is growing gray as a virgin, without a husband; and those two Dioskouroi, called the sons of Zeus, are no more.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="285">But with all my misfortunes, I am as good as dead in my circumstances, though not in fact. And this is the last evil of all: if ever I should come home, I would be shut out by barred doors, for people would think I was that Helen of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, coming back with Menelaos.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="290">If my husband were still alive, we could have recognized each other by recourse to tokens which are evident to us alone. But now this is not so, and he can never be saved.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="293"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="293">Why then do I still live? What fortune do I have left? Shall I choose marriage in exchange for evils,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="295">and live with a barbarian man, seated at his sumptuous table? But whenever a husband she hates lives with a woman, her own body is also hateful to her. It is best to die; how could this not be well done? <del>To hang oneself, high in the air, is unseemly,</del></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="300"><del>even slaves consider it undignified; but to stab oneself is noble and good, and the moment of rending life from the body is short.</del> For I have come to such a depth of misery; other women have good fortune from their beauty,</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="386">O Pelops, who once held that chariot-race contest with Oinomaos over <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>, if only, when you were persuaded to make a banquet for the gods, you had left your life then, inside the gods,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="390">before you ever begot my father, Atreus, to whom were born, from his marriage with Airope, Agamemnon and myself, Menelaos, a famous pair; for I believe that I carried a mighty army—and I say this not in boast—in ships to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="395">no tyrant commanding any troops by force, but leading the young men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> by voluntary consent. And some of these can be counted no longer alive, others as having a joyful escape from the sea, bringing home again names thought to be of the dead.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="400">But I wander miserably over the swelling waves of the gray ocean, ever since I sacked the towers of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>; and although I long to come home, I am not thought worthy by the gods to achieve this. I have sailed to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>’s deserts and all its inhospitable landing-places;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="405">and whenever I draw near my native land, the blast drives me back again, and no favoring wind has ever entered my sails to let me come home.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="408">And now I am cast up on this shore, a miserable shipwrecked sailor who has lost his friends; and my ship is</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="410">broken into many pieces against the rocks. But out of its cleverly-wrought fastenings the keel was left, on which I made my difficult escape by an unexpected chance, and also Helen with me, whom I dragged away from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. But I do not know the name of this country</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="415">and its people; for I was embarrassed to burst into a crowd and make inquiries, and so I concealed these shabby clothes, in shame over my misfortune. For whenever a man of high degree is badly off, he falls into an unaccustomed state which is worse than that of one who has long been unfortunate.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="420">But poverty is wearing me away; for I have neither food, nor clothes around my body; one can compare what I am wearing to rags cast out of the ship. The sea snatched away all the robes I once wore, splendid clothes and ornaments. Deep in a cave</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="425">I hid the woman who caused all my troubles, and have come here, after compelling those of my friends who survived to guard my wife. I have come alone, seeking help for those friends there, if I may find it somehow after careful search.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="430">When I saw this home, surrounded by walls, and the majestic gateways of some prosperous man, I came near; sailors can hope to get something from wealthy homes; but from those who have no livelihood—they could not help us, even if they wanted to.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="711">O daughter, how intricate and hard to trace out is the nature of the god! In some way that is good, he twists everything about, now up, now down; one man suffers, and one who has not suffered comes afterwards to a bad end,</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="725">in the chariot as a bride, were leaving your happy home with this man here. Whoever pays no reverence to his master’s affairs, rejoicing with him and grieving with his troubles, is worthless. Although I was born a servant, let me still be numbered among honest</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="745">the seers’ doings are, and how full of falsehood; there was no health in the blaze of sacrifice after all, or in the cry of winged birds; even to think that birds can help mankind is certainly foolish. For Calchas gave no word or sign to the army,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="750">when he saw his friends dying on behalf of a cloud, nor did Helenos; but the city was taken by storm in vain. You might say: because the god did not want them to? Then why do we consult prophets? We ought to sacrifice to the gods and ask a blessing, but leave divination alone;</l>

<sp><speaker>Menelaos</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="842">I will kill you on the tomb’s surface, and then kill myself. But first I will fight a great contest for your bed. Let anyone who wishes come near!</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="845">For I will not disgrace my Trojan fame, nor, on my return to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, will I receive great blame—I who robbed Thetis of Achilleus, and saw the slaughter of Aias, son of Telamon, and the son of Neleus made childless;</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="873">Helen, what about my prophecy—how is it? This man, your husband Menelaos, has openly arrived,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="875">robbed of his ships and of your counterfeit. O unhappy man! What troubles you have escaped to come here; nor do you know whether you are to return home or to stay here. For there will be strife among the gods, and a solemn assembly held by Zeus on your account this very day.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="880">Hera, who was hostile to you before, is now friendly and wants to bring you safely home, with this woman, so that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> may learn that the marriage of <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, Kypris’ gift, was false; but Kypris wishes to ruin your journey home,</l>

Now the decision rests with me, whether to ruin you, as Kypris wishes, by telling my brother of your presence here, or to save your life by taking Hera’s side,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="890">keeping my brother in the dark, for his orders are for me to tell him, whenever you happen to come to this land.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="894">Maiden, I fall at your knees as a suppliant,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="895">and seat myself in this sad posture on behalf of myself and of this man; I am on the point of seeing him slain, after I have found him with such difficulty. Please do not tell your brother that my husband has returned to my loving arms,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="900">but save us, I beseech you; do not forsake the piety that was once yours for your brother’s sake, buying favors that are wicked and unjust. For the god hates violence, and commands everyone to have their possessions without robbery.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="905"><del>Wealth that is unjust, though it may bring some power, ought to be avoided.</del> Heaven is common to all mortals, and so is the earth, where people ought to fill up their homes without having another’s property, or taking it away by force.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="910">At a critical time, but unhappily for me, Hermes gave me to your father to keep safe for my husband, this man who is here and wishes to have me back. But how could he recover me if he is dead? How could your father ever restore the living to the dead? Now examine the will of the god and of your father;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="915">would the deity and your dead father be willing to give back again their neighbor’s goods, or would they not? I think they would. It is not, therefore, right that you should attach more importance to a thoughtless brother more than a good father. If you, who are a prophet and believe in divine affairs,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="920">ruin the lawful intention of your father and gratify your lawless brother, it is disgraceful that you should have full knowledge of divine matters, both what is and what will be, and yet not know what is right. Save me, the unhappy one, enveloped in these troubles,</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="935">And if this man were dead and slaughtered on a funeral pyre, I would be cherishing his memory with tears far away; but shall I be robbed of him when he is now alive and safe?</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="939">Ah! not that, maiden, I beseech you:</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="950">And yet they say that it is fitting for a noble man to let tears fall from his eyes in misfortune. But I will not choose this honorable course, if it is honorable, in preference to bravery. But, if you think it right to save a stranger</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="955">seeking justly to recover his wife, then restore her and save us in addition; if not, I would be wretched, not now for the first time but as often before, and you will seem to be an evil woman. What I consider honest and worthy of me,</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="962">Old man, dwelling in this tomb of stone, give her back, I demand of you my wife, whom Zeus sent here for you to keep for me.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="965">I know you will never restore her to me yourself, for you are dead; but this woman here will not think it right that her father, invoked from below, once so glorious, should bear a tarnished name; for she is the one in authority now.</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="980">If he refuses to meet me face to face, but hunts us down, two suppliants at the tomb, by starvation, I am resolved to kill this woman, and then to plunge this two-edged sword through my heart, on the surface of the tomb, so that streams of blood may</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="985">run down the grave; we will lie, two corpses side by side upon this polished slab, a deathless grief to you, and a reproach to your father. Your brother will never marry this woman, nor will any other; but I will carry her off,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="990">if not to my house, at any rate to death.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="991">Why do I say this? If I turned to women’s ways with tears, rather than being active, I would be pitied more. Kill me, if it seems good to you; you will not kill those who are without fame; but it is better to yield to what I say,</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="1005">Since Hera wishes to serve you, I will cast my vote on her side. May Kypris be gracious to me; but she has had nothing to do with me, and I will try to remain a virgin always. As for your reproaches against my father at this tomb,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1010">I have the same words to say. I would be doing wrong if I do not give her back; for that man, if he were alive, would have given her back for you to have, and you to her.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1013">For truly there is retribution for these things, both among the dead and among all men living. The mind</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1015">of the dead does not live, yet it has eternal thought as it falls into eternal ether. So as not to give advice at length, I will be silent as to what you have entreated, and I will never aid my brother’s folly with my counsel.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1020">For I am doing him a service, though he does not think it, if I turn him from his godless life to holiness. You yourselves devise some course of action; I will stand out of your way by my silence. Begin with the gods, and beg</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1025">Kypris to allow you to return to your country, and Hera that her intention to save you and your husband may remain the same. And you, my own dead father, never, as far as I have strength, shall you be called impious instead of pious. <stage>Exit Theonoe.</stage></l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1517">Menelaos has taken her off as plunder, out of the land; he was the one that came with the news of his own death.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Theoklymenos</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1519">O dreadful story! What ship carried her</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1520">off from this land? Your story is unbelievable.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1521">The very one that you gave to the stranger; and he has gone with your sailors, so that you may know everything in brief.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Theoklymenos</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1523">How? I am eager to know; for I never expected that a single hand could excel over</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1525">so many sailors, with whom you were sent.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1526">When the daughter of Zeus had left this royal house and started for the sea, delicately picking her way, she most cleverly began to mourn her husband, though he was close at hand and not dead.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1530">When we reached the enclosure of your dockyards, we began to launch the Sidonian ship on her first voyage, with her fifty benches and full measure of rowers. Task gave way to task: one set up the mast, another set up the oars</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1535">. . . and the rudders were lowered by their cross-bars. And during this labor, men of Hellas who had been fellow-voyagers with Menelaos were watching us, it seems, and they drew near to the beach, clad in the rags of shipwrecked men,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1540">handsome, but rough to look upon. And the son of Atreus, when he saw them approach, spoke to them, craftily introducing the reason for his mourning: <q type="spoken">Unhappy sailors, how have you arrived? From the wreckage of what Achaean ship?</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1545"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Are you here to help bury the dead son of Atreus, whose missing body this lady, daughter of Tyndareus, is honoring with an empty grave?</q> They wept in a feigned manner, and went to the ship, carrying aboard the offerings to be thrown into the sea for Menelaos. We were suspicious at this,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1550">and said to each other that there would be a crowd of those additional passengers; but still we remained silent, out of respect for your orders; for by bidding the stranger command the vessel, you threw everything into confusion.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1554"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="1554">Well, we easily put the other victims on the ship, for they were light;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1555">but the bull did not want to go forward along the plank, but kept bellowing loudly, rolling his eyes around; and, arching his back and peering along his horns, he prevented us from touching him. But Helen’s husband</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1560">called out: <q type="spoken">O you who sacked the town of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, come pick up this bull on young shoulders, as is the way in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and cast him into the prow . . . the sacrifice to the dead man.</q></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1565">Then they came at his summons, and caught up the bull and carried him on to the deck. And Menelaos stroked the horse on neck and brow, coaxing it to go aboard.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1569">Finally, when the ship was fully loaded,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1570">Helen climbed up the ladder with elegant step, and took her seat in the middle of the rowers’ benches, and he was near by, Menelaos who was called dead. The rest, equally divided on the right and left sides of the ship, sat down, each beside his man, with swords concealed beneath their cloaks,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1575">and the waves were filled with shouting as we heard the voice of the boatswain.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1577"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="1577">Now when we had put out from land, neither very far nor very near, the helmsman asked, <q type="spoken">Shall we sail yet further, stranger, or is this far enough?</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1580"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">For the command of this ship is yours.</q> And he answered, <q type="spoken">Far enough for me.</q> Holding a sword in his right hand, he stepped into the prow; and, standing over the bull to slay it, with no mention of any dead man, he cut its throat and prayed: <q type="spoken">O Poseidon of the sea,</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1585"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">who lives in the deep, and you holy daughters of Nereus, bring me and my wife safe and sound from here to <placeName key="tgn,7011013">Nauplia</placeName>’s shore!</q> Streams of blood, a good omen for the stranger, darted into the waves. And someone said, <q type="spoken">There is treachery in this voyage;</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1590"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">let us sail back again! You, give an order for the right oar, you, turn your rudder.</q> But the son of Atreus, standing where he slew the bull, cried out to his comrades, <q type="spoken">Why do you, the pick of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, delay to slaughter and kill the barbarians</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1595"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">and hurl them from the ship into the waves?</q> And the boatswain cried the opposite command to your rowers: <q type="spoken">Some of you catch up planks at the end, break up the benches, or snatch the oars from the locks, and make the heads of these foreign enemies bloody!</q>.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1600"> They all leapt upright, some with oars in their hands, others with swords; and the ship ran with blood. Helen cheered them on from the stern: <q type="spoken">Where is the fame you won in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? Show it against the barbarians!</q> In their eagerness, some would</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1605">fall, some stood upright, you would have seen others lying dead. But Menelaos, in full armor, wherever he spied that his comrades were suffering, would go there, sword in hand; and so we dived</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1610">from the ship, and he cleared the benches of your rowers. Then going to the helmsman he told him to sail a straight course to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. So they set up the mast, and favoring breezes blew.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1613">They are gone from here. But I escaped death and let myself down by the anchor into the sea;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1615">and just as I was worn out, some fisherman took me up, and put me out on land, to bring you this report. Nothing is more useful to mankind than a prudent distrust.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1619">I never would have believed that Menelaos could have eluded both us</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1620">and you, O king, the way he did on his arrival.</l></sp>
