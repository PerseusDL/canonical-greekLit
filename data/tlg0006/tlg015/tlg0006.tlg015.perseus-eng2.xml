<stage>Before the royal palace of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. </stage>
<sp><speaker>Jocasta</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">O Sun-god, you who cut your path in heaven’s stars, mounted on a chariot inlaid with gold and whirling out your flame with swift horses, what an unfortunate beam you shed on <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the day</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">that Cadmus left <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>’s realm beside the sea and reached this land! He married at that time Harmonia, the daughter of Cypris, and begot Polydorus from whom they say Labdacus was born, and Laius from him.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">I am known as the daughter of Menoeceus, and Creon is my brother by the same mother. They call me Jocasta, for so my father named me, and I am married to Laius. Now when he was still childless after being married to me a long time in the palace,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">he went and questioned Phoebus, and asked for us both to have sons for the house. But the god said: <q type="spoken">Lord of Thebes famous for horses, do not sow a furrow of children against the will of the gods; for if you beget a son, that child will kill you,</q></l>
 <l resp="perseus" n="20"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">and all your house shall wade through blood.</q> But he, yielding to pleasure in a drunken fit, begot a child on me; and afterwards, conscious of his sin and of the god’s warning, he gave the child to shepherds to expose</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">in Hera’s meadow and the crag of Cithaeron, after piercing his ankles with iron spikes; from which <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> named him Oedipus. But Polybus’ horsemen found him and took him home and laid him in the arms of their mistress.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">So she suckled the child that I had borne and persuaded her husband she was its mother.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="32"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="32">When my son had become a man, with tawny beard, either because he had guessed or learned it from another, he set out for the shrine of Phoebus, wanting to know for certain who his parents were;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">and so did Laius, my husband, seeking to learn if the child he had exposed was dead. And the two of them met at the branching road of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>. And Laius’ charioteer ordered him:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40"><q type="spoken">Stranger, make way for the king!</q> But he walked on without a word, in his pride. The horses with their hoofs drew blood from the tendons of his feet. Then—why need I speak of matters outside these evils?—son slew father, and taking his chariot</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">gave it to Polybus, his foster-father. Now when the Sphinx was oppressing and ravaging our city, after my husband’s death, my brother Creon proclaimed my marriage: that he would marry me to anyone who should guess the riddle of the crafty maiden. It happened somehow</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">that my son, Oedipus, guessed the Sphinx’s song; <del>and so he became king of this land</del> and received the scepter of this land as his prize. He married his mother in ignorance, luckless wretch! nor did his mother know that she was sleeping with her son.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55"> I bore my son two sons, Eteocles and the hero Polyneices, and two daughters; the one her father called Ismene; the other, which was the elder, I named Antigone. Now when Oedipus, who endured so much,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">learned that he was married to his mother, he inflicted a dreadful slaughter upon his eyes, making the pupils bloody with a golden brooch. But when my sons grew to bearded men, they hid their father behind bars, so that his misfortune,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">needing as it did much skill to hide it, might be forgotten. He is still living in the house. Afflicted by his fate, he makes the most unholy curses against his sons, praying that they may divide this house with a sharp sword.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="69"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="69">So they were afraid</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">that the gods might fulfil his prayers if they dwell together; and they made an agreement, that Polyneices, the younger, should first leave the land in voluntary exile, while Eteocles should stay and hold the scepter, and then change places yearly. But as soon as Eteocles was seated on the bench of power,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="75">he did not leave the throne, but drove Polyneices into exile from this land.  So Polyneices went to <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName> and married into the family of Adrastus, and having collected a numerous force of Argives is leading them here; and he has come against these very walls of seven gates,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">demanding the scepter of his father and his share of the land. Now I, to end their strife, have persuaded one son to meet the other under truce, before seizing arms; and the messenger I sent tells me that he will come. O Zeus, dwelling in the bright folds of heaven,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">save us, and reconcile my sons! For you, if you are really wise, must not allow the same mortal to be forever wretched. <stage>Exit Jocasta.</stage></l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="88"><stage>From the roof.</stage>Antigone, famous child in your father’s house, although your mother allowed you at your entreaty to leave your maiden chamber</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">for the topmost story of the house, to see the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army, wait, so that I may first investigate the path, whether there be any of the citizens visible on the road, and reproach, a slight matter to a slave like me, should come</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">to you, my royal mistress; and when I have examined everything, I will tell you what I saw and heard from the Argives, when I carried the terms of the truce from here to Polyneices and back from him again.</l> <stage>After a slight pause.</stage>
<l resp="perseus" n="99">No, there is no citizen near the house,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">so mount the ancient cedar steps, and view the plains; beside Ismenus’ streams and the fountain of Dirce see the great army of the enemy.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="430">So many Danaan and Mycenaean chiefs have joined me, doing me a bitter though needful service, for it is against my own city I am marching. Now I call the gods to witness, that it is not willingly I have raised the spear against my willing friends.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="435">But it belongs to you, mother, to dissolve this unhappy feud, and, by reconciling loving brothers, to end the trouble for me and you and the whole city. It has been said for a long time, but I will say it anyway: wealth is most valued by men,</l>

<sp><speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="446">Mother, I am here; I have come to do you a favor. What am I to do? Let some one begin the conference; for I stopped marshalling the citizens in pairs of companies around the walls, so that I might hear your</l>

<sp><speaker>Jocasta</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="452">Wait; haste does not carry justice with it; but slow deliberation often attains a wise result. Restrain the fierceness of your look and panting rage;</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="460">I want to give you both one piece of good counsel; when a man that is angry with his friend confronts him face to face, he ought only to keep in view the object of his coming, forgetting all previous quarrels.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="465">My son Polyneices, speak first, for you have come at the head of a Danaid army, alleging wrongful treatment; may some god be the judge and reconciler of the troubles.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="480">doing others harm and suffering it myself, as is now the case. But he, after consenting to this and calling the gods to witness his oath, has performed none of his promises, but is still keeping the sovereignty in his own hands together with my share of our heritage.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="484">And now I am ready to take my own</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="490">as I shall attempt to do if I do not get my rights. I call the gods to witness that spite of my just dealing in everything I am being unjustly robbed of my country, a most unholy act. I have made my points, mother, without stringing together</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="505">or beneath the earth, if I were able so to do, to win Tyranny, the greatest of the gods. Therefore, mother, I will not yield this blessing to another rather than keep it for myself; for it is cowardly to lose the greater</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="510">and to win the less. Besides, I am ashamed to think that he should gain his object by coming with arms and ravaging the land; for this would be a disgrace to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, if I should yield my scepter up to him for fear of Mycenaean might.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="515">He ought not to have attempted reconcilement by armed force, mother, for words accomplish everything that even the sword of an enemy might effect. Still, if on any other terms he cares to dwell here, he may; but that I shall never willingly let go.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="520">Shall I become his slave, when I can rule? Therefore come fire, come sword! Harness your horses, fill the plains with chariots, for I will not give up my tyranny to him. For if we must do wrong, to do so for tyranny</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="535">and she is the one you are mad for. It is better, my son, to honor Equality, who always joins friend to friend, city to city, allies to allies; for Equality is naturally lasting among men; but the less is always in opposition to the greater,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="540">and begins the dawn of hatred. For it is Equality that has set up for man measures and divisions of weights, and has determined numbers; night’s sightless eye, and radiant sun proceed upon their yearly course on equal terms,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="545">and neither of them is envious when it has to yield. Though both sun and night are servants for mortals, you will not be content with your fair share of your heritage and give the same to him? Then where is justice?</l>

<l resp="perseus" n="870">That bloody destruction of his eyes was planned by the gods as an example to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>; and the sons of Oedipus went foolishly astray in wishing to throw over it the veil of time—as if they could outrun the gods! For by robbing their father of his due honor</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="875">and allowing him no freedom, they exasperated the poor sufferer; so he, suffering and disgraced as well, breathed dreadful curses against them. And I, because I left nothing undone or unsaid, incurred the hatred of the sons of Oedipus.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="880">But death inflicted by each other’s hands awaits them, Creon; and the many heaps of the slain, some from <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>, some from Theban spears, shall cause bitter lamentation in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Alas for you, poor city, you are being involved in their ruin,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="885">unless I can persuade one man. The best course was to prevent any child of Oedipus becoming either citizen or king in this land, on the ground that they were under a ban and would overthrow the city. But since evil has the mastery of good, there is</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="890">one other means of safety; but—for it is unsafe for me to tell, and painful too for those whose fortune it is to supply their city with the saving cure—I will go away. Farewell; among the rest</l>

<sp><speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="930">You do right to ask me and to test what I have said. In the chamber where the earth-born dragon kept watch over Dirce’s springs, he must be offered as a sacrifice and shed his blood on the ground, a libation of Cadmus, because of the ancient wrath of Ares,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="935">who now avenges the slaughter of his earth-born snake. If you do this, you shall win Ares as an ally. If the earth receives fruit for fruit and human blood for blood, you shall find her kind to you again, who once</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="940">sent up to us a crop of Sown-men with golden helmets; for one of those born from the dragon’s teeth must die.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="942">Now you are our only survivor of the Sown race, pure-blooded both on your mother’s and your father’s side, you and your sons. Haemon’s marriage</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="945">holds him back from the slaughter, for he is no longer single; even if he has not consummated his marriage, yet he is betrothed. But this tender youth, consecrated to his city, might by dying rescue his country; and bitter will he make the return of Adrastus and his Argives,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="950">flinging over their eyes a black spirit of death, and he will glorify <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Choose one of these two destinies: either save the city or your son.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="953">Now you have all that I had to say. Daughter, lead me home. The man who practices the prophet’s art</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="955">is a fool; for if he happens to give an adverse answer, he makes himself disliked by those for whom he takes the omens; while if he pities and deceives those who are consulting him, he wrongs the gods. Phoebus should have been man’s only prophet, for he fears no one. <stage>Exit Teiresias.</stage></l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="1090">After Creon’s son, who gave up his life for his country, had taken his stand on the turret’s top and plunged a dark-hilted sword through his throat to save this land, your son told off seven companies with their captains to the seven gates to keep watch on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> warriors,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1095">and stationed cavalry to cover cavalry, and infantry to support infantry, so that assistance might be close at hand for any weak point in the walls.

<l resp="perseus" n="1100">Teumesus, and, when near the trench, they charged up to our Theban city at a run. In one loud burst from their ranks and from our walls rang out the battle-cry and trumpet-call.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1104"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="1104">First to the Neitian gate, Parthenopaeus, son of the huntress,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1105">led a company bristling with thick rows of shields, and he had his own device in the centre of his shield: Atalanta slaying the Aetolian boar with an arrow shot from far. To the gates of Proetus</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1110">came the prophet Amphiaraus, bringing the victims on a chariot; he had no boastful sign, but weapons chastely plain.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1113">Next lord Hippomedon came marching to the Ogygian gates with this device in the middle of his shield:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1115">Argus the all-seeing dappled with eyes on the watch, some open with the rising stars, others hiding when they set, as could be seen after he was slain.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1119">At the Homoloian gates Tydeus had his post,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1120">a lion’s skin with shaggy mane upon his shield, while the Titan Prometheus bore a torch in his right hand, to fire the town.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1123">Your own Polyneices led the battle against the Fountain gate; upon his shield for a device</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1125">were the colts of <placeName key="perseus,Potniae">Potniae</placeName> galloping at frantic speed, revolving by some clever contrivance on pivots by the handle, so as to appear distraught.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1128">At Electra’s gate Capaneus brought up his company, bold as Ares for the battle;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1130">this device his shield bore upon its iron back: an earth-born giant carrying on his shoulders a whole city which he had wrenched from its base, a hint to us of the fate in store for <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1134">Adrastus was at the seventh gate;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1135">a hundred vipers engraved on his shield, <del> as he bore on his left arm the hydra</del> the boast of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and serpents were carrying off in their jaws the sons of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> from within our very  walls. Now I was able to see each of them,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1140">as I carried the watch-word along to the leaders of our companies. </l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1141">To begin with, we fought with bows and thonged javelins, with slings that shoot from far and crashing stones; and as we were conquering, Tydeus and your son suddenly cried aloud:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1145"><q type="spoken">You sons of Danaus, before you are torn to pieces by their attack, why delay to fall upon the gates with all your might, light-armed and cavalry and charioteers?</q> No loitering then, soon as they heard that call; and many fell with bloody head,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1150">and many of us you could have seen thrown to the earth like tumblers before the walls, breathing their last, bedewing the dry ground with streams of blood.</l>
<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="1153"/>
<l resp="perseus" n="1153">Then Atalanta’s son, who was not an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> but an Arcadian, hurling himself like a hurricane at the gates, called for</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1155">fire and picks to raze the town; but Periclymenus, son of the ocean-god, stayed his wild career, heaving on his head a wagon-load of stone, the coping from the battlements; and it shattered his head with yellow hair and</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1160">crashed through the seams of the skull, dabbling with blood his fresh cheek; and he will never go back alive to his mother with her lovely bow, the maid of Maenalus.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1163">Your son then, seeing these gates secure, went on to the next, and I followed him.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1165">I saw Tydeus and his thick rows of targeteers hurling their Aetolian spears into the opening at the top of the turrets, so that our men fled and left the battlements; but your son rallied them once more, as a huntsman cheers his hounds,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1170">and stationed them at the towers again. And then we hastened to other gates, after stopping the affliction there. As for the madness of Capaneus, how can I describe it? He was going about with a long scaling-ladder, and boasting</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1175">that even the holy fire of Zeus would not hold him back from giving the city to utter destruction. And even as he spoke, he climbed up beneath the hail of stones, crouched under the shelter of his shield, rung by smooth rung going up the ladder.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1180">But, just as he was scaling the parapet of the wall, Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt; the earth re-echoed, and fear seized everyone; for from the ladder <del>his limbs were slung far apart, his head toward <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, his blood toward earth,</del></l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1185"><del>while his legs and arms went spinning round like Ixion’s wheel</del> he was hurled, spinnning; his burning corpse fell to the ground.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1187">But when Adrastus saw that Zeus was hostile to his army, he drew the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> troops outside the trench. Meanwhile our armed cavalry, seeing the lucky omen of Zeus before us,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1190">were driving forth their chariots, and the armed men charged with spears into the middle of the Argives, and all troubles happened at once: men were dying, hurled headlong from chariots, wheels flew off, axles crashed together,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1195">while the dead were heaped up on the dead. So for to-day we have prevented destruction of the towers of our land; but if this land will be fortunate for the future, that rests with the gods; for even now it owes its safety to some deity.</l></sp>

Then Polyneices, turning his eyes towards <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, lifted up a prayer:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1365"><q type="spoken">O Lady Hera, for I am yours, since I have married the daughter of Adrastus and dwell in your land, grant that I may slay my brother, and give my right hand, which is set against him, the victory, stained with his blood.</q> <del>Asking for a shameful crown, to kill his brother.</del></l>

<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1377">When the Tuscan trumpet, like a torch, blew the signal for the bloody battle, they darted wildly against one another;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1380">like boars whetting their savage tusks, they joined battle, their beards wet with foam. They kept shooting out their spears, but crouched beneath their shields to let the steel glance off in vain; but if either saw the other’s eye above the rim,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1385">he would aim his lance there, eager to outwit him with the point.</l>
    <l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1386">But both kept such careful outlook through the spy-holes in their shields, that their weapons found nothing to do; while from the onlookers far more than the combatants trickled the sweat caused by terror for their friends.

<l resp="perseus" n="1390"><milestone ed="p" n="1390" unit="line"/>Eteocles, in kicking aside a stone that rolled beneath his tread, exposed a limb outside his shield, and Polyneices, seeing a chance of dealing him a blow, aimed at it, and the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> shaft passed through his leg;</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1395">the Danaid army, one and all, cried out for joy. And the wounded man, seeing Polyneices’ shoulder bare in this effort, plunged his spear with all his might into his breast, restoring gladness to the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, though he broke off the spear-head.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1400">And so, at a loss for a weapon, he retreated step by step, till catching up a splintered rock he let it fly and broke the other’s spear in the middle; and now the combat was equal, for each had lost his lance.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1404">Then clutching their sword-hilts</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1405">they closed, and round and round, with shields clashing, they fought a wild battle. And Eteocles introduced the crafty Thessalian trick, having some knowledge of it from his association with that country. Disengaging himself from the immediate contest,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1410">he drew back his left foot but kept his eye closely on the pit of the other’s stomach from a distance; then advancing his right foot he plunged the weapon through his navel and fixed it in his spine. Down fell Polyneices, dripping with blood,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1415">ribs and belly contracting in his agony. But the other, thinking his victory now complete, threw down his sword and began to despoil him, wholly intent on that, without a thought for himself. And this indeed tripped him up; for Polyneices, who had fallen first, was still faintly breathing,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1420">and having in his grievous fall kept his sword, he made a last effort and drove it through the heart of Eteocles. They both lie there, fallen side by side, biting the dust with their teeth, and they have not decided the mastery.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="1427">Now hear what further woes succeeded. Just as her two sons had fallen and lay dying, their wretched mother came on the scene,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1430">her daughter with her, in great haste. When she saw their mortal wounds, she wailed: <q type="spoken">O my sons, the help I bring is too late.</q> And throwing herself on each in turn she wept and mourned, sorrowing over all her toil in nursing them, and their sister, by her side, mourned also:</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1435"><q type="spoken">Supporters of your mother’ s age, dearest brothers, leaving me forlorn, unwed!</q> Then lord Eteocles with one deep dying gasp, hearing his mother, laid on her his clammy hand,</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1440">and though he could not say a word, his moistened eye was eloquent to prove his love. And Polyneices was still breathing, and seeing his sister and his old mother he said: <q type="spoken">Mother, our end has come; I pity you</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1445"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">and my sister Antigone and my dead brother. For I loved him though he became my enemy, I loved him in spite of all. Bury me, mother, and you, my sister, in my native land; pacify the city’s wrath that l may get at least that much</q></l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="1450"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">of my own fatherland, although I lost my home. With your hand, mother, close my eyes—he himself places her fingers on the lids—and farewell; for already the darkness wraps me round.</q></l>

<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1454">So both at once breathed out their life of sorrow.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1455">But when their mother saw this sad event, in her overmastering grief she snatched a sword from the dead, and did a fearful deed; for she drove the steel right through her throat, and there she lies, dead with those she loved so well, her arms thrown round them both.</l>
<l resp="perseus" rend="indent" n="1460"> The army sprang to their feet and fell to wrangling, we maintaining that victory rested with my master, they with theirs; and there was strife among the generals, some holding that Polyneices gave the first wound with his spear, others that, as both were dead, victory rested with neither.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1465">Meanwhile Antigone crept away from the army. They rushed to their weapons, but by some lucky forethought the people of Cadmus had sat down under arms; and by a sudden attack we surprised the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army before it was fully equipped.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1470">Not one withstood our onset, and they filled the plain with fugitives, while blood was streaming from the countless dead our spears had slain. When victory had crowned our warfare, some set up an image of Zeus as a trophy, others were stripping the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> dead of their shields</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1475">and sending their spoils inside the battlements; and others with Antigone are bringing the dead here for their friends to mourn.

<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1657">I will bury him, although the state forbids.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1658">Do so, and you will be making your own grave by his.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1659">A noble end, for two so near and dear to lie side by side!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Creon</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
