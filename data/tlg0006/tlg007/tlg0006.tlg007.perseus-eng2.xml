Now my father, when <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>’s capital </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg007.perseus-eng2" resp="perseus" n="5">was threatened with destruction by the spear of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, took alarm and conveyed me secretly from the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to Polymestor’s house, his guest-friend in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, who sows these fruitful plains of <placeName key="tgn,7010345">Chersonese</placeName>, curbing by his might a nation delighting in horses. </l>

I was the youngest of Priam’s sons; and this it was that caused my secret removal from the land; for my childish arm was not able </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg007.perseus-eng2" resp="perseus" n="15">to carry weapons or to wield the spear. So long then as the bulwarks of our land stood firm, and <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>’s battlements abode unshaken, and my brother Hector prospered in his warring, I, poor child, grew up and flourished, like some vigorous shoot, </l>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg007.perseus-eng2" resp="perseus" n="1140">and the Achaeans, knowing that a son of Priam survived, might bring another expedition against the Phrygian land, and then harry and lay waste these plains of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, for the neighbours of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to experience the very troubles we were lately suffering, O king.</l>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg007.perseus-eng2" resp="perseus" n="1145">Now Hecuba, having discovered the death of her son, brought me here on the following pretext, saying she would tell me of hidden treasure stored up in <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> by the race of Priam; and she led me apart with my children into the tent, that no other might hear her news.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg007.perseus-eng2" resp="perseus" n="1150">So I sat down on a couch in their midst to rest; for there were many of the Trojan maidens seated there, some on my right hand, some on my left, as if beside a friend; and they were praising the weaving of our Edonian handiwork, looking at this robe as they held it up to the light;</l>
