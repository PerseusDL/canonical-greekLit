<stage>Scene: Before Agamemnon's tent in the Greek camp upon the shore of the Thracian Chersonese. The Ghost of Polydorus appears.</stage>
<sp n="Ghost">
<speaker>Ghost</speaker>
<p>I have come from out of the charnel-house and gates of gloom, where Hades dwells apart from gods, I Polydorus, a son of Hecuba, the daughter of Cisseus, and of Priam. Now my father, when <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>'s capital <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> was threatened with destruction by the spear of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, took alarm and conveyed me secretly from the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to Polymestor's house, his guest-friend in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, who sows these fruitful plains of <placeName key="tgn,7010345">Chersonese</placeName>, curbing by his might a nation delighting in horses. <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> And with me my father sent much gold by stealth, so that, if ever <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>'s walls should fall, his children that survived might not want for means to live. I was the youngest of Priam's sons; and this it was that caused my secret removal from the land; for my childish arm was not able <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> to carry weapons or to wield the spear. So long then as the bulwarks of our land stood firm, and <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s battlements abode unshaken, and my brother Hector prospered in his warring, I, poor child, grew up and flourished, like some vigorous shoot, <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> at the court of the Thracian, my father's guest-friend. But when <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> fell and Hector lost his life and my father's hearth was rooted up, and he himself fell butchered at the god-built altar by the hands of Achilles' murderous son; <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> then my father's friend killed me, his helpless guest, for the sake of the gold, and then cast me into the swell of the sea, to keep the gold for himself in his house. And there I lie, at one time upon the strand, at another in the salt sea's surge, drifting ever up and down upon the billows, <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> unwept, unburied; but now I am hovering over the head of my dear mother Hecuba, a disembodied spirit, keeping my airy station these three days, ever since my poor mother came from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to linger here in the <placeName key="tgn,7017285">Chersonese</placeName>.</p>
</sp></div1>

<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> Meanwhile all the Achaeans sit idly here in their ships at the shores of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>; for the son of Peleus, Achilles, appeared above his tomb and stopped the whole army of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, as they were making straight for home across the sea, <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> demanding to have my sister Polyxena offered at his tomb, and to receive his reward. And he will obtain this prize, nor will they that are his friends refuse the gift; and on this very day fate is leading my sister to her doom. <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> So will my mother see two children dead at once, me and that ill-fated maid. For I, to win a grave, ah me! will appear among the rippling waves before her servant-maid's feet. Yes! I have begged this from the powers below, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> to find a tomb and fall into my mother's hands. So shall I have my heart's desire; but now I will get out of the way of aged Hecuba, for here she passes on her way from the shelter of Agamemnon's tent, terrified at my spectre. <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> Alas! O mother, from a palace to face a life of slavery, how sad your lot, as sad as once it was blessed! Some god is now destroying you, setting this in the balance to outweigh your former bliss.

<stage>The Ghost vanishes. Hecuba enters from the tent of Agamemnon, supported by her attendants, captive Trojan women.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Guide these aged steps, my servants, forth before the house; <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> guide and support your fellow-slave, once your queen, you maids of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Grasp my aged hand, take me, support me, guide me, lift me up; <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> and I will lean upon your bent arm as on a staff and quicken my halting footsteps onwards.</p>
<p>O dazzling light of Zeus! O gloom of night! why am I thus scared by <milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/> fearful visions of the night? O lady Earth, mother of dreams that fly on sable wings! I am seeking to avert the vision of the night, the sight of horror which I learned from my dreams <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> about my son, who is safe in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, and Polyxena, my dear daughter. You gods of this land! preserve my son, <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> the last and only anchor of my house, now settled in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, the land of snow, safe in the keeping of his father's friend. Some fresh disaster is in store, a new strain of sorrow will be added to our woe. <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> Such ceaseless thrills of terror never wrung my heart before. Oh! where, you Trojan maidens, can I find inspired Helenus or Cassandra, that they may read me my dream? <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> For I saw a dappled deer mangled by a wolf's bloody fangs, torn from my knees by force, piteously. And this too filled me with fear; over the summit of his tomb appeared Achilles' phantom, and for his prize <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> he would have one of the luckless maids of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Therefore, I implore you, divine powers, avert this horror from my daughter, from my child.</p></sp></div1>

<stage>The Chorus of captive Trojan women enters.</stage>
<sp n="Chorus">
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Hecuba, I have hastened away to you, leaving my master's tent, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> where the lot assigned &lsqb;and appointed&rsqb; me as his slave, when I was driven from the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, hunted by Achaeans at the point of the spear; no alleviation do I bring for your sufferings; <milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> no, I have laden myself with heavy news, and am a herald of sorrow to you, lady. It is said the Achaeans have determined in full assembly to offer your daughter in sacrifice to Achilles; for you know how one day he appeared <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> standing on his tomb in golden armor, and stayed the sea-borne ships, though they had their sails already hoisted, with this pealing cry: &ldquo;Where away so fast, you Danaids, leaving my tomb <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> without its prize?&rdquo; A violent dispute with stormy altercation arose, and opinion was divided in the warrior army of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, some being in favor of offering the sacrifice at the tomb, others dissenting. <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> There was Agamemnon, all eagerness in your interest, because of his love for the frenzied prophetess; but the two sons of Theseus, scions of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, though supporting different proposals, yet agreed on the same decision, which was to crown Achilles' tomb with fresh blood; <milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/> for they said they never would set Cassandra's bed before Achilles' valor.</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="130">
<sp><p>Now the zeal of the rival disputants was <milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/> almost equal, until that shifty, smooth-mouthed liar, the son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, whose tongue is always at the service of the mob, persuaded the army not to put aside the best of all the Danaids <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/> for want of a servant-maid's sacrifice, nor have it said by any of the dead that stand beside Persephone that the Danaids have left the plains of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> without gratitude <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> for their companions who died for <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. Odysseus will be here in an instant, to drag the tender maiden from your breast and tear her from your aged arms. Go to the temples, go to the altars, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> at Agamemnon's knees sit as a suppliant! Invoke the gods, both those in heaven and those beneath the earth. For either your prayers will avail to spare you the loss of your unhappy child, <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> or you must see your daughter fall before the tomb, her crimson blood spurting in deep dark jets from her neck encircled with gold.

<stage>Odysseus enters with his attendants.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Lady, I think you know already the intention of the army, and the vote that has been passed; still I will declare it. <milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/> It is the Achaeans' will to sacrifice your daughter Polyxena at the mound heaped over Achilles' grave; and they appoint me to take the maid and bring her there, while the son of Achilles is chosen to preside over the sacrifice and act as priest. <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/> Do you know then what to do? Do not be forcibly torn from her, nor match your might against mine; recognize the limits of your strength, and the presence of your troubles. Even in adversity it is wise to yield to reason's dictates.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Alas! a dreadful trial is near, it seems, <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/> full of mourning, rich in tears. Yes, I too escaped death where death had been my due, and Zeus did not destroy me but is still preserving my life, that I may witness in my misery fresh sorrows surpassing all before. But if the bond may ask the free <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/> of things that do not grieve them or wrench their heart-strings, you ought to speak in answer to my questions and I ought to hear what you have to say.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Granted; put your questions; I do not grudge you that delay.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Do you know when you came to spy on <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/> disguised in rags and tatters, while down your cheek ran drops of blood?</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>I do; for it was no slight impression it made upon my heart.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Are not you then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, after the kind treatment you by your own confession received from me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill you can? A thankless race! all you who covet honor from the mob <milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/> for your oratory. Oh that you were unknown to me! you who harm your friends and think no more of it, if you can say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote? <milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/> Was it duty that led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of oxen is more fitting? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? No! she at least never injured him. <milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/> He should have demanded Helen as a victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; or if some captive of surpassing beauty was to be singled out for death, this did not point to us; for the daughter of Tyndareus was fairest of all, <milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/> and her injury to him was proved no less than ours. Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument. Now hear the recompense due from you to me at my request. On your own confession, you fell at my feet and embraced my hand and aged cheek; <milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/> I in my turn now do the same to you, and claim the favor then bestowed; and I implore you, do not tear my child from my arms or slay her; there are dead enough. In her I take delight and forget my sorrows; <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/> she is my comfort in place of many a loss, my city and my nurse, my staff and journey's guide. It is not right that those in power should use it out of season, or, when prosperous, suppose they will be always so. For I also was prosperous once, but now my life is lived, <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> and one day robbed me of all my bliss. Friend, by your beard, have some regard and pity for me; go to <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>'s army, and talk them over, saying how hateful a thing it is to slay women whom at first you spared out of pity, <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> after dragging them from the altars. For among you the same law holds good for slave and free alike respecting bloodshed; such a reputation as yours will persuade them even though its words are weak; for the same argument, when proceeding from those of no account, <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> has not the same force as when it is uttered by men of mark.</p></sp>

<p>O Hecuba, be schooled by me, and do not in your angry mood <milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> count him a foe who speaks wisely. Your life I am prepared to save, for the service I received; I do not say otherwise. But what I said to all, I will not now deny, that after <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s capture I would give your daughter to the chief man of our army <milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/> because he asked a victim. For here is a source of weakness to many states, whenever a man of brave and generous soul receives no greater honor than his inferiors. Now Achilles, lady, deserves honor at our hands, <milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/> since on behalf of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> the man died most nobly. Is not this a foul reproach to treat him as a friend in life, but, when he is gone from us, to treat him so no more? Enough! what will they say, if once more there comes a gathering of the army and a contest with the foe? <milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/> &ldquo;Shall we fight or nurse our lives, seeing the dead have no honors?&rdquo; For myself, indeed, when alive, if my daily store were scant, yet it would be all-sufficient, but my tomb I should wish <milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/> to be an object of respect, for this gratitude has long to run. You speak of cruel sufferings; hear my answer. Among us are grey old women and men no less miserable than you, and brides bereft of gallant husbands, <milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/> over whom this Trojan dust has closed. Endure these sorrows; for us, if we are wrong in resolving to honor the brave, we shall bring upon ourselves a charge of ignorance; but as for you barbarians, do not regard your friends as such and pay no homage to your gallant dead, <milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/> so that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> may prosper and you may reap the fruits of such policy.</p></sp>

<p>Odysseus, I see you hiding your right hand beneath your robe and turning away your face, so that I may not touch your beard. <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/> Take heart; you are safe from the suppliant's god in my case, for I will follow you, both because I must and because it is my wish to die; for if I were unwilling, a coward would I show myself, a woman faint of heart. Why should I prolong my days? I whose father was lord <milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/> of all the Phrygians, my chiefest pride in life. Then I was nursed on fair hopes to be a bride for kings, the center of keen jealousy among suitors, to see whose home I would make my own; and over each lady of Ida I was queen; <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> ah me! admired among maidens, equal to a goddess, save for death alone, but now I am a slave! That name first makes me long for death, so strange it sounds; and then perhaps my lot might give me <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/> to some savage master, one that would buy me for money&mdash;me the sister of Hector and many others&mdash;who would make me knead him bread within his halls, or sweep his house or set me working at the loom, leading a life of misery; <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/> while some slave, bought I know not where, will taint my bed, once deemed worthy of royalty. No, never! Here I close my eyes upon the light, free as yet, and dedicate myself to Hades. Lead me away, Odysseus, and do your worst, <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/> for I see nothing within my reach to make me hope or expect with any confidence that I am ever again to be happy. Mother, do not seek to hinder me by word or deed, but join in my wish for death before I meet with shameful treatment undeserved. <milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/> For whoever is not used to taste of sorrows, though he bears it, yet it galls him when he puts his neck within the yoke; far happier would he be dead than alive, for life bereft of honor is toil and trouble.</p></sp>

<p>Lady, you wish me to have a double benefit of tears in pity for your child; for now too as I tell the sad tale <milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/> my eyes will be wet, as they were at the tomb when she was dying. All <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>'s army was gathered there in full array before the tomb to see your daughter sacrificed; and the son of Achilles took Polyxena by the hand and set her on the top of the mound, while I was near; <milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/> and a chosen band of young Achaeans followed to hold your child and prevent her struggling. Then Achilles' son took in his hands a brimming cup of gold and raised in his hand an offering to his dead father, making a sign to me <milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/> to proclaim silence throughout the Achaean army. So I stood at his side and in their midst proclaimed, &ldquo;Silence, you Achaeans! let all the people be silent! peace! be still!&rdquo; So I hushed the army. Then he spoke: &ldquo;Son of Peleus, my father, <milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/> accept the offering I pour for you to appease your spirit, strong to raise the dead; and come to drink the black blood of a pure girl, which I and the army are offering you; oh! be propitious to us; grant that we may loose our prows and the <milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/> cables of our ships, and, meeting with a prosperous voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, all come to our country.&rdquo; So he spoke; and all the army echoed his prayer. Then seizing his golden sword by the hilt he drew it from its scabbard, signing to the picked young <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> <milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/> warriors to hold the maid. But she, when she perceived it, uttered this speech: &ldquo;O Argives, who have sacked my city! of my free will I die; let no one lay hand on me; for bravely will I yield my neck. <milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/> By the gods, leave me free; so slay me, that death may find me free; for to be called a slave among the dead fills my royal heart with shame.&rdquo;</p>

<div1 type="card" n="553">
<sp><p>Then the people shouted their applause, and king Agamemnon told the young men to let go the maid. <milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/> &lsqb;So they set her free, as soon as they heard this last command from him whose might was over all.&rsqb; And she, hearing her master's words, took her robe and tore it open from the shoulder to the waist, <milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/> displaying a breast and bosom fair as a statue's; then sinking on her knee, one word she spoke more piteous than all the rest, &ldquo;Young prince, if it is my breast you are eager to strike, see, here it is, strike home! or if at my neck your sword <milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/> you will aim, that throat is here and ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he, half glad, half sorry in his pity for the maid, cut with the steel the channels of her breath, and streams of blood gushed forth; but she, even in death, took good heed to fall with grace, <milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/> hiding from the gaze of men what must be hidden. When she had breathed her last through the fatal gash, no <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> set his hand to the same task, but some were strewing leaves over the corpse in handfuls, others bringing pine-logs <milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/> and heaping up a pyre; and the one who brought nothing would hear from him who did such taunts as these, &ldquo;Do you stand still, ignoble wretch, with no robe or ornament to bring for the maiden? will you give nothing to her that showed such peerless bravery <milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line"/> and spirit?&rdquo; Such is the tale I tell about your daughter's death, and regard you as blessed beyond all mothers in your noble child, yet crossed in fortune more than all.</p></sp>

And now I can not efface from my mind the memory of your sufferings <milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line"/> sufficiently to stay my tears; yet the story of your noble death has taken from the keenness of my grief. Is it not then strange that a poor land, when blessed by heaven with a lucky year, yields a good crop, while that which is good, if robbed of needful care, <milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line"/> bears little fruit; yet among men the base is nothing else but wicked, the good man is good, never changing for the worse because of misfortune, but ever the same? Is then the difference due to birth or bringing up? <milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line"/> Good training doubtless gives lessons in good conduct, and if a man has mastered this, he knows what is shameful by the standard of the good.

And so I have come to send you from here; for our part there is well performed&mdash;if here there is any place for &ldquo;well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><stage>He sees the body.</stage>
Oh! what man is this I see near the tents, some Trojan's corpse? It is not an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>'s body; <milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line"/> that the garments it is clad in tell me.</p></sp>

<p>Not that; give me vengeance on the wicked, and I am willing to lead a life of slavery forever.</p></sp>

And receiving my consideration, he slew my son, and bent though he was on murder, did not think it right to bury him, but cast his body forth to sea.</p>
<p>I may be a slave and weak as well, but the gods are strong, and Custom too which prevails over them, <milestone ed="p" n="800" unit="line"/> for by custom it is that we believe in them and set up boundaries of right and wrong for our lives. Now if this principle, when referred to you, is to be set at nothing, and they are to escape punishment who murder guests or dare to plunder the temples of gods, <milestone ed="p" n="805" unit="line"/> then all fairness in human matters is at an end. Consider this then a disgrace and show regard for me, have pity on me, and, like an artist standing back from his picture, look on me and closely scan my piteous state. I was once a queen, but now I am your slave; <milestone ed="p" n="810" unit="line"/> a happy mother once, but now childless and old alike, bereft of city, utterly forlorn, the most wretched woman living.</p>

<p>Hearing a cry I have come here; for Echo, <milestone ed="p" n="1110" unit="line"/> child of the mountain-rock, has sent her voice loud-ringing through the army, causing a tumult.

<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Hold! banish that savage spirit from your heart <milestone ed="p" n="1130" unit="line"/> and plead your cause, so that after hearing you and her in turn I may fairly decide what reason there is for your present sufferings.</p></sp>
<sp n="Polymestor">
<speaker>Polymestor</speaker>
<p>I will tell my tale. There was a son of Priam, Polydorus, the youngest, a child by Hecuba, whom his father Priam sent to me from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to bring up in my halls, <milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/> suspecting no doubt the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. I killed him; but hear my reason for killing him, how cleverly and wisely I had thought it out. My fear was that if that child were left to be your enemy, he would repeople <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and settle it afresh; <milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/> and the Achaeans, knowing that a son of Priam survived, might bring another expedition against the Phrygian land, and then harry and lay waste these plains of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, for the neighbours of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> to experience the very troubles we were lately suffering, O king.</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1145">
<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="1145" unit="line"/> Now Hecuba, having discovered the death of her son, brought me here on the following pretext, saying she would tell me of hidden treasure stored up in <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> by the race of Priam; and she led me apart with my children into the tent, that no other might hear her news. <milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/> So I sat down on a couch in their midst to rest; for there were many of the Trojan maidens seated there, some on my right hand, some on my left, as if beside a friend; and they were praising the weaving of our Edonian handiwork, looking at this robe as they held it up to the light; <milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/> while others examined my Thracian spear and so stripped me of two-fold protection. And those that were young mothers were dandling my children in their arms, with loud admiration, as they passed them on from hand to hand to remove them far from their father; <milestone ed="p" n="1160" unit="line"/> and then after their smooth speeches&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;in an instant snatching daggers from somewhere in their dress they stab my children; while others, like foes, seized me hand and foot; <milestone ed="p" n="1165" unit="line"/> and if I tried to raise my head, anxious to help my children, they would clutch me by the hair; while if I stirred my hands, I could do nothing, poor wretch! for the numbers of the women. At last they did a fearful deed, worse than what had gone before; for they took their brooches <milestone ed="p" n="1170" unit="line"/> and stabbed the hapless pupils of my eyes, making them gush with blood, and then fled through the chambers; up I sprang like a wild beast in pursuit of the shameless murderesses, searching along each wall with hunter's care, <milestone ed="p" n="1175" unit="line"/> dealing buffets, spreading ruin. This then is what I have suffered because of my zeal for you, Agamemnon, for slaying an enemy of yours. But to spare you a lengthy speech, if any of the men of former times have spoken ill of women, if any does so now, or shall do so hereafter, <milestone ed="p" n="1180" unit="line"/> I will say all this in one short sentence; for neither land or sea produces such a race, as whoever has had to do with them knows.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>Curb your bold tongue, and do not, because of your own woes, thus embrace the whole race of women in one reproach. <milestone ed="p" n="1185" unit="line"/> &lsqb;For though some of us, and those a numerous class, deserve to be disliked, there are others among us who rank naturally among the good.&rsqb;</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1187">
<sp n="Hecuba">
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. No! if a man's deeds were good, so should his words have been; <milestone ed="p" n="1190" unit="line"/> if, on the other hand, evil, his words should have been unsound, instead of its being possible at times to speak injustice well. There are, it is true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; no one ever yet escaped.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1195" unit="line"/> This part of my prelude belongs to you. Now will I turn to this fellow, and will give you your answer, you who say it was to save <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName> double toil and for Agamemnon's sake that you killed my son. No, villain, in the first place <milestone ed="p" n="1200" unit="line"/> the barbarian race would never be friends with <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, nor could it be. Again, what interest did you have to further by your zeal? was it to form some marriage, or on the score of kinship, or what reason? or was it likely that they would sail here again and destroy <milestone ed="p" n="1205" unit="line"/> your country's crops? Whom do you expect to persuade into believing that? If you would only speak the truth, it was the gold that slew my son, and your greedy spirit. Now tell me this: why, when <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was victorious, when her ramparts still stood round her, <milestone ed="p" n="1210" unit="line"/> when Priam was alive, and Hector's warring prospered, why did you not then, if you were really minded to do Agamemnon a service, slay the child, for you had him in your palace beneath your care, or bring him with you alive to the Argives? But when the enemy took us from the light <milestone ed="p" n="1215" unit="line"/> and our city made a signal by its smoke, you murdered the guest who had come to your hearth.</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1217">
<sp><p>Furthermore, to prove your villainy, hear this; if you were really a friend to those Achaeans, you should have brought the gold, which you say you are keeping not for yourself but for this man, <milestone ed="p" n="1220" unit="line"/> and given it to them, for they were in need and had endured a long exile from their native land. But not even now can you bring yourself to part with it, but persist in keeping it in your palace. Again, had you kept my son safe and sound, as your duty was, <milestone ed="p" n="1225" unit="line"/> a fair renown would have been your reward, for it is in trouble's hour that the good most clearly show their friendship; though prosperity by itself in every case finds friends. If you were in need of money and he were prosperous, that son of mine would have been as a mighty treasure for you to draw upon; <milestone ed="p" n="1230" unit="line"/> but now you have him no longer to be your friend, and the benefit of the gold is gone from you, your children too, and you yourself are in this sorry plight. I say to you, Agamemnon, if you help this man, you will show your worthlessness; for you will be serving a guest-friend neither pious nor to be trusted where he should be, <milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/> not devout, not just; while I shall say you delight in evil-doers, being such a one yourself; but I do not abuse my masters.</p></sp>

<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1240" unit="line"/> To be judge in a stranger's troubles goes much against my grain, but still I must; yes, for to take this matter in hand and then put it from me is a shameful course. My opinion, that you may know it, is that it was not for the sake of the Achaeans or me that you killed your guest, <milestone ed="p" n="1245" unit="line"/> but to keep that gold in your own house. In your trouble you make a case in your own interests. Perhaps among you it is a light thing to murder guests, but with us in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> it is a disgrace. How can I escape reproach if I judge you not guilty? <milestone ed="p" n="1250" unit="line"/> I could not. No, since you endured your horrid crime, endure as well its painful consequence.</p></sp></div1>
