<stage>At the entrance of Heracles' house in Thebes, before the altar of Zeus.</stage> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1">What mortal has not heard of the one who shared a wife with Zeus, Amphitryon of Argos, whom once Alcaeus, son of Perseus, begot, Amphitryon the father of Heracles? Who lived here in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, where from the sowing </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="5">of the dragon's teeth grew up a crop of earth-born giants; and of these Ares saved a scanty band, and their children's children people the city of Cadmus. Hence sprung Creon, son of Menoeceus, king of this land; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="10">and Creon became the father of this lady Megara, whom once all Cadmus' race escorted with the glad music of lutes at her wedding, when the famous Heracles led her to my halls. Now he, my son, left <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> where I was settled, left his wife Megara and her kin, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="15">eager to make his home in <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, in that walled town which the Cyclopes built, from which I am exiled for the slaying of Electryon; so he, wishing to lighten my affliction and to find a home in his own land, offered Eurystheus a mighty price for my recall: </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="20">to free the world of savage monsters, whether it was that Hera goaded him to submit to this, or that fate was leagued against him. Other toils he has accomplished, and last of all has he passed through the mouth of Taenarus into the halls of Hades to drag to the light </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="25">that hound with three bodies, and from there he has never returned. Now there is an ancient legend among the race of Cadmus that a certain Lycus in days gone by was husband to Dirce, and he was king of this city with its seven towers, before Amphion and Zethus, sons of Zeus, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="30">lords of the milk-white steeds, became rulers in the land. His son, called by the same name as his father, although no Theban but a stranger from <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, slew Creon, and after that seized the government, having fallen on this city when weakened by dissension. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="35">So this family connection with Creon is likely to prove to us a serious evil; for now that my son is in the bowels of the earth, this new monarch Lycus is bent on extirpating the children of Heracles, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="40">to quench one bloody feud with another, likewise his wife and me, if useless age like mine is to rank among men, that the boys may never grow up to exact a blood-penalty of their uncle's family. So I, left here by my son, while he is gone into the pitchy darkness of the earth, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="45">to tend and guard his children in his house, am taking my place with their mother, that the race of Heracles may not perish, here at the altar of Zeus the Savior, which my own gallant child set up </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="50">to commemorate his glorious victory over the Minyae. And here we are careful to keep our station, though in need of everything, of food, drink and clothes, huddled together on the hard bare ground; for we are barred out from our house and sit here for want of any other safety. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="55">As for friends, some I see are unreliable; while others, who are staunch, have no power to help us further. This is what misfortune means to man; may it never fall to the lot of any who bears the least goodwill to me, to apply this never-failing test of friendship! </l></sp> 

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="60"/>  

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="60">Old warrior, who once razed the citadel of the Taphians leading on the troops of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to glory, how uncertain are the gods' dealings with man! I, for instance, as far as concerned my father, was never an outcast of fortune, for he was once accounted a man of might by reason of his wealth, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="65">possessed as he was of royal power, for which long spears are launched at the lives of the fortunate through love of it; children too he had; and he gave me to your son, matching me in glorious marriage with Heracles. And now all that is dead and gone from us; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="70">and I and you, old friend, are doomed to die, and these children of Heracles, whom I am guarding beneath my wing as a bird keeps her tender chicks under her. And they one after another keep asking me: <q type="spoken">Mother, tell us, where is our father gone from the land?</q> </l>
    <l resp="perseus" n="75"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">what is he doing? when will he return?</q> Thus they inquire for their father, in childish perplexity; while I put them off with excuses, inventing stories; but still I wonder if it is he whenever a door creaks on its hinges, and up they all start, thinking to embrace their father's knees. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="80">What hope or way of salvation are you now devising, old friend? for I look to you. We can never steal beyond the boundaries of the land unseen, for there is too strict a watch set on us at every outlet, nor have we any longer hopes of safety </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="85">in our friends. Whatever your scheme is, declare it, lest our death be made ready.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="88">It is by no means easy, my daughter, to give one's earnest advice on such matters off hand, without weary thought; but let us prolong the time, since we are powerless to escape.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="90">Do you need a further taste of grief, or do you cling so fast to life?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="91">Yes, I love this life, and cling to its hopes.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="92">So do I; but you should not expect the unexpected, old friend.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="93">In these delays the only cure for our evils is left.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="94">It is the biting pain of that interval I feel so.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="95">Daughter, there may yet be a happy escape from present troubles for me and you; my son, your husband, may yet arrive. So calm yourself, and wipe those tears from your children's eyes, and soothe them with soft words, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="100">inventing a tale to delude then, piteous though such fraud be. Yes, for even men's misfortunes often flag, and the stormy wind does not always blow so strong, nor are the prosperous ever so; for all things change, making way for each other. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="105">The bravest man is he who relies ever on his hopes, but despair is the mark of a coward.</l></sp> </div>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="107">To the sheltering roof, to the old man's couch, leaning on my staff have I set forth, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="110">chanting a plaintive dirge like some bird grown grey, I that am only a voice and a fancy bred of the visions of sleep by night, palsied with age, yet meaning kindly. All hail! you orphaned children! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="115">all hail, old friend! you too, unhappy mother, wailing for your husband in the halls of Hades!</l></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="119">Do not faint too soon upon your way, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="120">or let your limbs grow weary, as a colt beneath the yoke grows weary as he mounts some stony hill, dragging the weight of a wheeled chariot. Take hold of hand or robe, who ever feels his footsteps falter. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="125">Old friend, escort another like yourself, who once amid his toiling peers in the days of our youth would take his place beside you, no blot upon his country's glorious record.</l></sp></div>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="138">But I see Lycus, the ruler of this land, drawing near the house.</l></sp> 


<sp><speaker>Lycus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="140">One question, if I may, to this father of Heracles and his wife; and certainly as your lord and master I have a right to put what questions I choose. How long do you seek to prolong your lives? What hope, what aid do you see to save you from death? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="145">Do you trust that these children's father, who lies dead in the halls of Hades, will return? How unworthily you show your sorrow at having to die, you <stage>to Amphitryon</stage> after your idle boasts, scattered broadcast through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, that Zeus was partner in your marriage-bed and was your partner in children; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="150">and you, <stage>to Megara</stage> after calling yourself the wife of so peerless a lord.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="151" rend="indent">After all, what was the fine exploit your husband achieved, if he <emph>did</emph> kill a water-snake in a marsh or that monster of <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>? which he caught in a snare, for all he says he strangled it to death in his arms. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="155">Are these your weapons for the hard struggle? Is it for this then that Heracles' children should be spared? A man who has won a reputation for valor in his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="160">who never buckled shield to arm nor faced the spear, but with a bow, that coward's weapon, was ever ready to run away. Archery is no test of manly bravery; no! he is a man who keeps his post in the ranks and steadily faces the swift wound the spear may plough. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="165">My policy, again, old man, shows no reckless cruelty, but caution; for I am well aware I slew Creon, the father of this woman, and am in possession of his throne. So I have no wish that these children should grow up and be left to take vengeance on me in requital for what I have done.</l></sp> 

<milestone ed="perseus" unit="card" n="170"/>  

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="170">Let Zeus defend his his own share in his son; but as for me, Heracles, it is my concern on your behalf to prove by what I say this tyrant's ignorance; for I cannot allow you to be ill spoken of. First then for that which should never have been said—for to speak </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="175">of you, Heracles, as a coward is, I think, outside the pale of speech—of that must I clear you with heaven to witness. I appeal then to the thunder of Zeus, and the chariot in which he rode, when he pierced the Giants, earth's brood, to the heart with his winged shafts, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="180">and with gods uplifted the glorious triumph song; or go to Pholoe and ask the insolent tribe of four-legged Centaurs, you craven king, ask them who they would judge the bravest of men; will they not say my son, who according to you is but a pretender? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="185">Were you to ask Euboean Dirphys, your native place, it would not sing your praise, for you have never done a single gallant deed to which your country can witness. Next you disparage that clever invention, an archer's weapon; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="190">come, listen to me and learn wisdom. A man who fights in line is a slave to his weapons, and if his fellow-comrades want for courage he is slain himself through the cowardice of his neighbors, or, if he breaks his spear, he cannot defend his body from death, having only one means of defence; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="195">whereas all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they have but one weapon, yet is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless arrows, still has others with which to defend himself from death, and standing at a distance keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness with invisible shafts, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="200">and never exposing himself to the foe, but keeping under cover; and this is by far the wisest course in battle, to harm the enemy and keep safe oneself, independent of chance. These arguments completely contradict yours </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="205">with regard to the matter at issue. Next, why are you desirous of slaying these children? What have they done to you? One piece of wisdom I credit you with, your coward terror of a brave man's descendants. Still it is hard on us, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="210">if for your cowardice we must die; a fate that ought to have overtaken you at our braver hands, if Zeus had been fairly disposed towards us. But, if you are so anxious to make yourself supreme in the land, let us go into exile; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="215">abstain from all violence, else you will suffer by it whenever the god causes fortune's breeze to veer round. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="217" rend="indent">Ah! you land of Cadmus—for to you too will I turn, distributing my words of reproach—is this your defense of Heracles and his children? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="220">the man who faced alone all the Minyans in battle and allowed <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to see the light with free eyes. I cannot praise <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, nor will I ever keep silence, finding her so craven as regards my son; she should have come with fire and sword and warrior's arms </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="225">to help these tender chicks, to requite him for all his labors in purging land and sea. Such help, my children, neither <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> nor the city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> affords you; to me a feeble friend you look, and I am empty sound and nothing more. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="230">For the vigor which once I had, has gone from me; my limbs are palsied with age, and my strength is decayed. If I were young and still powerful in body, I would have seized my spear and dabbled those flaxen locks of his with blood, so that the coward would now </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="235">be flying from my spear beyond the bounds of Atlas.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="236">Have not the brave among mankind a fair occasion for speech, although slow to begin?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Lycus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="238">Say what you will of me in your exalted phrase, but I by deeds will make you rue those words. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="240"><stage>Calling to his servants</stage> Go, some to Helicon, others to the glens of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, and bid woodmen to cut me logs of oak, and when they are brought to the town, pile up a stack of wood all round the altar on either side, and set fire to it and burn them </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="245">all alive, that they may learn that the dead no longer rules this land, but that for the present I am king. <stage>Angrily to the Chorus</stage> As for you, old men, since you thwart my views, not for the children of Heracles alone shall you lament, but likewise for your own </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="250">misfortunes, and you shall never forget you are slaves and I your prince.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="252">—You sons of Earth, whom Ares once sowed, when from the dragon's ravening jaw he had torn the teeth, up with your staves, on which you lean your hands, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="255">and dash out this villain's brains! a fellow who, without even being a Theban, but a foreigner, lords it shamefully over the younger men; but my master shall you never be to your joy.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="259">—Nor shall you reap the harvest of all my toil; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="260">Go back to where you came from, in your insolence. For never while I live, shall you slay these sons of Heracles; not so deep beneath the earth has their father disappeared from his children's ken.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="264">—You are in possession of this land which you have ruined, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="265">while he, its benefactor, has missed his just reward.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="266">—And yet do I take too much upon myself because I help those I love after their death, when most they need a friend?</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="268">—Ah! right hand, how you desire to wield the spear, but your weakness is a death-blow to your desire. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="270">For then I would have stopped you calling me slave, and I would have governed <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with credit. In which you now rejoice; for a city sick with dissension and evil counsels does not think aright; otherwise it would never have accepted you as its master.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="275">Old men, I thank you; it is right that friends should feel virtuous indignation on behalf of those they love; but do not on our account vent your anger on the tyrant to your own undoing. Hear my advice, Amphitryon, if there appears to you to be anything in what I say. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="280">I love my children; strange if I did not love those whom I bore, whom I labored for! Death I count a dreadful fate; but the man who strives against necessity I esteem a fool. Since we must die, let us do so </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="285">without being burnt alive, a source of mockery to our enemies, which to my mind is an evil worse than death; for much good do we owe our family. You have always had a warrior's fair fame, so it is not to be endured that you should die a coward's death; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="290">and my husband's reputation needs no one to witness that he would never consent to save these children's lives by letting them incur the stain of cowardice; for the noble are afflicted by disgrace on account of their children, nor must I shrink from following my lord's example. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="295">As to your hopes consider how I weigh them. Do you think your son will return from beneath the earth? And who ever has come back from the dead out of the halls of Hades? But would you soften this man by entreaty? Oh no! better to fly from one's enemy when he is so brutish, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="300">but yield to men of breeding and culture; for you would more easily conclude a friendly truce by accepting regard. True, a thought has already occurred to me that we might by entreaty obtain a sentence of exile for the children; yet this too is misery, to compass their deliverance with dire penury as the result; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="305">for it is a saying that hosts look sweetly on banished friends for a day and no more. Endure to die with us, for that awaits you after all. By your brave soul I challenge you, old friend; for whoever struggles hard to escape destiny sent by the gods </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="310">shows zeal no doubt, but it is zeal with a taint of folly; for what must be, no one will ever avail to alter.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="312">If a man had insulted you, while yet my arms were strong, there would have been an easy way to stop him; but now am I am nothing ; and so you henceforth, Amphitryon, </l>

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="316">It is not cowardice or any longing for life that hinders my dying, but my wish to save my son's children, though no doubt I am longing for the impossible. See! here is my neck ready for the sword </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="320">to pierce, to hack, to hurl from the rock; only one favor I crave for both of us, king; slay me and this hapless mother before you slay the children, that we may not see the hideous sight, as they gasp out their lives, calling on their mother </l>

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Megara</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="451">Come now, who is to sacrifice or butcher these poor children? [or rob me of my wretched life?] These victims are ready to be led to Hades' halls. O my children! an ill-matched company are we hurried off to die, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="455">old men and young ones and mothers, all together. Alas! for my sad fate and my children's, whom these eyes now for the last time behold. So I gave you birth and reared you only for our foes to mock, to jeer at, and slay. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="460">Ah me! how bitterly my hopes have disappointed me in the expectation I once formed from the words of your father.  <stage>Addressing each of her three sons in turn.</stage> To <emph>you</emph> your dead father was for giving <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>; and you were to dwell in the halls of Eurystheus, lording it over the fair fruitful land of <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="465">and over your head would he throw that lion's skin with which he himself was armed.

<l resp="perseus" n="490">O my dearest Heracles, to you I call, if perhaps mortal voice can make itself heard in Hades' halls; your father and children are dying, and I am doomed, I who once because of you was counted blessed as men count bliss.

<l resp="perseus" n="505">without a thought of sorrow from morning until night; for time takes little heed of preserving our hopes; and, when he has busied himself on his own business, away he flies.

<l resp="perseus" n="510">has robbed me of it as of a feather that floats away toward the sky. I know not any whose plenteous wealth and high reputation is fixed and sure; fare you well, for now you have seen the last of your old friend, my comrades.</l></sp>

<l resp="perseus" n="930">he stopped without a word. And as their father lingered, his children looked at him; he was no longer himself; his eyes were rolling; he was quite distraught; his eyeballs were bloodshot, and foam was oozing down his bearded cheek. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="935">He spoke with a madman's laugh: <q type="spoken">Father, why should I offer the purifying flame before I have slain Eurystheus, and have the toil twice over?

<l resp="perseus" n="950">A twofold feeling filled his servants' breasts, amusement and fear at once; and one looking to his neighbor said: <q type="spoken">Is our master making sport for us, or is he mad?</q> But he was pacing to and fro in his house; and, rushing into the men's chamber, he said he had reached the city of Nisus; </l>

<l resp="perseus" n="965"><q type="spoken">My son, what do you mean by this? What strange doings are these? Can it be that the blood of your late victims has driven you frantic?</q> But he, supposing it was the father of Eurystheus striving in abject supplication to touch his hand: thrust him aside, and then against his own children aimed his bow </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="970">and made ready his quiver, thinking to slay the sons of Eurystheus. And they in wild fright darted here and there, one to his hapless mother's skirts, another to the shadow of a pillar, while a third cowered beneath the altar like a bird. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="975">Then cried their mother: <q type="spoken">O you who begot them, what are you doing? do you mean to slay your children?</q> Likewise his aged father and all the gathered servants cried aloud. But he, hunting the child round and round the column, in dreadful circles, and coming face to face with him shot him to the heart; and he fell upon his back, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="980">sprinkling the stone pillars with blood as he gasped out his life. Then Heracles shouted in triumph and boasted loud: <q type="spoken">Here lies one of Eurystheus' brood dead at my feet, atoning for his father's hatred.</q> Then he aimed his bow against a second, who had crouched </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="985">at the altar's foot thinking to escape unseen. But before he fired, the poor child threw himself at his father's knees, and, flinging his hand to reach his beard or neck, cried: <q type="spoken">Oh! hear me, dearest father, do not kill me! I am your child, your own; it is no son of Eurystheus you will slay.</q></l>

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1255">Hear me a moment, that I may enter the contest with arguments in answer to your admonitions; and I will unfold to you why life now as well as formerly has been unbearable to me. First I am the son of a man who incurred the guilt of blood, before he married my mother Alcmena, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1260">by slaying her aged father. Now when the foundation is badly laid at birth, it is necessary for the race to be cursed with woe; and Zeus, whoever this Zeus may be, begot me as an enemy to Hera; yet do not be vexed, old man; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1265">for you rather than Zeus I regard as my father. Then while I was being suckled, that bedfellow of Zeus foisted into my cradle fearsome snakes to cause my death. After I took on a cloak of youthful flesh, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1270">of all the toils I then endured what need to tell? what did I not destroy, whether lions, or triple-bodied Typhons, or giants or the battle against the hosts of four-legged Centaurs? or how when I had killed the hydra, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1275">that monster with a ring of heads with power to grow again, I passed through a herd of countless other toils besides and came to the dead to fetch to the light at the bidding of Eurystheus the three-headed hound, hell's porter. Last, ah, woe is me! I have dared this labor, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1280">to crown the sorrows of my house with my children's murder. I have come to this point of necessity; no longer may I dwell in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the city that I love; for suppose I stay, to what temple or gathering of friends shall I go? For mine is no curse that invites greetings. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1285">Shall I go to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>? how can I, when I am an exile from my country? Well, is there a single other city I can rush to? Am I then to be looked at askance as a marked man, held by cruel stabbing tongues: <q type="spoken">Is not this the son of Zeus that once murdered children</q> </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1290"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">and wife? Plague take him from the land!</q></l> 
<l resp="perseus" n="1291" rend="indent">Now to one who was once called happy, such changes are a grievous thing; though he who is always unfortunate feels no such pain, for sorrow is his birthright. This, I think, is the piteous pass I shall one day come to; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1295">for earth will cry out forbidding me to touch her, the sea and the river-springs will refuse me a crossing, and I shall become like Ixion who revolves in chains upon that wheel. And so this is best, that I should be seen by no one of the Hellenes, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1300">among whom in happier days I lived in bliss. What right have I to live? what profit can I have in the possession of a useless, impious life? So let that noble wife of Zeus dance, beating her foot in its shoe; </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1305">for now has she worked her heart's desire in utterly confounding the first of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>' sons. Who would pray to such a goddess? Her jealousy of Zeus for his love of a woman has destroyed </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1310">the benefactors of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, guiltless though they were.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1311">This is the work of none other of the gods than the wife of Zeus; you are right in that surmise.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1313">I cannot counsel you . . . rather than to go on suffering. There is not a man alive that has wholly escaped misfortune's taint, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1315">nor any god either, if what poets sing is true. Have they not intermarried in ways that law forbids? Have they not thrown fathers into ignominious chains to gain the sovereign power? Still they inhabit <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> and brave the issue of their crimes. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1320">And yet what shall you say in your defence, if you, a child of man, take your fate excessively hard, while they, as gods, do not? No, then, leave <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> in compliance with the law, and come with me to the city of Pallas. There, when I have purified you of your pollution, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1325">I will give you homes and the half of all I have. Yes, I will give you all those presents I received from the citizens for saving their fourteen children, when I slew the bull of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>; for I have plots of land assigned me throughout the country; these shall henceforth </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1330">be called after you by men, while you live; and at your death, when you have gone to Hades' halls, the whole city of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> shall exalt your honor with sacrifices and a monument of stone. For it is a noble crown of a good reputation </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1335">for citizens to win from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, by helping a man of worth. This is the return that I will make you for saving me, for now you are in need of friends. But when the gods honor a man, he has no need of friends; for the god's aid, when he chooses to give it, is enough.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1340">No! this is quite beside the question of my troubles. For my part, I do not believe that the gods indulge in unholy unions; and as for putting bonds on hands, I have never thought that worthy of credit nor will I now be so persuaded, nor again that one god is naturally lord and master of another. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1345">For the deity, if he be really such, has no wants; these are miserable tales of the poets. But I, for all my piteous plight, reflected whether I should let myself be branded as a coward for giving up my life. For whoever does not withstand disasters </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1350">will never be able to withstand even a man's weapon. I will be steadfast in living; I will go to your city, with grateful thanks for all you offer me.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1353" rend="indent">But I have tasted of countless troubles, as is well known; never yet did I faint at any or shed a single tear; no, nor did I ever think </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1355">that I should come to this, to let the tear-drop fall. But now, it seems, I must be fortune's slave. Well, let it pass; my old father, you see me go forth to exile, and in me you see my own children's murderer. </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1360">Give them burial, and lay them out in death with the tribute of a tear, for the law forbids my doing so. Rest their heads upon their mother's bosom and fold them in her arms, sad fellowship, which I, alas! unwittingly did slay. And when you have buried these dead, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1365">live on here still, in bitterness maybe, but still constrain your soul to share my sorrows. O children! he who begot you, your own father, has been your destroyer, and you have had no profit of my triumphs, all my restless toil to win for you by force </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1370">a fair name, a glorious advantage from a father. You too, unhappy wife, this hand has slain, a poor return to make you for preserving the honor of my bed so safely, for all the weary watch you long have kept within my house. Alas for you, my wife, my sons! alas for me, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1375">how sad my lot, cut off from wife and child! Ah! these kisses, bitter-sweet! these weapons which it is pain to own! I am not sure whether to keep or let them go; dangling at my side they thus will say, </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1380"><q type="spoken">With us you destroyed children and wife; we are your children's slayers, and you keep us.</q> Shall I carry them after that? what answer can I make? Yet, am I to strip myself of these weapons, the comrades of my glorious career in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and put myself in the power of my foes, to die a death of shame? </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1385">No! I must not let them go, but keep them, though it grieves me. In one thing, Theseus, help my misery; come to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and help me to manage the conveyance of the wretched dog; lest, if I go all alone, my sorrow for my sons may do me some hurt.</l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1389" rend="indent">O land of Cadmus, and all you people of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>! </l>
<l resp="perseus" n="1390">cut off your hair, and mourn with me; go to my children's burial, and with one dirge lament us all, the dead and me; for on all of us has Hera inflicted the same cruel blow of destruction.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1394">Rise, unhappy man! you have had your fill of tears.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1395">I cannot rise; my limbs are rooted here.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1396">Yes, even the strong are overthrown by misfortunes.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1397">Ah! Would I could become a stone upon this spot, oblivious of trouble.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1398">Peace! give your hand to a friend and helper.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1399">No, let me not wipe off the blood upon your robe.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1400">Wipe it off and spare not; I will not refuse you.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1401">Bereft of my own sons, I find you as a son to me.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1402">Throw your arm about my neck; I will be your guide.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1403">A pair of friends indeed, but one a man of sorrows. Ah! aged father, this is the kind of man to make a friend.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1405">Blessed in her sons, the country that gave him birth!</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1406">Theseus, turn me back again to see my children.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1407">What for? Do you think to find a drug in this to soothe your soul?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1408">I long to do so, and would embrace my father.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1409">Here am I, my son; your wish is no less dear to me.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1410">Have you so short a memory for your troubles?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1411">All that I endured before was easier to bear than this.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1412">If anyone sees you play the woman, they will scoff.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1413">Have I by living grown so abject in your sight? It was not so once, I think.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1414">Yes, too much so; in your sickness you are not the glorious Heracles.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1415">What about you? What kind of hero were you when in trouble in the world below?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1416">I was worse than anyone as far as courage went.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1417">How then can you say of me, that I am abased by my troubles?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1418" part="I">Forward!</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Amphitryon</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1421" part="I">How?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<l resp="perseus" n="1421b" part="F">I will fetch you from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.
