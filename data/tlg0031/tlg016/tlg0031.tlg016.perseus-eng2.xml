<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure
conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night
and day
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be
filled with joy;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that
is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother
Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift
of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        For God
didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the gospel according to the
power of God,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,

                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        but
has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who
abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the
gospel.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and
a teacher of the Gentiles.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For this cause I suffer also these
things.

   Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
against that day.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        That good thing
which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in
us.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me;
of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        May the Lord grant mercy to
the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chain,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        but when he was in Rome, he sought me

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        (the Lord grant to him to find the

in Christ Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The things which you have heard from me among
many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to
teach others also.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        You therefore must endure hardship, as a good
soldier of Christ Jesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        No soldier on service entangles himself

unless he has competed by the rules.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        The farmers who labor must
be the first to get a share of the crops.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Consider what I say,
and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of
David, according to my gospel,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        in which I suffer hardship to the
point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may
obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        This saying is faithful:
For if we died with him,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        If we are faithless,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of
the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        men who have erred concerning the
truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
