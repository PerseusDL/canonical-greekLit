<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of
you in my prayers,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>

enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>

believe, according to that working of the strength of his might

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made
him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to

                        You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        in which you once walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit who
now works in the sons of disobedience;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        among whom we also all
once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and
of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he
loved us,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us
alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        and
raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        that in the ages to come he might show
the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ
Jesus;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that
not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in
them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh,
who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision,"
(in the flesh, made by hands);
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        that you were at that time
separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without
God in the world.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far
off are made near in the blood of Christ.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        For he is our peace,
who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments
contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of
the two, making peace;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        and might reconcile them both in one body
to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who
were near.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For through him we both have our access in one Spirit
to the Father.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
