                        The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus
began both to do and to teach,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        until the day in which he was
received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to
the apostles whom he had chosen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        To these he also showed himself
alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them over a
period of forty days, and spoke about God's Kingdom.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Being
assembled together with them, he charged them, "Don't depart from
Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from
me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized
in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord,
are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        He said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons
which the Father has set within His own authority.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        But you will
receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you. You will be
witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the
uttermost parts of the earth."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was
taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        While
they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men
stood by them in white clothing,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        who also said, "You men of
Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was
received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you
saw him going into the sky."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called
Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they
were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas,
Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and
Judas the son of James.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        All these with one accord continued
steadfastly in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the
mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        "Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be
fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David
concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        For he
was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and
falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed
out.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in
their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of
blood.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For it is written in the book of Psalms,
'Let his habitation be made desolate,
   Let no one dwell therein,'

   and,
'Let another take his office.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        beginning
from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us,
of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was
surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        They prayed, and said, "You,
Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you
have chosen
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        to take part in this ministry and apostleship from
which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        They
drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered
with the eleven apostles.

                        Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one
accord in one place.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Suddenly there came from the sky a sound
like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where
they were sitting.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Tongues like fire appeared and were
distributed to them, and it sat on each one of them.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        They were
all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other
languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Now
there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation
under the sky.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        When this sound was heard, the multitude came
together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in
his own language.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        They were all amazed and marveled, saying to
one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        How
do we hear, everyone in our own native language?

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Parthians,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Others, mocking, said,
"They are filled with new wine."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        But this is what has been spoken through the prophet
Joel:

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>

made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        and
called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging
there.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to
him, "Behold, three men seek you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        But arise, get down, and go
with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom
you seek. Why have you come?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one
who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was
directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to
what you say.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        So he called them in and lodged them. On the next
day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from
Joppa accompanied him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        On the next day they entered into
Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his
relatives and his near friends.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        When it happened that Peter
entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a
man."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered
together.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an
unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of
another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man
unholy or unclean.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Therefore also I came without complaint when
I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this
hour, and at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house, and behold, a man
stood before me in bright clothing,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        and said, 'Cornelius, your
prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is
surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the
seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        Therefore I sent
to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are
all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been
commanded you by God."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was
in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and
would have made a sacrifice with the multitudes.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But when the

God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        But some Jews from Antioch and
Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

down, and spoke to the women who had come together.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        A certain

worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the
things which were spoken by Paul.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl

out that very hour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Some therefore cried one thing, and some
another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>

image which fell down from Zeus?

the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd
the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>

who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the
Gentiles.'"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        They, when they heard it, glorified God.

law.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men

                        Take them, and purify yourself with
them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads.

been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the
law.

strangled things, and from sexual immorality."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself

days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of
them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is
the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law,
and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and
has defiled this holy place!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        For they had seen Trophimus, the
Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought
him into the temple.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They
seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors
were shut.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the
commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to
them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped
beating Paul.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        Then the commanding officer came near, arrested
him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was
and what he had done.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Some shouted one thing, and some another,
among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of the
noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        for the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the
commanding officer, "May I say something to you?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>

                        They listened to him until he said that, then they lifted up

                        the commanding officer commanded him to be
brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion
who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman,
and not found guilty?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding

a Roman!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Immediately those who were about to examine him departed
from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        But on the next

he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all
the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before
them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men

and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        When he had said this, an argument arose between the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        For the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        A great clamor arose,
and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended,
saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has
spoken to him, let's not fight against God!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing

down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the
barracks.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "Cheer
up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound
themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        They came to the chief priests

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Now therefore, you
with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him
down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more
exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he
came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Paul summoned

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going
aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul
tomorrow to the council, as though intending to inquire somewhat more
accurately concerning him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Therefore don't yield to them, for
more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves
under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him.
Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging
him, "Tell no one that you have told these things to me."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        He
called to himself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred
soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two
hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        Desiring to know the cause why they

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        I found him
to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to
his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        When I was told that
the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        But on the next day they

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        When the governor had

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        When he had come, the Jews who had

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

                        I, being perplexed how to

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>

Festus, Paul was brought in.

Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they
lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        As we labored
exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things
overboard.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle
with their own hands.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        When neither sun nor stars shone on us
for many days, and no small tempest pressed on us, all hope that we
would be saved was now taken away.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the
midst of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not
have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among
you, but only of the ship.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        For there stood by me this night an
angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold,
God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Therefore,
sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been
spoken to me.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        But we must run aground on a certain island."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven
back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised
that they were drawing near to some land.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        They took soundings,
and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings
again, and found fifteen fathoms.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Fearing that we would run
aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and
wished for daylight.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        As the sailors were trying to flee out of
the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they
would lay out anchors from the bow,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        Paul said to the centurion
and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be
saved."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and
let her fall off.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take
some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and
continue fasting, having taken nothing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Therefore I beg you to
take some food, for this is for your safety; for there will not a hair
perish from the head of any of you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        When he had said this, and
had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he
broke it, and began to eat.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        Then they all cheered up, and they
also took food.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        We were in all in the ship two hundred
seventy-six souls.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        When they had eaten enough, they lightened
the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        When it was day,
they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a
beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time
untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they
made for the beach.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        But coming to a place where two seas met,
they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but
the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that
none of them would swim out and escape.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        But the centurion,
desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded
that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go
to the land;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        and the rest, some on planks, and some on other
things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to
the land.

                        When we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called
Malta.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The natives shown us no common kindness; for they kindled
a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because
of the cold.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and
laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and
fastened on his hand.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        When the natives saw the creature hanging
from his hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a
murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not
allowed to live."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        However he shook off the creature into the
fire, and wasn't harmed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But they expected that he would have
swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they were long in
expectation and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their
minds, and said that he was a god.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to
the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and
courteously entertained us three days.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        It was so, that the
father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to
him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Then when
this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and
were cured.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They also honored us with many honors, and when we
sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria
which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        From
there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south
wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        where

we came to Rome.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        From there the brothers, when they heard of
us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three
Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the
captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the
soldier who guarded him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        It happened that after three days Paul called together those
who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said
to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or
the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem
into the hands of the Romans,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal
to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For this cause therefore I asked you to see and to speak with
me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea
concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or
speak any evil of you.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But we desire to hear from you what you
think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere
it is spoken against."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        When they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his
lodging in great number. He explained to them, testifying about the
Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law
of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after

Lest they should see with their eyes,
   Hear with their ears,
   Understand with their heart,
