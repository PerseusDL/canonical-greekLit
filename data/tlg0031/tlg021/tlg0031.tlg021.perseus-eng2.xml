                        Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are
living as strangers in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithynia,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        according to the foreknowledge of God the
Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ
and be sprinkled in his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        to an
incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away,
reserved in heaven for you,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        who by the power of God are guarded
through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if
need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        that the
proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes
even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise,
glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ --
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        whom not
having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet
believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory
--
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your
souls.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and
searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to
you,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of
Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings
of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        To them it
was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, did they minister
these things, which now have been announced to you through those who
preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven;
which things angels desire to look into.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set
your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ --
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        as children of obedience, not
conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your
ignorance,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves
also be holy in all of your behavior;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        because it is written,
"You shall be holy; for I am holy."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        If you call on him as
Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's
work, pass the time of your living as strangers here in reverent fear:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things,
with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your
fathers,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, the
blood of Christ;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        who was foreknown indeed before the foundation
of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the
dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the
truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one
another from the heart fervently:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        having been born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which
lives and remains forever.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        For,
"All flesh is like grass,
   And all of man's glory like the flower in the grass.
The grass withers, and its flower falls;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        But the Lord's word endures forever."

   This is the word of good news which was preached to you.</p>
                    
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                  

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit,
hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        as newborn babes,
long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        if
indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        coming to him,
a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to
be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
God through Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Because it is contained in Scripture,
"Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious:
   He who believes in him will not be put to shame."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        For you therefore who believe is the honor, but for such as
are disobedient,
"The stone which the builders rejected,
   Has become the chief cornerstone,"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        and,
"A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."

   For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they
were appointed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a
holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may show forth
the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his
marvelous light:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        who in time past were no people, but now are
God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        having good behavior
among the nations, so in that which they speak against you as
evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in
the day of visitation.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Therefore subject yourselves to every
ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and
for praise to those who do well.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For this is the will of God,
that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of
wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the
king.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear;
not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For it
is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of
conscience toward God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For what glory is it if, when you sin,
you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently
endure suffering, this is commendable with God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For to this you
were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an
example, that you should follow his steps,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        who did not sin,
"neither was deceit found in his mouth."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Who, when he was
reviled, didn't revile back. When he suffered, didn't threaten, but
committed himself to him who judges righteously;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        who his own
self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to
sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        For you were going astray like sheep; but are now returned to
the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
