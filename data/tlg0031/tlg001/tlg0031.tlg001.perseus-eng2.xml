<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                        Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
saying,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his
star in the east, and have come to worship him."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        When Herod the
king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he
asked them where the Christ would be born.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        They said to him, "In
Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        'You Bethlehem, land of Judah,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them
exactly what time the star appeared.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        He sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have
found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the
star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and
stood over where the young child was.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        They came into the
house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down
and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts:
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another
way.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,
for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        He arose and took the young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        and was there until the death of Herod;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children
who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two
years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned
from the wise men.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled, saying,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        "A voice was heard in Ramah,
   Lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children;

   Because they are no more."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        "Arise and take

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But when he heard that Archelaus was
reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to
go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee,

                        When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying,
"Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want
to. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Jesus
said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the
priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to
them."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking
him,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come
under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I
tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes;
and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who
followed, "Most assuredly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith,
not even in Israel.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        I tell you that many will come from the east

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown
out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and the gnashing of
teeth."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be
done for you as you as you have believed." His servant was healed in
that hour.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother
lying sick with a fever.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        He touched her hand, and the fever left
her. She got up and served him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        When evening came, they brought
to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>

was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He took our
infirmities, and bore our diseases."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Now when Jesus saw great
multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first
to go and bury my father."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury
their own dead."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Behold, a great tempest arose in the sea, so much that the boat was
covered with the waves, but he was asleep.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        They came to him, and
woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        He said to them, "Why are you fearful, oh you of little
faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a
great calm.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that
even the wind and the sea obey him?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        When he came to the other side, into the country of the
Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of
the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass by that way.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you,
Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to
go away into the herd of pigs."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        He said to them, "Go!"

   They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole
herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told
everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with
demons.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they
saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed,
lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son,
cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But that you may know

your house."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn,

                        Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind
him, and touched the tassels of his garment;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        for she said within

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Daughter,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        and said, "Most assuredly I tell you, unless you

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to
stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be
hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the
sea.

feet to be cast into the eternal fire.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        The lord of that

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Then he came to his

sinners.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        Now he who

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they
came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        Behold, one of

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        Or do

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        How then would the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come
out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily
in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.

                        Those who had
taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes
and the elders were gathered together.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="58"><p>
                        But Peter followed him
from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and
sat with the officers, to see the end.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="59"><p>
                        Now the chief priests,
the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus,
that they might put him to death;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="60"><p>
                        and they found none. Even
though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last
two false witnesses came forward,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="61"><p>
                        and said, "This man said, 'I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="62"><p>
                        The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no
answer? What is this that these testify against you?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="63"><p>
                        But Jesus
held his peace. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the
living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of
God."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="64"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell
you, henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="65"><p>
                        Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has
spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you
have heard his blasphemy.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="66"><p>
                        What do you think?"

   They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="67"><p>
                        Then they spit in
his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="68"><p>
                        saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="69"><p>
                        Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came
to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="70"><p>
                        But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what
you are talking about."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="71"><p>
                        When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,
and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of
Nazareth."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="72"><p>
                        Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="73"><p>
                        After a little while those who stood by came and said to
Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you
known."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="74"><p>
                        Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"

   Immediately the cock crowed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="75"><p>
                        Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three
times." He went out and wept bitterly.

                        Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the
elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to
Pontius Pilate, the governor.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Then Judas, who betrayed him, when
he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        saying,
"I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and
departed. He went away and hanged himself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        The chief priests
took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into
the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        They took
counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was
fulfilled, saying,
"They took the thirty pieces of silver,
   The price of him upon whom a price had been set,
   Whom some of the children of Israel priced,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        And they gave them for the potter's field,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

   Jesus said to him, "So you say."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he
answered nothing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how
many things they testify against you?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Now at the feast the governor was
accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        When
therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do
you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called
Christ?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For he knew that because of envy they had delivered
him up.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to
him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Now
the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for
Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        But the governor answered them,
"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"

   They said, "Barabbas!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is
called Christ?"

   They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?"

   But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather
that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this
righteous person. You see to it."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and
delivered to be crucified.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Then the governor's soldiers took
Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a
reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked
him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        They spat on him, and
took the reed and struck him on the head.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        When they had mocked
him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led
him away to crucify him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name,
and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The
place of a skull."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with
gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        When they had
crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        and they sat and watched him there.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING
OF THE JEWS."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his
right hand and one on the left.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        Those who passed by blasphemed
him, wagging their heads,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        and saying, "You who destroy the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes,

                        He trusts in God.
Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him
the same reproach.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
until the ninth hour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my
God, why have you forsaken me?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said,
"This man is calling Elijah."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        The rest said, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his
spirit.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the
top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen
asleep were raised;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        and coming out of the tombs after his

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,
when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared
exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="56"><p>
                        Among them were Mary

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="57"><p>
                        When evening had come, a rich man from

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="58"><p>
                        This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="59"><p>
