<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with
all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Grace to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        who comforts us in all
our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any
affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
by God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our
comfort also abounds through Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But if we are afflicted, it
is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your
comfort, which works in the patient enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing
that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the
comfort.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,
concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were
weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired
even of life.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death
within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who
raises the dead,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        who delivered us out of so great a death, and
does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still
deliver us;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        you also helping together on our behalf by your
supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many,
thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For our
boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and
sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we
behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even
acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        as also
you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you
also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        In this confidence,
I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second
benefit;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from
Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey
to Judea.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        When I therefore was thus determined, did I show
fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the
flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and
no."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among
you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in
him is "Yes."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For however many are the promises of God, in him
is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of
God through us.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed
us, is God;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of
the Spirit in our hearts.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But I call God for a witness to my
soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Not that we
have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your
joy. For you stand firm in faith.
                    
                </p></div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                 

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                    
                        But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you
again in sorrow.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For if I make you sorry, then who will make me
glad but he who is made sorry by me?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        And I wrote this very thing
to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom
I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be
shared by all of you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        For out of much affliction and anguish of
heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made
sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for
you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to
me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the
many;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and
comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with
his excessive sorrow.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Therefore I beg you to confirm your love
toward him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the
proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Now I also
forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven
anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of
Christ,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we
are not ignorant of his schemes.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a
door was opened to me in the Lord,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I had no relief for my
spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of
them, I went out into Macedonia.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But thanks be to God, who
always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet
aroma of his knowledge in every place.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For we are a sweet aroma
of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet
aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        For
we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity,
but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
                   

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                    
                        Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as
do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        You are our
letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        being
revealed that you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not
with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of
stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Such confidence
we have through Christ toward God;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        not that we are sufficient of
ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency
is from God;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        who also made us sufficient as servants of a new
covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills,
but the Spirit gives life.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But if the service of death, written
engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel
could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his
face; which was passing away:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        won't service of the Spirit be with
much more glory?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For if the service of condemnation has glory,
the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For
most assuredly that which has been made glorious has not been made
glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which
remains is in glory.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of
speech,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the
children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which
was passing away.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        For if in anything I

before Titus was found to be truth.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        how that in
much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep
poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For according

their own accord,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        begging us with much entreaty in regard to this

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        This was

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        So we urged Titus, that as he

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge,

this grace.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        I give a judgment in this: for this

to do, but also to be willing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For if the readiness is

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>

of greediness.

parents for the children.
