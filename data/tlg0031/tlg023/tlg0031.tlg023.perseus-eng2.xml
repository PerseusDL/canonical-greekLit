                        That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard,
that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands
touched, concerning the Word of life
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        (and the life was revealed,
and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal
life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        that
which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have
fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his Son, Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        And we write these things to you,
that our joy may be fulfilled.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        This is the message which we have heard from him and announce
to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        If
we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we
lie, and don't tell the truth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But if we walk in the light, as he
is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of
Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        If we say that
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        If we say that
we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>

                        My little children, I write these things to you so that you
may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor with the Father, Jesus
Christ, the righteous.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        And he is the atoning sacrifice for our
sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        This
is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        One
who says, "I know him," and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar,
and the truth isn't in him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        But whoever keeps his word, God's
love has most assuredly been perfected in him. This is how we know that
we are in him:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        he who says he remains in him ought himself also
to walk just like he walked.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old
commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is
the word which you heard from the beginning.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Again, I write a new
commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the
darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        He
who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness
even until now.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        He who loves his brother remains in the light,
and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        But he who hates
his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't
know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        I write to you, little children, because your sins are
forgiven you for his name's sake.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the
beginning.

   I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.

   I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is
from the beginning.

   I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the
word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the
world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the
world's.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who
does God's will remains forever.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard
that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen.
By this we know that it is the end times.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        They went out from us,
but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they
would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be
revealed that none of them belong to us.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        You have an anointing
from the Holy One, and you know the truth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        I have not written to
you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and
because no lie is of the truth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Who is the liar but he who
denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies
the Father and the Son.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't
have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard
from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains
in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        This
is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        These
things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you
astray.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        As for you, the anointing which you received from him
remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his
anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no
lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        Now,
little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have
boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        If you
know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices
righteousness is born of him.

                        Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that
we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn't
know us, because it didn't know him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Beloved, now we are children
of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. But we know that,
when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as
he is.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.
Sin is lawlessness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        You know that he was revealed to take away
our sins, and in him is no sin.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Whoever remains in him doesn't
sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does
righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        He who sins
is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To
this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works
of the devil.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did
he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
