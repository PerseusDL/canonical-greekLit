                        Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth
which is according to godliness,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        to Titus, my true
child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in
order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city,
as I directed you;

wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or
unruly behavior.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        For the overseer must be blameless, as God's
steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not
violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching
things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.

they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        and that older women likewise be reverent

workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that
God's word may not be blasphemed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Likewise, exhort the younger
men to be sober-minded;
