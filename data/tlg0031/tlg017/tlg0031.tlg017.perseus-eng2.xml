                        Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth
which is according to godliness,

God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        to Titus, my true
child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in
order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city,
as I directed you;

wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or
unruly behavior.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        For the overseer must be blameless, as God's
steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not
violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those
who contradict him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching
things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        One of

their mind and their conscience are defiled.

they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        and that older women likewise be reverent
in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that
which is good;

workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that
God's word may not be blasphemed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Likewise, exhort the younger
men to be sober-minded;
