<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                  
                        In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The same was in the beginning with God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made
that has been made.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        In him was life, and the life was the light
of men.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
overcome it.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        There came a man, sent from God, whose name was
John.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the
light, that all might believe through him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        He was not the light,
but was sent that he might testify about the light.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        The true
light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and
the world didn't recognize him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        He came to his own, and those
who were his own didn't receive him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        But as many as received
him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who
believe in his name:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        who were born not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        The Word
became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of
the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        John testified about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I
said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        For
the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,
who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        This is
John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
to ask him, "Who are you?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, "I am not
the Christ."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"

   He said, "I am not."

   "Are you the Prophet?"

   He answered, "No."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer
to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands
one whom you don't know.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        He is the one who comes after me, who
has come to be before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to untie."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold,
the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        This is he
of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for
he was before me.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        I didn't know him, but for this reason I came
baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        John
testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out
of heaven, and it remained on him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        I didn't recognize him, but
he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you
will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        I have seen, and have
testified that this is the Son of God."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his
disciples,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said,
"Behold, the Lamb of God!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        The two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        Jesus turned, and saw them following,
and said to them, "What are you looking for?"

   They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), "where are you staying?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        He said to them, "Come, and see."

   They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him
that day. It was about the tenth hour.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        One of the two who heard
John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        He
first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the
Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        He brought him
to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Peter).
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and
he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        Now Philip was
from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Philip found
Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the
law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?"

   Philip said to him, "Come and see."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,
"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"

   Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under
the fig tree, I saw you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You
are King of Israel!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you
underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things
than these!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        He said to him, "Most assuredly, I tell you,
hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending on the Son of Man."
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                    

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                    
                        The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus'
mother was there.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to
the marriage.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him,
"They have no wine."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you
and me? My hour has not yet come."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do
it."
                        </p></div>

with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do
you speak with her?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans
received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at
the feast, for they also went to the feast.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        Jesus came therefore
again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was
a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        When he

the point of death.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        So he inquired of them the hour when he
began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>

                        After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there
is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        for an
angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred
up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water
was made whole of whatever disease he had.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        A certain man was
there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        When Jesus saw
him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he
asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into
the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another
steps down before me."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and
walked.

   Now it was the Sabbath on that day.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        So the Jews said to him
who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry
the mat."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had
withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,

to you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who
had made him well.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and
sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working,
too."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to
kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        Jesus therefore
answered them, "Most assuredly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he
does, these the Son also does likewise.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For the Father has
affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does.
He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son
also gives life to whom he desires.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        that all may
honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the
Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        "Most assuredly I tell you, he who hears my word, and
believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into
judgment, but has passed out of death into life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Most assuredly,

of God's voice; and those who hear will live.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        For as the Father
has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in
himself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        When therefore they had

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side

his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        Then the Jews who were with her in
the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up

to weep there."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was,
and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you

                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        and said, "Where have you laid him?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        Jesus wept.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the
tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        Jesus
said, "Take away the stone."

   Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        So they took away the stone from the place where the dead
man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank you
that you listened to me.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        When he had said this, he cried

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with
wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.

   Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what

chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        Now he didn't

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        So from that day forward they

                        Jesus therefore

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword
into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not
surely drink it?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers
of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        and led him to Annas
first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that
year.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was
expedient that one man should perish for the people.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Simon
Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was
known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of
the high priest;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        but Peter was standing at the door outside. So
the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and
spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Then the
maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man's
disciples?"

   He said, "I am not."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Now the servants and the officers were standing there,
having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming
themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about
his teaching.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world.
I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always
meet. I said nothing in secret.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Why do you ask me? Ask those
who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things
which I said."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        When he had said this, one of the officers standing by
slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest
like that?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the
evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore
to him, "You aren't also one of his disciples, are you?"

   He denied it, and said, "I am not."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of
him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you in the garden
with him?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster
crowed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium.
It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium,
that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you
bring against this man?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we
wouldn't have delivered him up to you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and
judge him according to your law."

   Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death,"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled,
which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called
Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Jesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did
others tell you about me?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and
the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my
kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I
wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"

   Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have
been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I
should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my
voice."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"

   When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to
them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        But you have a
custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore
do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but
Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The
soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        They kept saying, "Hail, King

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him,
they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!"

find no basis for a charge against him."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Pilate therefore

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me,

to you has greater sin."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews
cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's
friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus
out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The
Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Now it was the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"

   Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they
took Jesus and led him away.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He went out, bearing his cross, to
the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew,
"Golgotha,"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        where they crucified him, and with him two others,
on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        Pilate wrote a
title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Therefore many of the Jews
read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the
city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        The
chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The
King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the
coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast
lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, which says,
"They parted my garments among them.
   For my cloak they cast lots."

   Therefore the soldiers did these things.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        But there were
standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,
Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        Therefore when
Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he
said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Then he said to
the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took
her to his own home.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full
of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        When Jesus
therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." He bowed
his head, and gave up his spirit.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so
that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that
Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Therefore the
soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who
was crucified with him;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        but when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        However
one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately
blood and water came out.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        He who has seen has testified, and
his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        For these things happened, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        Again another
Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple
of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he
might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He came
therefore and took away his body.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        Nicodemus, who at first came

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>

to bury.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>

                        Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the
other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken
away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid
him!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they
went toward the tomb.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        They both ran together. The other disciple
outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Stooping and looking
in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Then
Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the
linen cloths lying,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        and the cloth that had been on his head, not
lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in,
and he saw and believed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For as yet they didn't know the
Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        So the disciples
went away again to their own homes.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as
she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        and she saw two
angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        They told her, "Woman, why are you
weeping?"

   She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't
know where they have laid him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you
looking for?"

   She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you
have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take
him away."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Jesus said to her, "Mary."

   She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Jesus said to her, "Don't touch me, for I haven't yet
ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am
ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        When
therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and
when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear
of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them,
"Peace be to you."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his
side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit!

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with
them when Jesus came.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        The other disciples therefore said to
him, "We have seen the Lord!"

   But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas
was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the

                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Then he said to Thomas,

put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>

                        After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the
disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and
the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing."

   They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went
out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the
disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Jesus therefore said to
them, "Children, have you anything to eat?"

   They answered him, "No."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
and you will find some."

   They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It's the Lord!"

   So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far
from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net
full of fish.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire
of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Jesus said to

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great
fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the
net wasn't torn.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast."

   None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing
that it was the Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the
fish likewise.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        This is now the third time that Jesus was
revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        So
when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,
son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?"

   He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."

   He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He said to him again a
second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"

   He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."

   He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He said to him the third
time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?"

   Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have
affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know
that I have affection for you."

   Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Most assuredly I tell
you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you
wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and
another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would
glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This
was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also
leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to
betray You?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about
this man?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come,
what is that to you? You follow me."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        This saying therefore went
out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus
didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that he stay
until I come, what is that to you?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        This is the disciple who
testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his
witness is true.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        There are also many other things which Jesus
did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world
itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
