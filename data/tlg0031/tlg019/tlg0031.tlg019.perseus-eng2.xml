<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the
prophets at many times and in various ways,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all
things, through whom also he made the worlds.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding
all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made
purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        having become so much better than the angels, as he has
inherited a more excellent name than they have.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For to which of
the angels did he say at any time, 
"You are my Son,
   Today have I become your father?"

   and again, 
"I will be to him a Father,
   And he will be to me a Son?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says,
"Let all the angels of God worship him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Of the angels he says,
"Who makes his angels winds,
   And his servants a flame of fire."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        but of the Son he says,
"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
   The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
   Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
      above your fellows."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        And,
"You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
   The heavens are the works of your hands.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        They will perish, but you continue.
   They all will grow old like a garment does.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        As a mantle you will roll them up,
   And they will be changed;
But you are the same.
   Your years will not fail."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        But of which of the angels has he said at any time,
"Sit at my right hand,
   Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Aren't they all ministering spirits, sent out to do service
for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                   

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that
were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For if the word spoken
through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        how will we escape if we
neglect so great a salvation -- which at the first having been spoken
through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        God
also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by
various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to
his own will?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For he didn't subject the world to come, whereof we
speak, to angels.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But one has somewhere testified, saying,
"What is man, that you think of him?
   Or the son of man, that you care for him?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        You made him a little lower than the angels;
   You crowned him with glory and honor.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        You have put all things in subjection under his feet."

   For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is
not subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him,
yet.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But we see him who has been made a little lower than the
angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and
honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are
all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their
salvation perfect through sufferings.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For both he who sanctifies
and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is
not ashamed to call them brothers,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        saying,
"I will declare your name to my brothers.
   In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Again, "I will put my trust in him." Again, "Behold, here am
I and the children whom God has given me."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Since then the
children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner
partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him
who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        and might
deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
subject to bondage.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For most assuredly, not to angels does he
give help, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Therefore
he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he
might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining
to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For in
that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those
who are tempted.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
                  

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                  
                        Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his
house.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is
God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for
a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if
we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the
end.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, 
"Today if you will hear his voice,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation,
   Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Where your fathers tested me by proving me,
   And saw my works for forty years.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Therefore I was displeased with that generation,
   And said, 'They always err in their heart,
   But they didn't know my ways;'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        As I swore in my wrath,
   'They will not enter into my rest.'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an
evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        but
exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest
any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        For we
have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our
confidence firm to the end:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        while it is said,
"Today if you will hear his voice,
   Don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who
came out of

                        by Moses?

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        With whom was he displeased forty
years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the
wilderness?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into
his rest, but to those who were disobedient?

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        We see that they

                        Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps a promise being left of
entering into his rest, anyone of you should seem to have come short of
it.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they
also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't
mixed with faith by those who heard.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For we who have believed do
enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath,
they will not enter into my rest;" although the works were finished
from the foundation of the world.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        For he has said this somewhere
about the seventh day, "God rested on the seventh day from all his
works;"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        and in this place again, "They will not enter into my
rest."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein,
and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in
because of disobedience,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        he again defines a certain day, today,
saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),
"Today if you will hear his voice,
   Don't harden your hearts."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken
afterward of another day.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        There remains therefore a Sabbath rest
for the people of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For he who has entered into his rest has
himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Let us
therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall
after the same example of disobedience.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For the word of God is
living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and
is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all
things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have
to do.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Having then a great high priest, who has passed through
the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our
confession.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points
tempted like we are, yet without sin.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Let us therefore draw near
with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and
may find grace for help in time of need.

                        For every high priest, being taken from among men, is
appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both
gifts and sacrifices for sins.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The high priest can deal gently
with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is
also surrounded with weakness.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Because of this, he must offer
sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like
Aaron was.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a
high priest, but it was he who said to him,
"You are my Son.
   Today I have become your father."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        As he says also in another place,
"You are a priest forever,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and
petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him
from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        though he
was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        named by God a high priest after

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need
to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the
oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of
righteousness, for he is a baby.

of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        but if it bears

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and

you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For when God made a promise to

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        In this
way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the

                        For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High,
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed
him,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being
first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of
Salem, which is king of peace;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        without father, without mother,
without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Now
consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch,
gave a tenth out of the best spoils.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        They indeed of the sons of
Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes
of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though
these have come out of the loins of Abraham,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        but he whose
genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has
blessed him who has the promises.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But without any dispute the
less is blessed by the better.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Here people who die receive
tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he
lives.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        So to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes,
has paid tithes,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        for he was yet in the loins of his father when
Melchizedek met him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Now if there was perfection through the
Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law),
what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order
of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For he of whom these things are said belongs to
another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which
tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        This is yet
more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there
arises another priest,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        who has been made, not after the law of a
fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        for
it is testified,
"You are a priest forever,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because
of its weakness and uselessness
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        (for the law made nothing
perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which
we draw near to God.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Inasmuch as he was not made priest without
the taking of an oath

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        (for they indeed have been made priests
without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him,
"The Lord swore and will not change his mind,
   'You are a priest forever,
   According to the order of Melchizedek'".
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better
covenant.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are
hindered from continuing by death.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        But he, because he lives
forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Therefore he is also
able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him,
seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.

                        who doesn't need, like those high priests, to daily offer up
