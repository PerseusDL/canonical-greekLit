                        Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but
through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the
dead),
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of
Galatia:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord
Jesus Christ,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        who gave himself for our sins, that he might
deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our
God and Father --
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you
in the grace of Christ to a different gospel;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        and there isn't
another gospel. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to
pervert the gospel of Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        But even though we, or an angel
from heaven, should preach to you any gospel other than that which we
preached to you, let him be cursed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        As we have said before, so I
now say again: if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that
which you received, let him be cursed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For am I now seeking the
favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were
still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        But I
make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel which was preached
by me, that it is not according to man.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For neither did I
receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through
revelation of Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For you have heard of my way of
living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I
persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        I advanced in
the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being
more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        But
when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's
womb, and called me through his grace,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        to reveal his Son in me,
that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer
with flesh and blood,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who
were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned
to Damascus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to
visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        But of the other
apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Now
about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not
lying.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        I
was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in
Christ,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        but they only heard: "He who once persecuted us now
preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        And they
glorified God in me.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                  

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                
                        Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to
Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I went up by
revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the
Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that
I might be running, or had run, in vain.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        But not even Titus, who
was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        This
was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to
spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might
bring us into bondage;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        to whom we gave no place in the way of
subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might
continue with you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But from those who were reputed to be
important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God
doesn't show partiality to man) -- they, I say, who were respected
imparted nothing to me,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        but to the contrary, when they saw that I
had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcision, even as
Peter with the gospel for the circumcision
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        (for he who appointed
Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the
Gentiles);
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        and when they perceived the grace that was given to
me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars,
gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go
to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They only asked
us to remember the poor -- which very thing I was also zealous to do.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face,
because he stood condemned.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        For before some people came from
James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and
separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even
Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But when I saw
that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I
said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live as the
Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to
live as the Jews do?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        "We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but
through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus,
that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of
the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove
myself a law-breaker.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For I, through the law, died to the law,
that I might live to God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        I have been crucified with Christ, and
it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I
now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me,
and gave himself up for me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        I don't make void the grace of God.
For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!"
                    </p>
                </div></div>

                        Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the
truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as
crucified?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive
the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Are
you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in
the flesh?

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed
in vain?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works
miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by
hearing of faith?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Even as Abraham "believed God, and it was
counted to him for righteousness."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Know therefore that those who
are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The Scripture,
foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the
gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all the nations will be
blessed."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the
faithful Abraham.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For as many as are of the works of the law are
under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who doesn't
continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Now that no man is justified by the law before God is
evident, for, "The righteous will live by faith."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        The law is not
of faith, but, "The man who does them will live by them."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a
curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a
tree,"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Brothers, I speak like men. Though it is only a
man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void,
or adds to it.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to
his seed. He doesn't say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To
your seed," which is Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Now I say this. A covenant
confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred
and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no
effect.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of
promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions,
until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was
ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Now a
mediator is not between one, but God is one.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Is the law then
against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law
given which could make alive, most assuredly righteousness would have
been of the law.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But the Scriptures shut up all things under
sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those
who believe.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But before faith came, we were kept in custody
under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be
revealed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to
Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        But now that faith
is come, we are no longer under a tutor.

burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For if a man thinks
himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in
himself and not in his neighbor.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For each man will bear his own
burden.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But let him who is taught in the word share all good
things with him who teaches.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Don't be deceived. God is not
mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        For he
who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he
who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if
we don't give up.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what
is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the
household of the faith.

                        See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.

                        As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to
be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of
Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the
law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may
boast in your flesh.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But far be it from me to boast, except in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been
crucified to me, and I to the world.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For in Christ Jesus neither
is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on

                        From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for
I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.

                        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,
