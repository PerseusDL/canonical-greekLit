This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to
show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent
and made known by his angel to his servant, John,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        who testified
to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything
that he saw.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the
prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is
at hand.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you
and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from
the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        and from Jesus
Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler
of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our
sins by his blood;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his
God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever.
Amen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see
him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will
mourn over him. Even so, Amen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and
who was and who is to come, the Almighty."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        I John, your brother and partner with you in oppression,
kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is
called Patmos because of God's Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a
loud voice, as of a trumpet</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        saying, "What you see, write in a
book and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned,
I saw seven golden lampstands.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        And in the midst of the
lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down
to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        His head
and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a
flame of fire.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had
been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded
a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its
brightest.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.

   He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid. I am the
first and the last,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        and the Living one. I was dead, and behold,
I am alive forevermore. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things
which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        the
mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the
seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven
assemblies. The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.

midst of the seven golden lampstands says these things:</p></div>

                        "I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that
you can't tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves
apostles, and they are not, and found them false.</p></div>

                        You have
perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown
weary.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        But I have this against you, that you left your first
love.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent
and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly, and will
move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But this
you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also
hate.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the

life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</p></div>

these things:</p></div>

rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are
not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Don't be afraid of the things
which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some
of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have
oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the
crown of life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won't be harmed by the second
death.</p></div>

is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days of
Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where
Satan dwells.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But I have a few things against you, because you
have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to
throw a stumbling block before the children of
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        , to eat things
sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        So you
also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same
way.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I
will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He who
has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him
who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give
him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one
knows but he who receives it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        But
I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to
commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual
immorality.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who

her works.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        I will kill her children with Death, and all the

you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>

After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven,
and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was
one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must
happen after this."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne
set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        that looked like a
jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like
an emerald to look at.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Around the throne were twenty-four
thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in
white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Out of the
throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps
of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like a
crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four
living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The first
creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the
third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying
eagle.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The four living creatures, having each one of them six
wings, are full of eyes around about and within. They have no rest day
and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to
come!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him
who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        the
twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and
worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before
the throne, saying,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        "Worthy are you, our Lord and our God, the

created!"

I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book
written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the
book, and to break its seals?"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        No one in heaven above, or on the
earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the
book, or to look in it.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        One of the elders said to me, "Don't
weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David,
has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        I saw
in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the
midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain,
having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God,
sent out into all the earth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Then he came, and he took it out of
the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Now when he had
taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders
fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls
full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        They sang a
new song, saying,
"You are worthy to take the book,
   And to open its seals:
For you were killed,
   And bought us for God with your blood,
   Out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        And made them kings and priests to our God,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels
around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number
of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been
killed to receive the power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and
blessing!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth,
under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, "To him
who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the
glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        The four living creatures said, "Amen!" The elders fell down

                        I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard

"Come and see!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it

to conquer.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Another came forth, a red horse. To him
who sat on it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they
should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living

sat on it had a balance in his hand.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        I heard a voice in the midst
of the four living creatures saying, "A choenix of wheat for a
denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't damage the
oil and the wine!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living
creature saying, "Come and see!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        And behold, a pale horse, and he
who sat on him, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority
over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with
death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the
souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the
testimony of the Lamb which they had.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They cried with a loud
voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and true, do you not judge
and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        A long
white robe was given them. They were told that they should rest yet for
a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also
be killed even as they were, completed their course.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great
earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the
whole moon became as blood.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        The stars of the sky fell to the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled
up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        They told the mountains

the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would
blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I saw another

the earth and the sea,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        saying, "Don't harm the earth, neither the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        I heard the number of those who were sealed,

children of Israel:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude,
which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes,
peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,
dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They

                        All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

                        Another angel
came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was

the golden altar which was before the throne.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        The smoke of the
incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the

                        The angel took the censer, and he filled it with
the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed
thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The first sounded, and there followed hail
and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown on the earth. One
third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt
up, and all green grass was burnt up.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning
mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        and one third of the creatures which were in the sea died, those

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky,
burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on
the springs of the waters.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        The name of the star is called

the waters, because they were made bitter.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>

one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one
third of it, and the night in the same way.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I saw, and I heard
an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe!

the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like
the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened
because of the smoke from the pit.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Then out of the smoke came
forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the
scorpions of the earth have power.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        They were told that they

foreheads.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        They were given power not to kill them, but to torment
them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion,
when it strikes a man.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        In those days men will seek death, and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared

faces were like men's faces.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        They had hair like women's hair, and
their teeth were like those of lions.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        They had breastplates, like
breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of
chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They have tails like
those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm
men for five months.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        They have over them as king the angel of
the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the
name "Apollyon."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        The first woe is past. Behold, there are still
two woes coming after this.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of
the golden altar which is before God,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        saying to the sixth angel
who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great
river Euphrates!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that
hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of
mankind.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The number of the armies of the horsemen was ten
thousands of ten thousands. I heard the number of them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Thus I
saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having
breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the
heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the
fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their
tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them
they harm.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these
plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't
worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and
of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        They didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor
of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.

                        I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with
a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his
feet like pillars of fire.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        He had in his hand a little book
open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the
seven thunders uttered their voices.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        When the seven thunders
sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying,
"Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don't write
them."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land
lifted up his right hand to the sky,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        and swore by him who lives
forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the
earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that
are in it, that there will no longer be delay,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        but in the days
of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the
mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the
prophets.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking
with me, said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the
angel who stands on the sea and on the land."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.

   He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your belly
bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my belly
was made bitter.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        They told me, "You must prophesy again over
many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."

A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, "Rise, and

                        Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don't

holy city under foot for forty-two months.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        I will give power to

every plague, as often as they desire.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        When they have finished

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Those who dwell on the earth

earth.</p></div>

those who saw them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        In that day there was a great earthquake, and
a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the
earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

                        The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The twenty-four elders, who sit before God's throne on their

                        saying: "We

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of

                        A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the
sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve
stars.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        She was with child. She cried out, laboring and in pain,
giving birth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven
crowns.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and
threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was
about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her
child.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all

his throne.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a

hundred sixty days.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on
the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        They didn't
prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the
devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to
the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        I heard a
loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power,

accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before
our God day and night.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        They overcame him because of the Lamb's

                        Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you

short time."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he
persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Two
wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly
into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a
time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        The dragon

Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up
out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten
crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.</p></div>

                        The beast which I
saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his
mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his
throne, and great authority.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        One of his heads looked like it had
been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth
marveled at the beast.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        They worshiped the dragon, because he
gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        A
mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority

                        He opened his

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        It was given to him to make
war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe,
people, language, and nation was given to him.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        All who dwell on

has been killed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>

                        If
anyone has captivity, he goes away. If anyone is with the sword, he

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two
horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        He exercises all
the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth
and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound
was healed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        He performs great signs, even making fire come down
out of the sky on the earth in the sight of men.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        He deceives my
own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was

the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the
sword wound and lived.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        It was given to him to give breath to
it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both
speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to
be killed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and

marks on their right hand, or on their forehead;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>

the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.

                        I heard a sound

on their harps.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        They sing a new song before the throne, and

redeemed out of the earth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        These are those who were not defiled

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        He said with a loud voice, "Fear

waters!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great

on his forehead, or on his hand,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        he also will drink of the wine

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Here is the patience of the saints, those who
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I heard the voice from heaven saying, "Write, 'Blessed are
the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'"

   "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors; for
their works follow with them."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one
sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in
his hand a sharp sickle.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Another angel came out from the
temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Send
forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the
harvest of the earth is ripe!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He who sat on the cloud thrust
his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven.
He also had a sharp sickle.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Another angel came out from the
altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to
him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle,
and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's
grapes are fully ripe!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        The angel thrust his sickle into the
earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the
great winepress of the wrath of God.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        The winepress was trodden
outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the
bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.

I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven
angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is
finished.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire,
and those who overcame the beast, and his image, and the number of his
name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        They
sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,
saying,
"Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty;
   Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Who wouldn't fear you, Lord,

For you only are holy.

   For your righteous acts have been revealed.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle
of the testimony in heaven was opened.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        The seven angels who had
the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and
wearing golden sashes around their breasts.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and
ever.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the
seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.

                   I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven
angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the
earth!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and
it became a harmful and evil sore on the men who had the mark of the
beast, and who worshiped his image.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it
became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of
water, and it became blood.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        I heard the angel of the waters
saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because
you judged this way.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        For they poured out the blood of the saints
and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve
this."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty,
true and righteous are your judgments."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given
to him to scorch men with fire.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        People were scorched with great
heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over
these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,
and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the
pain,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the
Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for
the kings that come from the sunrise.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        I saw coming out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like
frogs;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which
go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them
together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        "Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He gathered them together into the place which is
called in Hebrew, Megiddo.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice
came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is
done!"</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the
earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        The great city was
divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon
the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of
the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Every island fled
away, and the mountains were not found.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Great hailstones, about
the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on men. Men blasphemed
God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly
severe.

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and
spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the
great prostitute who sits on many waters,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        with whom the kings of
the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth
were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        He
carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting
on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        The woman was dressed in purple and
scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in
her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the
sexual immorality of the earth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        And on her forehead a name was
written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND
OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        I saw the woman drunken with
the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        The angel said
to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman,
and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the
ten horns.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about
to come up out of the abyss, and to go into destruction. Those who
dwell on the earth will wonder, whose name has not been written in the
book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see that the
beast was, and is not, and will pe present.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Here is the mind
that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the
woman sits.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is,
the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little
while.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an
eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        The
ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as
yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to
the beast.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will
overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also
will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute
sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The ten
horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and
will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her
flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        For God has put in
their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to come to unity of mind,
and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should
be accomplished.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        The woman whom you saw is the great city,
which reigns over the kings of the earth."

After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of

glory.</p></div>

abundance of her luxury."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come forth, my

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Therefore in one

strong.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality

                        I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me,
"Look! Don't do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your
brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the
testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he
who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges
and makes war.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head
are many crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one
knows but he himself.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with
blood. His name is called "The Word of God."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        The armies which

fine linen.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged
sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them
with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fierceness of the
wrath of God, the Almighty.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He has on his garment and on his

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, "Come! Be gathered
together to the great supper of God,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        that you may eat the flesh

free and slave, and small and great."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        I saw the beast, and the
kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war
against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        The
beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in
his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of
the beast and those who worshiped his image. They two were thrown alive
into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        The rest were
killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came
forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.

I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of
the abyss and a great chain in his hand.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        He seized the dragon,
the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole
inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        and cast
him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should
deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished.
After this, he must be freed for a short time.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        I saw thrones,

of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the
word of God, and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image, and
didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They
lived, and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.</p></div>

thousand years.</p></div>

                        and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        They
went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the
saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God,
and devoured them.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        The devil who deceived them was thrown into

                        I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing

which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which
were written in the books, according to their works.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        The sea

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The city lies foursquare, and

                        The
