<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;

   To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the
overseers and deacons:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Grace to you, and peace from God, our
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        I thank my God whenever I
remember you,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        always in every request of mine on behalf of you
all making my requests with joy,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        for your fellowship in
furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        being
confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will
complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        It is even right for
me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my
heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of
the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        For God is my
witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ
Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and all discernment;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        so that you may approve the
things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense
to the day of Christ;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        being filled with the fruits of
righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise
of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things
which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the
gospel;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard,
and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        and that most
of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more
abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Some
indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of
good will.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        The former insincerly preach Christ from selfish
ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        but
the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of
the gospel.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in
pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and
will rejoice.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For I know that this will turn out to my
salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        according to my earnest expectation and hope, that
I will in no way be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, now
also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But if I
live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't
make known what I will choose.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But I am in a dilemma between the
two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far
better.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your
sake.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes,
and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my
presence with you again.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of
Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of
your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving
for the faith of the gospel;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        and in nothing frightened by the
adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of
salvation, and that from God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Because it has been granted to you
on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on
his behalf,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        having the same conflict which you saw in me, and
now hear is in me.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                   

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any
consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender
mercies and compassion,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        make my joy full, by being like-minded,
having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        doing
nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each
counting others better than himself;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        each of you not just looking
to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider it robbery to be
equal with God,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        but emptied himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        And being found in
human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the
death of the cross.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Therefore God also highly exalted him, and
gave to him the name which is above every name;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        that at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and
those under the earth,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        and that every tongue should confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only
in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For it is God who works in
you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Do all
things without murmurings and disputes,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        that you may become
blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of
a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in
the world,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        holding up the word of life; that I may have
something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor
labor in vain.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and
service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        In
the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon,
that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        For
I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But
you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he
served with me in furtherance of the gospel.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        Therefore I hope to
send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        But I
trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        But I
counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow
worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need;
