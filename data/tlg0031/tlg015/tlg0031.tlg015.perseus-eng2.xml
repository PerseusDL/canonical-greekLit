of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus when I was going into
Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach a different
doctrine,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        neither to pay attention to myths and endless
genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which
is in faith --
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure
heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        from which
things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand
neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        But
we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        as
knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the
lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy
and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for
slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        according to the gospel of the
glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        And I
thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me
faithful, appointing me to service;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        although I was before a
blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy,
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        The grace of our Lord
abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus
Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were
going to believe in him for eternal life.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Now to the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and
glory forever and ever. Amen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to
the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the
good warfare;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                  
                        I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        for
kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and
quiet life in all godliness and reverence.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For this is good and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        For there is
one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in
faith and truth.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting
up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Deacons, in the same way, must be reverent, not
