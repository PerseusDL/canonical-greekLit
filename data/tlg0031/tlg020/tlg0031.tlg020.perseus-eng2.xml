<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                    
                        James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be
given to him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for
he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high
position;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like
the flower in the grass, he will pass away.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For the sun arises
with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it
falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich
man fade away in his pursuits.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has
been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord
promised to those who love him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Let no man say when he is
tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can't be tempted by evil, and
he himself tempts no one.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        But each one is tempted, when he is
drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Then the lust, when it
has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings
forth death.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from
the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning
shadow.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to
hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        for the anger of man
doesn't produce the righteousness of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Therefore, putting
away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with
humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own
selves.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he
is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        for he
sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man
he was.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of
freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of
the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he
doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion
is worthless.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        Pure religion and undefiled before our God and
Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                   

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1">
                    <p>
                        My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of
glory with partiality.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For if a man with a gold ring, in fine
clothing, comes into your assembly, and a poor man in filthy clothing
also comes in;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        and you pay special attention to him who wears the
fine clothing, and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the
poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        haven't you
shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil
thoughts?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn't God choose those
who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the
kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But you have
dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you, and personally
drag you before the courts?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Don't they blaspheme the honorable
name by which you are called?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        However, if you fulfill the royal
law, according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as
yourself," you do well.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But if you show partiality, you commit
sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        For whoever
shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he has become
guilty of all.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said
also, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but
murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        So speak, and
so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        For
judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs
over judgment.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but
has no works? Can that faith save him?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        And if a brother or
sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        and one of you tells
them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you didn't give them
the things the body needs, what good is it?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Even so faith, if it
has no works, is dead in itself.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Yes, a man will say, "You have
faith, and I have works." Show me your faith from your works, and I by
my works will show you my faith.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also
believe, and shudder.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        But do you want to know, vain man, that
faith apart from works is dead?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        Wasn't Abraham our father
justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was
perfected;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham
believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and he was
called the friend of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        You see then that by works, a man is
justified, and not only by faith.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        In like manner wasn't Rahab
the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the
messengers, and sent them out another way?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        For as the body apart
from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
                

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                  
                        Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we
will receive heavier judgment.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For in many things we all stumble.
