                        Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative
concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the
word delivered them to us,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        it seemed good to me also, having
traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to
you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a
wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        They
were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But they had no child,
because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office
before God in the order of his division,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        according to the custom
of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the
Lord and burn incense.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        The whole multitude of the people were
praying outside at the hour of incense.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
side of the altar of incense.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Zacharias was troubled when he saw
him, and fear fell upon him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        But the angel said to him, "Don't
be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your
wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his
birth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he
will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy
Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        He will turn many of the
children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He will go before him
in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to
make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For
I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the
presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good
news.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until
the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my
words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that
he delayed in the temple.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        When he came out, he could not speak
to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He
continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        It happened,
when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid
herself five months, saying,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        "Thus has the Lord done to me in
the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        to a virgin pledged to be
married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The
virgin's name was Mary.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        Having come in, the angel said to her,
"Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you
among women!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying,
and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        The angel
said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son,
and will call his name 'Jesus.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne
of his father, David,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        and he will reign over the house of Jacob
forever. There will be no end to his kingdom."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a
virgin?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the
holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old
age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        For everything spoken by God is possible.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
according to your word."

   The angel departed from her.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        Mary arose in those days and
went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        and
entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        It
happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in
her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        She
called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        Why am I so favored, that
the mother of my Lord should come to me?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        For behold, when the
voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb
for joy!
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a
fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        Mary said,
"My soul magnifies the Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        For he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.
For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
   Holy is his name.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear
      him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        He has shown strength with his arm.
   He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        He has put down princes from their thrones.
   And has exalted the lowly.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        He has filled the hungry with good things.
   He has sent the rich away empty.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember
      mercy,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        As he spoke to our fathers,
   To Abraham and his seed forever."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="56"><p>
                        Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to
her house.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="57"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        He entered into one of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one
hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has
ears to hear, let him hear!"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not
see, and hearing they may not understand.'

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Now the parable is
this: The seed is the word of God.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Those along the road are
those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from
their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Those on
the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but
these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of
temptation.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        That which fell among the thorns, these are those
who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares,
riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart,
having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with
patience.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>

                        His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        It was told him by some saying, "Your

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a
boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let's go over to
the other side of the lake." So they launched out.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But as they
sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they
were taking on dangerous amounts of water.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        They came to him, and
awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and
rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it
was calm.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid
they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that he
commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        They
arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who
had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live
in a house, but in the tombs.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have
to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't
torment me!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come
out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was
kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands
apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"

   He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        They
begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and
they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He
allowed them.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        The demons came out from the man, and entered into
the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and
were drowned.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        When those who fed them saw what had happened,
they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus,
and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus'
feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        Those
who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was
healed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        All the people of the surrounding country of the
Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much
afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        But the man from
whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but
Jesus sent him away, saying,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        "Return to your house, and declare
what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming
throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed
him, for they were all waiting for him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        Behold, there came a man
named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at
Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        for he had
an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as
he went, the multitudes thronged him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        A woman who had a flow of
blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        came behind him, and touched the
fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        Jesus said, "Who touched me?"

   When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that
power has gone out of me."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        When the woman saw that she was not
hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him
in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him,
and how she was healed immediately.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        He said to her, "Daughter,
cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's
house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the
Teacher."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don't be afraid. Only
believe, and she will be healed."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        When he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter
in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the girl, and her mother.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, "Don't weep. She
isn't dead, but sleeping."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        They laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        Her spirit returned, and she rose
up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.

                        It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he
took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to
pray.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Behold, two men were

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        who appeared in

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        and said to them,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>

                        The whole company of them rose up and brought him before
Pilate.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man
perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying
that he himself is Christ, a king."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

   He answered him, "So you say."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find
no basis for a charge against this man."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching
throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was
a Galilean.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        When he found out that he was in Herod's
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during
those days.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had
wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things
about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        The
chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in
luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Herod and
Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that
they were enemies with each other.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and
the people,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        and said to them, "You brought this man to me as
one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you,
and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those
things of which you accuse him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        I will therefore chastise him and release him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man!
Release to us Barabbas!" --
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        one who was thrown into prison for
a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man
done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise
him and release him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But they were urgent with loud voices,
asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the
chief priests prevailed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Pilate decreed that what they asked
for should be done.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        He released him who had been thrown into
prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he
delivered Jesus up to their will.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene,
coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after
Jesus.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        A great multitude of the people followed him, including
women who also mourned and lamented him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        But Jesus, turning to
them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for
yourselves and for your children.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        For behold, the days are
coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that
never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Then they will
begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover
us.'
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        For if they do these things in the green tree, what will
be done in the dry?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be
put to death.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        When they came to the place that is called The
Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right
and the other on the left.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what
they are doing."

   Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        The people
stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He
saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his
chosen one!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him
vinegar,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save
yourself!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        An inscription was also written over him in letters of
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying,
"If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don't you
even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        And
we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this
man has done nothing wrong."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember
me when you come into your kingdom."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be
with me in Paradise."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the
whole land until the ninth hour.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        The sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        Jesus, crying with a loud
voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said
this, he breathed his last.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man."

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        All the
multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        All his
acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood
at a distance, watching these things.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council,
a good and righteous man

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        (he had not consented to their counsel
and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting
for the Kingdom of God:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        this man went to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus' body.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth,
and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever
been laid.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath
was drawing near.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        The women, who had come with him out of
Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="56"><p>
                        They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the

prepared.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        It
happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men
stood by them in dazzling clothing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Becoming terrified, they
bowed their faces down to the earth.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>

                        returned from the tomb, and

they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        These

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        He said to them, "What things?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
