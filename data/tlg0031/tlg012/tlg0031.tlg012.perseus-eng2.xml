                        to the saints and faithful brothers in
Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
praying always for you,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        having heard of your faith in Christ
Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof
you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        which
has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit
and increasing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and
knew the grace of God in truth;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        even as you learned of Epaphras
our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our
behalf,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease
praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the
knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects,
bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        strengthened with all power, according to the might of his
glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        giving
thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the
inheritance of the saints in light;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        who delivered us out of the
power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For by him were all things
created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things
invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;
all things have been created through him, and for him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        He is
before all things, and in him all things are held together.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        He
is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
preeminence.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;

                        and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made
peace through the blood of his cross. Through him, I say, whether
things on the earth, or things in the heavens.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind
in your evil works,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        yet now he has reconciled in the body of his
flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and
blameless before him,

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        if it is so that you continue in the
faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
gospel which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under
heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on
my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh
for his body's sake, which is the assembly;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        of which I was made
a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me
toward you, to fulfill the word of God,

                        the mystery which has
been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to
his saints,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        to whom God was pleased to make known what are the
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ
in you, the hope of glory;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        whom we proclaim, admonishing every
man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus;

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>

according to his working, which works in me mightily.

and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in
the flesh;
