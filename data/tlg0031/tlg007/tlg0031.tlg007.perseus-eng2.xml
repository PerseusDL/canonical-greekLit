<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                    
                        Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        to the assembly of God which
is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
place, both theirs and ours:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God
which was given you in Christ Jesus;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        that in everything you were
enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        even as the
testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        so that you come behind
in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        God is faithful, through whom you were called
into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        Now I
beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you
all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but
that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For it has been reported to me concerning you, my
brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are
contentions among you.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Now I mean this, that each one of you
says, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," and, "I
follow Christ."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?
Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        I thank God that I
baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        so that no one
should say that I had baptized you into my own name.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        (I also
baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether
I baptized any other.)
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to
preach the gospel -- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of
Christ wouldn't be made void.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        For the word of the cross is
foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the
power of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        For it is written,
"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
   I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer
of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom
didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of
the preaching to save those who believe.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        For Jews ask for signs,
Greeks seek after wisdom,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        but we preach Christ crucified; a
stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        but to those
who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and
the wisdom of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        For you see
your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh,
not many mighty, and not many noble;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        but God chose the foolish
things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God
chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the
things that are strong;
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        and God chose the lowly things of the
world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not,
that he might bring to nothing the things that are:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        that no
flesh should boast before God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        But of him, you are in Christ
Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and
sanctification, and redemption:
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        that, according as it is
written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."
                    </p>
                </div></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                  

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                   
                        When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of
speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        For
I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and
him crucified.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much
trembling.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive
words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full
grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world,
who are coming to nothing.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        But we speak God's wisdom in a
mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before
the worlds to our glory,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        which none of the rulers of this world
has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord
of glory.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        But as it is written,
"Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear,
   Which didn't enter into the heart of man,
These God has prepared for those who love him."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the
Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        For who
among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man,
which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's
Spirit.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were
freely given to us by God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        Which things also we speak, not in
words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        Now the
natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are
foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are
spiritually discerned.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        But he who is spiritual discerns all
things, and he himself is judged by no one.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        "For who has known
the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have
Christ's mind.
                    </p>
                </div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="1"><p>
                
                        Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to
fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</p></div>
                       

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        I fed you with milk, not with
meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy,
strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk
in the ways of men?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        For when one says, "I follow Paul," and
another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you fleshly?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        Who then is
Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and
each as the Lord gave to him?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        I planted. Apollos watered. But God
gave the increase.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        So then neither he who plants is anything, nor
he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        Now he who plants
and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward

                        Now I declare to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached
to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        by
which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached
to you -- unless you believed in vain.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>
                        For I delivered to you
first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="4"><p>
                        that he was buried, that he was
raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="5"><p>
                        and that he
appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>
                        Then he appeared to over
five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some
have also fallen asleep.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
                        Then he appeared to James, then to all
the apostles,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="8"><p>
                        and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong
time, he appeared to me also.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="9"><p>
                        For I am the least of the
apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the assembly of God.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="10"><p>
                        But by the grace of God I am
what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I
worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was
with me.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="11"><p>
                        Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you
believed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="12"><p>
                        Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the
dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the
dead?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="13"><p>
                        But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has
Christ been raised.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="14"><p>
                        If Christ has not been raised, then our
preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="15"><p>
                        Yes, we
are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that
he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead
are not raised.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="16"><p>
                        For if the dead aren't raised, neither has
Christ been raised.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="17"><p>
                        If Christ has not been raised, your faith
is vain; you are still in your sins.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="18"><p>
                        Then they also who are
fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="19"><p>
                        If we have only hoped in
Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="20"><p>
                        But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the
first fruits of those who are asleep.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="21"><p>
                        For since death came by
man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="22"><p>
                        For as in
Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="23"><p>
                        But
each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are
Christ's, at his coming.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="24"><p>
                        Then the end comes, when he will
deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have
abolished all rule and all authority and power.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="25"><p>
                        For he must
reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="26"><p>
                        The last
enemy that will be abolished is death.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="27"><p>
                        For, "He put all things
in subjection under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in
subjection," it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things
to him.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="28"><p>
                        When all things have been subjected to him, then the
Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to
him, that God may be all in all.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="29"><p>
                        Or else what will they do who
are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then
are they baptized for the dead?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="30"><p>
                        Why do we also stand in
jeopardy every hour?
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="31"><p>
                        I affirm, by the boasting in you which I
have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="32"><p>
                        If I fought with
animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the
dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="33"><p>
                        Don't be deceived! "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="34"><p>
                        Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge
of God. I say this to your shame.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="35"><p>
                        But someone will say, "How
are the dead raised?" and, "With what kind of body do they come?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="36"><p>
                        You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive
unless it dies.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="37"><p>
                        That which you sow, you don't sow the body that
will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="38"><p>
                        But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each
seed a body of its own.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="39"><p>
                        All flesh is not the same flesh, but
there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish,
and another of birds.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="40"><p>
                        There are also celestial bodies, and
terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of
the terrestrial.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="41"><p>
                        There is one glory of the sun, another glory
of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from
another star in glory.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="42"><p>
                        So also is the resurrection of the dead.
It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="43"><p>
                        It is
sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is
raised in power.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="44"><p>
                        It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual
body.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="45"><p>
                        So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living
soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="46"><p>
                        However that
which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that
which is spiritual.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="47"><p>
                        The first man is of the earth, made of
dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="48"><p>
                        As is the one
made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the
heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="49"><p>
                        As we have
borne the image of those made of dust, let's also bear the image of the
heavenly.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="50"><p>
                        Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can't
inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit
incorruption.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="51"><p>
                        Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed,
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="52"><p>
                        in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be
raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="53"><p>
                        For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="54"><p>
                        But when this corruptible will have put on
incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what
is written will happen: "Death is swallowed up in victory."
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="55"><p>
                        "Death, where is your sting?
   Hades, where is your victory?"
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="56"><p>
                        The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="57"><p>
                        But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.
                        </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="58"><p>
                        Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast,
immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that
your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
                    </p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="2"><p>
                        On the first day of

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="3"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="6"><p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="verse" n="7"><p>
