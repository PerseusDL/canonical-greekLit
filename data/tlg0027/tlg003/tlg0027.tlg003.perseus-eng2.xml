<p rend="align(indent)">I think you all understand, gentlemen, that it is better to make peace on fair terms than to continue fighting. But some of you fail to see that although our political leaders have no objection to peace in the abstract, they are opposed to such measures as would lead to it, on the ground that the people would be in very grave danger of seeing the existing constitution overthrown once peace was concluded. </p>

He is also inaccurate in stating that <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> was still holding <placeName key="perseus,Megara" >Megara</placeName>; <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> revolted at the same time as <placeName key="tgn,7002677" >Euboea</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was left only with the two ports of Pegae and <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName>.

We were seized with a longing for peace; and, in virtue of his being <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>’s representative at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, we recalled Cimon’s son, Miltiades<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A double historical error. (a) Andocides means Cimon, son of Miltiades. (b) Cimon had been dead three years when the thirty years’ peace was negotiated. A. is thinking of the truce of five years with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName> arranged by Cimon in 451 immediately upon his return from exile. It was at the time of its expiry that the revolt of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> occurred. Cimon had been ostracized in 461 after his ignominious dismissal by the Spartans from <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>. His exile marked the triumph of the advanced democrats headed by Ephialtes and Pericles.</note>,who had been ostracized and was living in the <placeName key="perseus,Chersonesos,Crete" >Chersonese</placeName>, for the one purpose of sending him to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to make overtures for an armistice. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="4">
<p>On that occasion we secured a peace of fifty years with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; and both sides kept the treaty in question for thirteen. Let us consider this single instance first, gentlemen. Did the Athenian democracy ever fall during this peace? No one can show that it did. On the contrary, I will tell you how much you benefited by this peace. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="5">
<p>To begin with, we fortified Peiraeus in the course of this period<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Again an error. Peiraeus was fortified by Themistocles immediately after the repulse of the Persians in <date when="-0480">480</date>.</note>: secondly, we built the Long Wall to the north<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The northern Long Wall, connecting <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with Peiraeus, was in fact built in 457, over ten years before the negotiation of the peace which Andocides is discussing. Nothing is said of the wall to the south, running between <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and Phalerum, which was constructed at the same time.</note>: then the existing fleet of old, unseaworthy triremes with which we had won <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> her independence by defeating the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and his barbarians—these existing vessels were replaced by a hundred new ones<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An obvious inaccuracy. The Athenian fleet had been growing steadily since the Persian Wars and the institution of the Delian League.</note>: and it was at this time that we first enrolled three hundred cavalry and purchased three hundred Scythian archers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cavalry had been in existence since at least the seventh century. Solon, at the beginning of the sixth, formed his second property class of <foreign xml:lang="greek" >*(ippei=s</foreign>, citizens wealthy enough to provide themselves with a horse in time of war. Archers (<foreign xml:lang="greek" >toco/tai</foreign>) were imported for the first time shortly after <placeName key="perseus,Salamis, Cyprus">Salamis</placeName> (480 B.C.)</note>. Such were the benefits which <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> derived from the peace with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, such the strength which was added thereby to the Athenian democracy. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="6">
	<p rend="align(indent)">Later we went to war on account of <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City" >Aegina</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">There is bad confusion here. <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName> lost her independence and was incorporated in the Athenian empire in 457. Under the Thirty Years’ Peace of 446 she was guaranteed autonomy on condition that she continued to pay tribute. In 432, she made secret overtures to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, alleging that her autonomy had not been respected. Thus Andocides may be thinking of her share in precipitating the Archidamian War. On the other hand, the peace which follows is not the Peace of Nicias; when talking of the benefits which ensued from it, Andocides seems to be referring once again to the Thirty Years’ Peace (see <bibl n="Andoc. 3.3">Andoc. 3.3</bibl>). Probably he is thinking of the peace of 446, and assumes that because the status of <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName> figured prominently in the negotiations, it was <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City" >Aegina</placeName> which had originally sent <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to war.</note>; and after both sides had suffered heavily, we were seized once more with a desire for peace. So a deputation of ten —among them my grandfather, Andocides — was chosen from the whole citizen body and dispatched to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName> with unlimited powers to negotiate a peace. They arranged a thirty years’ peace with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName> for us. That is a long period, gentlemen; yet did the democracy ever fall in the course of it? Was any party, I ask you, ever caught plotting a revolution? No one can point to an instance. In fact just the opposite happened. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="7">
<p>The peace in question exalted the Athenian democracy; it rendered it so powerful that during the years after we gained peace we first of all deposited a thousand talents on the Acropolis and passed a law which set them apart as a state reserve<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For Athenian finance between 446 and 432 see I.G. i2. 91. According to Thucydides a reserve of 6000 talents had been accumulated on the Acropolis by the end of the period. One thousand were specially set apart against a naval crisis. It was forbidden to use this sum for any other purpose under pain of death. Andocides appears to be confusing the money earmarked for ships with the ships themselves</note>; in addition to that we built a hundred triremes, and decreed that they should be kept in reserve likewise: we laid out docks,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >Inaccurate. The docks had been built by Themistocles in the decade following the Persian Wars.</note> we enrolled twelve hundred cavalry and as many archers, and the Long Wall to the south was constructed.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the Middle Wall, running parallel to the wall on the north and connecting <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with Peiraeus by a narrow corridor. It was built during the Thirty Years’ Peace.</note> Such were the benefits which <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> derived from the peace with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, such the strength which was added thereby to the Athenian democracy. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="8">
	<p rend="align(indent)">Then we went to war again on account of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >The famous Megarian decree which excluded <placeName key="perseus,Megara" >Megara</placeName> from the markets of Attica and the ports of the Athenian empire was passed in 432. It brought Peloponnesian discontent to a head, and the Archidamian War followed (431-<date when="-0421">421</date>). See <bibl n="Thuc. 1.139">Thuc. 1.139</bibl>.</note> and allowed Attica to be laid waste; but the many privations which we suffered led us to make peace once more, this time through Nicias, the son of Niceratus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >In 421 B.C. It was a Fifty Years’ Peace; but in 420 <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> allied herself with <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Elis" >Elis</placeName>, and Mantinea, who were aggressively anti-Spartan. By 418 she was at war again.</note> As you are all aware, I imagine, this peace enabled us to deposit seven thousand talents of coined silver on the Acropolis </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="9">
<p>and to acquire over three hundred ships<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The MSS. give four hundred. Markland’s correction, based on the corresponding passage in Aeschines and <bibl n="Thuc. 2.13">Thuc. 2.13</bibl>, is now universally accepted.</note>: an annual tribute of more than twelve hundred talents was coming in<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">According to Thucydides (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.13">Thuc. 2.13</bibl>) the revenue from tribute at the beginning of the Archidamian War was 600 talents yearly. In 425 there was a re-assessment (known from I.G. i 2 . 63) which increased the total annual contribution of the allies to just over 960 talents. There is no good evidence to show that this figure was ever exceeded: and Andocides’ 1200 must be treated as an exaggeration. The mention of a reserve of 7000 talents is suspicious. <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> did, it is true, recover remarkably from the effects of the Archidamian War during the period between 421 and the Sicilian Expedition of 415. But Andocides is here talking of the years 421-419 only. He may be basing his figures on the financial reserve of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> before the Archidamian War.</note>: we controlled the <placeName key="perseus,Chersonesos,Crete" >Chersonese</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Naxos City" >Naxos</placeName>, and over two-thirds of <placeName key="tgn,7002677" >Euboea</placeName>: while to mention our other settlements abroad individually would be tedious. But in spite of all these advantages we went to war with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> afresh, then as now at the instigation of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> invaded the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Epidauros" >Epidaurus</placeName> in <date when="-0419">419</date>, thereby bringing about an open breach with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName>. <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, at the instance of Alcibiades, gave <placeName key="perseus,Argos" >Argos</placeName> her support in virtue of the alliance of the previous year. <q rend="double">Then as now at the instigation of <placeName key="perseus,Argos" >Argos</placeName>,</q> i.e. <placeName key="tgn,5001993" >Argive</placeName> representatives are again present, while Andocides is speaking, to urge <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to continue war with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> (cf. <bibl n="Andoc. 3.24">Andoc. 3.24</bibl> ff.). This seems more probable than the other possible rendering: <q rend="double">Once again at the instigation of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>,</q> referring to the Athenian alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> in <date when="-0462">462</date> B.C.</note> </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="10">
	<p rend="align(indent)">Now first of all, gentlemen, call to mind what I originally said that I was setting out to show. It was, was it not, that peace has never yet caused the fall of the Athenian democracy. That has now been proved against all possible arguments to the contrary. However, I have heard some people saying before now that the result of our last peace with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In 404, after <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>.</note> was the installment of the Thirty, the death of many citizens by the hemlock-cup, and the exile of others. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="11">
<p>Those who talk in this fashion misapprehend matters. There is a wide difference between a peace and a truce. A peace is a settlement of differences between equals: a truce is the dictation of terms to the conquered by the conquerors after victory in war, exactly as the Spartans laid down after their victory over us that we should demolish our walls, surrender our fleet, and restore our exiles. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="12">
<p>The agreement made then was a forced truce upon dictated terms: whereas today you are considering a peace. Why, look at the actual provisions of the two as they stand recorded; contrast the conditions of the truce inscribed upon the stone<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It was customary to inscribe treaties, etc., upon upright slabs of stone (<foreign xml:lang="greek" >sth=lai</foreign>). At <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> such <foreign xml:lang="greek">sth=lai</foreign> would stand for the most part on the Acropolis.</note> with the conditions on which you can make peace today. On the stone it is laid down that we shall demolish our walls: whereas under the present terms we can rebuild them. The truce allows us twelve ships: the peace as many as we like. Under the truce <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, Imbros, and Scyros remained in the possession of their occupants: under the peace they are to be ours. Nor is there today any obligation upon us to restore our exiles, as there was then, with the fall of the democracy as its consequence. Where is the similarity between the one and the other? Thus the general conclusion which I reach in the matter is this, gentlemen: peace means safety and power for the democracy, whereas war means its downfall. So much for that aspect of the question. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="13">
	<p rend="align(indent)">Now it is argued by some that present circumstances oblige us to continue fighting. Let us begin, then, gentlemen, by considering exactly why we are to fight. Everyone would agree, I think, that war is justified only so long as one is either suffering a wrong oneself or supporting the cause of another who has been wronged. Now we were both suffering a wrong ourselves and also supporting the cause of the Boeotians who had been wronged. If, then, <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> guarantees that our wrongs shall cease, and if the Boeotians have decided to allow <placeName key="perseus,Orchomenos">Orchomenus</placeName> its independence and make peace, why are we to continue fighting? </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="14">
<p>To free <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>? She is free already. To be able to build ourselves walls? The peace gives us that right also. To be allowed to build new triremes, and refit and keep our old ones? That is assured us as well, since the treaty affirms the independence of each state. To recover the islands, <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, Scyros, and Imbros? It is expressly laid down that these shall belong to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="15">
<p>Well then, is it to get back the <placeName key="perseus,Chersonesos,Crete" >Chersonese</placeName>, our colonies, our landed property abroad, and the debts owed us?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. all that had been lost when the empire collapsed in 404.</note> A war for their recovery needs the support of the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and our allies, and they refuse that support. Or shall I be told that we must continue fighting until we have crushed <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName> and her allies? We are not adequately equipped, in my opinion, for a campaign on such a scale; and if we are successful, what must we ourselves expect from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> afterwards? </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="16">
<p>No, even if this were a justifiable ground for war, and we had sufficient money and the necessary men, we ought not to continue it. So if we have no reasons for prolonging the war, no enemy to fight, and no resources, why should we not make every effort to secure peace? </p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="17">
	<p rend="align(indent)">Do not overlook another thing, gentlemen; you are negotiating today for the peace and independence of all Greeks alike: you are giving them all the opportunity of sharing in every advantage. Think of the circumstances in which the leading powers are ceasing hostilities. To begin with, take <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. When she first went to war with us and our allies,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In 395, when Pausanias and Lysander invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.

<p>And she is sacrificing this supremacy, not because we forced her to do so, but in order to give the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> its independence. The Spartans have now won three battles: the first at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >July 394.
