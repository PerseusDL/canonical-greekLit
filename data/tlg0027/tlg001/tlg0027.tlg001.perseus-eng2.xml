<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="1"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The systematic and untiring efforts of my enemies, gentlemen, to do me every possible injury, by fair means or by foul, from the very moment of my arrival in this city,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Four years earlier, in 403.</note> are known to almost all of you, and it is unnecessary for me to pursue the subject. Instead, I shall make a request of you, gentlemen, a fair request, which it is as easy for you to grant as it is valuable for me to gain.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Much of 1, 6, 7 and 9 consists of <foreign xml:lang="lat">loci communes</foreign> which recur in Lysias and Isocrates. Both they and Andocides were making use of the same handbook of proems.</note> </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="2"> 
	<p>First, I ask you to bear in mind that it is not because I have been forced to face my trial that I am here today—I have not been on bail, nor have I been kept in confinement.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This was not customary in a case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδειξις</foreign>. The accused, if a citizen, was usually given the choice of furnishing sureties (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγυηταί</foreign>) or suffering imprisonment until the case came into court. Possibly it was felt that the conditions in the present instance were exceptional and that Andocides should be allowed the opportunity of quitting 
<placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> if he so desired.</note> I am here, first and foremost because I rely upon justice and secondly because I rely upon you; I believe that you will decide my case impartially and, far sooner than allow my enemies to defy justice by taking my life, will uphold justice by protecting me, as your laws and your oaths as jurors require you to do. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="3"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">With defendants who face a trial of their own free will, gentlemen, it stands to reason that you should feel as convinced of their innocence as they do themselves. When a defendant admits himself guilty by refusing to await trial, you naturally endorse the verdict which he has passed upon himself; so it follows that if a man is prepared to face his trial because his conscience is clear, you should let his verdict upon himself determine your own in the same way, instead of presuming him guilty. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="4"> 
<p>Mine is a case in point. My enemies have been saying, or so I keep hearing, that I would take to my heels instead of standing my ground. <q rend="double">What motive could Andocides possibly have for braving so hazardous a trial?</q> they argue. <q rend="double">He can count upon a livelihood sufficient for all his needs, if he does no more than withdraw from 
<placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>; while if he returns to 
<placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> whence he has come,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The <title>De Reditu</title> shows that Andocides had spent a considerable time in 
<placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> during his years of exile. He was on very friendly terms with Evagoras, who had succeeded in regaining the throne of 
<placeName key="perseus,Salamis, Cyprus" >Salamis</placeName> in 410. Evagoras was notoriously eager to attract likely Greek settlers.</note> an abundance of good land has been offered him and is his for the asking. Will a man in his position want to risk his life? What object could he have in doing so? Cannot he see the state of things in 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>?</q> </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<p>That entirely misrepresents my feelings, gentlemen. I would never consent to a life abroad which cut me off from my country, whatever the advantages attached to it; and although conditions in 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> may be what my enemies allege, I would sooner be a citizen of her than of any other state which may appear to me to be just now at the height of prosperity. Those are the feelings which have led me to place my life in your hands. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="6"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">I ask you, then, to show more sympathy to me, the defendant, gentlemen, than to my accusers, in the knowledge that even if you give us an impartial hearing, the defence is inevitably at a disadvantage. The prosecution have brought their charge in perfect safety, after elaborating their plans at leisure; whereas I who am answering that charge am filled with fear; my life is at stake, and I have been grossly misrepresented. You have good reason for showing more sympathy to me than you do to my accusers. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="7"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And there is another thing to be borne in mind. Serious charges have often before now been disproved at once, and so decisively that you would much rather have punished the accusers than the accused. Again, witnesses have caused the death of innocent men by giving false evidence, and have only been convicted of perjury when it was too late to be of help to the victims. When this kind of thing has been so common, you can hardly do less than refuse for the Present to consider the prosecution’s statement of the case trustworthy. You may use it to judge whether the charge is serious or not but you cannot tell whether the charge is true or false until you have heard my reply as well. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="8"> 
<p>Now I am wondering at what point to begin my defence, gentlemen. Shall I start with what ought to be discussed last and prove that the prosecution disobeyed the law in lodging their information against me?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A reference, apparently, to the amnesty of 403. According to Andocides, it debarred the prosecution from reopening his case.</note> Shall I take the decree of Isotimides and show that it has been annulled? Shall I start with the laws which have been passed and the oaths which have been taken? Or shall I tell you the story right from the beginning? I will explain the chief reason for my hesitation. Doubtless the different charges made have not moved you all to the same degree, and each of you has some one of them to which he would like me to reply first; yet to answer them all simultaneously is impossible. On the whole, I think it best to tell you the entire story from the beginning, omitting nothing; once you are properly acquainted with the facts, you will see immediately how unfounded are the charges which my accusers have brought against me. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="9"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now to return a just verdict is already, I feel sure, your intention; indeed, it was because I relied upon you that I stood my ground. I have observed that in suits public and private the one thing to which you attach supreme importance is that your decision should accord with your oath; and it is that, and that alone, which keeps our city unshaken, in spite of those who would have things otherwise. I do, however, ask you to listen to my defence with sympathy; do not range yourselves with my opponents; do not view my story with suspicion; do not watch for faults of expression. Hear my defence to the end: and only then return the verdict which you think best befits yourselves and best satisfies your oath. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="10"> 
<p>As I have already told you, gentlemen, my defence will begin at the beginning and omit nothing. I shall deal first with the actual charge which furnished grounds for the lodging of the information that has brought me into court today, profanation of the Mysteries. I shall show that I have committed no act of impiety, that I have never turned informer, that I have never admitted guilt, and that I do not know whether the statements made to you by those who did turn informers were true or false. Of all this you shall have proof.</p> </div> </div>
			
<div type="textpart" subtype="part" n="Narrative"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="11"> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">The Assembly had met<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">June, <date when="-0415">415</date> B.C. Andocides is our only authority for this last-minute meeting of the Assembly. It was probably convened to make final arrangements for the expedition.</note> to give audience to Nicias, Lamachus, and Alcibiades, the generals about to leave with the Sicilian expedition—in fact, Lamachus’ flag-ship was already lying offshore—when suddenly Pythonicus rose before the people and cried: <q rend="double">Countrymen, you are sending forth this mighty host in all its array upon a perilous enterprise. Yet your commander, Alcibiades, has been holding celebrations of the Mysteries in a private house, and others with him; I will prove it. Grant immunity<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδεια</foreign> is used in two slightly different senses. (a) It is the immunity granted by the Assembly or Council to persons who have a statement to make to them, but who are debarred from addressing them without special permission. This applied to slaves, metics, and women. Hence Andromachus, Teucrus, and Agariste all have to obtain an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδεια</foreign> before lodging their information. (b) It is the immunity granted to a criminal who is prepared to turn informer. Often the two senses are combined, as here Andromachus was both debarred from addressing the Assembly in normal circumstances, and he was implicated in the crime which he was exposing. The same applies to Teucrus.</note> to him whom I indicate, and a non-initiate, a slave belonging to someone here present, shall describe the Mysteries to you. You can punish me as you will, if that is not the truth.</q> </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="12"> 
	<p>Alcibiades denied the charge at great length; so the Prytanes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That section of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> which presided at meetings of the Ecclesia for the time being. For further details see <bibl n="Antiph. 6.45">Antiph. 6.45</bibl> note 1.</note> decided to clear the meeting of non-initiates and themselves fetch the lad indicated by Pythonicus. They went off, and returned with a slave belonging to Archebiades, son of Polemarchus. His name was Andromachus. As soon as immunity had been voted him, he stated that Mysteries had been celebrated in Pulytion’s house. Alcibiades, Niciades and Meletus —those were the actual celebrants; but others had been present and had witnessed what took place. The audience had also included slaves, namely, himself, his brother, the fluteplayer Hicesius, and Meletus’ slave. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="13"> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">Such was the statement of Andromachus, the first of the informers. He gave the following list of persons concerned,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >The names of a number of those whose goods were confiscated and sold after the mutilation of the Hermae have survived on a fragmentary inscription (I.G. i 2. 327, 332). They confirm the lists given by Andocides. Oeonias, Panaetius, and Polystratus are mentioned from the list of Andromachus: Axiochus, Adeimantus, Cephisodorus, and Euphiletus from the later lists of Teucrus and Andocides himself.</note> all of whom, save Polystratus, fled the country and were sentenced to death by you in their absence; Polystratus was arrested and executed. Take the list, please, and read out their names.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Addressed to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματεύς</foreign> or clerk of the court.</note>
<quote type="names" rend="align(center)"><label>Names.</label>—The following were denounced by Andromachus: Alcibiades, Niciades, Meletus, Archebiades, Archippus, Diogenes, Polystratus, Aristomenes, Oeonias, Panaetius.</quote> </p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">This was the first information, gentlemen; it was due to Andromachus, and implicated the persons mentioned. Now call Diognetus, please.
<quote type="witness" rend="align(indent)">
	<lb/><add><label>Witness</label></add>You were on the commission of inquiry,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An extraordinary board of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζητηταί</foreign> was set up to investigate both the profanation of the Mysteries and the mutilaton of the Hermae; they would act as an advisory committee to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign>.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="15"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">A second information followed. An alien named Teucrus, resident in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, quietly withdrew to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>. From <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> he informed the Council that if immunity were granted him, he was prepared not only to lodge an information with regard to the Mysteries—as one of the participants, he would reveal the names of his companions—but he would also tell what he knew of the mutilation of the Hermae. The Council, which had supreme powers at the time, voted acceptance; and messengers were sent to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> to fetch him. He was brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and on being granted immunity, furnished a list of his associates. No sooner had Teucrus denounced them than they fled the country. Take the list, please, and read out their names. 
<quote type="names" rend="align(center)"><label>Names.</label>—The following were denounced by Teucrus: Phaedrus, Gniphonides, Isonomus, Hephaestodorus, Cephisodorus, himself, Diognetus, Smindyrides, Philocrates, Antiphon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Not, of course, the orator.</note> Teisarchus, Pantacles.</quote></p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Let me remind you, gentlemen, that you are receiving confirmation of these further facts in every detail.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. Diognetus, who had first-hand knowledge, had listened to the recital in silence.</note> </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="16"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">A third information followed. According to the wife of Alcmaeonides—she had previously been married to Damon and was named Agariste—according, as I say, to Alcmaeonides’ wife, Alcibiades, Axiochus, and Adeimantus celebrated Mysteries in Charmides’ house, next to the Olympieum. No sooner had the information been lodged than those concerned left the country to a man. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="17"> 
	<p rend="align(indent)">There was still one more information. According to Lydus, a slave of Pherecles of Themacus, Mysteries were celebrated at the house of his master, Pherecles, at Themacus. He gave a list of those concerned, including my father among them; my father had been present, so Lydus said, but asleep with his head under his cloak. Speusippus, one of the members of the Council, was for handing them all over to the proper court; whereupon my father furnished surieties and brought an action against Speusippus for making an illegal proposal.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Lydus gave his information before the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign>. Speusippus at once proposed that the offenders named be tried by the Heliaea in the usual way. Leogoras protested against his incluson in the list (a) because he had never been near Themacus and (b) because even Lydus did not go so far as to assert that he had had any part in the celebration. He then blocked Speusippus’ proposal by a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign> which had to be settled before the proposal could take effect. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφή</foreign> came before the Heliaea in the usual way; and Leogoras obtained a verdict in his favour. He had, of course, to furnish sureties for his own appearance in the event of his losing his case against Speusippus.</note> The case was tried before six thousand citizens.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This represents the whole of the Heliasts for the year. A jury of this size occurs nowhere else; but there are no good grounds for doubting Andocides’ figures.</note> There were six thousand jurors, I repeat; yet Speusippus failed to gall the votes of two hundred. I may add that my father was induced to stay in the country partly by the entreaties of his relatives in general, but principally by my own. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="18"> 
<p>Kindly call Callias and Stephanus—yes, and call Philippus and Alexippus. Philippus and Alexippus are related to Acumenus and Autocrator, who fled in consequence of the information lodged by Lydus; Autocrator is a nephew of the one, and Acumenus is the other’s uncle. They have little reason to love the man who drove the them from this country, and they should also know better than anyone who it was who caused their exile in the first instance.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. (1) Speusippus, who had initiated proceedings against them, and (2) Lydus, from whom the information had originated.</note> Face the court, gentlemen, and state whether I have been telling the truth. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="19"> 
<p rend="align(center); italic"><label>Witnesses</label></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now that you have heard the facts, gentlemen, and the witnesses have confirmed them for you, let me remind you of the version of those facts which the prosecution had the effrontery to give—for after all, the right way to conduct a defence is to recall the statements of the prosecution and disprove them. According to the prosecution, I myself gave information in the matter of the Mysteries and included my own father in my list of those present: yes, turned informer against my own father. I cannot imagine a more outrageous, a more abominable suggestion. My father was denounced by Pherecles’ slave, Lydus: it was I who persuaded him to remain in 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> instead of escaping into exile—and it was only after numberless entreaties and by clinging to his knees that I did so. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="20"> 
<p>What, pray, was I about in informing against my father, as we are asked to believe that I did, when at the same time I was begging him to remain in 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>—begging him, that is, to let me be guilty of the consequences to himself? Again, we are to suppose that my father himself consented to face a trial which was bound to have one or other of two terrible results for him; if my information against him was deemed true, his blood would be upon my hands: if he himself was acquitted, mine would be upon his; because the law ran that whereas an informer’s claim to immunity should be allowed if his information were true, he should be put to death, if it were not. Yet if there is one thing of which you are all certain, it is the fact that my father and I both escaped with our lives. That could not have happened, if I had informed against my father: either he or I would have had to die. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="21"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Then again, assume that he actually desired to stay. Do you imagine that his friends would have let him do so? Would they have gone bail for him? Would they not have urged him to change his mind? Would they not have begged him to find some place of refuge abroad, where he would be out of harm’s way himself and would avoid causing my death also? </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="22"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But to return to facts: when prosecuting Speusippus for making an illegal proposal, one thing upon which my father insisted repeatedly was that he had never visited Pherecles at Themacus in his life; and he offered the defence the opportunity of examining his slaves under torture<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For the torturing of slaves cf. p. 70. note.</note>; those who were ready to hand over their slaves, he said, ought not to meet with a refusal of the test which they were proposing, when those who were not ready to hand them over were forced to do so. You all know my father’s challenge to be a fact. Now if there is any truth in the prosecution’s assertion, what had Speusippus to reply but: <q rend="double">Why talk of slaves, Leogoras? Has not your son here informed against you? Does not he say that you were at Themacus? Andocides, prove your father guilty, or your chance of a pardon is gone.</q> Was that Speusippus’ natural retort or not, gentlemen? </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="23"> 
<p>I for one think so. In fact, if I ever entered a court, if I was ever mentioned in connexion with the affair, or if there is any recorded information or list containing my name, let alone any for which I was myself responsible, anyone who wishes is welcome to step up here and prove it against me. For my own part, I have never known anyone tell so outrageous or so unconvincing a story. All that was necessary, they imagined, was sufficient effrontery to bring a charge; the possibility of their being refuted did not disturb them in the least. Be consistent, then. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="24"> 
<p>Had this accusation of theirs been true, your anger would have fallen upon me, and you would have considered the severest penalty justified. So now that you see them to be lying, I demand that you look upon them instead as scoundrels—and with good reason too: for if the worst of their charges are shown to be conspicuously false, I shall hardly find it difficult to prove the same of those which are less serious. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="25"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Such, then, were the informations lodged in connexion with the Mysteries; they were, as I say, four in number. I have read you the names of those who went into exile after each, and the witnesses have given their evidence. I shall now do something more to convince you, gentlemen. Of those who went into exile as a result of the profanation of the Mysteries, some died abroad; but others have returned and are living in 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. These last are present in court at my request. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="26">

<p rend="align(indent)">So much for the profanation of the Mysteries, gentlemen, on which the information lodged against me is based and which you are here as initiates to investigate. I have shown that I have committed no act of impiety, that I have never turned informer, that I have never admitted guilt, and that I have not a single offence against the Two Goddesses<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Demeter and Kore, the central figures of the Eleusis-cult.</note> upon my conscience, whether serious or otherwise. And it is vitally important for me to convince you of this; for the stories told you by the prosecution, who treated you to so shrill a recital of bloodcurdling horrors, with their descriptions of past offenders who have made mock of the Two Goddesses and of the fearful end to which they have been brought as a punishment—what, I ask you, have such tales and such crimes to do with me? </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="30"> 
<p>It is I, in fact, who am much more truly the accuser, and they the accused. They have been guilty of impiety; and therefore, I maintain, they deserve death. I, on the other hand, have done no wrong, and therefore I deserve to go unharmed. It would be nothing less than monstrous to vent upon me the wrath which the misdeeds of others have aroused in you, or to let the malicious attack to which I have been subjected weigh more with you than the truth, when you know that it is my enemies who are responsible for it. Obviously anyone who was guilty of an offence such as that with which we are concerned could not clear himself by denying that he had committed it: for the scrutiny to which a defendant’s statements are subjected is formidable indeed when the court already knows the truth. But to me the inquiry into the facts is the very opposite of embarrassing; I have no need to resort to entreaties or appeals for mercy to gain an acquittal upon a charge such as this: I have merely to show the absurdity of the statements of my accusers by reminding you of what actually occurred. </p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="32"> 
<p>Understand, then, that to condemn the innocent for impiety is no less an act of impiety than to acquit the guilty. Indeed, in the name of the Two Goddesses I repeat yet more sternly the charge laid upon you by my accusers, for the sake both of the rites which you have witnessed and of the Greeks who are coming to this city for the festival. If I have committed any act of impiety, if I have admitted guilt, if I have informed against another, or if another has informed against me, then put me to death; I ask no mercy. </p> </div>

By the end of 412 he had identified himself with the oligarchic cause, and was active in trying to procure the return of Alcibiades. He was largely responsible for the installation of the Four Hundred at 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in 411, and did his utmost to have Andocides put to death when he attempted to return to Athens during that year (cf. <bibl n="Andoc. 2.13">Andoc. 2.13-15</bibl>). After the fall of the Four Hundred Peisander fled to Decelea; he was condemned to death in absentia and his property was confiscated. Nothing more is heard of him.

Like Peisander, he escaped to Decelea after their collapse; but he succeeded in effecting his return in 404 when 
<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> ordered the restoration of exiles. He became a member of the Thirty, and was responsible for some of their worst excesses. After their fall nothing more is heard of him. For a sketch of his conduct at this later period see <bibl n="Andoc. 1.101">Andoc. 1.101</bibl>.</note> who were regarded in those days as the most fervent of democrats, were members of the commission of inquiry. These two maintained that the outrage was not the work of a small group of criminals, but an organized attempt to overthrow the popular government: and that therefore inquiries ought still to be pursued as vigorously as ever. As a result, 
	<placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> reached such a state that the lowering of the flag, by the Herald, when summonig a meeting of the Council, was quite as much a signal for the citizens to hurry from the Agora, each in terror of arrest, as it was for the Council to proceed to the Council-chamber.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">There is some doubt about the meaning of this statement. (a) According to Suidas, a flag was hoisted in the Agora before meetings of the Ecclesia anad lowered when they were concluded. If this is the flag referred to here, the meeting of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> is the meeting held immediately after the adjournment of the Ecclesia. The Agora would then be thronged with citizens coming from the Pnyx. (b) Possibly a flag was flown from the roof of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευτήριον</foreign> and taken down when the council was sitting. There is no evidence for this, however; and it is a possible objection that this lowering of the flag during a meeting is precisely the opposite of the custom followed in the case of the Ecclesia. If the first explanation can be accepted we must assume that Andocides is referring only to those meetings of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> which occurred after a sitting of the Ecclesia; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> in fact met daily.</note> </p> </div>

I reminded myself that a number of the offenders responsible for the mutilation had already been executed upon the information lodged by Teucrus, while yet others had escaped into exile and been sentenced to death in their absence.

<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> learned the truth.

<p>I say this, gentlemen, because the chief task confronting me in this trial is to prevent anyone thinking the worse of me on account of my escape: to make first you and then the whole world understand that the explanation of my behaviour from start to finish lay in the desperate plight of 
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and, to a lesser degree, in that of my own family, not in any lack of principles or courage: to make you understand that, in disclosing that Euphiletus had told me, I was actuated solely by my concern for my relatives and friends and by my concern for the state as a whole, motives which I for one consider not a disgrace but a credit.

Yes, I, and I alone, was sending them to their death, if I refused to say that others were to blame; for Diocleides had thrown them into prison by his lies, and they could only be rescued if their countrymen were put in full possession of the facts; therefore I became their murderer if I refused to tell what I had heard.

<p rend="align(indent)">The truth of my account has been attested and it seems to me to contradict the prosecution’s story flatly. The prosecution, you may remember, alleged that the Two Goddesses themselves infatuated me and made me place the bough on the altar in ignorance of the law, in order that I might be punished. But I maintain, gentlemen, that even if every word of the prosecution’s story is true, it was the Goddesses themselves who saved my life. </p> </div>

<p>Suppose that I laid the bough there, and then failed to answer the Herald. Was it not I myself who was bringing about my doom by putting the bough on the altar? And was it not a piece of good fortune, my silence, that saved me, a piece of good fortune for which I clearly had the Two Goddesses to thank? Had the Goddesses desired my death, I ought surely to have confessed that I had laid the bough there, even though I had not done so. As it was, I did not answer, nor had I placed the bough on the altar. </p> </div>

<p>When Eucles informed the Council that there had been no response, Callias rose once more and said that under an ancient law, as officially interpreted on a former occasion by his father, Hipponicus, the penalty for placing a bough in the Eleusinium during the Mysteries was instant death. He added that he had heard that it was I who had put it there. Thereupon Cephalus here leapt to his feet and cried: </p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">And now, gentlemen, you would perhaps like to know what motive Callias had in putting the bough on the altar. I will explain why he tried to trap me.

The relatives concerned put in a claim before the Archon ( <foreign xml:lang="grc" >ἐπιδικασία</foreign>), and if it was not disputed, the Archon adjudged the daughters to them severally according to their degrees of relationship.

<p rend="align(indent)">But you must let me tell you how the son to whom Callias tried to have the daughter of Epilycus awarded was born and acknowledged by his father; it is quite worth hearing, gentlemen. Callias married a daughter of Ischomachus; but he had not been living with her a year before he made her mother his mistress. Was ever man so utterly without shame? He was the priest of the Mother and the Daughter; yet he lived with mother and daughter and kept them both in his house together. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="125"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The thought of the Two Goddesses may not have awoken any shame or fear in Callias; but the daughter of Ischomachus thought death better than an existence where such things went on before her very eyes. She tried to hang herself: but was stopped in the act. Then, when she recovered, she ran away from home; the mother drove out the daughter. Finally Callias grew tired of the mother as well, and drove her out in her turn. She then said she was pregnant by him; but when she gave birth to a son, Callias denied that the child was his. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="126"> 
<p>At that, the woman’s relatives came to the altar at the Apaturia<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Held for three days in Pyanepsion (Oct.-Nov.).

<p rend="align(indent)">Now some time afterwards, gentlemen, he fell in love with the abandoned old hag once more and welcomed her back into his house, while he presented the boy, a grown lad by this time, to the Ceryces, asserting that he was his own son. Calliades opposed his admission; but the Ceryces voted in favour of the law which they have, whereby a father can introduce his son, if he swears that it is his own son whom he is introducing.

<p rend="align(indent)">As a matter of fact, I want to remind you briefly, gentlemen, of a certain incident connected with Callias.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="131"> 
<p>Now in what sense do you think that the saying current in those days proved true? Why, Hipponicus imagined that he had a son in his house; but that son was really an evil spirit, which has upset his wealth, his morals, and his whole life. So it is as Hipponicus’ evil spirit that you must think of Callias. </p> </div>

The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνασιαρχία</foreign> is practically identical with the <foreign xml:lang="grc" >λαμπαδαρχία</foreign>. It involved the provision of torches for the great torch-race at the festival of Hephaestus and the training of the runners.

<p>They have held countless commands, and have won you many a victory over your foes on land and sea. They have held countless other offices and handled public monies; yet not once have they been found guilty of fraud. We have not wronged you, and you have not wronged us. Our house is the oldest in
