                            leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing store</l>

                            and for me—yes, for me—and it is said that he is coming here to proclaim
                            it for the certain knowledge of those who do not already know. They say
                            that he does not conduct this business lightly, </l>

                            you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line.</l>

                            shamefully for deeds so glorious as hers, who, when her own brother had
                            fallen in bloody battle, would not leave him unburied to be devoured by
                            savage dogs, or by any bird. Does she not deserve to receive golden

                            is more precious than your prosperity. What, indeed, is a nobler
                            ornament for children than the fair fame of a thriving father, or for a
                            father than that of his children? </l>

                            word and no other, must be right. For if any man thinks that he alone is
                            wise—that in speech or in mind he has no peer—such a soul, when laid
                            open, is always found empty. </l>

                            even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things,
                            and not to be too rigid. You see how the trees that stand beside the
                            torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their
                            branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all?</l>

                            the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and
                            voyages thereafter with his decking underwater. Father, give way and
                            allow a change from your rage. For if even from me, a younger man, a
                            worthy thought may be supplied, </l>

                            good to learn in addition from those who advise you well.</l>
