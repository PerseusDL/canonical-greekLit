<l n="965">For this was dear to the gods, who were angry, perhaps, with my race from of old. Taking me alone, you could not find a reproach for any crime, in retribution for which I was driven to commit these sins against myself and against my kin. Tell me now: if, by the voice of an oracle, some divine doom was coming on my father,</l>
<l n="970">that he should die by a son's hand, how could you justly reproach me with this, when I was then unborn, when no father had yet begotten me, no mother's womb conceived me? But if, having been born to misery—as I was born—I came to blows with my father and slew him, ignorant of what</l>

<l n="980">For I will not be silent, when you have gone so far in impious speech. Yes, she was my mother, yes—alas, for my miseries! I did not know it, nor did she, and to her shame she bore children to the son whom she had borne.</l>
               <l n="985">But one thing, at least, I know: that you willingly revile her and me, but I did not willingly marry her, and I do not willingly speak now. <milestone unit="para"/>No, I will not be called evil on account of this marriage, nor in the slaying of my father, which you charge me with again and again in bitter insult.</l>
<l n="990">Answer just one thing of those I ask. If, here and now, someone should come up and try to murder you—you, the just one—would you ask if the murderer was your father, or would you revenge yourself on him straightaway?</l>
<l n="995">I think that if your life is dear to you, you would requite the criminal, and not look around for a justification. Such then were the evils into which I came, led by the gods; and in this, I think, my father's soul, could it come back to life, would not contradict me.</l>

<l n="1005">Yet while giving such generous praise, you forget that if any land knows how to worship the gods with honors, this land excels in that. It is from her that you had planned to steal me, a suppliant and an old man, and tried to seize me, having already carried off my daughters.</l>

               <milestone unit="para"/><l n="1590">When he had come to the Descending Way, which is bound by steps of bronze to earth's deep roots, he paused at one of the many branching paths near the basin in the rock, where the faithful covenant of Theseus and Peirithous has its memorial.</l>
               <l n="1595">He stood midway between that basin and the Leaping stone, and between the hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb; then he sat down and loosened his filthy clothing. <milestone unit="para"/>And then he called his daughters, and asked them to bring water from some flowing source, so that he might wash and make a drink-offering.</l>
               <l n="1600">They went to the hill which was in view, the hill of Demeter who guards the tender plants, and in a short time brought what their father had commanded.

<l n="1605">and nothing that he required was still undone, then Zeus of the Underworld sent forth his thunder, and the maidens shuddered as they heard. They fell weeping at their father's knees, and did not cease from beating their breast, and from wailing loud.</l>
               <milestone unit="para"/><l n="1610">When he heard their sudden bitter cry, he put his arms around them and said: <q type="spoken">My children, on this day your father no longer exists. Now I have perished utterly, and no longer will you bear the burden of tending me,</q></l>
<l n="1615"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">which was no light one, I well know, my children. Yet just one word turns all those toils to nothing: you have been treated as friends by no one more than by this man; and now you will have me with you no longer, through all your days to come.</q></l>

               <l n="1625">felt hair rising from the sudden terror. The god called him again and again: <q type="spoken">Oedipus, Oedipus, why do you delay our going? Too long you have been lingering.</q> 
                  <milestone unit="para"/>And when he perceived that he was called by the god,</l>
<l n="1630">he asked that lord Theseus should come to him; and when he did, he said: <q type="spoken">Friend, give me the sworn pledge of your right hand for my children; and you, my daughters, for him. Promise never to betray them by your own free will, but always to accomplish whatever you think for their benefit.</q></l>
               <l n="1635">And he, as a man of noble spirit, without lamentation swore to keep that promise to the stranger. <milestone unit="para"/>When Theseus had done this, straightway Oedipus felt for his children with blind hands, and said:</l>
<l n="1640"><q type="spoken">Children, you must bear up nobly in your hearts and depart from this place; do not consider it just to look upon what is not right, or to hear such speech as you may not hear. Go in haste; let only Theseus be entitled to remain to learn of those things which will be done.</q></l>
               <milestone unit="para"/><l n="1645">So he spoke, and everyone of us listened; with streaming tears and mourning we followed the maidens away. But when we had gone off, very soon we looked back and saw that Oedipus was nowhere any more and our lord was alone,</l>
<l n="1650">holding his hand in front of his face to screen his eyes, as if he had seen some terrifying sight, one that no one could endure to behold. And then after a short time,</l>
               <l n="1655">we saw him adore together the earth and <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> of the gods in the same prayer. 
                  <milestone unit="para"/>But by what fate Oedipus perished, no man can tell, except Theseus alone. It was no fiery thunderbolt of the god that removed him,</l>
<l n="1660">nor any rising of whirlwind from the sea; it was either an escort from the gods, or else the dark world of the dead kindly split open to receive him. The man passed away without lamentation or sickness or suffering, and beyond all mortal men he was wondrous.</l>
