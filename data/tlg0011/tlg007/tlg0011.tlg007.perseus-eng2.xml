<l n="965">For this was dear to the gods, who were angry, perhaps, with my race from of old. Taking me alone, you could not find a reproach for any crime, in retribution for which I was driven to commit these sins against myself and against my kin. Tell me now: if, by the voice of an oracle, some divine doom was coming on my father,</l>
<l n="970">that he should die by a son’s hand, how could you justly reproach me with this, when I was then unborn, when no father had yet begotten me, no mother’s womb conceived me? But if, having been born to misery—as I was born—I came to blows with my father and slew him, ignorant of what</l>

<l n="980">For I will not be silent, when you have gone so far in impious speech. Yes, she was my mother, yes—alas, for my miseries! I did not know it, nor did she, and to her shame she bore children to the son whom she had borne.</l>
               <l n="985">But one thing, at least, I know: that you willingly revile her and me, but I did not willingly marry her, and I do not willingly speak now. <milestone unit="para"/>No, I will not be called evil on account of this marriage, nor in the slaying of my father, which you charge me with again and again in bitter insult.</l>
<l n="990">Answer just one thing of those I ask. If, here and now, someone should come up and try to murder you—you, the just one—would you ask if the murderer was your father, or would you revenge yourself on him straightaway?</l>
<l n="995">I think that if your life is dear to you, you would requite the criminal, and not look around for a justification. Such then were the evils into which I came, led by the gods; and in this, I think, my father’s soul, could it come back to life, would not contradict me.</l>

<l n="1315">then comes the son of Oeneus, Aetolian Tydeus; Eteoclus is third, of <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> birth; the fourth, Hippomedon, is sent by Talaos, his father; while Capaneus, the fifth, boasts that he will burn <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to the ground with fire; and sixth, Arcadian Parthenopaeus rushes to the war.</l>

<l n="1605">and nothing that he required was still undone, then Zeus of the Underworld sent forth his thunder, and the maidens shuddered as they heard. They fell weeping at their father’s knees, and did not cease from beating their breast, and from wailing loud.</l>

<l n="1615"><q type="spoken" rend="merge">which was no light one, I well know, my children. Yet just one word turns all those toils to nothing: you have been treated as friends by no one more than by this man; and now you will have me with you no longer, through all your days to come.</q></l>

               <l n="1625">felt hair rising from the sudden terror. The god called him again and again: <q type="spoken">Oedipus, Oedipus, why do you delay our going? Too long you have been lingering.</q> 
                  <milestone unit="para"/>And when he perceived that he was called by the god,</l>
<l n="1630">he asked that lord Theseus should come to him; and when he did, he said: <q type="spoken">Friend, give me the sworn pledge of your right hand for my children; and you, my daughters, for him. Promise never to betray them by your own free will, but always to accomplish whatever you think for their benefit.</q></l>
               <l n="1635">And he, as a man of noble spirit, without lamentation swore to keep that promise to the stranger. <milestone unit="para"/>When Theseus had done this, straightway Oedipus felt for his children with blind hands, and said:</l>
<l n="1640"><q type="spoken">Children, you must bear up nobly in your hearts and depart from this place; do not consider it just to look upon what is not right, or to hear such speech as you may not hear. Go in haste; let only Theseus be entitled to remain to learn of those things which will be done.</q></l>
               <milestone unit="para"/><l n="1645">So he spoke, and everyone of us listened; with streaming tears and mourning we followed the maidens away. But when we had gone off, very soon we looked back and saw that Oedipus was nowhere any more and our lord was alone,</l>

               <l n="1655">we saw him adore together the earth and <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> of the gods in the same prayer.
