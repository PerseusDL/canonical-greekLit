               <speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
               <l n="1" resp="p">There is a saying among men, put forth long ago, that you cannot judge a mortal’s life and know whether it is good or bad until he dies.  But well I know, even before I have passed away to Hades’ domain, that my life is ill-fortuned and heavy.</l>
<l n="5" resp="p">For I, while still dwelling in the house of my father Oeneus at <placeName key="perseus,Pleuron">Pleuron</placeName>, had such fear of marriage as never any woman of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> had.  For my suitor was a river-god, Achelous,</l>
<l n="10" resp="p">who in three shapes was always asking me from my father—coming now as a bull in visible form, now as a serpent, sheeny and coiled, now ox-faced with human trunk, while from his thick-shaded beard wellheads of fountain-water sprayed.</l>
<l n="15" resp="p">In the expectation that such a suitor would get me, I was always praying in my misery that I might die, before I should ever approach that marriage-bed.
               <milestone unit="para" resp="p"/>But at last, to my joy, the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena came and</l>
<l n="20" resp="p">closed with him in combat and delivered me.  The manner of their fighting I cannot clearly recount.  I know it not, but if there be anyone who watched that sight without trembling, he might give an account of it.  But I, as I sat there, was struck with terror,</l>
<l n="25" resp="p">lest my beauty should win me sorrow in the end.  But Zeus, Arbiter of Contests, accomplished a good ending—if indeed it was good.  For since being joined with Heracles as his chosen bride, I nourish one fear after another in my anxiety for him.  One night brings distress,</l>
<l n="30" resp="p">and the next night, in turn, drives it out.  Children, furthermore, were born to us, whom at the time he looked at only as the farmer looks at a distant field, visiting it only once to sow seed and once to reap.  Such was the manner of his life, ever sending him</l>
<l n="35" resp="p">to and from our home in servitude to some master.
<milestone unit="para" resp="p"/>But now, when he has risen above those trials—now it is that my fear is keenest.  For ever since he slew the mighty Iphitus, we have been dwelling here in <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, refugees</l>
<l n="40" resp="p">in the home of a foreign host.  But where Heracles is, no one knows.  I only know that he is gone, and has caused me sharp pain for him.  I am almost sure that he has come to some suffering.  The interval has not been brief;  rather, he is unheard from ten months already,</l>
<l n="45" resp="p">plus another five.  Yes, there has been some terrible misfortune.  That tablet which he left with me before departing suggests it to me.  I often pray to the gods that I did not receive it to my misfortune.</l>

<l n="55" resp="p">you do not send one of them to seek your husband, especially Hyllus?  It would be appropriate to send him, if he cared for his father’s sake that he be deemed to fare well.  Here he is now, dashing to the house in timely stride.  So if in your eyes I speak in season,</l>

<milestone unit="para" resp="p"/>I have received a maiden—or, I believe, no longer a maiden, but an experienced woman—into my home, just as a mariner takes on cargo, a merchandise to wreck my peace of mind.  And now we are two, a pair waiting under</l>
<l n="540" resp="p">a single bedspread for one man’s embrace.  Such is the reward that Heracles has sent me—he whom I called true and loyal—for guarding his home through all that long time.  I do not know how to be angry with him, even though he is infected with this disease.</l>
<l n="545" resp="p">But, then again, to live with her, sharing the same marriage—what woman could endure it?  For I see that the flower of her youth is blossoming, while mine is fading.  The eyes of men love to pluck off the bloom of youth, but they turn their steps from the old.</l>

<l n="555" resp="p">I had a gift, an old one given to me by a monster of long ago, and kept it hidden in a bronze urn.  While yet a girl, I took this gift from the shaggy-chested Nessus—from his lifeblood, as he lay dying.  He is the one who used to carry men</l>
<l n="560" resp="p">in his arms for hire across the deep current of the Evenus, using no oar for conveyance, nor ship’s sail.  He carried me, too, on his shoulders, when at my father’s sending, I first departed with Heracles as his wife.  When I was in midstream,</l>
<l n="565" resp="p">he touched me with lewd hands.  I shrieked, and straightaway the son of Zeus turned round and with his hands shot a feathered arrow that whistled right through his chest to the lungs.  As he passed away the monster spoke these few words:  “Child of aged Oeneus,</l>
<l n="570" resp="p">you will have this benefit from my ferrying, if you obey me, since you were the last whom I carried.  If you gather with your hands the blood clotted round my wound, at the place where the Hydra, <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName>’s monstrous growth, imbued the arrow with black gall,</l>
<l n="575" resp="p">you will have a charm for the heart of Heracles, so that he will never look upon any woman and love her more than you.”

May deeds of wicked daring always be far from my thoughts and from my knowledge, as I detest the women who attempt them!  But if in any way I may prevail against this girl by love-spells</l>

But as I am going back into the house, I see a thing inexplicable by words and beyond the knowledge of the human mind to understand.</l>
<l n="695" resp="p">For somehow I happened to have thrown the ball of wool, with which I had been anointing the robe, into the full blaze of the sun’s rays.  As it grew warm, it ran all into confusion, and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing in appearance so much as</l>

<l n="775" resp="p">But he, unfortunate one, all-unknowing, said that he had brought your gift from you alone, just as it had been sent.  When Heracles heard it, just as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the foot where the ankle bends in the socket</l>
