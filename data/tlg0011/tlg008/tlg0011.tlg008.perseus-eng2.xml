               The <title>Tracking Satyrs</title> is a substantial fragment of a satyr play by Sophocles, discovered at <placeName key="tgn,7001267">Oxyrhynchus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> in <date when="1907">1907</date>.  We have some 400 lines of a play that was probably about 800 lines long.  The plot is the same as that of the <bibl n="HH 4">
                     <title>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</title>
                  </bibl>:  Apollo’s cows have been stolen, and the culprit turns out to be his newborn brother Hermes.

                     <title>The Ichneutae of Sophocles</title>, Richard Johnson Walker, London:  1919</bibl>.  Walker established his own text for the fragment, filling in many of the gap reason="lost"s.  I have occasionally adopted his supplements, but have basically translated the text of the first publication of the play, <bibl>
