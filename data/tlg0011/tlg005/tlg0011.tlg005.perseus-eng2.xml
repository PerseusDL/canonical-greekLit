               <l n="1">Son of him who once commanded our forces at <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>, son of Agamemnon!—now you may survey all that your heart has desired for so long.  There is the ancient <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> of your yearning,</l>
<l n="5">that consecrated land from which the gad-fly drove the daughter of Inachus; there, Orestes,
                     is the Lycean market place, named from the wolf-slaying god; there on the left
                     is Hera’s famous temple; and in this place to which we have come, know that you
                     see <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, the rich in gold,</l>
<l n="10">and here the house of Pelops’ heirs, so often stained with bloodshed. Long ago from here,
                     away from the murder of your father, I carried you for her whose blood is
                     yours, your sister, and saved you and reared you up to manhood to be the
                     avenger of your murdered father.<milestone unit="para"/>
                  </l>
<l n="15">Now, therefore, Orestes, and you, best of allies, Pylades, our plan of action must be
                     quickly laid; for look, already the sun’s bright ray is stirring the birds’
                     songs into clarity, and the kindly darkness of the stars is spent.</l>
<l n="20">Before, then, anyone comes out from the house, we must make our plans, since we are at the point where it is no longer opportune to hesitate, but it is the moment for action.</l>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Orestes</speaker>
               <l n="23">True friend and follower, how well you prove your loyalty to our house!</l>
<l n="25">Just as a thoroughbred mount, even if advanced in years, does not lose courage in danger, but pricks up his ears, so you speed us forward and follow in the first ranks.  I will tell you, then, what I have determined.</l>
<l n="30">Listen closely to my words and correct me, if I miss the mark in any way.<milestone unit="para"/>When I went to the Pythian oracle to learn how I might avenge my father on his murderers,</l>
<l n="35">Phoebus gave me the commandment which you will now hear: that alone, and by stealth,
                     without the aid of arms or large numbers, I should carry off my right hand’s
                     just slaughters. Accordingly, since I received this divine declaration, you
                     must go into that house there</l>
<l n="40">when opportunity gives you entrance, and learn all that is happening, so that you may report to us out of sure knowledge.  Your age and the lapse of time will prevent them from recognizing you;  they will never suspect who you are with that silvered hair.  Let your story be that you are a Phocian stranger</l>
<l n="45">sent by Phanoteus, since he is the greatest of their allies.  Tell them, and affirm it with your oath, that Orestes has perished by a fatal chance, hurled at the Pythian games</l>
<l n="50">from his speeding chariot. Let that be the substance of your message. Meanwhile, we will
                     first crown my father’s tomb as the god ordered with libations and the
                     luxuriant tribute of a severed lock; then we will return here, bearing in our
                     hands an urn of hammered bronze</l>
<l n="55">—now hidden, as you no doubt know, in the brushwood—so that we may gladden them with the false tidings that this body of mine exists no more, but has been consumed with fire and reduced to ashes.  How does it hurt me, when by feigned death</l>
<l n="60">I find true life and win renown?  No word is ill-omened, I trust, if it yields gain.  For often before now I have seen clever men die in false report;  then, when they return home, they are held in greater honor.</l>
<l n="65">And so for myself I trust that as a result of this rumor I, too, shall live, shining down like a star upon my enemies.<milestone unit="para"/>But you, O my fatherland and native gods of my soil, receive me with good fortune in this journey, and you also, house of my ancestors,</l>
<l n="70">since I come by divine mandate to cleanse you as justice demands.  Do not dismiss me from this land in dishonor, but grant that I may rule over my possessions and restore my house!<milestone unit="para"/>I have said enough.  Go now, old one, and take care to watch over your task.</l>
<l n="75">The two of us will depart;  for so opportunity bids, chief ruler of every enterprise for men.</l>

<l n="435">No! To the winds with them! Or cover them in a deep, dusty hole, where not one of them

Then fall down and pray that he himself may come in kindness to us from the world below, a helper against our enemies;</l>

<l n="705">with chestnut colts;  a Magnesian was the seventh;  the eighth, with white horses, was of Aenian stock;  the ninth hailed from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, built of gods;  there was a Boeotian too, making the tenth chariot.  They took their stations where the appointed umpires</l>
<l n="710">placed them by lot and ranged the cars.  Then at the sound of the bronze trumpet, they started.  All shouted to their horses, and shook the reins in their hands;  the whole course was filled with the clatter of rattling chariots;  and the dust flew upward.</l>
<l n="715">All of them in a confused throng kept plying their goads unsparingly, so that one of them might pass the wheel-hubs and the snorting steeds of his rivals;  for both at their backs and at their rolling wheels the breath of the horses foamed and smattered.</l>
<l n="720">Orestes, driving close to the near edge of the turning-post, almost grazed it with his
                     wheel each time and, giving rein to the trace-horse on the right, he checked
                     the horse on the inner side. To this point, all the chariots still stood
                     upright. But then the Aenian’s</l>
<l n="725">hard-mouthed colts carried him out of control as they passed out of the turn from the sixth into the seventh lap and dashed their foreheads against the rig of the Barcaean.  Next, as a result of this one mishap, the cars kept smashing and colliding with each other, and the whole</l>
<l n="730">race-ground of <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName> swelled with shipwrecked chariots.</l>

               <l n="731">Seeing this, the clever charioteer from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> drew aside and paused, allowing the equestrian flood to pass in mid-crest.  Orestes was driving last, keeping his horses</l>
<l n="735">behind, as his trust was in the race’s end. But when he sees that the Athenian is alone
                     left in, he sends a shrill cry ringing through the ears of his swift colts, and
                     gives chase. Bringing yoke level with yoke the two of them raced, first one
                     man, then the other,</l>
<l n="740">showing his head in front of the other’s chariot. Up to now the ill-fated Orestes had
                     driven upright safely through every circuit, upright in his upright car. But
                     then he slackened his left rein while the horse was turning and unwittingly
                     struck the edge of the pillar,</l>
<l n="745">breaking the axle-box in two.  He spilled forward over the chariot-rail and was caught in the trim reins, and as he fell to the ground, his colts were scattered into the middle of the course.<milestone unit="para"/>But when the crowd saw that he had fallen</l>
<l n="750">from the chariot, a cry of pity went up for the young man who had done such deeds and was allotted such bad fortune—now dashed against the earth, now tossed with his feet to the sky until the charioteers with difficulty reigned in the gallop of his horses and</l>
<l n="755">freed him, so covered with blood that no friend who saw it would have known the pitiful corpse.  Immediately they burned him on a pyre, and chosen men of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> now bring the sad dust of that mighty form in a small urn of bronze,</l>
<l n="760">so that he may find due burial in his fatherland.<milestone unit="para"/>Such is my story—it is grievous even to hear, but for us witnesses who looked on, it was the greatest of sorrows that these eyes have seen.

<l n="895">and that his sepulchre was encircled with garlands of all flowers that grow.  I was astonished at the sight, and peered about lest somehow someone should approach close to me.  But when I perceived that all the place was in stillness,</l>
<l n="900">I crept nearer to the tomb, and on the mound’s edge I saw a lock of hair, freshly
                        severed.<milestone unit="para"/>And the very moment I see it—ah me!—a
                     familiar image rushes into my mind, and I feel that I am looking at a token of
                     him whom I most love, Orestes.</l>
<l n="905">Then I lift it in my hands and make no sound of bad omen, but the tears of joy straightaway fill my eyes.  Even now I know well, just as I knew then, that this fair tribute has come from no one but him.  Whom else does that tomb concern, save me and you?</l>
<l n="910">And I did not make those offerings, I know, nor did you. How could you, when you cannot
                     leave this house even to worship the gods without later regretting it? Nor,
                     again, does our mother’s heart incline to do such deeds, nor could she have
                     done so without our knowledge.<milestone unit="para"/>
                  </l>
<l n="915">No, these offerings are from Orestes!  Come, dear sister, have courage!  Not always does the same fortune, it is true, attend the same individuals.  Ours was once to be despised, but today, perhaps, will seal the promise of much good.</l>
