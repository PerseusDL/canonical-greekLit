             <stage rend="italic">Before the palace of Oedipus in <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>.  Suppliants of all ages are seated on the steps of the altars.  Oedipus enters, in the robes of a king: for a moment he gazes silently on the groups at the altars, then speaks.</stage>

               <speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
               <l n="1">My children, latest-born wards of old Cadmus, why do you sit before me like this with wreathed branches of suppliants, while the city reeks with incense,</l>
<l n="5">rings with prayers for health and cries of woe?  I thought it unbefitting, my children, to hear these things from the mouths of others, and have come here myself, I, Oedipus renowned by all.  Tell me, then, venerable old man—since it is proper that you</l>
<l n="10">speak for these—in what mood you sit here, one of fear or of desire?  Be sure that I will gladly give you all my help.  I would be hard-hearted indeed if I did not pity such suppliants as these.</l>

               <l n="14">Oedipus, ruler of my land, you see the age of those who sit</l>
<l n="15">on your altars—some, nestlings still too tender for flight, others, bowed with age, priests, like me of Zeus, and some, these here, the chosen youth.  The rest of the folk sit</l>
<l n="20">with wreathed branches in the market-place, and before the shrines of Pallas, and where Ismenus gives answer by fire.  For the city, as you yourself see, is now sorely vexed, and can no longer lift her head from beneath the angry waves of death.</l>
<l n="25">A blight has fallen on the fruitful blossoms of the land, the herds among the pastures, the barren pangs of women.  And the flaming god, the malign plague, has swooped upon us, and ravages the town: he lays waste to the house of Cadmus, but enriches Hades with</l>
<l n="30">groans and tears. It is not because we rank you with the gods that I and these children
                     are suppliants at your hearth, but because we deem you the first among men in
                     life’s common fortunes and in dealings with the divinities:</l>
<l n="35">when you came to the city of the Cadmeans, you freed us from the tax that we rendered to the hard songstress, and that when you knew no more than anyone else, nor had you been taught, but rather by the assistance of a god, as the story goes, you uplifted our life.</l>
<l n="40">Now, Oedipus, king glorious in our eyes, we, your suppliants, beseech you to find some defence for us, whether you hear it from some divine omen, or learn of it from some mortal.  For I see that the outcome of the councils of experienced men</l>
<l n="45">most often have effect.  On, best of mortals, uplift our state! On, guard your fame, since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal.  Let us not remember of your reign that</l>
<l n="50">we were first restored and then cast down: lift this state so that it falls no more!  With good omen you provided us that past happiness: show yourself the same now too, since if you are to rule this land just as you do now, it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland.</l>
<l n="55">Neither walled town nor ship is anything, if it is empty and no men dwell within.</l>

<l n="65">Thus you are not awakening me from sleep: no, be sure that I have wept many tears, wandered far and wide in my thought.  I have made use of the only remedy which I could find after close consideration: I sent my relative</l>
<l n="70">Creon, Menoeceus’ son, to Apollo’s Pythian residence to learn what we might do or say to
                     protect this city. And now, when the lapse of days is reckoned, I am troubled

               <l n="216">You pray.  And in answer to your prayer, if you will give a loyal reception to my words and minister to your own disease, you may hope to find help and relief from woes.  These words I will speak publicly, as one who was a stranger to the report,</l>
<l n="220">a stranger to the deed.  I would not go far on the trail if I were tracing it alone, without a clue.  But as it is—since it was only after the event that I was counted a Theban among Thebans—to you, Cadmeans all, I do thus proclaim: Whoever knows</l>
<l n="225">by whom Laius son of Labdacus was slain, I order him to declare all to me.  And if he is afraid, I order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself: he will suffer no other punishment, but will only leave this land, unhurt.</l>
<l n="230">If anyone knows the assassin to be an alien, from another land, let him not keep silent.  I will reward him, and my thanks shall rest with him besides.  But if he keeps silent, if anyone, through fear, seeks to screen himself or a friend from my orders,</l>
<l n="235">then hear what I shall do:  I charge you that no resident of this land, which I rule, give shelter to or address that murderer, whoever he is, or make him a partner in prayer or sacrifice,</l>
<l n="240">or give him a share of the lustral rite.  Ban him from your houses, all of you, knowing that this is the defilement, as the oracle of the Pythian god has recently shown to me.  In this way</l>
<l n="245">I am an ally both to the god and to the dead man.  And I pray solemnly that the slayer, whoever he is, whether he alone is guilty or he has partners, may, in the horrible way he deserves, wear out his unblest life. And for myself I pray that if he should,</l>
<l n="250">with my knowledge, become a resident of my house, I may suffer the same things which I have just called down on others.  And I order you to make all these words good, for my sake, for the sake of the god, and for the sake of our land, thus rendered unfruitful and ungodly.</l> <milestone unit="card" resp="p" n="255"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><l n="255">For even if the matter had not been urged upon us by a god,
it still would not have been fit that you should leave the guilt unpunished as it is, when one so noble—and he your king—had perished.  You should have searched it out.  But now, since I hold the powers which he once held,</l>
<l n="260">possessing his bed and the wife who bore his children, and since, had his hope of offspring not been unsuccessful, children born of one mother would have tied us with a common bond—as it was, fate swooped upon his head—I will uphold this cause, as though it were that of my own father,</l>
<l n="265">and will leave no stone unturned in my search for the one who shed the blood, for the honor of the son of Labdacus and of Polydorus and the elder Cadmus and Agenor of old.
<milestone unit="para"/>And for those who do not obey me, I pray that the gods</l>

                     the envy in your keeping, if for the sake of this office which the city has
                     entrusted to me, a gift unsought,</l>
<l n="385">Creon the trustworthy, Creon, my old friend, has crept upon me by stealth, yearning to overthrow me, and has suborned such a scheming juggler as this, a tricky quack, who has eyes only for profit, but is blind in his art!</l>
<l n="390">Come, tell me, where have you proved yourself a seer? Why, when the watchful dog who wove
                     dark song was here, did you say nothing to free the people? Yet the riddle, at
                     least, was not for the first comer to read: there was need of a seer’s
                     help,</l>
<l n="395">and you were discovered not to have this art, either from birds, or known from some god.  But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds.  It is I whom you are trying to oust, assuming that</l>
<l n="400">you will have great influence in Creon’s court. But I think that you and the one who
                     plotted these things will rue your zeal to purge the land: if you did not seem
                     to be an old man, you would have learned to your cost how haughty you are.</l>

                     client. And I tell you, since you have taunted my blindness, that though you

                     dwell, or with whom.</l>
<l n="415">Do you know who your parents are? You have been an unwitting enemy to your own kin, both

                     haste, with darkness upon those eyes of yours which now can see.</l>
<l n="420">What place will be harbor to your cries, what part of all Cithaeron will not ring with them soon, when you have learned the meaning of the nuptials in which, within that house, you found a fatal haven, after a voyage so fair?  And you have not guessed at a throng of other ills</l>

<l n="585">choose to rule amid terrors rather than in unruffled peace, granted that he is to have the same powers.  Now I, for one, have by nature no yearning to rule as a king rather than to do kingly deeds, and neither does any man I know who has a sound mind.</l>
               <l n="590">For now I attain all everything from you without fear, but, if I were ruler myself, I would have to do much that went against my own pleasure.

<l n="595">that I desire other honors than those which bring profit.  Now, every man has a greeting for me; now, all that have a request of you crave to speak with me, since in me lies all their hope of success.  Why then should I give up these things and take those others?</l>
<l n="600">No mind will become false while it is wise.  No, I am no lover of such a policy, and if another put it into action, I could never bear to go along with him.  And, in proof of this, first go to <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, and ask whether I brought a true report of the oracle.</l>
<l n="605">Then next, if you have found that I have planned anything in concert with the soothsayer, take and slay me, by the sentence not of one mouth, but of two—by my own no less than yours.  But do not assume my guilt on unproven inference.  It is not just to judge bad men good at random,</l>
<l n="610">or good men bad.  I think that casting off a true friend is for a man like casting away the life in his own bosom, which he most loves.  You will surely learn about these affairs in time, since time alone reveals a just man.</l>

               <l n="707">Then absolve yourself of the things about which you are speaking.  Listen to me, and take comfort in learning that nothing of mortal birth shares in the science of the seer.</l>
<l n="710">I will give you a pithy proof of this.  An oracle came to Laius once—I will not say from Phoebus himself, but from his ministers—saying that he would suffer his doom at the hands of the child to be born to him and me.</l>
<l n="715">And Laius—as, at least, the rumor goes—was murdered one day by foreign robbers at a place
                     where the three highways meet. And the child’s birth was not yet three days
                     past, when Laius pinned his ankles together and had him thrown, by others’
                     hands, on a remote mountain.</l>
<l n="720">So, in that case, Apollo did not bring it to pass that the child should become the slayer
                     of his father, or that Laius should suffer that which he feared, death at the
                     hands of his child: thus the messages of the seer’s art had mapped out the
                     future. Pay them no regard. Whatever necessary event</l>
<l n="725">the god seeks, he himself will easily bring to light.</l>

               <l n="771">It will not be kept from you, now that my forebodings have advanced so far.  To whom more than to you would I speak in suffering such a fortune as this?  My father was Polybus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,</l>
<l n="775">my mother the Dorian Merope.  I was considered the greatest of the folk in that town, until a chance event befell me, worthy, indeed, of wonder, though not of my overreaction regarding it.  At a banquet, a man drunk with wine</l>
<l n="780">cast it at me that I was not the true son of my father.  And I, vexed, restrained myself for that day as best as I could, but on the next went to my mother and father and questioned them.  They were angry at the one who had let this taunt fly.</l>
<l n="785">So I had comfort about them, but the matter rankled in my heart, for such a rumor still
                     spread widely. I went to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>
                     without my parents’ knowledge, and Phoebus sent me forth disappointed of the
                     knowledge for which I had come,</l>
<l n="790">but in his response set forth other things, full of sorrow and terror and woe: that I was
                     fated to defile my mother’s bed, that I would reveal to men a brood which they
                     could not endure to behold, and that I would slay the father that sired me.
                     When I heard this, I turned in flight from the land of <placeName

<l n="800">Now, lady, I will tell you the truth.  When on my journey I was near those three roads, there I met a herald, and a man in a carriage drawn by colts, as you have described.  The leader and the old man</l>
<l n="805">himself tried to thrust me rudely from the path.  Then, in anger, I struck the one pushing me aside, the driver, and the old man, when he saw this, watched for the moment I was passing, and from his carriage, brought his double goad straight down on my head.</l>
<l n="810">Yet he was paid back with interest: with one swift blow from the staff in this hand he rolled right out of the carriage onto his back.  I slew every one of them.  But if this stranger had any tie of kinship to Laius,</l>
<l n="815">who is now more wretched than this man before you?  What mortal could be proved more hateful to the gods?  No stranger, no citizen, is allowed to receive him at home, it is unlawful for anyone to accost him, and all must push him from their homes.  And this—this curse—</l>
<l n="820">was laid on me by no other mouth than my own.  And I pollute the bed of the slain man with the hands by which he perished.  Am I now vile?  Oh, am I not utterly unclean, seeing that I must be banished, and in banishment neither see my own people,</l>
<l n="825">nor set foot in my own land, or else be joined in wedlock to my mother, and slay my father Polybus, who sired and reared me? Then would he who judged these things to be sent down by some cruel divinity not be right about Oedipus?</l>
<l n="830">Prevent, prevent, you pure and awful gods, me from ever seeing that day!  No, may I be swept away from all men, before I see myself visited with that brand of doom.

For I think that neither the Ister nor the <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName> could wash this house clean, so many are the ills that it shrouds, or will soon bring to light, ills wrought not unwittingly, but on purpose.</l>

               <l n="1237">By her own hand.  You will not suffer the worst part of the painful event, since you do not behold the events.  Nevertheless, so far as my memory serves,</l>
<l n="1240">you will learn that unhappy woman’s fate. <milestone unit="para"/>When, frantic, she
                     passed within the vestibule, she rushed straight towards her marriage couch,
                     clutching her hair with the fingers of both hands. Once within the chamber,</l>
<l n="1245">she dashed the doors together behind her, then called on the name of Laius, long since a corpse, thinking of that son, born long ago, by whose hand the father was slain, leaving the mother to breed accursed offspring with his own child.  And she bewailed the marriage in which, wretched woman, she had given birth to a twofold brood,</l>
<l n="1250">husband by husband, children by her child.  And how she perished is more than I know.  For with a shriek Oedipus burst in, and did not allow us to watch her woe until the end:  on him, as he rushed around, our eyes were set.</l>
<l n="1255">To and fro he went, asking us to give him a sword, asking where he could find the wife who was no wife, but a mother whose womb had borne both him and his children.  And in his frenzy a power greater than mortal man was his guide, for it was none of us mortals who were near.</l>
<l n="1260">With a dread cry, as though someone beckoned him on, he sprang at the double doors, forced the bending bolts from the sockets, and rushed into the room.  There we beheld the woman hanging by the neck in a twisted noose of swinging cords.</l>
<l n="1265">And when he saw her, with a dread deep cry he released the halter by which she hung.  And when the hapless woman was stretched out on the ground, then the sequel was horrible to see:  for he tore from her raiment the golden brooches with which she had decorated herself,</l>
<l n="1270">and lifting them struck his own eye-balls, uttering words like these:  No longer will you behold such horrors as I was suffering and performing! Long enough have you looked on those whom you ought never to have seen, having failed in the knowledge of those whom I yearned to know—henceforth you shall be dark!</l>
<l n="1275">With such a dire refrain, he struck his eyes with raised hand not once but often.  At each blow the bloody eye-balls bedewed his beard, and sent forth not sluggish drops of gore, but all at once a dark shower of blood came down like hail.</l>
               <l n="1280">From the deeds of the two of them such ills have broken forth, not on one alone, but with mingled woe for man and wife.  The old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once happiness indeed.  But now today lamentation, ruin, death, shame,</l> <milestone unit="card" resp="p" n="1285"/>

<l n="1290">in order to banish himself from the land and not to put the house under his own curse by waiting here.  And yet he lacks strength, and one to guide his steps, for the anguish is more than he can bear.  He will soon show this to you: look, the bars of the gates are withdrawn,</l>

<l n="1510">Promise, noble man, and touch them with your hand.  To you, children, I would have given much counsel, if your minds were mature.  But now pray that you may live where occasion allows, and that the life which is your lot may be happier than your father’s.</l>
