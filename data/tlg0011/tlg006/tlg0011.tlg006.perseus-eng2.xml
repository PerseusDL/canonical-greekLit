<l n="5">long ago the native of Malis, Poeas’ son, on the express command of the two chieftains to do so, because his foot was all running with a gnawing disease.  Neither libation nor burnt sacrifice could be attempted by us in peace, but with his wild, ill-omened cries</l>
<l n="10">he filled the whole camp continually with shrieking, moaning.  But what need is there to speak of that?  The time is not ripe for too many words, lest he even learn that I am here, and I so waste the whole ruse whereby I think soon to take him.</l>
<l n="15">Come, it is your task to serve as my ally in what remains, and to seek where in this region there is a cave with two mouths.  During cold weather it provides two seats facing the sun, while in summer a breeze wafts sleep through the tunnelled chamber.</l>
<l n="20">And a little below, on the left hand, perhaps, you will see water rising from a spring, if it has not failed.  Go there silently, and signal to me whether he still  dwells in this same place, or is to be found elsewhere, so that the rest of my plan may be explained by me, heard by you,</l>
<l n="25">and sped by the joint effort of us both.</l>

               <l n="54a" part="F">You must cheat the mind of Philoctetes by means of a story</l>
<l n="55">told as you converse with him.  When he asks you who and from where you are, say that you are the son of Achilles—it is not in that detail that you will cheat him.  But tell him you are sailing homeward, and have left the fleet of the Achaean warriors, after coming to hate them with unbounded hatred.</l>
<l n="60">Give him this reason:  when, with no other hope of taking <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, they had summoned you by their prayers to come from home, they judged you not worthy of the arms of Achilles, not worthy to receive them—even though you had come and were claiming them by right—but instead handed them over to Odysseus.  Say what you</l>
<l n="65">will of me—even the vilest of vile insults.  You will not harm me at all by that.  But if you fail to do as I say, you will inflict pain on all the Argives, for if that man’s bow is not seized, you can never sack the realm of Dardanus.</l>
<l n="70">And learn why your intercourse with him may be free from mistrust and danger, while mine cannot.  You have sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> under no oath to any man, nor under any constraint.  Neither did you have any part in the earlier expedition.  I, however, can deny none of these things.  Accordingly, if he</l>
<l n="75">perceives me while he is still master of his bow, I am dead, and you, as my comrade, will share my doom.  No, the thing for which we must devise a ruse is just this:  how you may steal his invincible weapons.  Well I know, my son, that by nature you are not apt</l>
<l n="80">to utter or contrive such treachery.  Yet knowing that victory is a sweet prize to gain, steel yourself to do it.  Our honesty shall be displayed another time.  Now, however, give yourself to me for one brief, shameless day, and then for the rest of time</l>
<l n="85">may you be called the most righteous of all humankind.</l>

<l n="90">But I am ready to take the man by force and without treachery, since with the use of one foot only, he will not overcome so many of us in a struggle.  And yet I was sent to assist you and am reluctant to be called traitor.  Still I prefer, my king,</l>

<l n="260">O my son, boy whose father was Achilles, here I am before you, the man of whom you have perhaps heard as lord of the bow of Heracles, Philoctetes the son of Poeas.  I am he whom the two marshalls and the Cephallenian king</l>
<l n="265">shamelessly hurled to this solitude which you see, when I was wasting with a fierce disease, stricken by the savage bite of the murderous serpent.  With that plague for my sole companion, boy, those men put me out</l>

Delighted they were then, when they saw me asleep after much tossing on the waves, in the shelter of a cave upon the shore, and they abandoned me, first setting out a few rags, as though for an unfortunate beggar, and a bit of food, too—</l>
<l n="275">a small work of charity.  But may they get what they gave me!  Can you imagine, boy, what kind of awakening I had when they had gone, and I rose from sleep that day?—what stinging tears I wept, and what miseries I bewailed when I saw that the ships with which I had sailed</l>
<l n="280">were all gone, and that there was no man in the place, not one to help me, not one to ease the sickness that afflicted me, when looking all around me, I could find nothing at hand, save agony—but of that a ready store?</l>

<l n="290">in pain I would crawl to it myself, dragging my wretched foot behind me.  Or, again, if water had to be fetched, or, if when the frost had spread, as often happens in winter, a bit of firewood had to be broken, I would creep out in pain and</l>
<l n="295">manage it.  Then fire would be lacking;  but by rubbing stone hard on stone I would at last reveal the hidden spark which preserves me from day to day.  Indeed, a roof over my head and a fire inside provides all that I want—except release from my disease.</l>

               
<l n="300">Come now, son, you must understand what sort of island this is.  No mariner approaches it by choice, since there is no anchorage or port where he can find a gainful market or a kindly host.  This is not a place to which prudent men voyage.  But suppose that some one has put in against his will, for such things may often</l>
<l n="305">happen in the long course of a man’s life.  These visitors, then, when they come, son, have compassionate words for me, and, perhaps moved by pity, they give me a little food or some clothing.</l>
<l n="310">But there is one thing that no one will do, whenever I mention it:  take me home in safety.  No, this is already the tenth year that I am wasted by misery from hunger and suffering, by feeding this gluttonous plague.

And since your tongue is so arrogant, you will never sail back to Scyros with those arms in your possession.</q> In that way rebuked, in that way insulted, I sail for home, deprived of what is my own by that worst offspring of a wicked line, Odysseus.</l>
<l n="385">And yet I do not blame him as much as I do those in power.  For a city hangs wholly on its leaders, and so does an army, but when men shatter law and order, it is the lessons of their teachers that corrupt them.  My tale is told in full.  May he who hates the Atreids</l>

<l n="605">a son of Priam, called Helenus, whom that man, out on a solitary night raid—that deceitful Odysseus, whose repute is all shame and dishonor—captured.  Leading him back in bonds, he displayed him publicly to the Achaeans as his glorious prey.</l>
<l n="610">Helenus then prophesied for them whatever matter they asked, and, pertaining to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, he foretold that they would never sack its towers, unless by winning words they should bring Philoctetes here from the island where he now dwells.  And, as soon as he heard the seer prophecy this, <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>’ son</l>
<l n="615">immediately promised that he would bring the man and show him to the Achaeans.  He thought it most likely that he would get him willingly, but, if unwilling, then by force, and he added that, were he to fail in this, whoever wished it might sever his head.</l>
<l n="620">You have heard everything, boy, and I advise speed for you, and for any man for whom you care.</l>

<l n="625">from Hades into the light, as his father did!</l>

<l n="1005">bow, now that you are made that man’s bound quarry!  And you, who cannot think one healthy or one noble thought, how stealthily you have once more ambushed and trapped me, taking this boy for your screen, because he was a stranger to me.  He is too good for your company, but worthy of mine,</l>
<l n="1010">since he had no thought but to execute his orders, and he already shows remorse for his own errors and for the wrongs done me.  But your corrupt mind, always on the lookout from some position of ambush, trained him well—unsuited and unwilling though he was—</l>
<l n="1015">to be cunning in evil.  And now, wretch, for me you plan bonds and passage from the very shore on which you had me flung away, friendless, abandoned, citiless, a corpse in the eyes of the living.  Ah!  Hades take you!  Indeed I have often so prayed for you.</l>
<l n="1020">But, because the gods grant me nothing that is sweet, you remain alive and you laugh, while I live miserably among countless sufferings, mocked by you and by the sons of Atreus, the two generals whom you serve on this errand.</l>
<l n="1025">And yet you sailed with them only when brought under their yoke by trickery and compulsion.  But me, when, to my utter ruin, I sailed of my own accord as their mate with seven ships, me they cast out of ship and honor, as you claim, while they say that it was your doing.  And now, why would you take me?  Why have me led away?  For what purpose?</l>
<l n="1030">I am nothing, and, as far as you were concerned, I have long been dead.  You creature abhorred by the gods, how is it that you no longer find me crippled and foul-smelling?  How, if I sail with you, can you burn sacrifices to the gods, or make libations any more?  That was your pretext for casting me away in the first place.</l>
<l n="1035">A cruel death for you!—and die you shall for your unjust treatment of me, if the gods care for justice.  But I know that they do care for it, since you would never have made this voyage for one so miserable, unless some god-sent goad had driven you after me.</l>
<l n="1040">O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!  Yes, my life merits pity.  Yet if I were to see those men overthrown, I would believe that I had escaped my plague.</l>

<l n="1335">aid and mine, be hailed as the sacker of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>’s towers.  How I know these things are so ordained, I will tell you.  We have a Trojan prisoner, Helenus, foremost among seers, who says plainly that all this must come to pass, and further,</l>
<l n="1340">that this very summer must see the complete capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.  Otherwise he willingly gives himself over for execution, if these prophecies of his prove false.  Therefore, now that you understand everything, give way graciously.  It is a glorious addition to your gain to be singled out</l>
<l n="1345">as best of the Greeks—first, for coming into healing hands, and then for taking <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> rich in tears, and so winning a matchless renown.</l>

<l n="1350">Ah, me, what shall I do?  How can I ignore this man’s words, when he has advised me with good will?  But shall I yield, then?  How, after doing that, shall I, ill-fated, come into men’s sight?  Whom will I be able to talk to?  You orbs that have watched my every suffering,</l>
<l n="1355">how could you endure to see me consorting with the sons of Atreus, who caused my ruin, or with the accursed son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>?  It is not my resentment for what has already been done that stings me, rather it is the many troubles which I seem to foresee I must suffer at the hands of</l>
<l n="1360">these men in the future.  For when the mind of men has once mothered wrongdoing, it trains those men to be wrongdoers in all else thereafter.  And in you, too, I wonder at this.  You should never yourself revisit <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and should prevent me from going there, seeing that those men have done you outrage</l>
<l n="1365">by stripping you of your father’s arms <del>when, in the suit for the weapons, they judged unhappy Ajax inferior to Odysseus</del>.  After that, will you go to fight at their side, and compel me to do the same?  No, do not do it, son, but, as you swore to me, escort me home.  You yourself remain in Scyros, and leave those evil men to their evil doom.</l>
<l n="1370">So shall you win double thanks from me, as from your father, and you will not appear through your service to bad men to be like them in your nature.</l>
