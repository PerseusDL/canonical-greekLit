               <l n="1">Always, son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, have I observed you on
                        the prowl to snatch some means of attack against your enemies. So now at the
                        tent of Ajax by the ships where he has his post at the camp’s outer edge, I
                        watch you</l><l n="5">for a long time as you hunt and scan his newly pressed tracks, in order to see whether he is inside or away.  Your course leads you well to your goal, like that of a keen-scenting Laconian hound.  For the man has just now gone in,</l><l n="10">with sweat dripping from his head and from his hands that have killed with the sword.  There is no further need for you to peer inside these doors.  Rather tell me what your goal is that you have shown such eagerness for, so that you may learn from her who holds the knowledge.</l>

               <l n="14">Voice of Athena, dearest to me of the gods,</l><l n="15">how clearly, though you are unseen, do I hear your call and snatch its meaning in my mind, just as I would the bronze tongue of the Tyrrhenian trumpet!  And now you have discerned correctly that I am circling my path on the track of a man who hates me, Ajax the shield-bearer.</l><l n="20">It is he and no other that I have been tracking so long.  For tonight he has done us a deed beyond comprehension—if he is indeed the doer.  We know nothing for certain, but drift in doubt.  And so I of my of accord took up the burden of this search.</l><l n="25">For we recently found all the cattle, our plunder, dead—yes, slaughtered by human hand—and with them the guardians of the flocks.
                  <milestone unit="para" resp="ed"/>Now, all men lay responsibility for this crime to him.  And further, a scout who had seen him</l><l n="30">bounding alone over the plain with a newly-wet sword reported to me and declared what he saw.  Then immediately I rush upon his track, and sometimes I follow his signs, but sometimes I am bewildered, and cannot read whose they are.  Your arrival is timely, for truly in all matters, both those of the past</l><l n="35">and those of the future, it is your hand that steers me.</l>

At one time he thought that he was killing the two Atreidae, holding them in his very hand;  at another time it was this commander, and at another that one which he attacked.  And I, while the man ran about in diseased frenzy,</l><l n="60">I kept urging him on, kept hurling him into the snares of doom.  Soon, when he rested from this toil, he bound together the living oxen along with with all the sheep and brought them home, as though his quarry were men, not well-horned cattle.  And now he abuses them, bound together, in the house.
<milestone unit="para" resp="ed"/>But to you also will I show this madness openly, so that when you have seen it you may proclaim it to all the Argives.

                        For well now may Ajax cry <q type="spoken">Aiai</q>—yes, twice and three times. Such are the
                        harsh troubles with which I have met. Look, I am one whose father’s</l><l n="435">prowess won him the fairest prize of all the army, whose father brought every glory home from this same land of Ida;  but I, his son, who came after him to this same ground of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with no less might and proved the service of my hand in no meaner deeds,</l><l n="440">I am ruined as you see by dishonor from the Greeks.  And yet of this much I feel sure:  if Achilles lived, and had been called to award the first place in valor to any claimant of his arms, no one would have grasped them before me.</l><l n="445">But now the Atreidae have made away with them to a man without scruples and thrust away the triumphs of Ajax.  And if these eyes and this warped mind had not swerved from the purpose that was mine, they would have never in this way procured votes in judgment against another man.</l><l n="450">As it was, the daughter of Zeus, the grim-eyed, unconquerable goddess, tripped me up at the instant when I was readying my hand against them, and shot me with a plague of frenzy so that I might bloody my hands in these grazers.  And those men exult to have escaped me—</l><l n="455">not that I wanted their escape.  But if a god sends harm, it is true that even the base man can elude the worthier.

But then shall I go against the bulwark of the Trojans, attacking alone in single combats and doing some valuable service, and finally die?  But, in so doing I might, I think, gladden the Atreidae.</l><l n="470">That must not happen.  Some enterprise must be sought whereby I may prove to my aged father that in nature, at least, his son is not gutless.  It is a stain upon a man to crave the full term of life, when he finds no variation from his ignominious troubles.</l><l n="475">What joy is there in day following day, now advancing us towards, now drawing us back from the verge of death?

Show respect to your father, whom you abandon in miserable old age, and respect your mother with her share of many years, who often prays to the gods that you may come home alive.</l><l n="510">Pity, too, my king, your son.  Pity him the great sorrow which at your death you will bequeath both to him and to me, if robbed of nurturing care he must spend his days apart from you, an orphan tended by guardians who are neither family nor friends.

The prophet then addressed him and strictly commanded him to use every possible resource to keep Ajax inside his tent for the duration of this day that now shines on us, and to prevent him from moving about</l><l n="755">if he wished ever to look on him alive. For this day alone will the anger of divine

                        himself foolish, when his father advised him well. For Telamon told him, <q type="spoken">My

                        Now Ajax here had this gift from Hector, and by this he has perished in his
                        deadly fall. Was it not the Fury who forged this blade,</l><l n="1035">was not that belt the product of Hades, the grim artificer?  I, for my part, would affirm that these happenings and all happenings ever are designed by the gods for men.

               <l n="1052">This—that when we had hoped we were bringing Ajax from home to be an ally and a friend for the Greeks, we found him on closer examination to be an enemy worse than the Phrygians,</l><l n="1055">since he plotted the murder of the entire army and marched by night against us in order to take us with his spear.  And if some god had not smothered this attempt, we would have been allotted the fate which he now has, and we would be dead and lie prostrate by an ignoble doom,</l><l n="1060">while he would be living.  But now a god has turned his outrage aside, so that it fell on the sheep and cattle.
<milestone unit="para" resp="ed"/>For this reason there is no man so powerful that he will be able to entomb the corpse of Ajax.  Instead he shall be cast forth somewhere on the yellow sand</l><l n="1065">to become forage for the birds of the seashore. So then do not inflame the terrible force of your spirit.  If we were unable to master him while he lived, in any case in death, at least, we shall rule him despite your opposition and control him by force of our hands.   For while he lived, there never was a time</l><l n="1070">when he would obey my commands.
<milestone unit="para" resp="ed"/>Now it is, in truth, the mark of a base nature when a commoner does not think it right to obey those who stand over him.  Never can the laws maintain a prosperous course in a city where fear has no fixed place,</l><l n="1075">nor can a camp be ruled any more with moderation, if it lacks the guarding force of fear and reverence.  A man, though he grow his body great and mighty, must expect to fall, even from a light blow.

No, as an autonomous ruler, you say, Ajax set sail.

                        of the fact that your father’s father Pelops long ago was a barbarian, a
                        Phrygian? That Atreus, your own begetter, set before his brother a most
                        unholy feast made from the flesh of his brother’s children?</l><l n="1295">And you yourself were born from a Cretan mother, whose father found a stranger straddling her and who was consigned by him to be prey for the mute fish.  So being of such a kind, can you reproach a man like me for my lineage?  I am the son of Telamon,</l><l n="1300">who won my mother for his consort as prize for valor supreme in the army. And she was
                        the daughter of Laomedon, of royal blood, and it was as the flower of the
                        spoil that Alcmena’s son gave her to Telamon. Thus nobly born as I am from
                        two noble parents,</l><l n="1305">could I disgrace my own flesh and blood, whom even as he lies here subdued by such massive troubles, you, making your pronouncements without a blush of shame, would thrust out without burial?  Now consider this well:  wherever you cast him away, with him you will also cast our three corpses.</l><l n="1310">It is right for me to die before all men’s eyes while I am toiling in his cause, rather
                        than for your wife—or should I say your brother’s? With this in mind, then,
                        look not to my safety, but to yours instead, since if you cause me any grief
                        at all, you will soon wish</l><l n="1315">that you had been more timid than bold when confronting me.</l>
