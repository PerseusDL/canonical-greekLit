      <p>
        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In my opinion it is not the
        name of the Four Hundred that should incense you, but the actions of some of their number.
        For there were some who had insidious designs: but the rest were resolved to do no harm
        either to the city or to any amongst you; they entered the Council-chamber with loyal
        thoughts, and the defendant, Polystratus, is one of that section. <milestone n="2"
          unit="section"/>He was chosen by his tribesmen for the soundness of his views in regard to
        his township and also towards your people: yet they accuse him of disloyalty to your people,
        after he has been chosen by his tribesmen, who can best discern the character of this or
        that person amongst them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And what reason could he have had
        for courting an oligarchy? Because he was of an age to achieve success amongst you as a
        speaker, or because he had such bodily strength as might encourage him to commit an outrage
        on any of your people? But you see of what age he is: it is one that fits him rather to
        restrain others from such proceedings. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>To be sure, if a man
        has been disfranchised for some misdemeanor in the past, and so has courted a change in the
        constitution, he may be led by his past offences to seek his personal interest; but this man
        had committed no such offence as might lead him to hate your people in his own interest or
        in that of his children. One of these was in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
        >Sicily</placeName>, the others were in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>; so
        it was no interest of theirs that he should court a change in the constitution. <milestone
          n="5" unit="section"/>They do accuse him of having held many magistracies, but nobody is
        able to show that he was a bad magistrate. My own opinion is that it is not men of his
        character who are guilty of wrong in such situations, but some holder of a few offices who
        has not held them for the best advantage of the city. For our city was not betrayed by her
        good magistrates, but by her dishonest ones. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>This man,
        first of all, as a magistrate in Oropus,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">On the north coast
          of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> neither betrayed you nor set up
        a new constitution when everyone else in office utterly betrayed their trust. They did not
        stay for the reckoning, thus convicting themselves of guilt; whereas he, feeling himself
        innocent, comes up for punishment! <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>The guilty are smuggled
        out by their accusers in return for payment; but those from whom they can get no profit they
        expose as guilty. They make similar accusations against those who have proposed some motion
        in the Council and against those who have not. But this man has not even proposed one motion
        regarding your people; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>and I presume that these persons
        deserve no ill-treatment at your hands on the ground that, while they were loyal to you,
        they did not incur the enmity of that party.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The
          oligarchs.</note> For those who spoke in opposition to them were either exiled or put to
        death, so that whoever did aspire to oppose them in your interest was invariably deterred by
        fright or by the slaughter of their victims. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Hence in most
        cases they completely lost heart, since those who were not banished were executed. Those
        among them who engaged to obey and refrain from plotting and reporting, they placed in
        power. Thus a change of government would have been no easy thing for you. It is not fair,
        then, to punish people for matters in which they showed their loyalty to you. <milestone
          n="10" unit="section"/>And I consider it monstrous that the same treatment meted out to
        those who proposed measures concerning your people that were not to its highest advantage
        should also be applied to the man who proposed nothing, and who in seventy years has
        committed no offence against you, let alone eight days! Those who spent their whole lives in
        knavery have appeared as honest men before the auditors, because they have tampered with
        their accusers; while those who were always honest towards you—they are the knaves.
          <milestone n="11" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now, in their previous
        prosecution, among other lying charges that they made against my father, they stated that
          Phrynichus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">An active member of the oligarchy of Four
          Hundred (<date value="-411">411</date> B.C.); cf. <bibl n="Lys. 13.70">Lys. 13.70</bibl>,
            <title>Against Agoratus</title>.</note> was a relation of his. Well, let anyone, if he
        pleases, bear witness, in the time allowed for my speech, that there was kinship with
        Phrynichus. But, of course, their accusation was a lie. Nor, indeed, was he a friend of his
        by upbringing; for Phrynichus was a poor man, and kept sheep in the fields, while my father
        was being educated in town. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>On attaining manhood he looked
        after his farm, while Phrynichus came to town and became a slander-monger; so that the
        characters of the two were not at all compatible. And when Phrynichus had to pay a fine to
        the Treasury, my father did not bring him his contribution of money: yet it is in such cases
        that we see the best proof of a man’s friends. If he was of the same township, that is no
        reason why my father deserves to suffer,— <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>unless you also
        are guilty because he is your fellow-citizen. Where could you find a better friend of the
        people than the man who, after you had decreed that the government be entrusted to Five
        Thousand, proceeded as Registrar to make a list of nine thousand, his purpose being to risk
        no quarrel with any of his townsmen, but to enter the names of anyone who wished to be
        included; and then, if in some cases there was a disability, to do it as a favour. Well, the
        democracy is not upset by those who increase the number of the citizens, but by those who
        reduce it. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>He was unwilling either to take the oath or to
        make up the list: they compelled him by the imposition of fines and penalties. When he was
        thus compelled, and had taken the oath, after sitting for only eight days in Council he took
        ship to <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">On the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, opposite the
          north coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> and in the
        sea-fights there he showed no craven heart: he came home wounded, just when the revolution
        had taken place. And this man, who had neither proposed any motion nor sat in Council for
        more than eight days, was sentenced to pay that large sum, while many of those who had
        spoken in opposition to you, and had continued in Council throughout, have been acquitted.
          <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>I speak not in envy of their case, but in pity for ours:
        some who were thought guilty have been begged off by persons whose administration evinced
        their zeal in your cause; others who were guilty bought off their accusers, and were not so
        much as thought guilty. Our plight, therefore, would be quite unaccountable. <milestone
          n="16" unit="section"/>They accuse the Four Hundred of criminal conduct: yet you were
        yourselves persuaded by them to hand over the government to the Five Thousand, and if you,
        being so many yourselves, were persuaded, why should not each one of the Four Hundred have
        yielded likewise? Nay, it is not these who are guilty, but the men who were deceiving you to
        your hurt. The defendant shows his loyalty to you by this fact among many,—that, if he did
        have revolutionary designs upon your people, he would never have taken ship and gone off
        within eight days of taking his seat in Council. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>But, it
        night be said, he took ship in the quest of gain, like some people who went raiding and
        robbing. Well, nobody can cite any case of his keeping property of yours: no, they accuse
        him of anything rather than his use of his office. The prosecution at the time in no way
        showed their loyalty to the democracy, nor supported it; but now that the democracy is its
        own most loyal friend, their support is given nominally to you, but actually to themselves.
          <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>And do not be surprised, gentlemen of the jury, that he
        was fined such a large sum. For they found him without support, and obtained his conviction
        by accusations brought against both him and us. For, in his case, even if a man had evidence
        to give in his favor, he was prevented by the terror inspired by the accusers, whereas, in
        theirs, men were ready, through terror, to give even false evidence for them. <milestone
          n="19" unit="section"/>How monstrous, gentlemen, would be our fate if, although the men
        who are unable to deny their possession of your money are acquitted by you on the
        intercession of a friend, we who have shown our personal zeal in your people’s cause, and
        whose father, too, has done you no wrong, are not to obtain your grace! If some foreigner
        had come and either asked you for money or claimed to be recorded as your benefactor, you
        would have granted his request; and will you not grant to us, that we ourselves should have
        civic rights among you? <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>If there have been cases of
        disloyalty to your government or of the proposal of an improper motion, it is not the absent
        who are to blame for these things, since you have absolved even those who were present. For,
        even when one of our citizens here persuades you with mischievous advice, it is not you who
        are to blame, but your deceiver. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>But those men,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The revolutionaries.</note> convicting themselves of guilt in
        advance, have taken themselves off in order to escape punishment: while any others who were
        guilty,—though in a less degree than they, but still guilty,—are moved by their fear at once
        of you and of their accusers to take the field instead of staying at home, in order that
        they may either mollify you or prevail on them. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>The
        defendant, having done you no wrong, has submitted himself to justice immediately after
        those events, when your memory of what occurred was freshest, and he could best be put to
        the proof: he trusted in his own innocence and in the success which justice would award him
        in his trial. That he was a friend of the people, I will prove to you. <milestone n="23"
          unit="section"/>First of all, how many were the campaigns in which he served without once
        shirking his duty, can be told, from personal knowledge, by his fellow-townsmen. Then, when
        he might well have put his fortune away out of sight and refused to help you, he preferred
        that you should have cognizance of it, in order that, even if he chose to play the knave, he
        could have no chance, but must contribute to the special levies and perform his public
        services. He also placed us in a position to be most helpful to the State. <milestone n="24"
          unit="section"/>He sent me away to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, but I
        was not<gap reason="lost"/><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A gap occurs here in the text.</note> to you;
        so the cavalry should know what kind of spirit I showed as long as the army was safe: but
        when it was destroyed and I escaped to <placeName key="perseus,Catana"
          >Catana</placeName>,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">On the east coast of <placeName
            key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note> I used that town as a base for depredations
        by which I harried the enemy, so that from the spoil more than thirty minae were apportioned
        as the tithe for the goddess<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Presumably Athene.</note> and
        enough to deliver all the soldiers who were in the hands of the enemy. <milestone n="25"
          unit="section"/>And when the Cataneans compelled me to serve in the cavalry, I did so, and
        shirked no danger there either; so that everyone must know what kind of spirit I showed on
        service both with the cavalry and with the infantry. I will provide you with my witnesses to
        these facts.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="26" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>You have heard the
        witnesses, gentlemen of the jury. As to my disposition towards your people, I will make it
        plain to you. A Syracusan had arrived in that place with a form of oath, and was ready to
        administer it, and was approaching the people of the place one by one:<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">Apparently this man pretended that he had been commissioned by the magistrates
          to enlist troops.</note> I at once spoke against him, and went and reported the matter to
        Tydeus; he summoned an Assembly, and there were speeches not a few. However, I will call
        witnesses to what I said myself.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="27" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Consider now the letter
        from my father, which he arranged to be conveyed to me, and say whether its contents were of
        good or evil import to your people. In it he had written concerning our domestic affairs,
        and further, that when things were going well in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
          >Sicily</placeName> I should return. Now surely your interests and those of the people
        there were the same; so, if he had not been loyal to the State and to you, he would never
        have sent such a letter. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"
        />Then again, as to my youngest brother, I will inform you of his disposition towards you.
        When a descent was made on us by the returning exiles, who not only wreaked here whatever
        damage they could, but also raided and harried you from their fortress,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">Probably (with the Spartans) at Decelea in <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
            >Attica</placeName>.</note> he galloped out from the cavalry ranks and killed one of
        them. As witnesses to this I will produce to you the actual men who were present at the
          affair.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="29" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Of my eldest brother enough
        is known by his actual comrades in the campaign,—by any of you who were with <placeName
          key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName> at the <placeName key="tgn,7002638"
          >Hellespont</placeName>,—for him to be accounted the equal of any man in spirit. Please
        come up here.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="30" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>How, then, should we not
        obtain our reward from you, with such characters as those? Is our destruction to be
        justified by the slanders by which my father has been traduced to you, and are we to reap no
        benefit from the zeal that we have shown in the city’s service? Nay, there would be no
        justice in it. Supposing that we ought to suffer on account of the slander aimed at him, we
        deserve, on account of that zeal of ours, to save both him and ourselves. <milestone n="31"
          unit="section"/>For indeed it was not for the sake of money that we might get that we
        sought your good; our purpose was that, if we found ourselves in trouble, we might be saved
        by this plea, and might obtain our due reward at your hands. And for the sake of other
        people also you ought to be so disposed, recognizing that, whenever zeal is shown in your
        service, your support will be not merely for us,—for even before making any request you have
        proved our attitude towards you,—but you will make the others more zealous by your bestowal
        of merited favor in every case of service rendered to you. <milestone n="32" unit="section"
        />And avoid giving any kind of confirmation to those who repeat the most wicked of all
        sayings,—that ill-treated men have better memories than the well-treated. For who will keep
        a loyal heart, if those who harm you are to be preferred to those who help you? What you
        have to do, gentlemen, is this: <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>your decision is to be
        taken on us, and not on our estate. For so long as there was peace, we had a material
        fortune and our father was skillful in his farming; but after the invasion of the enemy, we
        were deprived of the whole of it. So this was the very reason why we were zealous in your
        service: we knew that we had no funds from which we could pay a fine, but that our personal
        zeal in your service entitles us to get some recompense. <milestone n="34" unit="section"
        />And yet we find, gentlemen, that when someone puts forward his children with sobs and
        lamentations you take pity on the children for the disfranchisement that they will owe to
        him; and you overlook the fathers’ transgressions on account of the children, of whom you
        cannot yet tell whether they will grow up to be good citizens or bad. But of us you can tell
        that we have zealously worked in your service, and that our father is clear of any
        transgression. Thus you are far more justified in showing favor to those whose work you have
        tested than to those of whom you cannot tell how they will shape in the future. <milestone
          n="35" unit="section"/>And our position is the contrary of that of other people: for
        others seek your indulgence by producing their children; but we seek it by producing our
        father here and ourselves, begging you not to deprive us of the rights that we now enjoy,
        and so leave us, your fellow-citizens, without a city. Nay, pity both our father in his old
        age, and us. If you ruin us unjustly, what pleasure will there be for him in our society, or
        for us in company with each other, when we are unworthy both of you and of the city ? But
        all three of us beseech you to let us give yet greater proofs of our zeal. <milestone n="36"
          unit="section"/>We beseech you, then, in the name of all that each of you holds dear,—if
        any have sons, pity us for their sake; if any is our equal, or our father’s, in age, pity us
        and acquit us. And do not let your act frustrate our purpose of rendering service to the
        State. Dreadful would be our lot if, from the enemy, who might fairly have denied us safety,
        we yet obtained safety, but at your hands we shall fail to find salvation.</p>
