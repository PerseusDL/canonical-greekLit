        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps some of you,
        gentlemen of the jury, suppose that, since I desire to be a person of some account, I must
        be able to excel others in speaking: but, so far from my being competent to speak on matters
        that do not concern myself, I fear that, even on matters of which I am obliged to speak, I
        may be unable to say what is needful. I believe, however, that if I can give you the full
        story of our dealings with Eraton and his children, you will easily form therefrom a proper
        judgement on the claim now put forward. So let me tell it you from the beginning. <milestone
          n="2" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Eraton, father of Erasiphon, borrowed
        from my grandfather two talents. To show that he received this money, and that it was the
        amount of the loan that he requested, I will produce to you witnesses before whom the money
        was paid. As to the use that he made of it, and the profit that he got, those who know
        better than I, as having been in touch with his business, will relate and testify it to you.
        Please call witnesses.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now as long as Eraton was
        alive, we duly received our interest and the terms of agreement were kept; but when he died,
        leaving three sons—Erasiphon, Eraton and Erasistratus,—these persons ceased to give us our
        rightful dues. During the war,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The time of the struggle
          between the thirty oligarchs and the democracy, between <dateRange from="-404" to="-403"
            >404</dateRange>-403 B.C.</note> of course, as there were no suits at law, we were
        unable to make them pay what they owed; but when peace was made, as soon as civil suits
        began to be tried, my father got permission to proceed against Erasistratus for the whole
        debt, as he alone of the brothers was resident here, and obtained a verdict against him in
        the archonship of Xenaenetus.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"><dateRange from="-401"
            to="-400">401</dateRange>-400 B.C.</note> I will produce to you witnesses of these facts
        also. Please call witnesses.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That the property of Eraton
        should of right be ours is easily understood from these statements, but that the whole is
        being confiscated appears from the actual inventories; for these have been compiled in
        detail by three and even four persons. Surely it is obvious to everyone that they would not
        have omitted any other property of Eraton’s available for confiscation, when they were
        entering all the property of Eraton, including even the part that has belonged to me for a
        long time past. Well, that it is not possible for us to recover anything even from the other
        side, once you have confiscated this property, I consider obvious; <milestone n="5"
          unit="section"/>but now let me tell you how I have treated you,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">The jury are addressed as representing the State.</note> as distinct from
        private persons, in the conduct of this dispute. As long as the relatives of Erasiphon were
        contesting this property, I claimed the whole as mine, because Erasistratus lost his case
        when he pleaded against my father’s suit for the whole debt; and for the last three years I
        have let out the property at Sphettus,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A township of the
          tribe Acamantis in the south of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note>
        but over the property at Cicynna<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A township of the tribe
          Acamantis in the south of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> and the
        house there I was at law with the occupiers. Last year, however, they got my suit quashed by
        alleging that they were sea-traders<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">As such they could only
          be tried before a nautical court.</note>; but at present, although I was permitted to
        bring proceedings in the month of Gamelion,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >December-January.</note> the nautical court has not decided the case. <milestone n="6"
          unit="section"/>Now that you have seen fit to confiscate the property of Erasiphon, I
        relinquish two thirds to the State, and claim that the property of Erasistratus be adjudged
        to me, because it is this property that your previous decision has already made ours. So I
        have limited my share to one-third of their property, making no exact calculation, but
        leaving much more than two-thirds to the Treasury. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>This is
        easily concluded from the valuation which has been attached to the schedule of the property.
        For they have valued the whole at more than a talent, whereas to one of the properties for
        which I am suing I attached five minae, and to the other<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >One at Sphettus and one at Cicynna.</note> a thousand drachmae<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">A talent was 6000 drachmae, and a mina 100 drachmae. He asks for a value of 15
          minae—one eight of the two talents originally lent to Eraton.</note>: if they are worth
        more than those amounts, the surplus after they have been sold by auction will go to the
        State. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>And to convince you of the truth of this I will
        produce to you, as witnesses, first the persons who rented from me the estate at Sphettus,
        then the neighbors of the place at Cicynna, who know that we have been contesting it for the
        last three years, and next the magistrates of last year, before whom the suits were
        authorized to be heard, and the present judges of the nautical court. <milestone n="9"
          unit="section"/>You will also have these inventories read to you: for they above all will
        convince you that our claim to this property is no recent matter, and also that today we are
        contesting with the Treasury an amount that compares favorably with that which we formerly
        contested with private persons. Please call witnesses. <label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That there is no injustice,
        gentlemen, in my claiming your verdict on the property in question, but rather that I have
        relinquished to the State a great part of my own property before claiming this restoration,
        has been clearly proved. And now I deem it just to lay my request before you and also before
        the Commissioners<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Of Revenue.</note> in your presence.</p>
