        <milestone n="Intro, Narr, Proof" unit="part"/>
        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Among many noble feats,
        gentlemen, for which it is right to remember Heracles, we ought to recall the fact that he
        was the first, in his affection for the Greeks, to convene this contest. For previously the
        cities regarded each other as strangers. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But he, when he
        had crushed despotism and arrested outrage, founded a contest of bodily strength, a
        challenge of wealth, and a display of intelligence in the fairest part of <placeName
          key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, that we might meet together for all these enjoyments
        alike of our eyes and of our ears, because he judged that our assembly here would be a
        beginning of mutual amity amongst the Greeks. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The project
        of it, then, was his; and so I have not come here to talk trivialities or to wrangle over
        words: I take that to be the business of utterly futile professors in straits for a
        livelihood; but I think it behoves a man of principle and civic worth to be giving his
        counsel on the weightiest questions, when I see <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
          >Greece</placeName> in this shameful plight, with many parts of her held subject by the
        foreigner, and many of her cities ravaged by despots.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Cf.
            <bibl n="Lys. 2.59">Lys. 2.59</bibl>.</note>
        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now if these afflictions were due to weakness, it would be
        necessary to acquiesce in our fate: but since they are due to faction and mutual rivalry,
        surely we ought to desist from the one and arrest the other, knowing that, if rivalry befits
        the prosperous, the most prudent views befit people in a position like ours. <milestone
          n="5" unit="section"/>For we see both the gravity of our dangers and their imminence on
        every side: you are aware that empire is for those who command the sea, that the King<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Artaxerxes II., who reigned <dateRange from="-405" to="-362"
            >405</dateRange>-362 B.C.</note> has control of the money, that the Greeks are in thrall
        to those who are able to spend it, that our master possesses many ships, and that the despot
        of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName><note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >Dionysius I of Syracuse, who reigned <dateRange from="-405" to="-367">405</dateRange>-367
          B.C.</note> has many also. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>We ought therefore to
        relinquish our mutual warfare, and with a single purpose in our hearts to secure our
        salvation; to feel shame for past events and fear for those that lie in the future, and to
        compete with our ancestors, by whom the foreigner, in grasping at the land of others, was
        deprived of his own, and who expelled the despots and established freedom for all in common.
          <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But I wonder at the Lacedaemonians most of all: what can
        be their policy in tolerating the devastation of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
          >Greece</placeName>, when they are leaders of the Greeks by the just claims alike of their
        inborn valor and their martial science, and when they alone have their dwelling-places
        unravaged though unwalled and, strangers to faction and defeat, observe always the same
        rules of life? Wherefore it may be expected that the liberty they possess will never die,
        and that having achieved the salvation of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in
        her past dangers they are providing against those that are to come. <milestone n="8"
          unit="section"/>Now the future will bring no better opportunity than the present. We ought
        to view the disasters of those who have been crushed, not as the concern of others, but as
        our own: let us not wait for the forces of both our foes to advance upon ourselves, but
        while there is yet time let us arrest their outrage. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>For
        who would not be mortified to see how they have grown strong through our mutual warfare?
        Those incidents, no less awful than disgraceful, have empowered our dire oppressors to do
        what they have done, and have hindered the Greeks from taking vengeance for their wrongs.<gap reason="lost"/>
