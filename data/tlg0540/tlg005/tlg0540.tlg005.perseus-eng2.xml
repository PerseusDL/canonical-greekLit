<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>If Callias had anything else than his life at stake in this trial, gentlemen of the jury, I should be content with what you have heard from the other speakers; but, as it is, and when he urges and requests me, and he is not only a friend of mine but was one of my fatherâ€™s so long as he lived, and we have had many arrangements between us, I feel it would be disgraceful not to support Callias so far as justice requires and my ability permits. </p></div>

But I find that these designing persons make life no less dangerous for those who have done no wrong than for those who are guilty of many misdeeds. </p></div>
        
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>You, however, ought not to credit the statements of mere servants and discredit those of the accused; for you should reflect that no one, either private citizen or magistrate, has ever indicted Callias before, and that while dwelling in this city he has bestowed many benefits upon you, and has arrived at his time of life with a blameless reputation; whereas these men, having spent their lives in committing serious offences and incurring a variety of troubles, make their speeches to-day with an air of having performed a great service, merely in the hope of freedom.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A slave whose accusation was accepted as true was rewarded with freedom.

Yet surely such men as these, whether accusers or witnesses, should win no credit, when they have a great profit to make for themselves by their statements concerning others; much rather should it be given to those who, to uphold the public weal,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Perhaps Callias was employed by the stewards of the sacred treasure of the Parthenon, and was accused of embezzling some of it.</note> involve themselves in danger. </p></div>
