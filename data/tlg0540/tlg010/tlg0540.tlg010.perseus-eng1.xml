      <p>
        <milestone n="Intro" unit="part"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
          unit="para"/>I believe that I shall not be at a loss for witnesses, gentlemen of the jury:
        for I see many of you in this place of judgement who were present at the time when Lysitheus
        was prosecuting Theomnestus for speaking before the people, since he had lost the right to
        do so by having cast away his armour. Now it was during that trial that he asserted that I
        had billed my own father. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If he accused me of having killed
        his own, I should forgive him his statement, regarding him as an insignificant and worthless
        person; nor, if I had heard him apply any other forbidden term to me, should I have taken
        steps against him, since I consider it a mark of a mean and too litigious person to go to
        law for slander. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But in the present case I feel it would be
        disgraceful, as it concerns my father, who has deserved so highly both of you and of the
        State,—not to take vengeance on the man who has made that statement; and I wish to know from
        you whether he will be duly punished, or whether he alone of the Athenians has the privilege
        of doing and saying whatever he pleases in defiance of the laws.<milestone n="Narr"
          unit="part"/>
        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>My age, gentlemen, is
        thirty-two, and your return to the city<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"><date
            >403</date> B.C.</note> was nineteen years ago. It will be seen, therefore, that I was
        thirteen when my father was put to death by the Thirty. At that age I neither knew what an
        oligarchy was, nor would have been able to rescue him from the wrong that he suffered.<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The speaker was thus too young either to be implicated in the
          political murder of his father or to aid in his protection.</note>
        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Besides, I could have had no true motive in the monetary
        way for making designs upon him: for my elder brother Pantaleon took over everything, and on
        becoming our guardian he deprived us of our patrimony; so that I have many good reasons,
        gentlemen, for wishing my father alive. Now, although it is necessary to mention those
        reasons, there is no need to dwell on them at length; for you all know well enough that I am
        speaking the truth. Nevertheless I will produce witnesses to those facts. <label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="Proof" unit="part"/>
        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well, it may be, gentlemen,
        that he will make no defence on these points, but will state again to you what he had the
        boldness to say before the arbitrator<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">At the preliminary
          trial, which was subject to appeal to a higher court. See Introduction, p. 196, note
          b.</note>—that it is not a use of a forbidden word to say that someone has killed his
        father, since the law does not prohibit that, but does disallow the use of the word
        “murderer.” <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>For my part, gentlemen, I hold that your
        concern is not with mere words but with their meaning, and that you are all aware that those
        who have killed someone are murderers, and that those who are murderers have killed someone.
        For it was too much of a task for the lawgiver to write all the words that have the same
        effect; but by mentioning one he showed his meaning in regard to them all. <milestone n="8"
          unit="section"/>For I presume, Theomnestus, you would not go so far, while expecting to
        get satisfaction from a man who called you a father-beater or a mother-beater, as to
        consider that he should go unpunished for saying that you struck your male or your female
        parent because he had spoken no forbidden word! <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>And I
        should be glad if you would tell me this, since of this affair you are a past master, both
        in action and in speech: if a man said that you had cast your shield (in the terms of the
        law it stands,—“if anyone asserts that a man has thrown it away, he shall be liable to
        penalty”), would you not prosecute him? Would you be content, if someone said you had cast
        your shield, to make nothing of it, because casting and throwing away are not the same
        thing? <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>Nay, if you were one of the Eleven,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Magistrates who had powers of summary arrest and judgement in
          capital and other serious cases, and also the charge of prisons and executions.</note> you
        would refuse to accept a prisoner arrested on the charge of having pulled off the accuser’s
        cloak or stripped him of his shirt: by that same rule, you would rather let him go, because
        he was not called a clothes-stealer! Or if somebody were seized for the abduction of a
        child, you would declare him to be no kidnapper, since your contention will be about words,
        and you will have no thought to spare for deeds,—the objects for which words are everywhere
        made! <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Then, again, consider this, gentlemen,—for I believe
        that this man, from indolence and enervation, has not even gone up to attend the
          Areopagus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The speaker suggests that Theomnestus’s
          ignorance shows that he has never attended a sitting of the Areopagus, the most august
          tribunal of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note>: you all know that
        in that place, when they try cases of murder, they do not use this term in making the sworn
        statements, but the one which was used for slandering me; the prosecutor swears that the
        other party has killed, and the defendant that he has not killed. <milestone n="12"
          unit="section"/>Well now, it would be absurd to acquit the doer of the deed when he
        declared he was a murderer, on the ground that the prosecutor deposed on oath that the
        defendant killed. And is not this the same thing as what this man’s plea will amount to?
        Why, you have taken proceedings yourself against Lysitheus for slander, because he said that
        you had cast your shield: yet there is nothing in the terms of the law about casting,
        whereas, if anyone says, that a man has thrown away his shield, it imposes a penalty of five
        hundred drachmae.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">About 330 pounds.</note>
        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>How monstrous it is, then, that when you have to avenge
        yourself on your enemies for slander you take the laws in the sense that I do now, but when
        you slander another in defiance of the laws you claim to escape punishment! Tell me, are you
        so clever that you are able to turn the laws about to suit your pleasure, or so powerful
        that you suppose that the people whom you have wronged will never get their revenge?
          <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>And then, are you not ashamed of such a senseless vagary
        as to presume on advantages due to you, not for any services done to the State, but for your
        unpunished offences? Please read me the law.<label>Law</label>
        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well, gentlemen, I think
        you have all perceived that my statement is correct, whereas this man is so stupid that he
        cannot understand a word that is said. So I would like to avail myself of some other laws
        for his instruction on these points, in the hope that even now, on the dais,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">There were separate raised seats for the prosecutor and the
          defendant.</note> he may learn a lesson, and may henceforward cease from his vexatious
        proceedings against us. Please read me those ancient laws of Solon. <milestone n="16"
          unit="section"/><label>Law</label>
            <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>“He
          shall have his foot confined in the stocks for five days, if the court shall make such
          addition to the sentence.”</quote> The “stocks” there mentioned, Theomnestus, are what we
        now call “confinement in the wood.” So if a person confined should on his release accuse the
        Eleven, at their public examination, of having him confined, not in the stocks, but in the
        wood, they would take him for an idiot, would they not? Read another law. <milestone n="17"
          unit="section"/><label>Law</label>“He shall vow by Apollo and give
          security. If he dreads the course of justice, let him flee.”</quote>
        <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Here to “vow” is to “swear,” and “flee” is what we now call
        “run away.”<label>Law</label>“Whosoever debars with his door, when the
          thief is within,”</quote>—Here to “debar” is taken to be “shut out”; no dispute, now, on
        that score! <milestone n="18" unit="section"/><label>Law</label>“Money
          shall be placed out at whatever rate the lender may choose.”</quote> “Placed out” here, my
        fine fellow, is not a case of placing in the balance, but of drawing interest to such amount
        as one may choose. Once more, read the final clause of this same law. <milestone n="19"
          unit="section"/><label>Law</label>“All women who ply about
          overtly,”</quote> and<label>Law</label>“for hurt to a varlet the redress
          shall be double.”</quote> Pay attention: “overtly” is “openly,” “ply about” is “walk
        about,” and a “varlet” is a “servant.” <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>We have many other
        instances of the sort, gentlemen. But if he is not a numskull, I suppose he has realized
        that things are the same now as they were of old, but that in some cases we do not use the
        same terms now as we did formerly. And he will show as much, for he will leave the dais and
        depart in silence. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>If not, I beg you, gentlemen, to vote
        according to justice, reflecting that it is a far greater slur to be told that one has
        killed one’s father than that one has thrown away one’s shield. I, for one, would rather
        have cast any number of shields than entertain such thoughts regarding my father. <milestone
          n="22" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now this man, on a charge which was
        well-founded, but which involved less disaster to him, obtained not only your pity, but even
        the disfranchisement<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">For perjury.</note> of the witness for
        the prosecution. But I, who have seen him do that<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Namely,
          throw away his shield.</note> which you likewise know, who have saved my own shield, who
        have been accused of a proceeding thus unholy and monstrous, and whose disaster will be
        overwhelming if he is acquitted, while his will be inconsiderable if he is convicted of
        slander,-am I not to obtain satisfaction from him? What imputation have you standing against
        me? <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>Is it that I have been justly accused? No, not even
        yourselves can say so. That the defendant is a better man and of better birth than I? No;
        not he himself can claim this. That having thrown away my arms I am suing for slander a man
        who saved his? This is not the story that has been disseminated in the city. <milestone
          n="24" unit="section"/>Remember that there you have presented him with a rich and goodly
          gift<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., his success in securing the condemnation and
          disfranchisement of Dionysius, the other witness in the previous trial.</note> in that
        respect, who would not pity Dionysius for the disaster that overtook him, after he had
        proved himself a man of the highest valor in times of danger, <milestone n="25"
          unit="section"/>who on leaving the court remarked that that was our most calamitous
        campaign, in which many of us were killed, and those who saved their arms had been condemned
        for false witness at the suit of those who threw theirs away; and that it had been better
        for him to be killed on that day than return home to meet with such a fate? <milestone
          n="26" unit="section"/>Do not, then, if you pity Theomnestus for the obloquy that he
        deserves, forgive him for outrages and expressions whereby he has broken the laws. For what
        greater misfortune could befall me, after I have had such shameful charges brought against
        me, and in relation to such a father? <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>He was general many
        times, and shared your peril besides in many a conflict; neither did his person fall into
        the hands of the enemy, nor was he ever convicted by his fellow-citizens at any audit of his
        service, but at the age of sixty-seven he lost his life under the oligarchy for loyalty to
        your people. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>Is there not good cause to feel anger against
        the man who has made such statements, and to defend my father as included in this calumny?
        For what more distressing fate could overtake him than this,—after being slain by his
        enemies, to bear the reproach of having been destroyed by his children? Even now, gentlemen,
        the memorials of his valor are hanging in your temples, while those of this man’s and his
        father’s baseness are seen in the temples of the enemy, so ingrained is cowardice in their
        nature. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>And indeed, gentlemen, the taller and more gallant
        they are in looks, the more they are deserving of anger. For it is clear that, though strong
        in their bodies, they are ill in their souls. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/><milestone
          ed="P" unit="para"/>I hear, gentlemen, that he is resorting to the argument that he has
        made these statements in a fit of anger at my having borne witness to the same effect as
        Dionysius. But your reflection on this, gentlemen, must be that the lawgiver grants no
        indulgence to anger he punishes the speaker, unless he proves the truth of the statements
        that he has made. I myself have now borne witness twice in regard to this man; for I was not
        yet aware that you punished the persons who had seen the deed, but pardoned those who had
        done the throwing away.<milestone n="Concl" unit="part"/>
        <milestone n="31" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I doubt if on these points
        there is need to say any more. I request you to condemn Theomnestus, reflecting that no
        trial could be more serious for me than the present. For although I am now prosecuting for
        slander, yet at the same casting of your vote I am prosecuted for murdering my father,—I who
        alone, as soon as I was certified to be of age,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">By the
          Council, when he was eighteen years old.</note> indicted the Thirty before the Areopagus.
          <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>Remembering these reasons, vindicate me and my father,
        and also the established laws and the oaths that you have sworn.</p>
