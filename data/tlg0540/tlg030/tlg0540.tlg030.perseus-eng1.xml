      <p>
        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There have been cases,
        gentlemen of the jury, of persons who, when brought to trial, have appeared to be guilty,
        but who, on showing forth their ancestors’ virtues and their own benefactions, have obtained
        your pardon. Since, therefore, you are satisfied with the plea of the defendants, if they
        are shown to have done some service to the State, it is fair that you should also listen to
        the accusers, if they show forth a long course of villainy in the accused. <milestone n="2"
          unit="section"/>Now, to tell how Nicomachus’s father was a public slave,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Owned by the State and employed in the police and other public
          services.</note> and what were the man’s own occupations in his youth, and at what age he
        was admitted to his clan,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A subdivision of the tribe, to
          which admission was usually obtained in infancy.</note> would be a lengthy affair: but
        when he became a commissioner for transcribing the laws, it is common knowledge what
        outrages he committed on the city. For whereas he had been instructed to transcribe the laws
        of Solon within four months, he usurped the place of Solon as lawgiver, extended his office
        over six years instead of four months, and day by day, in return for payment, he inserted
        some laws and erased others. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>We were brought to such a pass
        that we had our laws dispensed to us from his hands, and parties to suits produced opposite
        laws in the courts, both sides asserting that they had obtained them from Nicomachus. When
        the magistrates imposed summary fines on him, and brought him up in court, he refused to
        hand over the laws: nay, the city was already involved in the gravest disasters, and still
        he had not been relieved of his office, nor had submitted to an audit of his proceedings.
          <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And observe, gentlemen, how, having suffered no
        punishment for that conduct, he has now turned his new office to similar account: first, he
        has been transcribing for four years, when he could have discharged his duty in thirty days;
        and second, although he had definite orders as to the texts that he had to transcribe, he
        assumed supreme authority over the whole code, and after handling more business than anyone
        had ever done before he is the only person who has held office without submitting to an
        audit. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Everyone else, with each new presidency,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Every 35 days the presidency of the Council and the Assembly
          was taken over by a committee of 50 representatives of the 10 tribes. Magistrates on going
          out of office submitted their accounts to a board of 10 auditors (<foreign
            xml:lang="greek">logistai/</foreign>); appointed by the Council, and some minor officers
          changed with each “presidency.”.</note> renders an account of his office; but you,
        Nicomachus, have not deigned to show your accounts for as much as four years; you, alone of
        the citizens, claim licence to hold office for a lengthy period, without either submitting
        to an audit, or obeying the decrees, or respecting the laws: you insert this, and erase
        that, and carry insolence to such a pitch that you regard the State’s property as yours, who
        are yourself its slave! <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>It is your duty, therefore,
        gentlemen of the jury, to remember what was the ancestry of Nicomachus, and also how
        ungrateful has been his treatment of you with his illegal acts, and to punish him: so, since
        you have not made him pay the penalty for each one of them, exact requital now, at any rate,
        for them all. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It may be,
        gentlemen, that, failing to find a plea for his own defence, he will try to slander me: but
        I would ask you only to credit this man’s account of my life when, on having to defend
        myself, I fail to convict him of falsehood. If by chance he should venture on a repetition
        of what he stated before the Council,—that I was one of the Four Hundred,—reflect that on
        the basis of such statements as this the Four Hundred will number more than a thousand; for
        on those who were still but children at that time, or were not residing here, this aspersion
        is commonly cast by persons of slanderous intent. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>But for
        my part, so far was I from being one of the Four Hundred that I was not even included in the
        list of the Five Thousand. And I consider it monstrous that, although in a suit concerning
        private contracts, had I convicted him as plainly as here of wrongdoing, he would not even
        himself have expected to obtain an acquittal by resorting to such a defence, he now, on his
        trial for matters of public interest, is to count on escaping punishment at your hands by
        accusing me. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, I
        find it astonishing that Nicomachus should think fit to stir up resentment against others in
        this criminal way, when I mean to prove that he hatched mischief against the people. And now
        listen to me; for it is justifiable, gentlemen of the jury, to admit such accusations in the
        case of men who, having combined at that time to subvert the democracy, would represent
        themselves today as democrats. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>After the loss of our
          ships,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">At <placeName key="tgn,6000070"
            >Aegospotami</placeName>, <date value="-405">405</date> B.C.</note> when the revolution
        was being arranged, Cleophon<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Lys. 13.7">Lys.
            13.7</bibl>, note.</note> reviled the Council, declaring that it was in conspiracy<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., with the oligarchs.</note> and was not seeking the best
        interests of the State. Satyrus of Cephisia,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">An Attic
          township about 9 miles north-east of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
          >Athens</placeName>.</note> one of the Council, persuaded them to arrest him and hand him
        over to the court. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Those who wished to do away with him,
        fearing that they would fail of a death-sentence in the law-court, persuaded Nicomachus to
        exhibit a law requiring the Council<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Mainly consisting of
          oligarchs, and so likely to condemn Cleophon.</note> to partake in the trial as assessors.
        And this man, the worst of villains, was so open in his support of the plot that on the day
        of the trial he exhibited the law. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>Now against Cleophon,
        gentlemen of the jury, one might have other accusations to urge; but one thing is admitted
        on all sides,—that the subverters of the democracy desired to get him out of their way more
        than any other of the citizens, and that Satyrus and Chremon, who were members of the
        Thirty, accused Cleophon, not from any anger at your fate, but in order that, having put
        that man to death, they might injure you themselves. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>And
        they achieved their end because of the law which Nicomachus exhibited. Now you may
        reasonably reflect, gentlemen,—even those of you who thought Cleophon to be a bad
        citizen,—that, although among those who perished under the oligarchy there were perhaps one
        or two villains, yet it was on account of even such sufferers that you were incensed against
        the Thirty, as having put them to death, not for their crimes, but for motives of party.
          <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>If, therefore, he tries to rebut this charge, you have
        merely to remember that he exhibited the law at that very moment when the revolution was
        being effected, with the aim of gratifying those who had subverted the democracy; and that
        he included as assessors at the trial that Council in which Satyrus and Chremon had the
        chief influence, and which put to death Strombichides,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">See
            <bibl n="Lys. 13.13">Lys. 13.13</bibl>, note.</note> Calliades and a number of loyal and
        upright citizens. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I should
        have made no reference to these events had I not learnt that he was going to attempt, by
        posing as a democrat, to save himself in despite of justice, and that he would produce his
        exile as a proof of his attachment to the people. But I on my part could point out others
        among those who combined to subvert the democracy who were either put to death or exiled and
        debarred from the citizenship, <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>so that he cannot expect to
        get any credit on that account. For while this man did contribute his share to your exile,
        he owed his return to you, the people. And besides, it would be monstrous if you should feel
        grateful to him for what he underwent against his will, but should exact no requital for his
        voluntary offences. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I am
        informed that he alleges that I am guilty of impiety in seeking to abolish the sacrifices.
        But if it were I who were law-making over this transcription of our code, I should take it
        to be open to Nicomachus to make such a statement about me. But in fact I am merely claiming
        that he should obey the code established and patent to all<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >The speaker seems to mean: “If I, like Nicomachus, were using the opportunities of a
          transcriber for the purpose of unauthorized ‘law-making,’ he might reasonably accuse me of
          some such innovation as ‘abolishing sacrifices’; whereas I merely demand that he should
          adhere to the established code, about which there is no doubt or secrecy.”</note>; and I
        am surprised at his not observing that, when he taxes me with impiety for saying that we
        ought to perform the sacrifices named in the tablets and pillars as directed in the
        regulations, he is accusing the city as well: for they are what you have decreed. And then,
        sir, if you feel these to be hard words, surely you must attribute grievous guilt to those
        citizens who used to sacrifice solely in accordance with the tablets. <milestone n="18"
          unit="section"/>But of course, gentlemen of the jury, we are not to be instructed in piety
        by Nicomachus, but are rather to be guided by the ways of the past. Now our ancestors, by
        sacrificing in accordance with the tablets, have handed down to us a city superior in
        greatness and prosperity to any other in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; so
        that it behoves us to perform the same sacrifices as they did, if for no other reason than
        that of the success which has resulted from those rites. <milestone n="19" unit="section"
        />And how could a man show greater piety than mine, when I demand, first that our sacrifices
        be performed according to our ancestral rules, and second that they be those which tend to
        promote the interests of the city, and finally those which the people have decreed and which
        we shall be able to afford out of the public revenue? But you, Nicomachus, have done the
        opposite of this: by entering in your copy a greater number than had been ordained you have
        caused the public revenue to be expended on these, and hence to be deficient for our
        ancestral offerings. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>For example, last year some
        sacrifices, costing three talents, were in abeyance, though they were among those inscribed
        on the tablets. And it cannot be said that the revenues of the State were insufficient; for
        if this man had not entered sacrifices to an excess amounting to six talents, there would
        have been enough for our ancestral offerings, and moreover the State would have had a
        surplus of three talents. In support of these statements I will add the evidence of
          witnesses.<label>Witnesses</label>
        <milestone n="21" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Reflect, therefore,
        gentlemen of the jury, that when we proceed in accordance with the regulations, all the
        ancestral offerings are made; but when we are guided by the pillars as copied by this man,
        numerous rites are abolished.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., some of the “ancestral
          rites” are dropped because the necessary funds have to be spent on the rites that he has
          foisted into the code.</note> Whereupon the sacrilegious wretch runs about saying that his
        transcription was piety and not parsimony, and that if you do not approve of his work you
        had better erase it: by this means he thinks to persuade you of his innocence. Yet in two
        years he has managed to spend twelve talents more than was necessary, <milestone n="22"
          unit="section"/>and has endeavored to mulct the State in a sum of six talents each
        year,—and that too when he saw her in difficulties for money, the Lacedaemonians threatening
        us if we failed to remit them their payments, the Boeotians taking reprisals because we
        could not refund two talents, and the shipping sheds and the walls falling to pieces; when
        he knew that the Council for the time being is not led into error if it has sufficient means
        for the administration, but is forced in a time of difficulty to accept impeachments, to
        confiscate the property of our citizens, and to be swayed by the most unprincipled of its
        orators! <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>You ought therefore, gentlemen, to be incensed,
        not with those who happen to be on the Council, but with those who reduce the State to these
        awful straits. And the men who seek to rob the public purse are watching closely to see how
        Nicomachus will fare in these proceedings. If you do not punish him, you will grant them
        absolute licence; but if you condemn him and award him your heaviest sentence, by the same
        vote you will reform the rest, and will have done justice upon this man. <milestone n="24"
          unit="section"/>Understand, gentlemen of the jury, that it will be an example to the rest,
        and will deter them from committing offences against you, if instead of punishing unskillful
        speakers you exact requital from the skillful. And from whom amongst our citizens could it
        be more suitably exacted than from Nicomachus? Who has rendered less service or done more
        wrong to the city? <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>Appointed to transcribe our code of
        duties, secular and sacred, he has offended against both. Remember that ere now you have put
        many of the citizens to death for peculation: yet the injury that they had done you was only
        for the passing moment, whereas these men,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The speaker
          enlarges the crime of the accused by suggesting that there are others practicing or
          attempting the same thing.</note> by taking bribes for the version that they made of our
        laws, damage the city for all time. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
          unit="para"/>And what reason is there for acquitting this man? Because he has taken a
        brave man’s part in many battles by land and sea against the enemy? But while you were
        facing danger on naval expeditions, this man stayed at home and corrupted the laws of Solon.
        Or because he has disbursed money and contributed to numerous levies? But, so far from
        bestowing anything of his own upon you, he has embezzled a vast amount of your property. Or
        because of his ancestors? <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>For this has been a reason in
        the past for some men obtaining your pardon. But if this man deserves to be put to death on
        his own account, he ought to be sold on account of his ancestors.<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">Being of servile birth, he has no right to the citizenship, and should be sold
          in the slave-market.</note> Or is it that, if you spare him now, he will repay your
        favours hereafter? He does not even remember the benefits in which you allowed him to share
        before. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>And yet from a slave he has become a citizen, and
        has exchanged beggary for wealth and the position of under-clerk for that of lawgiver! And
        here one might even make it an accusation against you that, whereas your ancestors chose as
        lawgivers Solon, Themistocles and Pericles, in the belief that the laws would accord with
        the character of their makers, you have chosen Teisamenus,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >Who proposed the decree that the laws should be revised.</note> son of Mechanion, and
        Nicomachus, and other persons who were under-clerks; and although you feel that the
        magistracy is depraved by people of this sort, it is just these men who have your
        confidence. <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>Most extraordinary of all, though it is not
        permissible for the same man to act twice as under-clerk to the same magistracy, you
        authorize the same persons to have control over the most important affairs for a long
        period. And, to crown all, you have chosen Nicomachus for the transcription of our ancestral
        rites, when on the father’s side he has no connection with the State; <milestone n="30"
          unit="section"/>and the man who ought to have been tried by the people is found to have
        joined in destroying the people. Today, therefore, you must repent of the things that you
        have done, and refuse to endure continual maltreatment from these men. You reprobate the
        guilty in private: do not acquit them when you are free to punish them. <milestone n="31"
          unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On these matters I have now said enough:
        but in regard to those who propose to beg him off I would make to you a few remarks. Some of
        his friends and some members of the government have arranged to intercede for him: several
        of them, in my opinion, ought much rather to defend their own acts than engage to save the
        guilty. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>But it seems to me an extraordinary thing,
        gentlemen of the jury, that, when he was but one man, in no way wronged by the State, they
        made no attempt at requiring him to desist from his offences against you, but should seek to
        persuade you, who are so many and have been wronged by him, that you should not do justice
        upon him. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>You ought therefore to show on your part the
        same zeal, with which you see them working to save their friends, in punishing your enemies,
        fully assured that they will be the first to think the better of you for exacting the
        penalty from the guilty. Reflect that not a single one of those who will plead for him has
        done as much service as this man has done wrong to the State, and that therefore it is much
        more your duty to punish than it is theirs to succor. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>You
        must also know for certain that these same men have plied the prosecution with many appeals,
        but have utterly failed to persuade us: it is to make a base attempt on your vote that they
        have entered the court, and they are hoping to deceive you, and so obtain licence to act as
        they please in the future. <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>Now we, having refused to be
        swayed by the inducements of their appeal, exhort you to show the same spirit and, instead
        of merely detesting wickedness before it is brought to trial, to make this trial your means
        of punishing those who nullify your legislation. For thus everything connected with public
        affairs will be administered in accordance with the laws.</p>
