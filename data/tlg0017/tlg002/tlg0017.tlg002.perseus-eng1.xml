			<div n="hypothesis" type="section">
				<p>Menecles adopted a son and lived for twenty-three years after the date of the
					adoption. When his brothers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This is incorrect;
						there was only one brother, whose son was also apparently associated with
						him in the case.</note> claimed his estate, a certain Philonides attested
					that the estate was not adjudicable, because Menecles had left a son. The
					brothers then brought an action for perjury against Philonides, and it is
					against them that the son undertakes the defence of Philonides. The speech,
					which is in defence of a will, is the counterpart of that delivered “On the
					Estate of Cleonymus,”<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Isaeus 1">Isaeus
							1</bibl></note> which upholds the rights of kindred. The discussion
					concerns a point of law with a controversy on a point of fact; for the speaker
					affirms that the deceased had the right to adopt a son, and then deals with the
					point of fact, saying, “It was not under the influence of a woman that he
					adopted me.” </p>
			</div>
			<div n="1" type="section">
				<p>I think, gentlemen, that, if any adoption was ever made in accordance with the
					laws, mine was, and no one could ever dare to say that Menecles adopted me in a
					moment of insanity or under the influence of a woman. But since my uncle,
					acting, as I assert, under a misapprehension, is trying by every means in his
					power to deprive his dead brother of descendants, showing no respect for the
					gods of his family or for any of you, I feel constrained to come to the aid of
					the father who adopted me, and to my own aid. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="2" type="section">
				<p>I intend, therefore, first to show you that my adoption was appropriate and
					legal, and that there is no question of adjudicating the estate of Menecles,
					since he had a son, namely, myself, and that the evidence of the witness was
					true. I beg and entreat and beseech you all to listen with favor to what I have
					to say. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="3" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>My father, gentlemen, Eponymus of Acharnae,<note
						resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A deme of <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
							>Attica</placeName> about seven miles north of <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> was a friend and close
					acquaintance of Menecles and lived on terms of intimacy with him; there were
					four of us children, two sons and two daughters. After my father's death we
					married our elder sister, when she reached a suitable age, to Leucolophus,
					giving her a dowry of twenty minae. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="4" type="section">
				<p>Four or five years later, when our younger sister was almost of marriageable age,
					Menecles lost his first wife. When he had carried out the customary rites over
					her, he asked for our sister in marriage, reminding us of the friendship which
					had existed between our father and himself and of his friendly disposition
					towards ourselves. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="5" type="section">
				<p>Knowing that our father would have given her to no one with greater pleasure, we
					gave her to him in marriage—not dowerless, as my opponent asserts on every
					possible occasion, but with the same portion as we gave to our elder sister. In
					this manner, having been formerly his friends, we became his kinsmen. I should
					like first to produce evidence that Menecles received a dowry of twenty minae
					with my sister.<quote type="Evidence"><title>Evidence</title></quote>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="6" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having thus settled our sisters, gentlemen, and,
					being ourselves of military age, we adopted the career of a soldier and went
					abroad with Iphicrates to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.<note
						resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See Introduction, p. 39.</note> Having proved
					our worth there, we returned hither after saving a little money and we found
					that our elder sister had two children, but that the younger, the wife of
					Menecles, was childless. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="7" type="section">
				<p>Two or three months later Menecles, with many expressions of praise for our
					sister, approached us and said that he viewed with apprehension his increasing
					age and childlessness: she ought not, he said, to be rewarded for her virtues by
					having to grow old with him without bearing children; </p>
			</div>
			<div n="8" type="section">
				<p>it was enough that he himself was unfortunate. [;His words clearly prove that he
					loved her when he put her away; for no one utters supplications for one whom he
						hates.];<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This sentence is inappropriate and
						has clearly come into the text from a marginal gloss.</note> He, therefore,
					begged us to do him the favor of marrying her to someone else with his consent.
					We told him that it was for him to persuade her in the matter, for we would do
					whatever she agreed. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="9" type="section">
				<p>At first she would not even listen to his suggestion, but in course of time she
					with difficulty consented. So we gave her in marriage to Elius of Sphettus,<note
						resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A deme south-west of <placeName
							key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and Menecles handed over
					her dowry to him—for he had become part-lessee of the estate of the children of
						Nicias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See Introduction, p. 38.</note>—and
					he gave her the garments which she had brought with her to his house and the
					jewelry which there was. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="10" type="section">
				<p>Some time after this Menecles began to consider how he could put an end to his
					childless condition and have someone to tend his old age and bury him when he
					died and thereafter carry out the customary rites over him. He saw that my
					opponent had only one son; so he thought it wrong to ask him to give him his son
					to adopt and so deprive him of male offspring. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="11" type="section">
				<p>Thus he could find no nearer relative than us; he, therefore, approached us and
					said that he thought it right, since fate had decreed that he should have no
					children by our sister, that he should adopt a son out of the family from which
					he would have wished to have a son of his own in the course of nature; “I should
					like, therefore,” he said,“to adopt one of you two, whichever is willing.” </p>
			</div>
			<div n="12" type="section">
				<p>My brother, on hearing this,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The words bracketed
						in the text have certainly come in from a marginal note and are unsuited to
						the context here.</note> expressed his approval of Menecles' proposal and
					agreed that his age and solitary condition required someone who would look after
					him, and remain at home; “I,” he said, “as you know, go abroad; but my brother
					here” (meaning me) “will look after your affairs as well as mine, if you wish to
					adopt him.” Menecles approved of his suggestion and thus adopted me. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="13" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I wish next to prove to you that the adoption was
					carried out in the proper legal manner. So please read me the law which ordains
					that a man can dispose as he likes of his own property, if he does not possess
					male issue of his own. The law-giver, gentlemen, legislated thus, because he saw
					that for childless persons the only refuge for their solitary condition, and the
					only possible comfort in life, lay in the possibility of adopting whomsoever
					they wished. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="14" type="section">
				<p>The law thus allowing Menecles, because he was childless, to adopt a son, he
					adopted me, not by a will made at the point of death, as other citizens have
					done, nor during illness; but when he was sound in body and mind, and fully
					aware of what he was doing, he adopted me and introduced me to his
					fellow-wardsmen in the presence of my opponents and enrolled me among the
					demesmen and the members of his confraternity.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
						>A private religious association, cf. <bibl n="Isaeus 9.30">Isaeus
							9.30</bibl>.</note>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="15" type="section">
				<p>At the time my opponents raised no objection to his action on the ground that he
					was not in his right mind, although it would have been much better to have tried
					to win him over to their point of view during his lifetime rather than insult
					him now that he is dead and try to desolate his house. For he lived on after the
					adoption, not one or two years, but twenty-three, and during all this period he
					never regretted what he had done, because it was universally acknowledged that
					he had been well advised in what he did. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="16" type="section">
				<p>To prove the truth of these statements, I will produce before you, as witnesses,
					the wardsmen, the members of the confraternity, and the demesmen, and, to prove
					that Menecles was at liberty to adopt me, the clerk of the court shall read you
					the text of the law in accordance with which the adoption was made. Please read
					these depositions and the law.<quote><title>Depositions. Laws.</title></quote>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="17" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The law itself makes it clear that Menecles was
					free to adopt anyone he liked as his son; that he did adopt a son, the wardsmen,
					the demesmen, and the members of the confraternity have provided evidence. Thus
					we have clearly proved it, gentlemen, the witness<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">Philonides.</note> has attested the truth of it, and my
					opponents cannot say a word against the actual fact of the adoption. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="18" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, Menecles began to look about for a
					wife for me, and said I ought to marry. So I married the daughter of Philonides.
					Menecles exercised the forethought on my behalf which a father would naturally
					exercise for his son, and I tended him and respected him as though he were my
					true father, as also did my wife, so that he praised us to all his
					fellow-demesmen. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="19" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That Menecles was not insane or under the
					influence of a woman but in his right mind when he adopted me, you can easily
					understand from the following facts. In the first place, my sister, with whom
					most of my opponent's argument has been concerned, and under whose influence he
					alleges that Menecles adopted me, had remarried long before the adoption took
					place, so that, if it had been under her influence that he was adopting his son,
					he would have adopted one of her boys; for she has two. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="20" type="section">
				<p>But, gentlemen, it was not under her influence that he adopted me as his son; his
					chief motive was his loneliness, and, secondly, the other causes I have
					mentioned, and the goodwill which he felt towards my father, and, thirdly,
					because he had no other relative from whose family he might have adopted a son.
					These were the motives which at the time induced him to adopt me; so that it is
					quite clear that he was not insane or under the influence of a woman, unless,
					indeed, my opponent wishes to describe his loneliness and childlessness in these
					terms. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="21" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I feel that I should like my opponent, who thinks
					himself so wise, to tell me whom of his relatives Menecles ought to have
					adopted? Ought he to have adopted my opponent's son? But he would never have
					given him up and so rendered himself childless; he is not so avaricious as all
					that. Well then, the son of his sister or of his male or female cousin? But he
					had no such relative at all. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="22" type="section">
				<p>He was, therefore, obliged to adopt someone else, or, failing that, grow old in
					childlessness, as my opponent now thinks he ought to have done. I think,
					therefore, that you would all admit that, when he adopted a son, he could not
					have adopted anyone who was more closely connected with him than I was.
					Otherwise, let my opponent indicate such a person. He cannot possibly do so; for
					he had no other kinsman than those whom I have mentioned. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="23" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But my opponent is now clearly blaming Menecles
					not for failing to adopt his own son but for adopting any son at all and not
					dying childless. It is for this that he blames him, a proceeding which is as
					spiteful as it is unjust; for while he has children of his own, he is obviously
					blaming Menecles for being childless and unfortunate. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="24" type="section">
				<p>All other men, whether Greek or barbarians, regard this law about adoption as a
					good one and therefore all make use of it; but my uncle here is not ashamed to
					deprive his own brother of this right to adopt a son, the enjoyment of which no
					one has ever grudged even those who were no relatives at all. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="25" type="section">
				<p>I think that my opponent, if anyone were to ask him what he would have done in
					the same circumstances as Menecles, would have nothing to say except that he
					would have adopted someone who was likely to look after him while he lived and
					bury him when he died; and it is obvious that the adoption would have been
					carried out under the same law as mine was. He himself, then, if he had been
					childless, would have adopted a son; but when Menecles acts in the same manner,
					he declares that he was insane and under the influence of a woman when he
					adopted me. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="26" type="section">
				<p>Is it not clear that he is talking in an abominable manner? I am of opinion that
					it is much rather my opponent who is insane by reason of the line of argument
					which he employs and the things which he does. For he is clearly arguing the
					contrary of the laws and of justice and of what he himself would have done, and
					is not ashamed of making the law about adoption valid for himself, while he
					seeks to render this same law of no effect for his brother. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="27" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next, it is right, gentlemen, that you should hear
					what cause of quarrel my opponent has that he seeks to make his own brother
					childless. For if he has any quarrel with me about my name, and repudiates the
					suggestion that I am to be called Menecles' son, is he not the victim of mean
					jealousy? But if it is a question of money with him, let him point out to you
					what land or building or house Menecles left behind of which I am now in
					possession. But if he left no such property, but my opponent took from him in
					his lifetime all that remained after he had paid off the money due to the
					orphan, is he not clearly convicted of shameless conduct? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="28" type="section">
				<p>I will put the facts of the case before you. When it became necessary to pay back
					the money to the orphan, and Menecles did not possess the requisite sum, and
					interest had accumulated against him over a long period, he was for selling the
					land. My opponent, seizing the opportunity and being desirous to pick a quarrel
					with him because he had adopted me, tried to prevent the land from being sold,
					in order that it might be held as a pledge, and that Menecles might be obliged
					to cede the possession of it to the orphan. My opponent, therefore, claimed a
					part of the property from Menecles, though he had never previously made any such
					claim, and tried to prevent the purchasers from completing the purchase. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="29" type="section">
				<p>Menecles was annoyed, as I can well imagine, and was obliged to reserve the
					portion which my opponent claimed; the rest he sold to Philippus of Pithos for
					seventy minae and thus paid off the orphan, giving him one talent and seven
					minae out of the price of the property; and he brought an action against his
					brother for restraining the sale. After long discussion had taken place and much
					bad feeling been aroused, we thought it best, in order that no one might say
					that I was avaricious and that I was setting these men, who were brothers,
					against one another, to submit the matter to the arbitration of my opponent's
					brother-in-law and our friends. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="30" type="section">
				<p>The latter told us that, if we were to entrust them to decide the rights of the
					case, they would refuse to act as arbitrators, for they did not wish to quarrel
					with either party; if, however, we would allow them to decide what was in the
					interest of all, they consented to act. So we, in order, as we thought, to get
					rid of the matter, entrusted the decision to them on these terms. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="31" type="section">
				<p>They, after having sworn an oath to us at the altar of Aphrodite at Cephale<note
						resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This sanctuary is mentioned on an inscription
						found near the E. coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>
						about 12 miles N. of Sunium.</note> that they would decide what was to our
					common interest, gave as their verdict that we should give up what my opponent
					claimed and hand it over to him as a free gift; for they declared that the only
					way of settling the matter was that my opponent should receive a share of
					Menecles' property. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="32" type="section">
				<p>They decided that for the future we must behave in a proper manner towards one
					another, both in word and in deed, and they obliged both parties to swear at the
					altar that they would do so; so we swore that we would in future behave properly
					towards one another both in word and in deed, as far as lay within our power.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="33" type="section">
				<p>That the oath was sworn and that these men are in possession of the property
					which was awarded to them by my opponent's friends and that their notion of
					behaving well towards us is this, to try and make the deceased childless and
					drive me forth with insult from his family—of all this I will produce before you
					as witnesses the very men who gave the decision, if they are willing to appear
					(for they are my opponent's friends), but, if not, those who were present on the
					occasion. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="34" type="section">
				<p>Please read these depositions; and, you, turn off the water-clock.<note

				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="35" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus it is my uncle here, gentlemen, who has
					inherited the property of Menecles—really and not merely nominally, as I
					have—and has a much larger share than I have; for I received only the three
					hundred drachmae which remained over out of the proceeds of the sale and a small
					house not worth three minae. My opponent, on the other hand, being in possession
					of land worth more than ten minae, has now, moreover, come into court with the
					object of rendering desolate the house of the deceased.<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">i.e., seeking to disinherit the adopted son and so deprive
						Menecles of a representative to carry on his family.</note>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="36" type="section">
				<p>I, the adopted son, with the aid of my wife, the daughter of Philonides here,
					tended Menecles while he lived and gave his name to my little son, in order that
					his family might not lack a representative. On his death, I buried him in a
					manner befitting both him and myself, and I erected a fine monument to him and
					celebrated the commemorative ceremony on the ninth day and performed all the
					other rites at the tomb in the best manner possible, so that I won the praise of
					all the members of my deme. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="37" type="section">
				<p>But my opponent, his kinsman, who blames him for having adopted a son, during his
					lifetime deprived him of the landed property which remained to him, and, now
					that he is dead, wishes to render him childless and wipe out his very name; that
					is the kind of man he is. In proof that I buried Menecles and performed the
					ceremonies on the third and ninth days and all the other rites connected with
					the burial, the clerk shall read you the depositions of those who are acquainted
					with the facts.<quote type="Evidence"><title>Evidence</title></quote>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="38" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In support of the truth of my assertion,
					gentlemen, that Menecles, when he adopted me, was not insane or under the
					influence of a woman, I wish to bring before you my opponents themselves as
					witnesses, not in word but in deed, by their own conduct. For it is notorious
					that both of them went through the process of reconciliation with me and not
					with Menecles, and swore an oath to me, as I did to them. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="39" type="section">
				<p>Yet if the adoption had not been carried out in proper legal form and I had not
					been recognized as heir to Menecles' property by my opponents themselves, what
					need was there for them to swear to me and to receive an oath from me? Surely
					none. By so acting then they themselves clearly bear witness that I was legally
					adopted and am the rightful heir of Menecles. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="40" type="section">
				<p>It is clear, I think, to you all that it was acknowledged even by my opponents
					themselves that Menecles was not insane but that it is much rather my opponent
					who is insane now, seeing that, after having effected a settlement of his
					quarrel with us and having sworn oaths, he has now again come forward in
					violation of his acknowledgements and oaths, and demands that I shall be
					deprived of these poor remnants of the estate. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="41" type="section">
				<p>Were it not that I think it an altogether base and shameful act to betray him
					whose son was called and who adopted me, I would have readily abandoned the
					right of succession to his estate in favor of my opponent; for there is nothing
					at all left, as I think you realize. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="42" type="section">
				<p>But, in the circumstances, I consider it terrible and disgraceful that, when
					Menecles possessed property, I accepted adoption as his son and out of his
					property, before the land was sold, acted as gymnasiarch<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">The duty of the gymnasiarch was to bear the expense of the
						torch-races at certain festivals.</note> in his deme and won credit as his
					son, and served in his tribe and deme on all the campaigns which took place
					during that period; </p>
			</div>
			<div n="43" type="section">
				<p>and, now that he is dead, if I shall betray him and go off leaving his house
					desolate, would it not seem a strange and ridiculous proceeding, and give those
					who wish to do so a good occasion to speak evil of me? And these are not the
					only motives which induce me to fight this case; but what grieves me is the
					possibility of being thought so worthless and good-for-nothing as not to be able
					to find a friend in his right senses, but only a madman, to adopt me. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="44" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I beg you all therefore, gentlemen, and beseech
					and entreat you to pity me and to acquit the witness here. I have shown you
					that, in the first place, I was adopted by Menecles with the strictest possible
					legality, and that the form of adoption was not merely verbal or by will but by
					very act and deed; and of these things I produced before you the evidence of the
					wardsmen, the demesmen, and the members of the confraternity. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="45" type="section">
				<p>I further showed that Menecles lived for twenty-three years after he had adopted
					me. Further, I placed before you the laws which permit those who are childless
					to adopt sons. In addition to this I am shown to have tended him in his lifetime
					and to have buried him when he died. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="46" type="section">
				<p>My opponent wishes now to deprive me of my father's estate, whether it be large
					or small, and to render the deceased childless and nameless, so that there may
					be no one to honor in his place the family cults and perform for him the annual
					rites, but that he may be robbed of all his due honors. It was to provide
					against this that Menecles, being master of his own property, adopted a son, so
					that he might secure all these advantages. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="47" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Do not therefore, gentlemen, listen to my
					opponents and deprive me of my name, the sole remnant of my inheritance, and
					annul Menecles' adoption of me; but since the matter has come before you for
					judgement and you have the sovereign right of decision, come to the aid both of
					us and of him who is in the other world, and do not allow Menecles, by the gods
