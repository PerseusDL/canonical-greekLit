			<div n="hypothesis" type="section">
				<p>Nicostratus having died in a foreign land, Hagnon and Hagnotheus, as being his
					first cousins (their father having been brother to Nicostratus's father),
					contend for the succession to his estate against Chariades, who claims to be
					heir by bequest, that is to say, by will. Isaeus, the orator, being a kinsman of
					Hagnon and his brother, speaks as their advocate.<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">This statement is improbable; see Introduction.</note> The
					question at issue is one of fact. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="1" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hagnon here and Hagnotheus, gentlemen, are
					intimate friends of mine, as was their father before them. It seems, therefore,
					only natural to me to support their case to the best of my ability.<milestone
						unit="para" ed="P"/>For the events which happened in a foreign land it is
					not possible to find witnesses or easy to convict our adversaries of any lies
					which they may tell, because neither of my clients has ever been to the country
					in question; but the events which have occurred here in <placeName
						key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> seem to me to provide you with
					sufficient proof that all those who lay claim to Nicostratus's estate on the
					ground of bequest are desirous of deceiving you. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="2" type="section">
				<p>In the first place, gentlemen, it is proper that you should consider the
					different names attributed to the deceased and determine which of the two
					parties has laid his claim in the more straightforward and natural manner.
					Hagnon here and Hagnotheus described Nicostratus in their claim as the son of
					Thrasymachus and declare that they are his first cousins and prove these
					statements by witnesses. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="3" type="section">
				<p>Chariades and his supporters, on the other hand, assert that Nicostratus was the
					son of Smicrus and yet claim the estate of the son of Thrasymachus. My clients
					make no pretence that they know anything of the name of Smicrus or that it has
					anything to do with them; they declare that Nicostratus was the son of
					Thrasymachus, and it is likewise his estate which they claim. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="4" type="section">
				<p>If the parties were in agreement as to the name of Nicostratus's father and were
					disputing only about the estate, you would only have to consider whether
					Nicostratus, on whose identity both were agreed, did or did not leave a will.
					But as it is, how is it possible to assign two fathers to the man? Yet this is
					what Chariades has done; he himself claimed the estate of Nicostratus the son of
					Smicrus, and paid the deposit for a suit against my clients when they claimed
					the estate of the son of Thrasymachus, just as though it were a question of one
					and the same person. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="5" type="section">
				<p>It is all an insolent plot and conspiracy. They think that my clients, if the
					matter is simple and nothing is introduced to confuse the issue, will have no
					difficulty in proving that Nicostratus made no will; whereas, if they allege
					that the father is not the same and likewise claim the estate, they know full
					well that my clients will have to employ a longer argument to prove that
					Nicostratus was the son of Thrasymachus than to convince you that he left no
					will. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="6" type="section">
				<p>Further, if they admitted that Nicostratus was the son of Thrasymachus, they
					would be unable to prove that my clients are not his cousins; but, by inventing
					another father for the deceased, they have introduced a discussion about his
					parentage as well as about the will. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="7" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it is not only from these proceedings but from
					all that has happened from the beginning that you can be sure that those who are
					thus plotting against my clients are strangers to the family. For who did not
					cut the hair<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As a sign of mourning.</note> when
					the two talents arrived from Ace<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See
						Introduction.</note>? Who did not wear black, hoping by mourning to inherit
					the estate? What was the number of would-be kinsmen and adopted sons who claimed
					Nicostratus's property? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="8" type="section">
				<p>Demosthenes declared himself to be his nephew, but renounced his claim when he
					was unmasked by my clients. Telephus asserted that Nicostratus had made him a
					gift of all his property; he too soon desisted. Ameiniades appeared before the
					archon and produced as Nicostratus's son a child not yet three years old,
					although it was eleven years since Nicostratus had been in <placeName
						key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p>
			</div>
			<div n="9" type="section">
				<p>Pyrrhus of Lamptra declared that the property had been consecrated by Nicostratus
					to Athena but that it had been given him by Nicostratus himself.<note
						resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The meaning is perhaps that Pyrrhus claimed a
						life-interest in the estate.</note> Ctesias of <placeName key="perseus,Besa"
						>Besa</placeName> and Cranaus at first asserted that Nicostratus had been
					condemned to pay them a talent; when they could not prove this, they pretended
					that he was their freedman;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">If a freedman died
						without issue, his property could, under certain circumstances, be claimed
						by his former master.</note> they were no better able to prove their
					statement. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="10" type="section">
				<p>These were the men who at the very beginning swooped down upon the estate of
					Nicostratus. Chariades at that time made no claim, but came forward later,
					foisting in not only himself but also his child by his mistress. It was all the
					same to him whether he was going to inherit the estate or have his son
					recognized as a citizen. He, too, perceiving that he would be defeated on the
					question of the child's birth, jettisoned the child's claim and paid a deposit
					to bring an action asserting his own right under a will. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="11" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It would be a good thing, gentlemen, that any
					claimant to an inheritance under a will, if he fails, should not be fined at the
					usual rate<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">One-tenth of the estimated value of
						the estate claimed.</note> but be made to pay into the treasury the full
					amount of the fortune which he set out to obtain; thus the laws would not be
					despised nor would the relatives be insulted, and above all, no fictions would
					be invented against the dead. But, since full liberty is given to anyone
					according to his fancy to claim anyone else's estate, it behoves you to sift
					their claims with every possible care and to omit no possible precaution. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="12" type="section">
				<p>It seems to me that in suits concerning inheritances, and in these alone, more
					credit ought to be given to circumstantial proof than to the statements of
					witnesses. When other legal instruments are the subject of litigation, it is not
					very difficult to convict those who give false evidence, for they give their
					evidence to the prejudice of the supposed party to the deed alive and present;
					but when a will is in question, how can one recognize those who are not telling
					the truth, unless the divergences in the evidence are great, since the party
					against whom they bear witness is dead, the relatives know nothing of the facts,
					and the method of refuting the evidence is by no means clear? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="13" type="section">
				<p>Further, gentlemen, most of those who make wills do not even mention to those who
					are present the purport of their will, but only invite them to attest the fact
					that they have made a will, and it is within the range of possibility that a
					will has been substituted or alterations made in a sense directly opposed to the
					wishes of the deceased; for the witnesses will have no more knowledge than
					anyone else whether the will produced is that which they were summoned to
					attest. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="14" type="section">
				<p>Since, then, it is possible to deceive those who were admittedly present when the
					will was made, how much more easily might an attempt be made to impose upon you
					who know nothing of the matter?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, gentlemen,
					the law ordains that a will in order to be valid must not merely be executed but
					executed by a man in his right senses. You ought, therefore, to examine, first,
					whether the deceased made a will and, secondly, whether he was in his right mind
					at the time. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="15" type="section">
				<p>Since, however, we deny that a will was made at all, how can you decide whether
					that a man was insane when he made a will, until you are convinced that actually
					he made a will? Observe, then, how difficult it is to discover whether those who
					claim under a will are telling the truth; those, on the other hand, who claim by
					right of kinship, in the first place, need not produce witnesses to prove that
					the inheritance is theirs—for it is universally admitted that the property of a
					deceased person devolves on his next-of-kin— </p>
			</div>
			<div n="16" type="section">
				<p>and, secondly, the laws, not only those which deal with consanguinity but also
					those which treat of testamentary disposition, are in favor of kinsmen. For the
					law allows no one to dispose of his own property if his reason is impaired by
					old age or disease or the other causes with which you are familiar; but by right
					of relationship the next-of-kin has an undisputed title to the property of a
					deceased person, whatever was the state of the latter's faculties. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="17" type="section">
				<p>Beside this, in order to believe in a will, you are obliged to rely on witnesses,
					by whom it is possible to be deceived—if this were not so, there would be no
					prosecutions for perjury—but when the claim is based on kinship, you act on your
					own authority, for the next-of-kin assert their right in accordance with the
					laws which you have laid down. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="18" type="section">
				<p>In addition to this, gentlemen, if those who claim under the will were admittedly
					close friends of Nicostratus, even then the conclusive proof would be lacking,
					though there would be a greater probability that the will could be regarded as
					genuine; for before now testators, being ill-disposed towards their kinsmen,
					have preferred strangers who were their friends to their nearest relatives by
					blood. But in the present case Nicostratus and Chariades were neither members of
					the same mess nor friends nor members of the same company,<note resp="Loeb"
						anchored="true">There is a lacuna in the text at this point and the sense is
						incomplete as it stands.</note> and on all these points we have produced
					witnesses before you. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="19" type="section">
				<p>And consider this further point, which is of great importance and is the clearest
					possible proof of Chariades' impudence. Whereas he neither took up the body of
					his adopted father nor committed it to the flames nor collected the bones, but
					left all these duties to be done by complete strangers, should he not be
					regarded as most impious in claiming to inherit the property of the deceased,
					though he never performed any of the customary rites over him? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="20" type="section">
				<p>Shall I be told that, after having performed none of these duties, he
					administered Nicostratus's property?<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This
						sentence is apparently parenthetic and ironical. There is a further
						reference in <bibl n="Isaeus 4.26">Isaeus 4.26</bibl> to certain business
						relations between Nicostratus and Chariades.</note> Evidence of these facts,
					too, has been given you, and even he himself does not deny most of them.
					Makeshift excuses have, of course, been found to explain all his acts; for what
					other resource remains to one who expressly admits the facts? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="21" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You must now be well aware, gentlemen, that these
					persons have no legal right to the property of Nicostratus, but wish to deceive
					you and to deprive my clients, who are his kinsmen, of an inheritance which
					lawfully belongs to them. Chariades is not the only person who has acted thus;
					many other claimants to the property of men who have died abroad have arisen,
					sometimes even without having been acquainted with them. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="22" type="section">
				<p>For they consider that, if they are successful, it will be possible for them to
					enjoy the property of others, while, if they fail, the risk is inconsiderable;
					there are always men who are willing to perjure themselves, and the attempted
					refutations of their evidence are dealing with the unknown. In a word, there is
					a vast difference between claiming by right of kinship and claiming under a
					will. But your duty, gentlemen, is first of all to examine the will and decide
					whether you think that it is genuine; for this is what the laws enjoin and is
					the justest course. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="23" type="section">
				<p>But since you have no certain personal knowledge of the truth, and since the
					witnesses to the will were friends not of the deceased but of Chariades, who
					wishes to seize property which does not belong to him, what could be juster than
					by your verdict to award the property of a kinsmen to his kinsmen? For, indeed,
					if anything had happened to my clients, their property would have passed to none
					other than Nicostratus; for he would have claimed it by the same right of
					kinship, being their first cousin, the son of their father's own brother. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="24" type="section">
				<p>But, by Heaven, I am forgetting; Hagnon and Hagnotheus are not kinsmen of
					Nicostratus according to the allegation of our adversaries, but his kinsmen are
					quite different people. Are these kinsmen then bearing witness in favor of the
					claimant under the will rather than themselves contesting the property by right
					of kinship? Surely they are not so insane as to believe so easily in the will
					and renounce their claim to so much money! Nay, to judge from what these men
					themselves say, it is to the advantage of these supposed kinsmen themselves that
					my clients, rather than Chariades, should have the estate of Nicostratus
					adjudicated to them. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="25" type="section">
				<p>For, if my clients, who claim by right of kinship, receive the estate, it will be
					always open to the supposed kinsmen whenever they like at any future date to
					claim the estate on the grounds of relationship, and prove to you that they are
					themselves more nearly related to Nicostratus, and that he was the son of
					Smicrus and not of Thrasymachus. On the other hand, if Chariades inherits the
					estate, it will never be possible for any relative to bring an action for the
					property of Nicostratus; for when once the property is in possession of one to
					whom it has been adjudicated in virtue of a will, what will those who claim by
					right of kinship be able reasonably to allege? </p>
			</div>
			<div n="26" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whatever each of you would consider just on his
					own behalf, let that be your determination in favor of these young men. They
					have produced before you witnesses to prove, first, that they and Nicostratus
					are first cousins, the sons of own brothers; secondly, that they never had any
					quarrel with him; thirdly, that they carried out his burial; and further that
					Chariades was never a friend of Nicostratus either here in <placeName
						key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> or in the army, and, lastly, that
					the supposed business association between them, on which Chariades most relies,
					is a fiction. </p>
			</div>
			<div n="27" type="section">
				<p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apart from this, gentlemen, it is only right that
					you should examine the characters of the respective claimants. Thrasippus, the
					father of Hagnon and Hagnotheus, has before now supported public burdens and
					paid contributions and otherwise proved himself a worthy citizen. My clients
					themselves have never quitted this country unless they have been sent somewhere
					by your orders, and at home they are not unserviceable to the state; they serve
					in the army, they make contributions and in every other respect perform what is
					required of them, and, as everyone knows, they behave as law-abiding citizens;
				</p>
			</div>
			<div n="28" type="section">
				<p>so that it is much more fitting that they should claim to receive the estate by
					gift than Chariades. The latter, when he resided here, was first caught in the
					act of theft and thrown into prison; he was subsequently released with certain
					other criminals by the Eleven,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The
						police-magistrates of <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
						>Athens</placeName>.</note> all of whom you publicly condemned to
						death,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The context seems to imply that
						these magistrates were tried and condemned for allowing prisoners to escape,
						but nothing is known of the circumstance.</note> and, having been again
					denounced to the Council as a malefactor, he absconded and did not appear to
					answer the charge, </p>
			</div>
			<div n="29" type="section">
				<p>and for seventeen years after this he never came near <placeName
						key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and only returned on the death of
					Nicostratus. He has never once served the state as a soldier nor made any
					contribution, except perhaps since he claimed Nicostratus's estate, nor has he
					performed any other public service. And now, though such is his character, so
					far from being content if he avoids punishment for his misdeeds, he actually
					claims the property of others! </p>
			</div>
			<div n="30" type="section">
				<p>If my clients were fond of quarrelling or resembled so many of their
					fellow-citizens, he would not perhaps be claiming Nicostratus's estate but would
					be on trial for his life. But, as it is, gentlemen, it shall be left to someone
					else, if he wishes, to punish him; </p>
			</div>
			<div n="31" type="section">
				<p>your care let it be to assist my clients, and not to show favor to those who wish
					unjustly to possess the property of others rather than to the next-of-kin of the
					deceased, who have besides already rendered him service. Remember the laws and
					the oaths which you swore and also the evidence which we have placed before you,
					and give your verdict in conformity with justice.</p>
