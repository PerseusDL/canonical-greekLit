<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="1"> 
 <p rend="align(indent)">I have never, fellow citizens, brought indictment against any Athenian, nor vexed any man when he was rendering account of his office<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Athenian Constitution provided for rigid auditing of the accounts of all officials at the close of their year of office, and gave full opportunity to any citizen to bring charges against any act of their administration. Such opportunity might easily be used for malicious or blackmailing attack</note>; but in all such matters I have, as I believe, shown myself a quiet and modest man.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A quiet citizen, as distinguished from the professional political blackmailer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκοφάντης</foreign></note> But when I saw that the city was being seriously injured by the defendant, Timarchus, who, though disqualified by law, was speaking in your assemblies,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As the speech proceeds we shall see that Aeschines declares that Timarchus was guilty of immoral practices that disqualified him from speaking before the people.</note> and when I myself was made a victim of his blackmailing attack—the nature of the attack I will show in the course of my speech—</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="2"> 
<p>I decided that it would be a most shameful thing if I failed to come to the defence of the whole city and its laws, and to your defence and my own; and knowing that he was liable to the accusations that you heard read a moment ago by the clerk of the court, I instituted this suit, challenging him to official scrutiny. Thus it appears,fellow citizens, that what is so frequently said of public suits is no mistake, namely, that very often private enmities correct public abuses.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="3"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">You will see, then, that Timarchus cannot blame the city for any part of this prosecution, nor can he blame the laws, nor you, nor me, but only himself. For because of his shameful private life the laws forbade him to speak before the people, laying on him an injunction not difficult, in my opinion, to obey—nay, most easy; and had he been wise, he need not have made his slanderous attack upon me. I hope, therefore, that in this introduction I have spoken as a quiet and modest citizen ought to speak.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="4"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">I am aware, fellow citizens, that the statement which I am about to make first is something that you will undoubtedly have heard from other men on other occasions; but I think the same thought is especially timely on this occasion, and from me. It is acknowledged, namely, that there are in the world three forms of government, autocracy, oligarchy, and democracy: autocracies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of their lords, but democratic states according to established laws.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<p>And be assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the person of the citizen and the constitution of the state, whereas the despot and the oligarch find their protection in suspicion and in armed guards. Men, therefore, who administer an oligarchy, or any government based on inequality, must be on their guard against those who attempt revolution by the law of force; but you, who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only will you be strong, when you cherish the laws, and when the revolutionary attempts of lawless men shall have ceased.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="6"> 
<p>And it behooves us, I think, not only when we are enacting laws, to consider always how the laws that we make may be good and advantageous to the democracy, but when once we have enacted them, it equally behooves us, if all is to be well with the state, to obey the laws that we have enacted, and to punish those who do not obey them.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Consider, fellow citizens, how much attention that ancient lawgiver, Solon, gave to morality, as did Draco and the other lawgivers of those days.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="7"> 
<p>First, you recall, they laid down laws to protect the morals of our children, and they expressly prescribed what were to be the habits of the freeborn boy, and how he was to be brought up; then they legislated for the lads, and next for the other age-groups in succession, including in their provision, not only private citizens, but also the public men. And when they had inscribed these laws, they gave them to you in trust, and made you their guardians.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="8"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now it is my desire, in addressing you on this occasion, to follow in my speech the same order which the lawgiver followed in his laws. For you shall hear first a review of the laws that have been laid down to govern the orderly conduct of your children, then the laws concerning the lads, and next those concerning the other ages in succession, including not only private citizens, but the public men as well. For so, I think, my argument will most easily be followed. And at the same time I wish, fellow citizens, first to describe to you in detail the laws of the state, and then in contrast with the laws to examine the character and habits of Timarchus. For you will find that the life he has lived has been contrary to all the laws.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="9"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">In the first place, consider the case of the teachers. Although the very livelihood of these men, to whom we necessarily entrust our own children, depends on their good character, while the opposite conduct on their part would mean poverty, yet it is plain that the lawgiver distrusts them; for he expressly prescribes, first, at what time of day the free-born boy is to go to the school-room; next, how many other boys may go there with him, and when he is to go home.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="10"> 
<p>He forbids the teacher to open the school-room, or the gymnastic trainer the wrestling school, before sunrise, and he commands them to close the doors before sunset; for he is exceeding suspicious of their being alone with a boy, or in the dark with him. He prescribes what children are to be admitted as, pupils, and their age at admission. He provides for a public official who shall superintend them, and for the oversight of slave-attendants of school-boys. He regulates the festivals of the Muses in the school-rooms, and of Hermes in the wrestling-schools. Finally, he regulates the companionships that the boys may form at school, and their cyclic dances.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Dances by specially trained groups of boys, often competive between tribes, were popular features of many of the Greek festivals. Those dances which were arranged for a circular dancing-ground were called <q rend="double">cyclic</q>.</note></p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="11"> 
<p>He prescribes, namely, that the choregus, a man who is going to spend his own money for your entertainment, shall be a man of more than forty years of age when he performs this service, in order that he may have reached the most temperate time of life before he comes into contact with your children.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">These laws, then, shall be read to you, to prove that the lawgiver believed that it is the boy who has been well brought up that will be a useful citizen when he becomes a man. But when a boy’ s natural disposition is subjected at the very outset to vicious training, the product of such wrong nurture will be, as he believed, a citizen like this man Timarchus. Read these laws to the jury.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="12"> 
<p rend="align(center)"><label>Laws</label></p>
<p rend="align(center)">[The teachers of the boys shall open the school-rooms not earlier than sunrise, and they shall close them before sunset. No person who is older than the boys shall be permitted to enter the room while they are there, unless he be a son of the teacher, a brother, or a daughter’ s husband. If any one enter in violation of this prohibition, he shall be punished with death. The superintendents of the gymnasia shall under no conditions allow any one who has reached the age of manhood to enter the contests of Hermes together with the boys. A gymnasiarch who does permit this and fails to keep such a person out of the gymnasium, shall be liable to the penalties prescribed for the seduction of free-born youth. Every choregus who is appointed by the people shall be more than forty years of age.]</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="13"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now after this, fellow citizens, he lays down laws regarding crimes which, great as they undoubtedly are, do actually occur, I believe, in the city. For the very fact that certain unbecoming things were being done was the reason for the enactment of these laws by the men of old. At any rate the law says explicitly: if any boy is let out for hire as a prostitute, whether it be by father or brother or uncle or guardian, or by any one else who has control of him, prosecution is not to he against the boy himself, but against the man who let him out for hire and the man who hired him; against the one because he let him out for hire, and against the other, it says, because he hired him. And the law has made the penalties for both offenders the same. Moreover the law frees a son, when he has become a man, from all obligation to support or to furnish a home to a father by whom he has been hired out for prostitution; but when the father is dead, the son is to bury him and perform the other customary rites.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="14"> 
<p>See, gentlemen, how admirably this legislation fits the case; so long as the father is alive he is deprived of all the benefits of fatherhood, precisely as he deprived his son of a citizen’ s right to speak;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The son, as one whose person had been prostituted, was debarred from addressing the assembly of the people. cp. <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.3">Aeschin. 1.3</bibl>.</note> but when he is dead, and unconscious of the service that is being rendered him, and when it is the law and religion that receive the honor, then at last the lawgiver commands the son to bury him and perform the other customary rites.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">But what other law has been laid down for the protection of your children? The law against panders. For the lawgiver imposes the heaviest penalties if any person act as pander in the case of a free-born child or a free-born woman.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="15"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And what other law? The law against outrage, which includes all such conduct in one summary statement, wherein it stands expressly written: if any one outrage a child (and surely he who hires, outrages) or a man or woman, or any one, free or slave, or if he commit any unlawful act against any one of these. Here the law provides prosecution for outrage, and it prescribes what bodily penalty he shall suffer, or what fine he shall pay. Read the law.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="16"> 
<p rend="align(center)"><label>Law</label></p>
<p rend="align(center)">[If any Athenian shall outrage a free-born child, the parent or guardian of the child shall demand a specific penalty. If the court condemn the accused to death, he shall be delivered to the constables and be put to death the same day. If he be condemned to pay a fine, and be unable to pay the fine immediately, he must pay within eleven days after the trial, and he shall remain in prison until payment is made. The same action shall hold against those who abuse the persons of slaves.]</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="17"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now perhaps some one, on first hearing this law, may wonder for what possible reason this word <q rend="double">slaves</q> was added in the law against outrage. But if you reflect on the matter, fellow citizens, you will find this to be the best provision of all. For it was not for the slaves that the lawgiver was concerned, but he wished to accustom you to keep a long distance away from the crime of outraging free men, and so he added the prohibition against the outraging even of slaves. In a word, he was convinced that in a democracy that man is unfit for citizenship who outrages any person whatsoever.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="18"> 
<p>And I beg you, fellow citizens, to remember this also, that here the lawgiver is not yet addressing the person of the boy himself, but those who are near him, father, brother, guardian, teachers, and in general those who have control of him. But, as soon as the young man has been registered in the list of citizens, and knows the laws of the state, and is now able to distinguish between right and wrong, the lawgiver no longer addresses another, Timarchus, but now the man himself.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="19"> 
<p>And what does he say? <q rend="double">If any Athenian,</q> he says, <q rend="double">shall have prostituted his person, he shall not be permitted to become one of the nine archons,</q> because, no doubt, that official wears the wreath;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The myrtle wreath was worn as sign of the sacred character of the office, and it protected the person from assault.</note><q rend="double">nor to discharge the office of priest,</q> as being not even clean of body; <q rend="double">nor shall he act as an advocate for the state,</q> he says, <q rend="double">nor shall ever hold any office whatsoever, at home or abroad,whether filled by lot or by election; nor shall he be a herald or an ambassador</q></p> </div>

And if any one contrary to these prohibitions, the lawgiver has provided for criminal process on the charge of prostitution, and has prescribed the heaviest penalties therefor. Read to the jury this law also, that you may know, gentlemen, in the face of what established laws of yours, so good and so moral, Timarchus has had the effrontery to speak before the people—a man whose character is so notorious.</p> </div>

<p>Consider, fellow citizens, the wisdom of this regulation. The lawgiver does not forget, I think, that the older men are at their best in the matter of judgment, but that courage is now beginning to fail them as a result of their experience of the vicissitudes of life. So, wishing to accustom those who are the wisest to speak on public affairs, and to make this obligatory upon them, since he cannot call on each one of them by name, he comprehends them all under the designation of the age-group as a whole, invites them to the platform, and urges them to address the people.

<p rend="align(indent)">Fellow citizens, there is one Misgolas, son of Naucrates, of the deme Collytus, a man otherwise honorable, and beyond reproach save in this, that he is bent on that sort of thing like one possessed, and is accustomed always to have about him singers or cithara-players. I say this, not from any liking for indecent talk, but that you may know what sort of man Misgolas is. Now this Misgolas, perceiving Timarchus’  motive in staying at the house of the physician, paid him a sum of money in advance and caused him to change his lodgings, and got him into his own home; for Timarchus was well developed, young, and lewd, just the person for the thing that Misgolas wanted to do, and Timarchus wanted to have done.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="42"> 
<p>Timarchus did not hesitate, but submitted to it all, though he had income to satisfy all reasonable desires. For his father had left him a very large property, which he has squandered, as I will show in the course of my speech. But he behaved as he did because he was a slave to the most shameful lusts, to gluttony and extravagance at table, to flute-girls and harlots, to dice, and to all those other things no one of which ought to have the mastery over a man who is well-born and free. And this wretch was not ashamed to abandon his father’ s house and live with Misgolas, a man who was not a friend of his father’ s, nor a person of his own age, but a stranger, and older than himself, a man who knew no restraint in such matters, while Timarchus himself was in the bloom of youth.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="43"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Among the many ridiculous things which Timarchus did in those days was one which I wish to relate to you. The occasion was the procession at the City Dionysia. Misgolas, who had taken possession of him, and Phaedrus, son of Callias, of the deme Sphettus, were to march in the procession together. Now Timarchus here had agreed to join them in the procession, but they were busy with their general preparations, and he failed to come back. Misgolas, provoked at the thing, proceeded to make search for him in company with Phaedrus. They got word of him and found him at lunch with some foreigners in a lodging-house. Misgolas and Phaedrus threatened the foreigners and ordered them to follow straight to the lock-up for having corrupted a free youth. The foreigners were so scared that they dropped everything and ran away as fast as they could go.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="44"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The truth of this story is known to everybody who knew Misgolas and Timarchus in those days. Indeed, I am very glad that the suit that I am prosecuting is against a man not unknown to you, and known for no other thing than precisely that practice as to which you are going to render your verdict. For in the case of facts which are not generally known, the accuser is bound, I suppose, to make his proofs explicit; but where the facts are notorious, I think it is no very difficult matter to conduct the prosecution, for one has only to appeal to the recollection of his hearers.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="45"> 
<p>However, although the fact in this case is acknowledged, I remember that we are in court, and so I have drafted an affidavit for Misgolas, true and not indelicate in phrasing, as I flatter myself. For I do not set down the actual name of the thing that Misgolas used to do to him, nor have I written anything else that would legally incriminate a man who has testified to the truth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, Misgolas can testify to the truth of the affidavit without thereby testifying to any criminal act of his own.</note> But I have set down what will be no news for you to hear, and will involve the witness in no danger nor disgrace.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">If therefore Misgolas is willing to come forward here and testify to the truth, he will be doing what is right; but if he prefers to refuse the summons rather than testify to the truth, the whole business will be made clear to you. For if the man who did the thing is going to be ashamed of it and choose to pay a thousand drachmas into the treasury rather than show his face before you,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is evident from this that when a formal summons to testify in court was refused, a definite fine was inflicted.</note> while the man to whom it has been done is to be a speaker in your assembly, then wise indeed was the lawgiver who excluded such disgusting creatures from the platform. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001.perseus-eng2" n="47"> 
<p> But if Misgolas does indeed answer the summons, but resorts to the most shameless course, denial of the truth under oath, as a grateful return to Timarchus, and a demonstration to the rest of them that he well knows how to help cover up such conduct, in the first place he will damage himself, and in the second place he will gain nothing by it. For I have prepared another affidavit for those who know that this man Timarchus left his father’ s house and lived with Misgolas, though it is a difficult thing, no doubt, that I am undertaking. For I have to present as my witnesses, not friends of mine nor enemies of theirs, nor those who are strangers to both of us, but their friends. </p> </div>

<p> But even if they do persuade these men also not to testify—I do not expect they will, at any rate not all of them—one thing at least they will never succeed in accomplishing: they will never hush up the truth, nor blot out Timarchus’  reputation among his fellow citizens—a reputation which he owes to no act of mine, but to his own conduct.

<p> Hegesandrus, being so well supplied with money, resorted to the house of Pittalacus, who gambled with him; there he first saw this man Timarchus; he was pleased with him, lusted after him, and wanted to take him to his own house, thinking, doubtless, that here was a man of his own kidney. So he first had a talk with Pittalacus, asking him to turn Timarchus over to him. Failing to persuade him, he appealed to the man himself. He did not spend many words; the man was instantly persuaded. For when it is a question of the business itself, Timarchus shows an openmindedness and a spirit of accommodation that are truly wonderful; indeed, that is one of the very reasons why he ought to be an object of loathing.</p> </div>

At last they persuaded him to get up from the altar, believing that he was going to receive some measure of justice.

In what excesses of bestiality are we not to imagine them to have indulged when they were drunken and alone! Don’ t you suppose that Hegesandrus, in his desire to wipe out his own notorious practices with Leodamas, which are known to all of you, made extravagant demands on the defendant, hoping to make Timarchus’  conduct so exceedingly bad that his own earlier behavior would seem to have been modest indeed?</p> </div>

What shall we say when a young man leaves his father’ s house and spends his nights in other people’ s houses, a conspicuously handsome young man?

In the second place, look at the case in the light, not of the present moment, but of the time that is past. For the words spoken before today about Timarchus and his practices were spoken because they were true; but what will be said today will be spoken because of the trial,and with intent to deceive you. Give, therefore, the verdict that is demanded by the longer time, and the truth, and your own knowledge.</p> </div>

But when these resources had been wasted and gambled away and eaten up, and this defendant had lost his youthful charm, and, as you would expect, no one would any longer give him anything, while his lewd and depraved nature constantly craved the same indulgences, and with excessive incontinence kept making demand after demand upon him,</p> </div>

Of these, Eupolemus was the first to die, before the estate had been divided; next, Arizelus, the father of Timarchus.

<p> For your sakes pray let him give up such defence as that! But I myself will suggest to you, Timarchus, a different line of defence, which is honorable and fair, and you will adopt it, if you are conscious of having done nothing shameful.

But since we have selected for special mention a few from each of the two classes, on the one side men who have been loved with a chaste love, and on the other men who sin against themselves, now let me ask you this question, and pray answer me: To which class do you assign Timarchus—to those who are loved, or to those who are prostitutes?

If, therefore, this business needs the help of the courts, those who have served as prostitutes by contract, in case they are wronged, have left them, according to the argument of the defendants, recourse to the protection of the laws.

But in the meetings of the assembly and in the courts, you oftentimes lose all hold of the discussion of the matter in hand, and are led away by deceit and trickery; and you admit into your cases at law a custom that is utterly unjust, for you allow the defendants to bring counter accusations against the complainants. </p> </div>

For before Timarchus came to trial, the law and the name of the courts did cause some men to fear; but if the leader in indecency and the most notorious man of all shall once have been brought into court and then come safely off, many will be induced to offend; and it will finally be, not what is said, but the desperate situation, that will arouse your anger. </p> </div>

<p> therefore punish one man, and do not wait till you have a multitude to punish; and be on your guard against their machinations and their advocates. I will name no one of these, lest they make that their excuse for speaking, saying that they would not have come forward had not someone mentioned them by name. But this I will do: I will omit their names, but by describing their habits will make known their persons also. And each man will have only himself to blame if he comes up here and displays his impudence.</p> </div>

<p> three sorts of supporters, namely, are going to come into court to help the defendant: firstly, men who have squandered their patrimony by the extravagance of their daily life; secondly, men who have abused their youth and their own bodies, and now are afraid, not for Timarchus, but for themselves and their own habits, lest they one day be called to account; and still others from the ranks of the licentious, and of those who have freely associated with licentious men; for they would have certain men rely on their aid, and thus be the more ready to indulge in wrong-doing.</p> </div>

<p> therefore you hear the pleas of these men in his support, call to mind their lives, and bid those who have sinned against their own bodies to cease annoying you and to stop speaking before the people; for the law investigates, not men in private station, but those who are in public life. And tell those who have eaten up their patrimony to go to work, and find some new way to get their living. And as for the hunters of such young men as are easily trapped, command them turn their attention to the foreigners and the resident aliens, that they may still indulge their predilection, but without injuring you.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">And now I have fulfilled all my obligation to you: I have explained the laws, I have examined the life of the defendant. Now, therefore, you are judges of my words, and soon I shall be spectator of your acts, for the decision of the case is now left to your judgment. If, therefore, you do what is right and best, we on our part shall, if it be your wish, be able more zealously to call wrongdoers to account.</p> </div>
