<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="1">  
<p rend="align(indent)">I beg you, fellow citizens, to hear me with willing and friendly mind, remembering how great is my peril, and how many the charges against which I have to defend myself; remembering also the arts and devices of my accuser, and the cruelty of the man who, speaking to men who are under oath to give equal hearing to both parties, had the effrontery to urge you not to listen to the voice of the defendant.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="2">  
<p> and it was not anger that made him say it; for no man who is lying is angry with the victim of his calumny, nor do men who are speaking the truth try to prevent the defendant from obtaining a hearing; for the prosecution does not find justification in the minds of the hearers until the defendant has had opportunity to plead for himself and has proved unable to refute the charges that have been preferred.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="3">  
<p> But Demosthenes, I think, is not fond of fair argument, nor is that the sort of preparation he has made. No, it is your anger that he is determined to call forth. And he has accused me of receiving bribes—he who would be the last man to make such suspicion credible! For the man who seeks to arouse the anger of his hearers over bribery must himself refrain from such conduct.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="4">  
<p rend="align(indent)">But, fellow citizens, as I have listened to Demosthenes’ accusation, the effect upon my own mind has been this: never have I been so apprehensive as on this day, nor ever more angry than now, nor so exceedingly rejoiced. I was frightened, and am still disturbed, lest some of you form a mistaken judgment of me, beguiled by those antitheses of his, conceived in deliberate malice. And I was indignant—fairly beside myself at the charge, when he accused me of insolence and drunken violence towards a free woman of <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Demosthenes in his speech (<bibl n="Dem. 19.196" >Dem. 19.196</bibl> ff.) had told in detail the story of the abuse of a well-born Olynthian captive by Aeschines and others at a banquet in <placeName key="tgn,7006667" >Macedonia</placeName>.</note> But I was rejoiced when, as he was dwelling on this charge, you refused to listen to him. This I consider to be the reward that you bestow upon me for a chaste and temperate life.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="5">  
<p> To you I do, indeed, give praise and high esteem for putting your faith in the life of those who are on trial, rather than in the accusations of their enemies; however, I would not myself shrink from defending myself against this charge. For if there is any man among those who are standing outside the bar—and almost the whole city is in the court—or if there is any man of you, the jurors, who is convinced that I have ever perpetrated such an act, not to say towards a free person, but towards any creature, I hold my life as no longer worth the living. And if as my defence proceeds I fail to prove that the accusation is false, and that the man who dared to utter it is an impious slanderer, then, even though it be clear that I am innocent of all the other charges, I declare myself worthy of death.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="6">  
<p rend="align(indent)">But strange indeed did that other argument of his seem to me, and outrageously unjust, when he asked you whether it was possible in one and the same city to sentence Philocrates to death because he would not await trial and so condemned himself, and then to acquit me. But I think that on this very ground I ought most certainly to be cleared for if the man who condemns himself by not awaiting trial is guilty, certainly he who denies the charge and submits his person to the laws and to his fellow citizens is not guilty.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="7">  
<p rend="align(indent)">Now, fellow citizens, as regards the rest of his accusations, if I pass over any point and fail to mention it, I beg of you to question me and let me know what it is that you wish to hear about, and to refrain from forming any judgment in advance, but to listen with impartial goodwill. I do not know where I ought to begin, so inconsistent are his accusations. See whether you think I am being treated in a reasonable way.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="8">  
<p> it is I who am now on trial, and that too for my life; and yet the greater part of his accusation has been directed against Philocrates and Phrynon and the other members of the embassy, against Philip and the peace and the policies of Eubulus; it is only as one among all these that he gives me a place. But when it is a question of solicitude for the interests of the state, one solitary man stands out in all his speech—Demosthenes; all the rest are traitors! For he has unceasingly insulted us and poured out his slanderous lies, not upon me alone, but upon all the rest as well.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="9">  
<p> and after treating a man with such contempt, later, when it suits his whim, he turns about, and as though he were accusing an Alcibiades or a Themistocles, the most famous men among all the Greeks, he proceeds to charge that same man with having destroyed the cities in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, with having lost you the Thracian coast, with having expelled from his kingdom Cersobleptes, a friend and ally of the city.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="10">  
<p> and he undertook to liken me to Dionysius, the tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and vehemently and with loud cries he called upon you to be on your guard against me; and he related the dream of the priestess in <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Neither the comparison with Dionysius nor the story of the dream was retained by Demosthenes when he revised his speech for publication.</note> Then, after all this exaggeration, he begrudged me the credit even for what he had slanderously charged me with accomplishing, and ascribed it all, not to my words, but to the arms of Philip.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="11">  
<p rend="align(indent)">When now a man has shown such trickery and effrontery, it is difficult even to remember every single thing, and in the face of danger it is not easy to answer unexpected slanders. But I will begin with those events which I think will enable me to make my presentation most clear and intelligible to you, and fair; these events are the discussion that took place concerning the peace, and the choice of the ambassadors. In this way I shall best remember his charges and best be able to speak effectively, and you will be best instructed.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="12">  
<p rend="align(indent)">There is one thing, at any rate, which I think you all yourselves remember: how the ambassadors from <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, after they had discussed with our assembly the question of our making peace with them, told us that Philip also had asked them to report to you that he wished to come to terms and be at peace with you. Not long after this, Phrynon of Rhamnus was captured by privateers, during the Olympian truce, according to his own complaint.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >Shortly before the time for the Olympic festival in each quadrennium, heralds were sent out by the Elean state to carry to all Greeks the invitation to the festival and to proclaim a sacred truce between all warring Greek states. Phrynon claimed that Macedonian pirates had violated this truce.</note> Now when he had been ransomed and had come home, he asked you to choose an envoy to go to Philip in his behalf, in order that, if possible, he might recover his ransom money. You were persuaded, and chose <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> as envoy for him.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="13">  
<p> When <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> returned from his mission, he first reported to you on the matters for which he was sent, and then in addition he said that Philip declared that he had gone to war with you against his own will, and that he wished, even now, to be rid of the war. When <placeName key="tgn,6001610" >Ctesiphon</placeName> had said this and had also told of the marked kindness of his reception, the people eagerly accepted his report and passed a vote of praise for <placeName key="tgn,6001610" >Ctesiphon</placeName>. Not a voice was raised in opposition. Then it was, and not till then, that Philocrates of Hagnus offered a motion, which was passed by unanimous vote of the people that Philip be allowed to send to us a herald and ambassadors to treat for peace. For up to this time even that had been prevented by certain men who made it their business to do so, as the event itself proved.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="14">  
<p> for they attacked the motion as unconstitutional,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">On the indictment for proposing an unconstitutional measure, see <bibl n="Aeschin. 3">Aeschin. 3</bibl>, Introduction.</note> subscribing the name of Lycinus to the indictment, in which they proposed a penalty of one hundred talents. When the case came to trial Philocrates was ill, and called as his advocate Demosthenes, not me. And Demosthenes the Philip-hater came to the platform and used up the day in his plea for the defence. Finally Philocrates acquitted, and the prosecutor failed to receive the fifth part of the votes.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A prosecutor who failed to receive one-fifth part of the votes of the jury was subject to a fine of 1,000 drachmas and disability to bring such a suit in the future.</note> This is matter of common knowledge.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="15">  
<p> Now about the same time <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus" >Olynthus</placeName> was taken, and many of our citizens were captured there, among them Iatrocles, brother of Ergochares, and Eueratus, son of Strombichus. Their families naturally made supplication in their behalf, and begged you to provide for them. Their spokesmen before the people were Philocrates and Demosthenes, not Aeschines. So Aristodemus the actor is sent as envoy to Philip, as being an acquaintance of his, and of a profession that naturally wins friends.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="16">  
<p> But when Aristodemus returned from his mission, his report to the senate was delayed by certain business of his, and meanwhile Iatrocles came back from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, released by Philip without ransom. Then many people were angry with Aristodemus for having failed to make his report, for they heard from Iatrocles the same story about Philip.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The same story that the Euboean ambassadors and <placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> had brought, that Philip was ready to discuss peace.</note></p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="17">  
<p> Finally Democrates of <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna" >Aphidna</placeName> went before the senate and persuaded them to summon Aristodemus. One of the senators was Demosthenes, my accuser! Aristodemus appeared before them, reported Philip’s great friendliness toward the city, and added this besides, that Philip even wished to become an ally of our state. This he said not only before the senate, but also at an assembly of the people. Here again Demosthenes spoke no word in opposition, but even moved that a crown be conferred on Aristodemus.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="18">  
<p rend="align(indent)">Next Philocrates moved that ten ambassadors be chosen to go to Philip and discuss with him both the question of peace and the common interests of the Athenians and Philip. At the election of the ten ambassadors I was nominated by Nausicles, but Philocrates himself nominated Demosthenes—Demosthenes, the man who now accuses Philocrates.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="19">  
<p> and so eager was Demosthenes for the business, that in order to make it possible for Aristodemus to be a member of our embassy without financial loss to himself, he moved that we elect envoys to go to the cities in which Aristodemus was under contract to act, and beg in his behalf the cancelling of his forfeitures. To prove the truth of this, take, if you please, the decrees, and read the deposition of Aristodemus, and call the witnesses before whom the deposition was made, in order that the jury may know who was the good friend of Philocrates, and who it was that promised to persuade the people to bestow the rewards on Aristodemus.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="20">
<p rend="align(center)"><label>The Decrees. <space/> The Deposition</label></p>
<p rend="align(indent)">The whole affair, therefore, from the beginning originated not with me, but with Demosthenes and Philocrates. And on the embassy he was eager to belong to our mess—not with my consent, but with that of my companions, Aglaocreon of Tenedos, whom you chose to represent the allies, and Iatrocles. And he asserts that on the journey I urged him to join me in guarding against the beast—meaning Philocrates. But the whole story was a fabrication; for how could I have urged Demosthenes against Philocrates, when I knew that he had been Philocrates’ advocate in the suit against the legality of his motion, and that he had been nominated to the embassy by Philocrates?</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="21">  
<p> Moreover, this was not the sort of conversation in which we were engaged, but all the way we were forced to put up with Demosthenes’ odious and insufferable ways. When we were discussing what should be said, and when Cimon remarked that he was afraid Philip would get the better of us in arguing his claims, Demosthenes promised fountains of oratory, and said that he was going to make such a speech about our claims to <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and the origin of the war that he would sew up Philip’s mouth with an unsoaked rush,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The job would be so easy that he would not have to stop to soak the rush fiber and make it pliable. A proverbial expression.</note> and he would persuade the Athenians to permit Leosthenes to return home,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Leosthenes was an Athenian orator and general, who had been condemned to death in 361 because of the failure of his campaign in the northern waters; he was now in exile in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. The recovery of <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis" >Amphipolis</placeName> would mollify the anger of the Athenians against him</note> and Philip to restore <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="22">  
<p rend="align(indent)">But not to describe at length the overweening self-confidence of this fellow, as soon as we were come to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, we arranged among ourselves that at our audience with Philip the eldest should speak first, and the rest in the order of age. Now it happened that the youngest man of us was, according to his own assertion, Demosthenes. When we were summoned—and pray now give especial attention to this, for here you shall see the exceeding enviousness of the man, and his strange cowardice and meanness too, and such plottings against men who were his own fellow ambassadors and his messmates as one would hardly enter into even against his bitterest enemies. For you remember he says<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Dem. 19.189">Dem. 19.189</bibl> ff.

Demosthenes replied that the table and the salt, even, in the case of the prytanes and other high officials who ate together at a common official table, gave no immunity to the wrongdoer; his fellow-officials were free to bring him to punishment.

<p rend="align(indent)">He began his speech with certain slanderous allusions to his colleagues, to the effect that not all of us had come with the same end in view, nor were we all of one mind; and then he proceeded to review his own previous services to Philip: first, his defence of Philocrates’ motion, when Philocrates, having moved that Philip be permitted to send ambassadors to the Athenians to discuss peace, was defendant on the charge of having made an unconstitutional proposal; secondly, he read the motion of which Demosthenes himself was author, to grant safe conduct to the herald and ambassadors from Philip; and thirdly, the motion that restricted the people’s discussion of peace to appointed days.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="110">  
<p> To the account he added a conclusion like this: that he had been the first to put a curb on those who were trying to block the peace; that he had done this, not by his words, but by fixing the dates. Then he brought up another motion, the one which provided that the people should discuss an alliance also; then, after that, the motion about assigning the front seats at the Dionysia to Philip’s ambassadors.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="111">  
<p> He alluded also to the special attention he had shown them: the placing of cushions, and certain watchings and vigils of the night, caused by men who were jealous of him and wished to bring insult upon his honourable name!

<p rend="align(indent)">But when at last he stopped and there was silence, I was forced to speak—after such an exhibition of ill-breeding and such excess of shameful flattery.

<p> Then after speaking briefly on the subject of the oaths for which we had come, I reviewed the other matters that you had entrusted to us.

I called on Philip to settle matters there, preferably not with arms, but with vote and verdict; but if that should be impossible (it was already evident that it was, for the army was collected and on the spot), I said that he who was on the point of deciding the fate of the holy places of our nation ought to give careful thought to the question of piety, and to give attention to those who undertook to give instruction as to our traditions.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="115">  
<p> At the same time I reviewed from the beginning the story of the founding of the shrine, and of the first synod of the Amphictyons that was ever held; and I read their oaths, in which the men of ancient times swore that they would raze no city of the Amphictyonic states, nor shut them off from flowing water either in war or in peace; that if anyone should violate this oath, they would march against such an one and raze his cities;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The city that has violated its Amphictyonic oath can no longer claim the protection of that oath.</note> and if any one should violate the shrine of the god or be accessory to such violation, or make any plot against the holy places, they would punish him with hand and foot and voice, and all their power.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="116">  
<p> When I had read all this, I solemnly declared that in my opinion it was not right that we should overlook the fact that the cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> were lying in ruins.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See on <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.104">Aeschin. 2.104</bibl>.</note> To prove that they were Amphictyonic cities and thus protected by the oaths, I enumerated twelve tribes which shared the shrine: the Thessalians, Boeotians (not the Thebans only), Dorians, Ionians, Perrhaebi, Magnetes, Dolopians, Locrians, Oetaeans, Phthiotians, Malians, and Phocians. And I showed that each of these tribes has an equal vote, the greatest equal to the least: that the delegate from <placeName key="perseus,Dorion">Dorion</placeName> and Cytinion has equal authority with the Lacedaemonian delegates, for each tribe casts two votes; again, that of the Ionian delegates those from <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Priene">Priene</placeName> have equal authority with those from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and the rest in the same way.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">But not to waste time in reciting to you now precisely what was spoken there, I will content myself with this brief summary of it all.

My words were words of justice, and they were spoken in your interest; the issue was not according to our prayer, but according to Philip’s acts. Who, therefore, is it that deserves your approval?

But, fellow citizens, let me tell you what it is that he is doing. While I was with Philip I demanded—and when I returned to you I reported that I thought it right—that <placeName key="perseus,Thebes" >Thebes</placeName> should be Boeotian, and not <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, Theban.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="120">  
<p> And I told you that Cleochares of <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis" >Chalcis</placeName> said that he was surprised at the sudden agreement between you and Philip, especially when we had been instructed <q rend="double">to negotiate concerning any good thing that should be within our power.</q> For he said the people of the small states, like himself, were afraid of the secret diplomacy of the greater.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="121">  
<p rend="align(indent)">But he falsely declared that when he wished to report the truth, he was hindered by me, together with Philocrates—for he divided the responsibility in that case also. Now I should like to ask you this: Has any ambassador sent out from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> ever been prevented from presenting to the people an official report of his conduct? And if one had suffered such treatment and had been repudiated by his colleagues, would he ever have made a motion that they be given a vote of thanks and invited to dinner? But Demosthenes on his return from the second embassy, in which he says that the cause of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> was ruined, moved the vote of thanks in his decree;</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="122">  
<p> and not only that, but when I had reported to the people what I had said about the Amphictyons and Boeotians, not briefly and rapidly as now, but as nearly word for word as possible, and when the people heartily applauded, I called upon him together with the other ambassadors, and asked them whether my report was true, and identical with what I had said to Philip; and when all my colleagues had testified and praised me, after them all Demosthenes arose and said: No, I had not to-day been speaking as I spoke there, but that I spoke twice as well there. You who are going to give the verdict are my witnesses of this.</p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002.perseus-eng2" n="123">  
<p> and yet what better opportunity could he have had to convict me than to do it then and there, if I was in any wise deceiving the city? You say, Demosthenes, that while I was in a conspiracy against the city in the first embassy, you were not aware of it, but that on the second you found it out—the embassy in which we find you testifying to my services! And while accusing me for my conduct on the first embassy, you at the same time deny that you accuse me, and direct your accusations against the embassy that was sent to take the oaths. And yet if it is the peace you find fault with, it was you who moved to add the alliance to it. And if Philip did at any point deceive the city, his deception had to do with the peace, for he was maneuvering for the precise form of peace that would serve his own advantage.

<p> the third cause of their ruin was mutiny, such as usually attends armies which are poorly supplied with funds. The fourth cause was Phalaecus’ inability to foresee the future.
