<p rend="align(indent)">You see, fellow citizens, how certain persons have been making their preparations for this case: how they have mustered their forces, and how they have gone begging up and down the market place, in the attempt to prevent the fair and orderly course of justice in the state. But I have come trusting first in the gods, then in the laws and in you, believing that with you no scheming preparation can override law and justice.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="2"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">I could wish, indeed, fellow citizens, that the Senate of Five Hundred and the assemblies of the people were properly conducted by those who preside over them, and the laws enforced which Solon enacted to secure orderly conduct on the part of public speakers; for then it would be permitted to the oldest citizen, as the law prescribes, to come forward to the platform first, with dignity, and, uninterrupted by shouting and tumult, out of his experience to advise for the good of the state and it would then be permitted to all other citizens who wished, one by one in turn, in order of age, to express their opinion on every question; for so, I think, the state would be best governed, and least litigation would arise.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="3"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But now all our standards of orderly procedure have been set aside; there are men who do not hesitate to make illegal motions, and other men who are ready to put these motions to the vote—not men who have been chosen by right and lawful allotment to preside, but men who hold the position by trickery; and if any other senator does actually obtain the presidency by lot, and does honestly declare your votes, he is threatened with impeachment by men who no longer regard citizenship as a common right, but as their own private perquisite; men who are making slaves of the common people, and arrogating lordship to themselves;</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="4"> 
<p>men who have set aside the lawful processes of the courts, and carry their verdicts in the assembly by appeal to passion.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The popular leaders, confident in their ability to carry the popular assembly by appeal to the passions of the masses, bring cases there in the form of impeachments, etc., which ought to go to the courts, to be decided under the laws.</note> The result of all this is that we have ceased to hear that wisest and most judicious of all the proclamations to which the city was once accustomed, <q rend="double">Who of the men above fifty years of age wishes to address the people,</q> and then who of the other Athenians in turn. The disorder of the public men can no longer be controlled by the laws, nor by the prytanes, nor by the presiding officers, nor by the presiding tribe, the tenth part of the city.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Aeschin. 1.33">Aeschin. 1.33</bibl> and note.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Under such circumstances, and in a political situation the gravity of which you yourselves understand, only one part of the constitution is left to us—if I too may lay claim to some discernment—the suits against illegal motions. But if you shall annul these also, or give way to those who are trying to annul them, I warn you that before you know it you will step by step have surrendered your rights to a faction.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="6"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">There are, as you know, fellow-citizens, three forms of government in the world tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. Tyrannies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of their lords, but democratic states according to their own established laws. Let no man among you forget this, but let each bear distinctly in mind that when he enters a court-room to sit as juror in a suit against an illegal motion, on that day he is to cast his vote for or against his own freedom of speech. This is why the lawgiver placed first in the jurors’ oath these words, <q rend="double">I will vote according to the laws.</q> For he well knew that if the laws are faithfully upheld for the state, the democracy also is preserved.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="7"> 
<p>This you ought always to remember, and to hate those who make illegal motions, and to hold no such offence as trivial, but every one as serious indeed. And you ought to let no man rob you of this right of yours, whether through the intercession of the generals, who by their cooperation with certain public men have this long time been outraging the constitution, or through petitions of foreigners, whom some bring in here, and so escape the courts, when their whole political career has been in defiance of the laws. But as each man of you would be ashamed to desert the post to which he had been assigned in war, so now you should be ashamed to desert the post to which the laws have called you, sentinels, guarding the democracy this day.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="8"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">And another thing you have to remember: today your fellow citizens as a body have put the city and the constitution into your hands as a solemn trust. Some of them are present, listening to this case; others are absent, busy with their personal affairs. Respect them therefore, and remember the oaths which you have sworn, and the laws; and if I convict Ctesiphon of having made a motion that is illegal, false, and injurious to the state, annul the illegal motion, fellow citizens; confirm the democratic government for our state; punish those whose policies are opposed to the laws and to your interests. If in this spirit you listen to the words which are about to be spoken, I am sure that your verdict will be just, faithful to your oath, and salutary alike to yourselves and to the commonwealth.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="9"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">I hope now that what I have said is a sufficient introduction to my complaint as a whole but I wish to speak briefly about the laws themselves which govern the rendering of account by public officers, the laws which are in fact violated by Ctesiphon’s resolution.</p>
      <p rend="align(indent)">In former times certain men who held the highest offices and administered the revenues—yes, and betrayed their every trust for money—would attach to themselves the public speakers of the senate-house and the assembly, and thus anticipate their day of accounting long in advance, with votes of thanks and with proclamations. The result was that when the time came for them to render their account, those who had charges to prefer fell into very great embarrassment, and this was even more the case with the jurors.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="10"> 
<p>For great numbers of those who were subject to audit, though they were caught in the very act of stealing the public funds, went out from the court-room acquitted. And no wonder! For the jurors were ashamed, I imagine, to see the same man in the same city one day proclaimed at the festival as crowned by the people with a golden crown because of his virtue and justice, and then a little later to see the same man come out of the auditors’ court convicted of theft. And so the jurors were forced to render,</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="11"> 
<p>not the verdict that fitted the actual crime, but one that would avert the shame of the people.</p>
      <p rend="align(indent)">Now some statesman who had observed this situation caused a law to be passed—and a most excellent law it is—which expressly forbids crowning men before they have passed their final accounting. And yet in spite of this wise provision of the framer of the law, forms of statement have been invented which circumvent the laws; and unless you are warned of them you will be taken unawares and deceived. For among those men who contrary to the laws crown officers who have not yet submitted their accounts, some, who at heart are orderly citizens—if any one is really orderly who proposes illegal measures—at any rate some do make an attempt to cloak their shame; for they add to their decrees the proviso that the man who is subject to audit shall be crowned <q rend="double">after he shall have rendered account and submitted to audit of his office.</q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="12"> 
<p>The injury to the state is indeed no less, for the hearings for accounting are prejudiced by previous votes of thanks and crowns; but the man who makes the motion does show to the bearers that while he has made an illegal motion, he is ashamed of the wrong thing that he has done. But Ctesiphon, fellow citizens, overleaping the law that governs those who are subject to audit, and not deigning to resort to the pretext of which I have just spoken, has moved that before the accounting, before the auditing, you crown Demosthenes—in the midst of his term of office.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="13"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But, fellow citizens, in opposition to the statement of the case which I have just presented, they will urge a different argument; for they will say, forsooth, that whatever a man is called on to do under special enactment, this is not an <q rend="double">office,</q> but a sort of <q rend="double">commission</q> and <q rend="double">public service</q> and they will say that <q rend="double">offices</q> are those to which the Thesmothetae appoint men by lot in the Theseum, and those which are filled by popular election (the offices of general, cavalry commander, and associated offices); but that all others are <q rend="double">employment under special enactment.</q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="14"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Well, to their arguments I will oppose your law, a law which you yourselves passed in the expectation of silencing such pretexts; for it expressly says <q rend="double">the elective offices,</q> including all in a single phrase, calling everything which is filled by popular election an <q rend="double">office,</q> and specifying <q rend="double">the superintendents of public works.</q> But Demosthenes is in charge of the construction of walls, superintendent of the greatest of the works; <q rend="double">and all who have charge of any business of the state for more than thirty days, and all to whom is given the presidency of a court</q>; but every superintendent of public works holds the presidency of a court.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It was a principle of the Athenian legal system that litigation arising within the sphere of any executive department should come before a court presided over by the head of that department.</note></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="15"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">What is it that the law commands these men to do? Not to <q rend="double">serve,</q> but <q rend="double">after approval by the court<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">All incoming officials were required to pass a formal <q rend="double">scrutiny</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</foreign>) before entering upon office. In the case of most officials this was conducted before a court. Aeschines mentions this preliminary scrutiny here because it would naturally follow that any person who had to pass the official scrutiny before entering on his work would have to pass the official accounting on laying it down.</note> to hold office</q> (for even the officers who are selected by lot are not exempt from the scrutiny, but hold their office only after approval); <q rend="double">and to submit their accounts before the clerk and board of auditors,</q> precisely as other officers are required to do. As proof of the truth of my statement, the laws themselves shall be read to you.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="16"> 
<p rend="align(center)"><label>The Laws</label></p> 
<p rend="align(indent)">When, therefore, fellow citizens, what the lawgiver names <q rend="double">offices,</q> they call <q rend="double">employments</q> and <q rend="double">commissions,</q> it is your duty to remember the law, and to set it against their shamelessness, and to remind them that you refuse to accept a rascally sophist, who expects to destroy the laws with phrases; but that when a man has made an illegal motion, the more cleverly he talks, the more angry will he find you. For by right, fellow citizens, the orator and the law ought to speak the same language; but when the law utters one voice and the orator another, you ought to give your vote to the just demand of the law, not to the shamelessness of the speaker.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="17"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But now to <q rend="double">the irrefutable argument,</q> as Demosthenes calls it, I wish to reply briefly in advance. For he will say, <q rend="double">I am in charge of the construction of walls; I admit it; but I have made a present of a hundred minas to the state, and I have carried out the work on a larger scale than was prescribed; what then is it that you want to audit? unless a man’s patriotism is to be audited!</q> Now to this pretext hear my answer, true to the facts and beneficial to you.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">In this city, so ancient and so great, no man is free from the audit who has held any public trust.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="18"> 
<p>I will first cite cases where this would be least expected. For example, the law directs that priests and priestesses be subject to audit, all collectively, and each severally and individually—persons who receive perquisites only, and whose occupation is to pray to heaven for you; and they are made accountable not only separately, but whole priestly, families together, the Eumolpidae, the Ceryces, and all the rest.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="19"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Again, the law directs that the trierarchs be subject to audit, though they have had no public funds in their hands, and though they are not men who filch large sums from your treasury and pay out small ones, and not men who claim to be making donations when they are only paying back what is your own, but men who are acknowledged by all to have spent their family fortunes in their ambition to serve you.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">Furthermore, not the trierarchs alone, but also the highest bodies in the state, come under the verdict of the courts of audit.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="20"> 
<p>For, first, the Senate of the Areopagus is required by the law to file its accounts with the Board of Auditors and to submit to their examination; yes, even those men, who sit with solemn aspect yonder as the court of highest competence, are brought under your verdict. Shall the Senate of the Areopagus, then, receive no crown? They shall not, for such is not the tradition of our fathers. Have they, then, no love of honor? Indeed they have! They so love honor that they are not satisfied with merely keeping free from guilt, but they punish their members even for mistakes. But your politicians are pampered. Further, the lawgiver has made the Senate of Five Hundred subject to audit.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="21"> 
<p>And so deep is his distrust of those who are subject to audit, that he says at the very beginning of the laws, <q rend="double">The officer who has not yet submitted his accounts shall not leave the country?</q> <q rend="double">Heracles !</q> some one may answer, <q rend="double">because I held an office may I not leave the country?</q> No, for fear you may make profit of the public money or the public acts, and then run away. Furthermore, the man who is subject to audit is not allowed to consecrate his property, or to make a votive offering, or to receive adoption,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An official who caused himself to be adopted into some family poorer than his own might thus diminish the security which the state would hold in case of his misconduct in office.</note> or to dispose of his property by will and he is under many other prohibitions. In a word, the lawgiver holds under attachment the property of all who are subject to audit, until their accounts shall have been audited.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="22"> 
<p><q rend="double">Yes, but there is a man who has received no public funds and spent none, but has simply had something to do with administrative matters.</q> He too is commanded to render account to the auditors. <q rend="double">And how shall the man who has received nothing and spent nothing render account to the state?</q> The law itself suggests and teaches what he is to write; for it commands him to file precisely this statement, <q rend="double">I have neither received nor spent any public funds.</q> There is nothing in all the state that is exempt from audit, investigation, and examination. As proof of what I say, hear the laws themselves.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="23">

<p rend="align(indent)">They will not be able to deny that the laws forbid the man who is crowned by the people to be proclaimed outside the assembly, but they will present for their defence the Dionysiac law, and will use a certain portion of the law, cheating your ears.</p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="38"> 
<p>But that is not the case. May you never reach the point where your laws are in such disorder as that! Nor was the lawgiver who established the democracy guilty of such neglect; he has expressly laid upon the Thesmothetae<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Thesmothetae were the six lower archons. They had general supervision of all the courts, and particular control of numerous specified cases.</note> the duty of making an annual revision of the laws in the presence of the people, prescribing sharp investigation and examination, in order to determine whether any law stands written which contradicts another law, or an invalid law stands among the valid, or whether more laws than one stand written to govern each action.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">If now, fellow citizens, what they assert were true, and two laws had been in force governing proclamations, I think the Thesmothetae would necessarily have searched them out, and the prytanes would have referred them to the Nomothetae, and one or the other of the two laws would have been repealed, either the law that gave authority for the proclamation, or the law that forbade it. But seeing that no such thing has been done, surely what they say is demonstrated to be, not only false, but absolutely impossible.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="41"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But I will show you where they get this false assertion. First, however, I will tell the reason why the laws governing the proclamations in the theater were enacted. It frequently happened that at the performance of the tragedies in the city proclamations were made without authorization of the people, now that this or that man was crowned by his tribe, now that others were crowned by the men of their deme, while other men by the voice of the herald manumitted their household slaves, and made all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> their witness;</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="42"> 
<p>and, most invidious of all, certain men who had secured positions as agents of foreign states managed to have proclaimed that they were crowned—it might be by the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011266" >Rhodes</placeName>, or of <placeName key="tgn,7002670" >Chios</placeName>, or of some other state—in recognition of their merit and uprightness. And this they did, not like those who were crowned by your senate or by the people, by first obtaining your consent and by your decree, and after establishing large claims upon your gratitude, but themselves reaching out after the honor with no authorization from you.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="43"> 
<p>The result of this practice was that the spectators, the choregi, and the actors alike were discommoded, and that those who were crowned in the theater received greater honors than those whom the people crowned. For the latter had a place prescribed where they must receive their crown, the assembly of the people, and proclamation <q rend="double">anywhere else</q> was forbidden; but the others were proclaimed in the presence of all the Hellenes; the one class with your consent, by your decree; the other, without decree.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="44"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">Now some legislator, seeing this, caused a law to be enacted which has nothing to do with the law concerning those who are crowned by our people, and did not supersede it. For it was not the assembly that was being disturbed, but the theater; and he was not enacting a law contradictory to the previously existing laws, for that may not be done; but a law governing those who, without your decree, are crowned by their tribe or deme, and governing the freeing of slaves, and also the foreign crowns. He expressly forbids the manumission of a slave in the theater, or the proclamation of a crown by the tribe or deme, <q rend="double">or by any one else,</q> he says, <q rend="double">and the herald who disobeys shall lose his civic rights.</q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="45"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">When, therefore, the lawgiver designates, for those who are crowned by the senate, the senate-house as the place of proclamation, and, for those who are crowned by the people, the assembly, and when he forbids those who are crowned by the demes or tribes to be proclaimed at the tragedies—that no one may try to get spurious honor by begging crowns and proclamations, and when in the law he further forbids proclamation being made by any one else, senate, people, tribe, and deme being thus eliminated—when one takes these away, what is it that is left except the foreign crowns?</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="46"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">For the truth of my assertion I will show you a strong argument derived from the laws themselves. For the golden crown itself which is proclaimed in the city theater the law takes from the man who is crowned, and commands that it be dedicated to Athena. And yet who among you would dare to charge the Athenian people with such illiberality? For certainly no state, nay, not even a private person—not one—would be so mean as to proclaim a crown and at the same moment demand back the gift which he himself had made. But I think it is because the crown is the gift of foreigners that the dedication is made, lest any one set a higher value upon the gratitude of a foreign state than upon that of his own country, and so become corrupted.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="47"> 
<p>But the other crown, the crown that is proclaimed in the assembly, no one dedicates, but he is permitted to keep it, that not only he, but also his descendants, having the memorial in their house, may never become disloyal to the democracy. And the reason why the lawgiver also forbade the proclamation of the foreign crown in the theater <q rend="double">unless the people vote,</q> is this: he would have the state that wishes to crown any one of your citizens send ambassadors and ask permission of the people, for so he who is proclaimed will be more grateful to you for permitting the proclamation than to those who confer the crown. But to show that my statements are true, hear the laws themselves.</p> </div>

 <p rend="align(center)"><label>Laws</label></p>
<p rend="align(indent)">When, therefore, they try to deceive you, and say that it is added in the law that the bestowal of the crown is permitted <q rend="double">if the people vote,</q> do not forget to suggest to them, Yes, if it is another state that is crowning you; but if it is the Athenian people, a place is designated for you where the ceremony must be performed; it is forbidden you to be crowned outside the assembly. For you may spend the whole day in explaining the meaning of the words <q rend="double">and nowhere else</q>; you will never show that his motion is lawful.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="49"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">But that part of my accusation remains upon which I lay greatest stress: the pretext upon which he claims that the crown is deserved. It reads thus in his motion : <q rend="double">And the herald shall proclaim in the theater in the presence of the Hellenes that the Athenian people crown him for his merit and uprightness,</q> and that monstrous assertion, <q rend="double">because he continually speaks and does what is best for the people.</q></p> </div>

<p>You see how entirely simple the remainder of our argument becomes, and how easy for you, my hearers, to weigh.

But the defence must show the opposite of this. And you are to be the judges of our pleas.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="51"> 
<p rend="align(indent)">The case is this: To review the private life of Demosthenes would, in my opinion, demand too long a speech. And why need I tell it all now? the story of what happened to him in the matter of the suit over the wound, when he summoned his own cousin, Demomeles of Paeania, before the Areopagus;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Aeschin. 2.93">Aeschin. 2.93</bibl>.</note> and the cut on his head; or the story of the generalship of Cephisodotus, and the naval expedition to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>,</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="52"> 
<p>when Demosthenes as one of the trierarchs carried the general on his ship, and shared his table, his sacrifices, and his libations and how after he had been thus honored because the general was an old friend of his father’s, he did not hesitate, when the general was impeached, and was on trial for his life, to become one of his accusers; or, again, that story about Meidias and the blow of the fist that Demosthenes got when he was choregus, in the orchestra, and how for thirty minas he sold both the insult to himself and the vote of censure that the people had passed against Meidias in the theater of Dionysus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Meidias was a rich and domineering man,who had conceived a bitter hatred for Demosthenes in the course of the suites against Demosthenes’ guardians. When Demosthenes was serving as choregus, Meidias, meeting him in the orchestra, in the presence of the spectators, struck him in the face. The people, at a meeting held in the theater at the close of the festival, passed a vote of censure against Meidias, and Demosthenes instituted a suit in the courts; but finally, probably for worthy political reasons, he compromised the case.</note></p> </div>

<p>Now these incidents and all the others like them I think it is best to pass over; not that I would betray you, gentlemen of the jury, or politely yield this case to him, but because I fear that I shall encounter in you the feeling that, while all this is true, it is an old story, admitted by everybody. And yet, Ctesiphon, when a man’s utter shame is so credible to the hearers and so notorious that his accuser seems, not to be speaking what is false, but what is stale, and what everybody admits at the outset, ought that man to be crowned with a golden crown, or ought he to be censured? And you, who had the effrontery to make your false and unlawful motion, ought you to despise the courts, or ought you to give satisfaction to the city?</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">But concerning the crimes of his public life I will try to speak more explicitly. For I understand that when the defence are given opportunity to speak, Demosthenes will enumerate to you four periods in the history of the city as the periods of his own political activity.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In fact, Demosthenes made no such division.</note> One of them, and the first, as I hear, he reckons as the time of our war with Philip over <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>. He marks this off by the peace and alliance that were made on motion of Philocrates of Hagnus, and with the cooperation of Demosthenes himself, as I shall show.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="55"> 
<p>And he says that the second period was the time while we kept the peace, doubtless up to that day on which this same orator put an end to the existing peace, by himself introducing the motion for war; and the third period, the period of war, up to the events of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>; and the fourth, the present period. When he has enumerated these, he intends, as I hear, to call me forward and ask me to tell him for which of these four periods I accuse him, and when it is that I say that his policy has not been for the best interests of the people. And if I refuse to answer, and cover my face and run away, he says he will come and uncover me and lead me to the platform, and force me to answer.</p> </div>

<p>by adding in their resolution that any Greek state that wished should be permitted within the space of three months to have its name inscribed with the Athenians on the same stone, and to share the oaths and agreements. In this way they were taking two precautions, and those of the greatest importance; for first, they provided the period of three months, a sufficient time for the ambassadors of the Greek states to arrive; and secondly, they sought to secure to the city the good-will of the Greeks, by the provision for a general congress, in order that in case the agreements should be violated, we might not enter upon the war unprepared and alone—the misfortune that actually came upon us, thanks to Demosthenes.

<p rend="align(indent)">I acknowledge that I supported this resolution, as did all who spoke in the first of the two assemblies; and the people left the assembly with substantially this supposition, that peace would be made (that, however, it was better not to discuss an alliance, because of our summons to the Greeks), and that the peace would be shared by all the Greeks. Night intervened. We came the next day to the assembly. Then it was that Demosthenes, hastening to get possession of the platform, and leaving no other man an opportunity to speak, said that the propositions of yesterday were utterly useless unless Philip’s ambassadors could be persuaded to assent to them. He further said that he could not conceive of peace without alliance.</p> </div>

And finally he called Antipater<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">One of Philip’s ambassadors.</note> to the platform, and proceeded to ask him a certain question—he had previously told him what he gas going to ask, and had instructed him what he was to answer, to the injury of the state.

<p>One thing remained now for them to do—to betray Cersobleptes and the Thracian coast.

<p rend="align(indent)">But this was only the beginning of outrage—this actual selling of such opportunities and accessions to the league and contributions of money for that which I am about to relate was far worse, as you shall see. For Callias was led on to such a pitch of insolence and arrogance, and Demosthenes—whom Ctesiphon praises—to such a pitch of rapacity for bribes, that, while you still had life and sight and senses, they succeeded in stealing away from you the contributions of Oreus and <placeName key="perseus,Eretria" >Eretria</placeName>, ten talents in all, and they detached from you the delegates from those cities, and carried them back to <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, uniting them in the so-called Euboean Congress.

<p rend="align(indent)">Callias, depending no longer on messengers, came himself to you,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In the spring of 340 b.c.</note> and coming forward in your assembly repeated a speech that Demosthenes had prepared for him. He said that he had just come from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076" >Peloponnesus</placeName>, and that he had made arrangements for contributions which would yield a revenue of not less than one hundred talents for use against Philip; and he counted off what each state was to pay: the united Achaeans and the Megarians sixty talents, and the united cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, forty.</p> </div>

<p>From this fund he said we could be sure of forces by land and sea, adding that there were many other Greeks who wished to share in contributing, so that there would be no lack of money or men.

The sum of what he said was that all <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> could be counted on, and that he had brought all the Acarnanians into line against Philip; that the contributions of money were sufficient to provide for the manning of one hundred swift ships, and to employ ten thousand foot soldiers and a thousand cavalry;</p> </div>

<p>other deceivers, when they are lying, try to speak in vague and ambiguous terms, afraid of being convicted; but Demosthenes, when he is cheating you, first adds an oath to his lie, calling down destruction on himself; and secondly, predicting an event that he knows will never happen, he dares to tell the date of it; and he tells the names of men, when he has never so much as seen their faces, deceiving your ears and imitating men who tell the truth.

<p rend="align(indent)">But now when he had said this, he gave the clerk a resolution to read, longer than the Iliad, but more empty than the speeches that he is accustomed to deliver and the life that he has lived. Empty did I say? Nay, full of hopes that were not to be realized and of armies that were never to be assembled. And leading you off out of sight of his fraud, and suspending you on hopes, at last he gathers all up in a motion that you choose ambassadors to go to <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> and beg the Eretrians—of course it was necessary to beg!—no longer to pay their contribution of five talents to you,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true" >The contribution that they had formerly paid as members of the maritime league but it was now some years since they had thus contributed.</note> but to Callias; and further, that you choose other ambassadors to go to Oreus to beg the people of that city to make common cause with the Athenians.</p> </div>

<p>Here again, in this resolution, you see how entirely absorbed he is in his thievery, for he also moves that your ambassadors ask the people of Oreus to give their five talents, not to you, but to Callias.

<p rend="align(indent)">It remains for me to say that Demosthenes was paid three talents for making this motion: a talent from <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, paid over by Callias, a talent from <placeName key="perseus,Eretria" >Eretria</placeName>, paid by the tyrant Cleitarchus, and a talent from Oreus. And it was this last by means of which he was found out; for the government of Oreus is a democracy, and everything is done there by popular vote. Now they, exhausted by the war and entirely without means, sent to him Gnosidemus, son of Charigenes, a man who had once been powerful in Oreus, to ask him to release the city from paying the talent, and to offer him a statue of bronze to be set up in Oreus.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="104"> 
<p>But he replied to Gnosidemus that the last thing that he was in need of was bronze, and he tried to collect the talent through Callias. Now the people of Oreus, pressed for payment and without means, mortgaged to him the public revenues as security for the talent, and paid Demosthenes interest on the fruit of his bribery at the rate of a drachma per month on the mina,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Twelve per cent a year, an ordinary rate of interest.</note> until they paid off the principal.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">Now when we had reported this decree to our senate, and then to the assembly, and when the people had approved our acts, and the whole city was ready to choose the righteous course, and when Demosthenes had spoken in opposition—he was earning his retaining-fee from Amphissa—and when I had clearly convicted him in your presence, thereupon the fellow, unable to frustrate the city by open means, goes into the senate chamber, expels all listeners, and from the secret session brings out a bill to the assembly, taking advantage of the inexperience of the man who made the motion.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Aeschines implies that Demosthenes drafted the motion in a form which gave it a very different effect from what was expected by the inexperienced senator through whom he had it presented to the senate.</note></p> </div>

<p>And he managed to have this same bill put to vote in the assembly and passed by the people, at the moment when the assembly was on the point of adjourning, when I had already left the place—for I would never have allowed it—and when most of the people had dispersed. Now the substance of the bill was this: <q rend="double">The hieromnemon of the Athenians,</q> it says, <q rend="double">and the pylagori who are at the time in office, shall go to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> at the times appointed by our fathers</q>; fine in sound, shameful in fact; for it prevents attendance on the special meeting at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, which had to be held before the date of the regular meeting.</p> </div>

But when the Amphissians failed to pay the money to the god, and had restored the guilty men, and banished those righteous men who had been restored by the Amphictyons, under these circumstances at last the second campaign was made, a long time afterward, when Philip had now returned from his Scythian expedition.

<p>What brought you into <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was the crisis and fear and need of alliance, not Demosthenes.</p>
<p rend="align(indent)">For in this whole affair Demosthenes is responsible to you for three most serious mistakes. The first was this: when Philip was nominally making war against you, but really was far more the enemy of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, as the event itself has proved (why need I say more?), Demosthenes concealed these facts, which were so important, and pretending that the alliance was to be brought about, not through the crisis, but through his own negotiations,</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="142"> 
<p>first he persuaded the people to give up all consideration of the terms of the alliance, and to count themselves fortunate if only it were made; and when he had gained this point he betrayed all <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> to the Thebans by writing in the decree, <q rend="double">If any city refuse to follow <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the Athenians shall aid the Boeotians in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes" >Thebes</placeName>,</q><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The traditional policy of <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> had been to support the smaller Boeotian cities in their refusal to recognize Theban dominion over them.</note> cheating with words and altering the facts, as he is wont to do; as though, forsooth, when the Boeotians should be suffering in fact, they would be content with Demosthenes’ fine phrases, rather than indignant at the outrageous way in which they had been treated;</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="143"> 
<p>and, secondly, he laid two thirds of the costs of the war upon you, whose danger was more remote, and only one third on the Thebans (in all this acting for bribes); and the leadership by sea he caused to be shared equally by both; but all the expenditure he laid upon you and the leadership by land, if we are not to talk nonsense, he carried away bodily and handed it over to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes" >Thebes</placeName>.

<p>And it is not true that in this I alone accuse, while others are silent; nay, I speak, all men blame him, you know the facts—and are not angry! For this is your experience as regards Demosthenes: you have so long been accustomed to hear of his crimes that they no longer surprise you. But it ought not so to be; you ought to be indignant, and to punish him, if the city is to prosper in the future.</p> </div>

<p rend="align(indent)">But he was guilty of a second and far greater crime; for he stole the senate-house of the city and the democracy outright and carried them off to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, to the Cadmeia, by his agreement with the Boeotarchs for joint control. And he contrived such domination for himself that now he came forward to the platform and declared that he was going as ambassador wherever he chose, whether you sent him or not;</p> </div>

And by drawing pay for empty places in the mercenary force,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The charge is that Demosthenes was in a conspiracy to pad the rolls.</note> by stealing the pay of the troops, and by hiring out those ten thousand mercenaries to the Amphissians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The administration, by detaching this large body of mercenaries and sending them to the immediate aid of the Amphissians, gave Philip the opportunity to sweep them away before meeting the army of the Athenians and Thebans at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.</note> against my repeated protests and complaints in the assembly—when the mercenaries had thus been carried off, he rushed the city all unprepared into the mist of peril.</p> </div>

And Demosthenes, who is responsible for such misfortunes as that, is not content with escaping punishment, but is miserable unless he shall he crowned with a golden crown! Nor is he satisfied that the crown shall be announced in your presence, but if it is not to he proclaimed before the Hellenes, he is miserable over that.

<p rend="align(indent)">But the third and greatest of the crimes that I have mentioned is that which I am about to describe.

The officials at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> also were frightened at the impending danger—naturally, for they had no run-away orator and deserter to advise them, but the ten years’ Phocian war had taught them a lesson not to be forgotten.</p> </div>

<p>(whose statue, it seems, Pheidias wrought expressly that Demosthenes might have it to perjure himself by and to make profit of) that if any one should say that we ought to make peace with Philip, he would seize him by the hair and drag him to prison—in this imitating the politics of Cleophon, who, they tell us, in the time of the war against the Lacedaemonians, brought ruin to the state.

<p>Thirdly, he ought to be temperate and self-restrained in his daily life, lest to support his wanton extravagance he take bribes against the people. Fourthly, he ought to be a man of good judgment and an able speaker; for it is well that his discernment choose the wisest course, and his training in rhetoric and his eloquence persuade the hearers; but if he cannot have both, good judgment is always to be preferred to eloquence of speech. Fifthly, he ought to be a man of brave heart, that in danger and peril he may not desert the people. But the oligarch we should expect to have all the opposite qualities; why need I go over them again? Examine, then, and see what one of these qualities belongs to Demosthenes.

She it was who bore your busy-body and informer.

And though he made enormous profits out of politics, he laid up next to nothing. It is true that just now the Persian’s gold has floated his extravagance, but even that will not suffice, for no wealth ever yet kept up with a debauched character.

But since he admits it himself in the assembly, and you are perfectly aware of it, it remains only to remind you of the laws as to this matter. For Solon, the ancient lawgiver, thought it necessary to apply the same penalties to the coward as to the man who failed to take the field or the man who deserted his post. For there are such things as indictments for cowardice. Some of you may indeed be surprised to know that there are indictments for inborn defects. There are. To what end?

<p rend="align(indent)">If any one should ask you whether our city seems to you more glorious in our own time or in the time of our fathers, you would all agree, in the time of our fathers. And were there better men then than now? Then, eminent men; but now, far inferior. But rewards and crowns and proclamations, and maintenance in the Prytaneum—were these things more common then than now? Then, honors were rare among us, and the name of virtue was itself an honor. But now the custom is already completely faded out, and you do the crowning as a matter of habit, not deliberately.</p> </div>

<p>Are you not therefore surprised, when you look at it in this light, that the rewards are now more numerous, but the city was then more prosperous? And that the men are now inferior, but were better then? I will try to explain this to you. Do you think, fellow citizens, that any man would ever have been willing to train for the pancratium or any other of the harder contests in the Olympic games, or any of the other games that confer a crown, if the crown were given, not to the best man, but to the man who had successfully intrigued for it?

Imagine, therefore, that you yourselves are the officials presiding over a contest in political virtue, and consider this, that if you give the prizes to few men and worthy, and in obedience to the laws, you will find many men to compete in virtue’s struggle; but if your gifts are compliments to any man who seeks them and to those who intrigue for them, you will corrupt even honest minds.</p> </div>

Was the democracy, then, ungrateful? No, but noble-minded, and those men were worthy of their city. For they thought that their honor should be conferred, not in written words, but in the memory of those whom they had served; and from that time until this day it abides, immortal.

<p>And in those days, so my father said, they gave no such hearing as is given now, but the jurors were far more severe toward the authors of illegal motions than was the accuser himself; and it frequently happened that they made the clerk stop, and told him to read to them the laws and the motion a second time; and they convicted a man of making an illegal motion, not in case he had overleaped all the laws together, but if one syllable only was contravened. But the process as it is conducted nowadays is ridiculous. The clerk reads the statement of the illegality which is charged, and the jurors, as though hearing an incantation, or some matter which is no concern of theirs, are attending to something else.</p> </div>

For indictments for illegal motions were in those times brought, not only by political rivals against one another, but by friend against friend, if one was responsible for any error toward the state.

Why need you call Demosthenes to your support? When you overleap the just defence and call forward a rascal and a rhetorician, you cheat the ears of the jury, you injure the city, you undermine the democracy.</p> </div>

      <p rend="align(indent)">How you may avert speeches of that sort, fellow citizens, I will tell you.

If he pretends that he does not hear you, then do you refuse to hear him.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003.perseus-eng2" n="202"> 
<p>But if he shall overleap the just defence and call Demosthenes to the platform, the best course for you is to refuse to receive a sophist, who expects to overthrow the laws with words.

<p rend="align(indent)">I did not at the beginning review the private life of Demosthenes, nor did I at the beginning call to mind a single one of his public crimes—though I certainly had great abundance of material, or else I must be the most helpless of mortals—but first I exhibited the laws which forbid crowning men who have not yet rendered their accounts, and then I convicted the orator of having moved to crown Demosthenes before he had rendered account, and that too without inserting the qualifying proviso, <q rend="double">When he shall have rendered account,</q> but in utter contempt of you and of your laws.

<p>Secondly, I recited to you the laws which govern proclamations, in which it is expressly forbidden that when one is crowned by the people the proclamation shall be made in any other place than in the assembly. But the politician who is the defendant in this case has not only transgressed the laws, but the time of proclamation, and the place of it; for he orders the proclamation to be made, not in the assembly, but in the theater, not when the Athenian assembly is in session, but when the tragedies are about to he performed. After saying this, I spoke briefly about his private life, but chiefly about his public crimes.</p> </div>

<p>I insist, therefore, that you demand the same order of defence from Demosthenes; first, let him defend himself against the law of accountability, secondly, against the law which governs proclamations, and thirdly, and most important, let him show also that he is not unworthy of the reward. But if he asks you to indulge him as to the order of his speech, and solemnly promises that at the close of his defence he will clear away the matter of illegality, do not yield to him, and do not forget that this is an old trick of the court-room. For he would never of his own choice return to the defence against the illegality but because he has nothing to say which is just, he seeks by the insertion of extraneous matters to plunge you into forgetfulness of the charge.</p> </div>

<p>As, therefore, in gymnastic contests you see the boxers contending with one another for position, so do you for the city’s sake fight with him the whole day long for position as regards argument; and do not let him set his feet outside the bounds of the illegality charged, but watch him and lie in wait for him as you listen, drive him into discussion of the illegality, and look out for the twists and turns of his speech.</p> </div>

This man weeps more readily than other men laugh, and nothing is so easy for him as perjury. And I should not wonder if he should change his tactics and slander the listeners outside the bar, alleging that those whom truth herself has singled out and counted as oligarchs have come to the platform of the prosecution, but all the friends of the people to the platform of the defence.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In court, plaintiff and defendant had each a platform, where he sat with his intimate friends and supporters.

A few days hence the Pythian games are to be celebrated and the synod of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Hellas</placeName> assembled.

It might well be expected that at the coming meeting of the Amphictyonic Council, or at a special synod of delegates from the Greek states held at the time of the Pythian games, complaint would be brought by the Macedonians against the Spartans and those who had encouraged them in breaking the peace.</note> If you crown him, you will seem to be in sympathy with those who violate the general peace, whereas if you do the opposite, you will free the people from these charges.</p> </div>

Deliberate, not with the help of your ears alone, but with your eyes as well, looking sharply among yourselves to see who of your number they are who propose to aid Demosthenes; whether they are comrades of his youth in the hunting-field, or companions in the gymnasium—but no, by the Olympian Zeus, that cannot be, for his time has been spent, not in hunting wild boars, and not in cultivating vigor of body, but in practising his art of hunting down men of property.</p> </div>
