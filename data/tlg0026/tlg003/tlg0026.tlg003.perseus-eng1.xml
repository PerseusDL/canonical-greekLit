                              persons have been making their preparations for this case: how they
                              have mustered their forces, and how they have gone begging up and down
                              the market place, in the attempt to prevent the fair and orderly
                              course of justice in the state. But I have come trusting first in the
                              gods, then in the laws and in you, believing that with you no scheming
                              preparation can override law and justice.</p>

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I could wish, indeed, fellow citizens,
                              that the Senate of Five Hundred and the assemblies of the people were
                              properly conducted by those who preside over them, and the laws
                              enforced which Solon enacted to secure orderly conduct on the part of
                              public speakers; for then it would be permitted to the oldest citizen,
                              as the law prescribes, to come forward to the platform first, with
                              dignity, and, uninterrupted by shouting and tumult, out of his
                              experience to advise for the good of the state and it would then be
                              permitted to all other citizens who wished, one by one in turn, in
                              order of age, to express their opinion on every question; for so, I
                              think, the state would be best governed, and least litigation would
                              arise.</p>

                              make illegal motions, and other men who are ready to put these motions
                              to the vote—not men who have been chosen by right and lawful allotment
                              to preside, but men who hold the position by trickery; and if any
                              other senator does actually obtain the presidency by lot, and does
                              honestly declare your votes, he is threatened with impeachment by men
                              who no longer regard citizenship as a common right, but as their own
                              private perquisite; men who are making slaves of the common people,

                              the presiding tribe, the tenth part of the city.<note resp="Loeb"

                              only one part of the constitution is left to us—if I too may lay claim
                              to some discernment—the suits against illegal motions. But if you
                              shall annul these also, or give way to those who are trying to annul
                              them, I warn you that before you know it you will step by step have

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are, as you know, fellow-citizens,
                              three forms of government in the world tyranny, oligarchy, and
                              democracy. Tyrannies and oligarchies are administered according to the
                              tempers of their lords, but democratic states according to their own
                              established laws. Let no man among you forget this, but let each bear
                              distinctly in mind that when he enters a court-room to sit as juror in
                              a suit against an illegal motion, on that day he is to cast his vote
                              for or against his own freedom of speech. This is why the lawgiver
                              placed first in the jurors' oath these words, “I will vote according
                              to the laws.” For he well knew that if the laws are faithfully upheld
                              for the state, the democracy also is preserved.</p>

                  <div n="7" type="section">
                        <p>This you ought always to remember, and to hate those who make illegal
                              motions, and to hold no such offence as trivial, but every one as
                              serious indeed. And you ought to let no man rob you of this right of
                              yours, whether through the intercession of the generals, who by their
                              cooperation with certain public men have this long time been outraging
                              the constitution, or through petitions of foreigners, whom some bring
                              in here, and so escape the courts, when their whole political career
                              has been in defiance of the laws. But as each man of you would be
                              ashamed to desert the post to which he had been assigned in war, so
                              now you should be ashamed to desert the post to which the laws have
                              called you, sentinels, guarding the democracy this day.</p>

                              today your fellow citizens as a body have put the city and the
                              constitution into your hands as a solemn trust. Some of them are
                              present, listening to this case; others are absent, busy with their
                              personal affairs. Respect them therefore, and remember the oaths which
                              you have sworn, and the laws; and if I convict <placeName
                                    key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName> of having made a motion
                              that is illegal, false, and injurious to the state, annul the illegal
                              motion, fellow citizens; confirm the democratic government for our
                              state; punish those whose policies are opposed to the laws and to your
                              interests. If in this spirit you listen to the words which are about
                              to be spoken, I am sure that your verdict will be just, faithful to
                              your oath, and salutary alike to yourselves and to the

                              briefly about the laws themselves which govern the rendering of
                              account by public officers, the laws which are in fact violated by

                              themselves the public speakers of the senate-house and the assembly,
                              and thus anticipate their day of accounting long in advance, with
                              votes of thanks and with proclamations. The result was that when the
                              time came for them to render their account, those who had charges to
                              prefer fell into very great embarrassment, and this was even more the
                              case with the jurors.</p>

                              men before they have passed their final accounting. And yet in spite
                              of this wise provision of the framer of the law, forms of statement

                              and they are made accountable not only separately, but whole priestly,
                              families together, the Eumolpidae, the Ceryces, and all the rest.</p>

                              hands, and though they are not men who filch large sums from your

                              made to the people a report of the revenues. But because of the trust
                              which you placed in Eubulus, those who were elected Superintendents of
                              the Theoric Fund held (until the law of Hegemon was passed) the office
                              of Comptroller of the Treasury and the office of Receiver of Moneys;
                              they also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal

                              were true, and two laws had been in force governing proclamations, I
                              think the Thesmothetae would necessarily have searched them out, and
                              the prytanes would have referred them to the Nomothetae, and one or
                              the other of the two laws would have been repealed, either the law
                              that gave authority for the proclamation, or the law that forbade it.
                              But seeing that no such thing has been done, surely what they say is

                              happened that at the performance of the tragedies in the city
                              proclamations were made without authorization of the people, now that
                              this or that man was crowned by his tribe, now that others were
                              crowned by the men of their deme, while other men by the voice of the
                              herald manumitted their household slaves, and made all <placeName

                              were crowned by your senate or by the people, by first obtaining your
                              consent and by your decree, and after establishing large claims upon
                              your gratitude, but themselves reaching out after the honor with no

                              those who are crowned by our people, and did not supersede it. For it
                              was not the assembly that was being disturbed, but the theater; and he

                              by the tribe or deme, “or by any one else,” he says, “and the herald

                        <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For the truth of my assertion I will show
                              you a strong argument derived from the laws themselves. For the golden
                              crown itself which is proclaimed in the city theater the law takes
                              from the man who is crowned, and commands that it be dedicated to
                              Athena. And yet who among you would dare to charge the Athenian people
                              with such illiberality? For certainly no state, nay, not even a
                              private person—not one—would be so mean as to proclaim a crown and at
                              the same moment demand back the gift which he himself had made. But I
                              think it is because the crown is the gift of foreigners that the
                              dedication is made, lest any one set a higher value upon the gratitude
                              of a foreign state than upon that of his own country, and so become
                              corrupted.</p>

                  <div n="47" type="section">
                        <p>But the other crown, the crown that is proclaimed in the assembly, no one
                              dedicates, but he is permitted to keep it, that not only he, but also
                              his descendants, having the memorial in their house, may never become
                              disloyal to the democracy. And the reason why the lawgiver also
                              forbade the proclamation of the foreign crown in the theater “unless
                              the people vote,” is this: he would have the state that wishes to
                              crown any one of your citizens send ambassadors and ask permission of
                              the people, for so he who is proclaimed will be more grateful to you
                              for permitting the proclamation than to those who confer the crown.

                              before he leaves the room, to assent to that conclusion, whatever it

                              regarding peace, but on the subject of an alliance also; and that we

                                    largely broken up by the league war of 357—55. It was the synod

                              counsel regarding peace, and omitted the word “alliance”—and that not
                              inadvertently, but because they looked upon even the peace as
                              necessary, rather than honorable; secondly, they met Demosthenes'
                              bribery with a well-chosen remedy,</p>

                              agreements. In this way they were taking two precautions, and those of
                              the greatest importance; for first, they provided the period of three
                              months, a sufficient time for the ambassadors of the Greek states to
                              arrive; and secondly, they sought to secure to the city the good-will
                              of the Greeks, by the provision for a general congress, in order that
                              in case the agreements should be violated, we might not enter upon the
                              war unprepared and alone—the misfortune that actually came upon us,

                              resolution, as did all who spoke in the first of the two assemblies;
                              and the people left the assembly with substantially this supposition,
                              that peace would be made (that, however, it was better not to discuss
                              an alliance, because of our summons to the Greeks), and that the peace
                              would be shared by all the Greeks. Night intervened. We came the next
                              day to the assembly. Then it was that Demosthenes, hastening to get
                              possession of the platform, and leaving no other man an opportunity to
                              speak, said that the propositions of yesterday were utterly useless
                              unless Philip's ambassadors could be persuaded to assent to them. He
                              further said that he could not conceive of peace without alliance.</p>

                              from the peace, nor wait for the slow decisions of the other Greeks,
                              but we must either fight ourselves, or by ourselves make the peace.
                              And finally he called Antipater<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">One

                              injury of the state. Finally this thing prevailed, Demosthenes forcing

                              You know of your own knowledge, and have no need of other witness, how
                              these men have farmed out port-dues, and how they are making money
                              from the sacred harbor.” At the same time I called for the reading of
                              the oracle of the god, the oath of our fathers, and the curse that was
                              proclaimed. And I made this declaration:</p>

                              permitted it; and the curse closes with these words: ‘May they who

                              of the god and the sacred land; “And whatever city shall fail to

                              them to pay it at the temple within a stated time; and they removed
                              the wicked men who were responsible for what had been done, and
                              restored others, whose piety had forced them into exile. But when the
                              Amphissians failed to pay the money to the god, and had restored the
                              guilty men, and banished those righteous men who had been restored by

                              secured a certain degree of immunity for himself, and reconciliation;
                              and he has carried his flattery to great lengths.</p>

                              Alexander, as he claims to have been, or had any thought of it, three
                              of the best opportunities in the world have been offered to him, and,
                              as you see, he has not seized one of them. One, the first, was when
                              Alexander, newly come to the throne, and not yet fairly settled in his
                              personal affairs, crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004"

                              you, Demosthenes, at that time say a word? Did you move a decree?
                              Shall I assume that you followed your natural disposition and were
                              frightened? And yet the public opportunity waits not for the orator's

                              you actually approach—let us talk not about a city—would you actually
                              approach a house, where there was danger? But if money is being paid
                              out anywhere, you will lay siege to the place; a man's deed you will

                              his mother's side, lest because of misfortune of birth he be disloyal
                              to the laws that preserve the democracy. In the second place, he
                              should have as a legacy from his ancestors some service which they
                              have done to the democracy, or at the very least there must he no

                              people. Fourthly, he ought to be a man of good judgment and an able
                              speaker; for it is well that his discernment choose the wisest course,
                              and his training in rhetoric and his eloquence persuade the hearers;
                              but if he cannot have both, good judgment is always to be preferred to

                              But now the custom is already completely faded out, and you do the
                              crowning as a matter of habit, not deliberately.</p>

                              prosperous? And that the men are now inferior, but were better then? I
                              will try to explain this to you. Do you think, fellow citizens, that
                              any man would ever have been willing to train for the pancratium or
                              any other of the harder contests in the Olympic games, or any of the
                              other games that confer a crown, if the crown were given, not to the
                              best man, but to the man who had successfully intrigued for it? No man
                              would ever have been willing.</p>

                              men are willing to risk their bodies, and at the cost of the most
                              severe discipline to carry the struggle to the end. Imagine,
                              therefore, that you yourselves are the officials presiding over a
                              contest in political virtue, and consider this, that if you give the
                              prizes to few men and worthy, and in obedience to the laws, you will
                              find many men to compete in virtue's struggle; but if your gifts are
                              compliments to any man who seeks them and to those who intrigue for
                              them, you will corrupt even honest minds.</p>

                              worthy of their city. For they thought that their honor should be
                              conferred, not in written words, but in the memory of those whom they

                              only after certain men had put out of the way the provision for the
                              indictment of men who propose illegal measures. Yes, as I have heard

                              city, which he often described to me in his leisure hours—well, he
                              said that in the early days of the re-established democracy, if any
                              indictment for an illegal motion came into court, the word was as good

                              illegal motions than was the accuser himself; and it frequently
                              happened that they made the clerk stop, and told him to read to them
                              the laws and the motion a second time; and they convicted a man of
                              making an illegal motion, not in case he had overleaped all the laws
                              together, but if one syllable only was contravened. But the process as
                              it is conducted nowadays is ridiculous. The clerk reads the statement
                              of the illegality which is charged, and the jurors, as though hearing
                              an incantation, or some matter which is no concern of theirs, are

                        <p>Once the famous Aristophon of Azenia dared in your presence to boast that
                              he had been acquitted seventy-five times on charge of making illegal
                              motions. Not so the venerable Cephalus, famous as the truest
                              representative of democracy—not so, but he took pride in the very
                              opposite fact, saying that although he had been the author of more
                              measures than any other man, he had never once been indicted for an
                              illegal motion; an honorable pride, I think. For indictments for
                              illegal motions were in those times brought, not only by political
                              rivals against one another, but by friend against friend, if one was
                              responsible for any error toward the state. Yes, the following shall

                              by making a motion which was against the laws he was driving them into

                              not an indefinite one, but is defined by your own laws. For as in

                              transgressed the laws, but the time of proclamation, and the place of
                              it; for he orders the proclamation to be made, not in the assembly,
                              but in the theater, not when the Athenian assembly is in session, but
                              when the tragedies are about to he performed. After saying this, I
                              spoke briefly about his private life, but chiefly about his public
                              crimes.</p>

                              Demosthenes; first, let him defend himself against the law of

                              and thirdly, and most important, let him show also that he is not
                              unworthy of the reward. But if he asks you to indulge him as to the
                              order of his speech, and solemnly promises that at the close of his
                              defence he will clear away the matter of illegality, do not yield to
                              him, and do not forget that this is an old trick of the court-room.
                              For he would never of his own choice return to the defence against the
                              illegality but because he has nothing to say which is just, he seeks
                              by the insertion of extraneous matters to plunge you into
