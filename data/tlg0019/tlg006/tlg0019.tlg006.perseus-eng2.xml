<l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="690">you shall know thoroughly what is the nature of the birds, what the origin of the gods, of the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, even Prodicus will envy you your knowledge.</l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="693">At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. </l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="695">Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light.</l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="700">That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. We are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it.
