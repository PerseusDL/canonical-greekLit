moving Greg's work-in-progress on CTS-izing greco-roman collection texts to a Work directory

Revision 1.3  2013-06-30 12:34:33  gcrane
the card divs had had a line range but there was a problem with this, so we just have the start line in the n attribute.

Revision 1.1  2009/10/08 19:12:31  rsingh04
began reorganizing texts module by collection.  created separate work directory in texts module to keep hopper files separate from in progress files

edited entity tags CEH

Revision 1.3  2006/02/10 21:10:06  packel

                            different from that of Sacas. He is not a citizen, and would fain be one
                            at any cost; we, on the contrary, born of an honorable tribe and family
                            and living in the midst of our fellow-citizens, </l><l n="35">we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could
                            go. It's not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich,
                            likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself paying taxes; but
                            the crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two,

                            That is why we started off with a basket, a stew-pot and some myrtle
                            boughs and have come to seek a quiet country </l><l n="45">in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops,

                            a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool. I was at a feast in town, given to
                            celebrate the birth of a child; I had drunk pretty freely </l><l n="495">and had just fallen asleep, when a cock,
                            I suppose in a greater hurry than the rest, began to crow. I thought it
                            was dawn and set out for Halimus. I had hardly got beyond the walls,
                            when a footpad struck me in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and
                            wanted to shout, but he had already made off with my mantle.</l>

                            ever young and occupied with eternal thoughts, for we shall teach you
                            about all celestial matters; </l><l n="690">you
                            shall know thoroughly what is the nature of the birds, what the origin
                            of the gods, of the rivers, of Erebus, and Chaos; thanks to us, even
                            Prodicus will envy you your knowledge.</l>
                        <l>At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep
                            Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. </l><l n="695">Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg
                            in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the
                            revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering
                            golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep
                            Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth
                            our race, which was the first to see the light.</l><l n="700">That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had
                            brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their
                            marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods
                            sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the
                            dwellers in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. We are the
                            offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings
                            and we lend assistance to lovers. </l><l n="705">How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have
                            opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to
                            their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by
                            the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.</l>

                            when the fleece of the sheep must be clipped. Is the swallow in sight?</l>

                            earth is on the contrary honorable among us, the birds. For instance,
                            among you it's a crime to beat your father, but with us it's an
                            estimable deed; it's considered fine to run straight at your father and

                            more pleasant than to have wings. To begin with, just let us suppose a
                            spectator to be dying with hunger and to be weary of the choruses of the
                            tragic poets; if he were winged, he would fly off, go home to dine and
                            come back with his stomach filled.</l><l n="790">Some Patroclides, needing to take a crap, would not have to spill it
                            out on his cloak, but could fly off, satisfy his requirements, let a few
                            farts and, having recovered his breath, return. If one of you, it
                            matters not who, had adulterous relations and saw the husband of his
                            mistress in the seats of the senators, </l><l n="795">he might stretch his wings, fly to her, and, having
                            laid her, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of all, to
                            be winged? Look at Diitrephes! His wings were only wicker-work ones, and
                            yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from being
                                nobody,</l><l n="800">he has risen to be
                            famous; he's now the finest gilded cock of his tribe.</l>

                            went dirty like Socrates and carried staves. Now all is changed.

                            indeed he looks like a quail that has been hit hard on the head.

                            they repeat all the songs which concern the swallow, the teal, the goose
                            or the pigeon; in each verse you see wings, or at all events a few
                            feathers. This is what is happening down there.</l><l n="1305"> Finally, there are more than ten thousand
                            folk who are coming here from earth to ask you for feathers and hooked
                            claws; so, mind you supply yourself with wings for the immigrants.</l>
