copyrighted CTS texts from sdl and classics in new canonical structure per github repo

Revision 1.1  2013-09-13 11:17:04  balmas01
moving Greg's work-in-progress on CTS-izing greco-roman collection texts to a Work directory

Revision 1.3  2013-06-30 12:34:33  gcrane
the card divs had had a line range but there was a problem with this, so we just have the start line in the n attribute.

Revision 1.1  2009/10/08 19:12:31  rsingh04
began reorganizing texts module by collection.  created separate work directory in texts module to keep hopper files separate from in progress files

Revision 1.4  2009/07/15 15:24:01  student
edited entity tags CEH

Revision 1.3  2006/02/10 21:10:06  packel
places/dates now actually tagged

Revision 1.2  2005/08/01 15:50:23  packel
removed stray item tags

Revision 1.1  2005/07/25 14:28:02  packel

Updated texts to TEI P4 and Perseus P4 extensions; minor cleanup (esp. character encodings and typos.)

Revision 1.7  2000/05/01 13:24:35  amahoney
mark the English as English!  some of them had Latin first in their
langusage, which is even more wrong than Greek

Revision 1.6  2000/03/04 20:33:53  dasmith
Added separate funder entity to TEI header.

                            I suppose in a greater hurry than the rest, began to crow. I thought it
                            was dawn and set out for Halimus. I had hardly got beyond the walls,
                            when a footpad struck me in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and
                            wanted to shout, but he had already made off with my mantle.</p>

                            Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. <milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg
                            in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the
                            revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering
                            golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep
                            Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth
                            our race, which was the first to see the light.<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had
                            brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their
                            marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods
                            sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the

                            voracious insects the soil produces, which attack the trees <milestone ed="p" n="1065" unit="line"/>and feed on the germ when it has
                            scarcely formed in the calyx; I destroy those who ravage the balmy

                            if he brings him to us alive. For this Philocrates skewers the finches
                            together and sells them at the rate of an obolus for seven.<milestone ed="p" n="1080" unit="line"/> He tortures the thrushes by blowing

                            forces them, fastened in a net, to decoy others.” That is what we wish
                            to proclaim. And if anyone is keeping birds <milestone ed="p" n="1085" unit="line"/>shut up in his yard, let him hasten to let them loose;
                            those who disobey shall be seized by the birds and we shall put them in
