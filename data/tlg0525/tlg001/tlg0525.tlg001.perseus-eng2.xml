		<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the Greek mainland facing the Cyclades Islands and the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean Sea</placeName> the Sunium promontory stands out from the Attic land.  When you have rounded the promontory you see a harbor and a temple to Athena of Sunium on the peak of the promontory.  Farther on is <placeName key="tgn,7010895">Laurium</placeName>, where once the Athenians had silver mines, and a small uninhabited island called the Island of Patroclus.  For a fortification was built on it and a palisade constructed by Patroclus, who was admiral in command of the Egyptian men-of-war sent by Ptolemy, son of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, to help the Athenians, when Antigonus, son of Demetrius, was ravaging their country, which he had invaded with an army, and at the same time was blockading them by sea with a fleet.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date from="-0267" to="-0263">267-263 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Peiraeus was a parish from early times, though it was not a port before Themistocles became an archon of the Athenians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0493">493 B.C.</date></note> Their port was Phalerum, for at this place the sea comes nearest to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and from here men say that Menestheus set sail with his fleet for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and before him Theseus, when he went to give satisfaction to Minos for the death of Androgeos.  But when Themistocles became archon, since he thought that the Peiraeus was more conveniently situated for mariners, and had three harbors as against one at Phalerum, he made it the Athenian port.  Even up to my time there were docks there, and near the largest harbor is the grave of Themistocles.  For it is said that the Athenians repented of their treatment of Themistocles, and that his relations took up his bones and brought them from <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName>.  And the children of Themistocles certainly returned and set up in the Parthenon a painting, on which is a portrait of Themistocles.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most noteworthy sight in the Peiraeus is a precinct of Athena and Zeus.  Both their images are of bronze; Zeus holds a staff and a Victory, Athena a spear.  Here is a portrait of Leosthenes and of his sons, painted by Arcesilaus.  This Leosthenes at the head of the Athenians and the united Greeks defeated the Macedonians in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and again outside <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> forced them into <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName> over against Oeta, and shut them up there.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0323">323 B.C.</date></note> The portrait is in the long portico, where stands a market-place for those living near the sea—those farther away from the harbor have another—but behind the portico near the sea stand a Zeus and a Demos, the work of Leochares.  And by the sea <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. c. <date when="-0350">350 B.C.</date></note> built a sanctuary of Aphrodite, after he had crushed the Lacedaemonian warships off <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName> in the Carian peninsula.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0394">394 B.C.</date></note> For the Cnidians hold Aphrodite in very great honor, and they have sanctuaries of the goddess; the oldest is to her as Doritis (<term>Bountiful</term>), the next in age as Acraea (<term>Of the Height</term>), while the newest is to the Aphrodite called Cnidian by men generally, but Euploia (<term>Fair Voyage</term>) by the Cnidians themselves.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Athenians have also another harbor, at Munychia, with a temple of Artemis of Munychia, and yet another at Phalerum, as I have already stated, and near it is a sanctuary of Demeter.  Here there is also a temple of Athena Sciras, and one of Zeus some distance away, and altars of the gods named Unknown, and of heroes, and of the children of Theseus and Phalerus; for this Phalerus is said by the Athenians to have sailed with Jason to <placeName key="tgn,7016642">Colchis</placeName>. There is also an altar of Androgeos, son of Minos, though it is called that of Heros; those, however, who pay special attention to the study of their country's antiquities know that it belongs to Androgeos.</p></div>
		<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Twenty stades away is the Coliad promontory; on to it, when the Persian fleet was destroyed, the wrecks were carried down by the waves.  There is here an image of the Coliad Aphrodite, with the goddesses Genetyllides (Goddesses of Birth), as they are called.  And I am of opinion that the goddesses of the Phocaeans in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, whom they call Gennaides, are the same as those at Colias.  On the way from Phalerum to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> there is a temple of Hera with neither doors nor roof.  Men say that Mardonius, son of Gobryas, burnt it.  But the image there to-day is, as report goes, the work of Alcamenes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. <date from="-0440" to="-0400">440-400 B.C.</date></note> So that this, at any rate, cannot have been damaged by the Persians.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="2" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
	<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On entering the city there is a monument to Antiope the <placeName key="tgn,1121168">Amazon</placeName>.  This Antiope, Pindar says, was carried of by Peirithous and Theseus, but Hegias of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> gives the following account of her.  Heracles was besieging Themiscyra on the Thermodon, but could not take it, but Antiope, falling in love with Theseus, who was aiding Heracles in his campaign, surrendered the stronghold.  Such is the account of Hegias.  But the Athenians assert that when the Amazons came, Antiope was shot by Molpadia, while Molpadia was killed by Theseus.  To Molpadia also there is a monument among the Athenians.</p></div>
	<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go up from the Peiraeus you see the ruins of the walls which <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> restored after the naval battle off <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName>.  For those built by Themistocles after the retreat of the Persians were destroyed during the rule of those named the Thirty.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0404" to="-0403">404-403 B.C.</date></note> Along the road are very famous graves, that of Menander, son of Diopeithes, and a cenotaph of Euripides.  He him self went to King Archelaus and lies buried in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; as to the manner of his death (many have described it), let it be as they say.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So even in his time poets lived at the courts of kings, as earlier still Anacreon consorted with Polycrates, despot of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, and Aeschylus and Simonides journeyed to Hiero at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.  Dionysius, afterwards despot in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had Philoxenus at his court, and Antigonus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Antigonus surnamed Gonatas became king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> in <date when="-0283">283 B.C.</date></note> ruler of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, had Antagoras of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and Aratus of <placeName key="perseus,Soli">Soli</placeName>.  But Hesiod and Homer either failed to win the society of kings or else purposely despised it, Hesiod through boorishness and reluctance to travel, while Homer, having gone very far abroad, depreciated the help afforded by despots in the acquisition of wealth in comparison with his reputation among ordinary men.  And yet Homer, too, in his poem makes Demodocus live at the court of Alcinous, and Agamemnon leave a poet with his wife. Not far from the gates is a grave, on which is mounted a soldier standing by a horse.  Who it is I do not know, but both horse and soldier were carved by Praxiteles.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On entering the city there is a building for the preparation of the processions, which are held in some cases every year, in others at longer intervals. Hard by is a temple of Demeter, with images of the goddess herself and of her daughter, and of Iacchus holding a torch.  On the wall, in Attic characters, is written that they are works of Praxiteles.  Not far from the temple is Poseidon on horseback, hurling a spear against the giant Polybotes, concerning whom is prevalent among the Coans the story about the promontory of Chelone.  But the inscription of our time assigns the statue to another, and not to Poseidon.  From the gate to the Cerameicus there are porticoes, and in front of them brazen statues of such as had some title to fame, both men and women.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>One of the porticoes contains shrines of gods, and a gymnasium called that of Hermes. In it is the house of Pulytion, at which it is said that a mystic rite was performed by the most notable Athenians, parodying the Eleusinian mysteries.  But in my time it was devoted to the worship of Dionysus. This Dionysus they call Melpomenus (Minstrel), on the same principle as they call Apollo Musegetes (Leader of the Muses).  Here there are images of Athena Paeonia (Healer), of Zeus, of Mnemosyne (Memory) and of the Muses, an Apollo, the votive offering and work of Eubulides, and Acratus, a daemon attendant upon Apollo; it is only a face of him worked into the wall.  After the precinct of Apollo is a building that contains earthen ware images, Amphictyon, king of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, feasting Dionysus and other gods.  Here also is Pegasus of Eleutherae, who introduced the god to the Athenians. Herein he was helped by the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, which called to mind that the god once dwelt in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in the days of Icarius.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Amphictyon won the kingdom thus.  It is said that Actaeus was the first king of what is now <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.  When he died, Cecrops, the son-in-law of Actaeus, received the kingdom, and there were born to him daughters, Herse, Aglaurus and Pandrosus, and a son Erysichthon.  This son did not become king of the Athenians, but happened to die while his father lived, and the kingdom of Cecrops fell to Cranaus, the most powerful of the Athenians.  They say that Cranaus had daughters, and among them Atthis; and from her they call the country <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, which before was named Actaea.  And Amphictyon, rising up against Cranaus, although he had his daughter to wife, deposed him from power.  Afterwards he himself was banished by Erichthonius and his fellow rebels.  Men say that Erichthonius had no human father, but that his parents were Hephaestus and Earth.</p></div>

<div n="3" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The district of the Cerameicus has its name from the hero <placeName key="tgn,5003746">Ceramus</placeName>, he too being the reputed son of Dionysus and Ariadne.  First on the right is what is called the Royal Portico, where sits the king when holding the yearly office called the kingship. On the tiling of this portico are images of baked earthenware, Theseus throwing Sciron into the sea and Day carrying away Cephalus, who they say was very beautiful and was ravished by Day, who was in love with him.  His son was Phaethon, [afterwards ravished by Aphrodite]. . . and made a guardian of her temple.  Such is the tale told by Hesiod, among others, in his poem on women.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near the portico stand <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, Timotheus his son and Evagoras<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Evagoras was a king of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, who reigned from about <date from="-0410" to="-0374">410 to 374 B.C.</date>  He favoured the Athenians, and helped <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> to defeat the Spartan fleet off <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName> in <date when="-0394">394 B.C.</date></note> King of Cyprus, who caused the Phoenician men-of-war to be given to <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> by King Artaxerxes.  This he did as an Athenian whose ancestry connected him with <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, for he traced his pedigree back to Teucer and the daughter of Cinyras.  Here stands Zeus, called Zeus of Freedom, and the Emperor Hadrian, a benefactor to all his subjects and especially to the city of the Athenians.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A portico is built behind with pictures of the gods called the Twelve.  On the wall opposite are painted Theseus, Democracy and Demos.  The picture represents Theseus as the one who gave the Athenians political equality.  By other means also has the report spread among men that Theseus bestowed sovereignty upon the people, and that from his time they continued under a democratical government, until Peisistratus rose up and became despot.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0560" to="-0527">560-527 B.C.</date></note> But there are many false beliefs current among the mass of mankind, since they are ignorant of historical science and consider trustworthy whatever they have heard from childhood in choruses and tragedies; one of these is about Theseus, who in fact himself became king, and afterwards, when Menestheus was dead, the descendants of Theseus remained rulers even to the fourth generation.  But if I cared about tracing the pedigree I should have included in the list, besides these, the kings from Melanthus to Cleidicus the son of Aesimides.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here is a picture of the exploit, near <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, of the Athenians who were sent to help the Lacedaemonians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0362">362 B.C.</date></note> Xenophon among others has written a history of the whole war—the taking of the Cadmea, the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, how the Boeotians invaded the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>,and the contingent sent to the Lacedacmonians from the Athenians.  In the picture is a cavalry battle, in which the most famous men are, among the Athenians, Grylus the son of Xenophon, and in the Boeotian cavalry, Epaminondas the Theban.  These pictures were painted for the Athenians by Euphranor, and he also wrought the Apollo surnamed Patrous (Paternal) in the temple hard by.  And in front of the temple is one Apollo made by Leochares; the other Apollo, called Averter of evil, was made by Calamis. They say that the god received this name because by an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> he stayed the pestilence which afflicted the Athenians at the time of the Peloponnesian War.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0430">430 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here is built also a sanctuary of the Mother of the gods; the image is by Pheidias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0490" to="-0432">490-432 B.C.</date></note>.  Hard by is the council chamber of those called the Five Hundred, who are the Athenian councillors for a year.  In it are a wooden figure of Zeus Counsellor and an Apollo, the work of Peisias,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The dates of these artists are unknown.</note> and a Demos by Lyson. The thesmothetae (lawgivers) were painted by Protogenes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A contemporary of Alexander the Great.</note> the Caunian, and Olbiades<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An unknown painter.</note> portrayed Callippus, who led the Athenians to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> to stop the incursion of the Gauls into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0279">279 B.C.</date></note></p></div>

</div>

<div n="4" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These Gauls inhabit the most remote portion of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, near a great sea that is not navigable to its extremities, and possesses ebb and flow and creatures quite unlike those of other seas.  Through their country flows the river <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Eridanus</placeName>, on the bank of which the daughters of Helius (Sun) are supposed to lament the fate that befell their brother Phaethon.  It was late before the name “Gauls” came into vogue; for anciently they were called Celts both amongst themselves and by others.  An army of them mustered and turned towards the <placeName key="tgn,1112277">Ionian Sea</placeName>, dispossessed the Illyrian people, all who dwelt as far as <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> with the Macedonians themselves, and overran <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>.  And when they drew near to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, the Greeks in general made no move to prevent the inroad of the barbarians, since previously they had been severely defeated by Alexander and Philip.  Further, Antipater and Cassander<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Antipater and Cassander were successors of Alexander the Great.</note> afterwards crushed the Greeks, so that through weakness each state thought no shame of itself taking no part in the defence of the country.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the Athenians, although they were more exhausted than any of the Greeks by the long Macedonian war, and had been generally unsuccessful in their battles, nevertheless set forth to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> with such Greeks as joined them, having made the Callippus I mentioned their general. Occupying the pass where it was narrowest, they tried to keep the foreigners from entering <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; but the Celts, having discovered the path by which Ephialtes of <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName> once led the Persians, over whelmed the Phocians stationed there and crossed Oeta unperceived by the Greeks.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then it was that the Athenians put the Greeks under the greatest obligation, and although outflanked offered resistance to the foreigners on two sides.  But the Athenians on the fleet suffered most, for the Lamian gulf is a swamp near Thermopylae—the reason being, I think, the hot water that here runs into the sea.  These then were more distressed; for taking the Greeks on board they were forced to sail through the mud weighted as they were by arms and men.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they tried to save <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in the way described, but the Gauls, now south of the Gates, cared not at all to capture the other towns, but were very eager to sack <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and the treasures of the god.  They were opposed by the Delphians themselves and the Phocians of the cities around <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>; a force of Aetolians also joined the defenders, for the Aetolians at this time were pre-eminent for their vigorous activity.  When the forces engaged, not only were thunderbolts and rocks broken off from <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> hurled against the Gauls, but terrible shapes as armed warriors haunted the foreigners. They say that two of them, Hyperochus and Amadocus, came from the Hyperboreans, and that the third was Pyrrhus son of Achilles.  Because of this help in battle the Delphians sacrifice to Pyrrhus as to a hero, although formerly they held even his tomb in dishonor, as being that of an enemy.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The greater number of the Gauls crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> by ship and plundered its coasts. Some time after, the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName>, that was called of old Teuthrania, drove the Gauls into it from the sea.  Now this people occupied the country on the farther side of the river Sangarius capturing <placeName key="perseus,Ancyra">Ancyra</placeName>, a city of the Phrygians, which Midas son of Gordius had founded in former time.  And the anchor, which Midas found,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A legend invented to explain the name “<placeName key="perseus,Ancyra">Ancyra</placeName>,” which means anchor.</note> was even as late as my time in the sanctuary of Zeus, as well as a spring called the Spring of Midas, water from which they say Midas mixed with wine to capture Silenus. Well then, the Pergameni took <placeName key="perseus,Ancyra">Ancyra</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName> which lies under Mount Agdistis, where they say that Attis lies buried.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They have spoils from the Gauls, and a painting which portrays their deed against them. The land they dwell in was, they say, in ancient times sacred to the Cabeiri, and they claim that they are themselves Arcadians, being of those who crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> with Telephus.  Of the wars that they have waged no account has been published to the world, except that they have accomplished three most notable achievements; the subjection of the coast region of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, the expulsion of the Gauls therefrom, and the exploit of Telephus against the followers of Agamemnon, at a time when the Greeks after missing <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, were plundering the Meian plain thinking it Trojan territory.  Now I will return from my digression.</p></div>

Among the <term>eponymoi</term> is Erechtheus, who conquered the Eleusinians in battle, and killed their general, Immaradus the son of Eumolpus. There is Aegeus also and Oeneus the bastard son of Pandion, and Acamas, one of the children of Theseus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I saw also among the <term>eponymoi</term> statues of Cecrops and Pandion, but I do not know who of those names are thus honored.  For there was an earlier ruler Cecrops who took to wife the daughter of Actaeus, and a later—he it was who migrated to Euboea—son of Erechtheus, son of Pandion, son of Erichthonius.  And there was a king Pandion who was son of Erichthonius, and another who was son of Cecrops the second. This man was deposed from his kingdom by the Metionidae, and when he fled to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>—for he had to wife the daughter of Pylas king of Megara—his children were banished with him.  And Pandion is said to have fallen ill there and died, and on the coast of the Megarid is his tomb, on the rock called the rock of Athena the Gannet.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But his children expelled the Metionidae, and returned from banishment at Megara, and Aegeus, as the eldest, became king of the Athenians.  But in rearing daughters Pandion was unlucky, nor did they leave any sons to avenge him.  And yet it was for the sake of power that he made the marriage alliance with the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.  But there is no way for a mortal to overstep what the deity thinks fit to send.  They say that Tereus, though wedded to Procne, dishonored Philomela, thereby transgressing Greek custom, and further, having mangled the body of the damsel, constrained the women to avenge her.  There is another statue, well worth seeing, of Pandion on the Acropolis.</p></div>

And among the distinguished acts of Ptolemy in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> they mention that it was he who, of Alexander's companions, was foremost in succoring him when in danger among the Oxydracae.  After the death of Alexander<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0323">323 B.C.</date></note>, by withstanding those who would have conferred all his empire upon Aridaeus, the son of Philip, he became chiefly responsible for the division of the various nations into the kingdoms.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> in person, and killed Cleomenes, whom Alexander had appointed satrap of that country, considering him a friend of Perdiccas, and therefore not faithful to himself; and the Macedonians who had been entrusted with the task of carrying the corpse of Alexander to <placeName key="perseus,Aegae">Aegae</placeName>, he persuaded to hand it over to him.  And he proceeded to bury it with Macedonian rites in <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>, but, knowing that Perdiccas would make war, he kept <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> garrisoned.  And Perdiccas took Aridaeus, son of Philip, and the boy Alexander, whom Roxana, daughter of Oxyartes, had borne to Alexander, to lend color to the campaign, but really he was plotting to take from Ptolemy his kingdom in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.  But being expelled from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and having lost his reputation as a soldier, and being in other respects unpopular with the Macedonians, he was put to death by his body guard.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The death of Perdiccas immediately raised Ptolemy to power, who both reduced the Syrians and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, and also welcomed Seleucus, son of Antiochus, who was in exile, having been expelled by Antigonus; he further himself prepared to attack Antigonus.  He prevailed on Cassander, son of Anti pater, and Lysimachus, who was king in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, to join in the war, urging that Seleucus was in exile and that the growth of the power of Antigonus was dangerous to them all.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For a time Antigonus pre pared for war, and was by no means confident of the issue; but on learning that the revolt of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> had called Ptolemy to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, he immediately reduced the Syrians and Phoenicians by a sudden inroad, handed them over to Demetrius, his son, a man who for all his youth had already a reputation for good sense, and went down to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>. But he led his army back without crossing, on hearing that Demetrius had been overcome by Ptolemy in battle.  But Demetrius had not altogether evacuated the country before Ptolemy, and having surprised a body of Egyptians, killed a few of them.  Then on the arrival of Antigonus Ptolemy did not wait for him but returned to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the winter was over, Demetrius sailed to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and overcame in a naval action Menelaus, the satrap of Ptolemy, and afterwards Ptolemy him self, who had crossed to bring help.  Ptolemy fled to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, where he was besieged by Antigonus on land and by Demetrius with a fleet.  In spite of his extreme peril Ptolemy saved his empire by making a stand with an army at <placeName key="tgn,6004608">Pelusium</placeName> while offering resistance with warships from the river.  Antigonus now abandoned all hope of reducing <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> in the circumstances, and dispatched Demetrius against the Rhodians with a fleet and a large army, hoping, if the island were won, to use it as a base against the Egyptians.  But the Rhodians displayed daring and ingenuity in the face of the besiegers, while Ptolemy helped them with all the forces he could muster.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Antigonus thus failed to reduce <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> or, later, <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and shortly afterwards he offered battle to Lysimachus, and to Cassander and the army of Seleucus, lost most of his forces, and was himself killed, having suffered most by reason of the length of the war with Eumenes.  Of the kings who put down Antigonus I hold that the most wicked was Cassander, who although he had recovered the throne of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> with the aid of Antigonus, nevertheless came to fight against a benefactor.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the death of Antigonus, Ptolemy again reduced the Syrians and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, and also restored Pyrrhus to <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName> on the mainland.  <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> rebelled; but Magas, the son of <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName> (who was at this time married to Ptolemy) captured <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> in the fifth year of the rebellion.  If this Ptolemy really was the son of Philip, son of Amyntas, he must have inherited from his father his passion for women, for, while wedded to Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, although he had children he took a fancy to Berenice, whom Antipater had sent to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> with Eurydice.  He fell in love with this woman and had children by her, and when his end drew near he left the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> to Ptolemy (from whom the Athenians name their tribe) being the son of <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName> and not of the daughter of Antipater.</p></div>

He put to death another brother also, son of Eurydice, on discovering that he was creating disaffection among the Cyprians.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Ptolemy fortified the entrance into <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and awaited the attack of the Cyrenians.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Magas, who was married to Apame, daughter of Antiochus, son of Seleucus, persuaded Antiochus to break the treaty which his father Seleucus had made with Ptolemy and to attack <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

I have already stated how this Ptolemy sent a fleet to help the Athenians against Antigonus and the Macedonians, but it did very little to save <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is pertinent to add here an account of Attalus, because he too is one of the Athenian <term>eponymoi.</term> A Macedonian of the name of Docimus, a general of Antigonus, who afterwards surrendered both himself and his property to Lysimachus, had a Paphlagonian eunuch called Philetaerus.  All that Philetaerus did to further the revolt from Lysimachus, and how he won over Seleucus, will form an episode in my account of Lysimachus.  Attalus, however, son of Attalus and nephew of Philetaerus, received the kingdom from his cousin Eumenes, who handed it over.

<div n="9" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The one called Philometor is eighth in descent from Ptolemy son of Lagus, and his surname was given him in sarcastic mockery, for we know of none of the kings who was so hated by his mother.  Although he was the eldest of her children she would not allow him to be called to the throne, but prevailed on his father before the call came to send him to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>.  Among the reasons assigned for Cleopatra's enmity towards her son is her expectation that Alexander the younger of her sons would prove more subservient, and this consideration induced her to urge the Egyptians to choose Alexander as king.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the people offered opposition, she dispatched Alexander for the second time to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, ostensibly as general, but really because she wished by his means to make Ptolemy more afraid of her.  Finally she covered with wounds those eunuchs she thought best disposed, and presented them to the people, making out that she was the victim of Ptolemy's machinations, and that he had treated the eunuchs in such a fashion.  The people of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> rushed to kill Ptolemy, and when he escaped on board a ship, made Alexander, who returned from <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, their king.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Retribution for the exile of Ptolemy came upon Cleopatra, for she was put to death by Alexander, whom she herself had made to be king of the Egyptians.  When the deed was discovered, and Alexander fled in fear of the citizens, Ptolemy returned and for the second time assumed control of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.  He made war against the Thebans, who had revolted, reduced them two years after the revolt, and treated them so cruelly that they were left not even a memorial of their former prosperity, which had so grown that they surpassed in wealth the richest of the Greeks, the sanctuary of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and the Orchomenians.  Shortly after this Ptolemy met with his appointed fate, and the Athenians, who had been benefited by him in many ways which I need not stop to relate, set up a bronze likeness of him and of <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName>, his only legitimate child.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the Egyptians come statues of Philip and of his son Alexander.  The events of their lives were too important to form a mere digression in another story. Now the Egyptians had their honors bestowed upon them out of genuine respect and because they were benefactors, but it was rather the sycophancy of the people that gave them to Philip and Alexander, since they set up a statue to Lysimachus also not so much out of goodwill as because they thought to serve their immediate ends.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This Lysimachus was a Macedonian by birth and one of Alexander's body-guards, whom Alexander once in anger shut up in a chamber with a lion, and afterwards found that he had overpowered the brute.  Henceforth he always treated him with respect, and honored him as much as the noblest Macedonians.  After the death of Alexander, Lysimachus ruled such of the Thracians, who are neighbors of the Macedonians, as had been under the sway of Alexander and before him of Philip.  These would comprise but a small part of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.  If race be compared with race no nation of men except the Celts are more numerous than the Thracians taken all together, and for this reason no one before the Romans reduced the whole Thracian population. But the Romans have subdued all <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, and they also hold such Celtic territory as is worth possessing, but they have intentionally overlooked the parts that they consider useless through excessive cold or barrenness.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then Lysimachus made war against his neighbours, first the Odrysae, secondly the Getae and Dromichaetes. Engaging with men not unversed in warfare and far his superiors in number, he himself escaped from a position of extreme danger, but his son Agathocles, who was serving with him then for the first time, was taken prisoner by the Getae. Lysimachus met with other reverses afterwards, and attaching great importance to the capture of his son made peace with Dromicliaetes, yielding to the Getic king the parts of his empire beyond the Ister, and, chiefly under compulsion, giving him his daughter in marriage.  Others say that not Agathocles but Lysimachus himself was taken prisoner, regaining his liberty when Agathocles treated with the Getic king on his behalf.  On his return he married to Agathocles Lysandra, the daughter of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, and of Eurydice.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He also crossed with a fleet to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and helped to overthrow the empire of Antigonus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0302">302 B.C.</date></note> He founded also the modern city of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> as far as the coast, bringing to it as settlers people of Lebedos and <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>, after destroying their cities, so that the iambic poet Phoenix com posed a lament for the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>.  Mermesianax, the elegiac writer, was, I think, no longer living, otherwise he too would certainly have been moved by the taking of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName> to write a dirge. Lysimachus also went to war with Pyrrhus, son of Aeacides.  Waiting for his departure from Epeirus (Pyrrhus was of a very roving disposition) he ravaged Epeirus until he reached the royal tombs.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The next part of the story is incredible to me, but Hieronymus the Cardian<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. 20-<date when="-0300">300 B.C.</date></note> relates that he destroyed the tombs and cast out the bones of the dead.  But this Hieronymus has a reputation generally of being biased against all the kings except Antigonus, and of being unfairly partial towards him.  As to the treatment of the Epeirot graves, it is perfectly plain that it was malice that made him record that a Macedonian desecrated the tombs of the dead.  Besides, Lysimachus was surely aware that they were the ancestors not of Pyrrhus only but also of Alexander.  In fact Alexander was an Epeirot and an Aeacid on his mother's side, and the subsequent alliance between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus proves that even as enemies they were not irreconcilable.  Possibly Hieronymus had grievances against Lysimachus, especially his destroying the city of the Cardians and founding Lysimachea in its stead on the isthmus of the Thracian Chersonesus.</p></div>

And at the same time Philetaerus, to whom the property of Lysimachus had been entrusted, aggrieved at the death of Agathocles and suspicious of the treatment he would receive at the hands of <placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName>, seized <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1121615">Caicus</placeName>, and sending a herald offered both the property and himself to Seleucus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lysimachus hearing of all these things lost no time in crossing into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0281">281 B.C.</date></note>, and assuming the initiative met Seleucus, suffered a severe defeat and was killed.

<div n="11" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the history of Lysimachus.  The Athenians have also a statue of Pyrrhus.  This Pyrrhus was not related to Alexander, except by ancestry. Pyrrhus was son of Aeacides, son of Arybbas, but Alexander was son of Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemus, and the father of Neoptolemus and Aryblas was Alcetas, son of Tharypus. And from Tharypus to Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, are fifteen generations.  Now Pyrrhus was the first who after the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> disdained to return to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, but sailing to Epeirus dwelt there because of the oracles of Helenus.  By Hermione Pyrrhus had no child, but by Andromache he had Molossus, Pielus, and Pergamus, who was the youngest.  Helenus also had a son, Cestrinus, being married to Andromache after the murder of Pyrrhus at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Helenus on his death passed on the kingdom to Molossus, son of Pyrrhus, so that Cestrinus with volunteers from the Epeirots took possession of the region beyond the river Thyamis, while <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and killed Areius, despot in Teuthrania, who fought with him in single combat for his kingdom, and gave his name to the city which is still called after him.  To Andromache, who accompanied him, there is still a shrine in the city.  Pielus remained behind in Epeirus, and to him as ancestor Pyrrhus, the son of Aeacides, and his fathers traced their descent, and not to Molossus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Down to Alcetas, son of Tharypus, Epeirus too was under one king. But the sons of Alcetas after a quarrel agreed to rule with equal authority, remaining faithful to their compact; and afterwards, when Alexander, son of Neoptolemus, died among the Leucani, and Olympias returned to Epeirus through fear of Antipater, Aeacides, son of Arybbas, continued in allegiance to Olympias and joined in her campaign against Aridaeus and the Macedonians, although the Epeirots refused to accompany him.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Olympias on her victory behaved wickedly in the matter of the death of Aridaeus, and much more wickedly to certain Macedonians, and for this reason was considered to have deserved her subsequent treatment at the hands of Cassander; so Aeacides at first was not received even by the Epeirots because of their hatred of Olympias, and when after wards they forgave him, his return to Epeirus was next opposed by Cassander. When a battle occurred at Oeneadae between Philip, brother of Cassander, and Aeacides, Aeacides was wounded and shortly after met his fate.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0313">313 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Epeirots accepted Alcetas as their king, being the son of Arybbas and the elder brother of Aeacides, but of an uncontrollable temper and on this account banished by his father.  Immediately on his arrival he began to vent his fury on the Epeirots, until they rose up and put him and his children to death at night.  After killing him they brought back Pyrrhus, son of Aeacides.  No sooner had he arrived than Cassander made war upon him, while he was young in years and before he had consolidated his empire.  When the Macedonians attacked him, Pyrrhus went to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.  Ptolemy gave him to wife the half-sister of his children, and restored him by an Egyptian force.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The first Greeks that Pyrrhus attacked on becoming king were the Corcyraeans.  He saw that the island lay off his own territory, and he did not wish others to have a base from which to attack him. My account of Lysimachus has already related how he fared, after taking <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>, in his war with Lysimachus, how he expelled Demetrius and ruled <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> until he was in turn expelled by Lysimachus, the most important of his achievements until he waged war against the Romans,</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>being the first Greek we know of to do so. For no further battle, it is said, took place between Aeneas and Diomedes with his Argives.  One of the many ambitions of the Athenians was to reduce all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, but the disaster at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0413">413 B.C.</date></note> prevented their trying conclusions with the Romans.  Alexander, son of Neoptolemus, of the same family as Pyrrhus but older, died among the Leucani before he could meet the Romans in battle.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="12" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Pyrrhus was the first to cross the <placeName key="tgn,1112277">Ionian Sea</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to attack the Romans.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0280">280 B.C.</date></note> And even he crossed on the invitation of the Tarentines.  For they were already involved in a war with the Romans, but were no match for them unaided.  Pyrrhus was already in their debt, because they had sent a fleet to help him in his war with <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>, but the most cogent arguments of the Tarentine envoys were their accounts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, how its prosperity was equal to that of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and their plea that it was wicked to dismiss them when they had come as friends and suppliants in their hour of need.  When the envoys urged these considerations, Pyrrhus remembered the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, which he took to be an omen of his success in the war, as he was a descendant of Achilles making war upon a colony of Trojans.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pleased with this proposal, and being a man who never lost time when once he had made up his mind, he immediately proceeded to man war ships and to prepare transports to carry horses and men-at-arms.  There are books written by men of no renown as historians, entitled “Memoirs.” When I read these I marvelled greatly both at the personal bravery of Pyrrhus in battle, and also at the forethought he displayed whenever a contest was imminent.  So on this occasion also when crossing to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with a fleet he eluded the observation of the Romans, and for some time after his arrival they were unaware of his presence; it was only when the Romans made an attack upon the Tarentines that he appeared on the scene with his army, and his unexpected assault naturally threw his enemies into confusion.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And being perfectly aware that he was no match for the Romans, he prepared to let loose against them his elephants. The first European to acquire elephants was Alexander, after subduing Porus and the power of the Indians; after his death others of the kings got them but Antigonus more than any; Pyrrhus captured his beasts in the battle with Demetrius.  When on this occasion they came in sight the Romans were seized with panic, and did not believe they were animals.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For although the use of ivory in arts and crafts all men obviously have known from of old, the actual beasts, before the Macedonians crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, nobody had seen at all except the Indians themselves, the Libyans, and their neighbours.  This is proved by Homer, who describes the couches and houses of the more prosperous kings as ornamented with ivory, but never mentions the beast; but if he had seen or heard about it he would, in my opinion have been much more likely to speak of it than of the battle between the Dwarf-men and cranes.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.3">Hom. Il. 3.3</bibl>f.</note></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pyrrhus was brought over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> by an embassy of the Syracusans.  The Carthaginians had crossed over and were destroying the Greek cities, and had sat down to invest <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, the only one now remaining.  When Pyrrhus heard this from the envoys he abandoned <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> and the Italiots on the coast, and crossing into <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> forced the Carthaginians to raise the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.  In his self-conceit, although the Carthaginians, being Phoenicians of <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName> by ancient descent, were more experienced sea men than any other non-Greek people of that day, Pyrrhus was nevertheless encouraged to meet them in a naval battle, employing the Epeirots, the majority of whom, even after the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, knew no thing of the sea nor even as yet how to use salt. Witness the words of Homer in the <title>Odyssey</title>:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Nothing they know of ocean, and mix not salt</l><l>with their victuals.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

</div>

<div n="13" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Worsted on this occasion Pyrrhus put back with the remainder of his vessels to <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>. Here he met with a serious reverse, and his retirement, for he knew that the Romans would not let him depart without striking a blow, he contrived in the following manner.  On his return from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and his defeat, he first sent various dispatches to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and to Antigonus, asking some of the kings for troops, some for money, and Antigonus for both. When the envoys returned and their dispatches were delivered, he summoned those in authority, whether Epeirot or Tarentine, and without reading any of the dispatches declared that reinforcements would come.  A report spread quickly even to the Romans that Macedonians and Asiatic tribes also were crossing to the aid of Pyrrhus.  The Romans, on hearing this, made no move, but Pyrrhus on the approach of that very night crossed to the headlands of the mountains called Ceraunian.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the defeat in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> Pyrrhus gave his forces a rest and then declared war on Antigonus, his chief ground of complaint being the failure to send reinforcements to Italy.  Overpowering the native troops of Antigonus an his Gallic mercenaries he pursued them to the coast cities, and himself reduced upper <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and the Thessalians.  The extent of the fighting and the decisive character of the victory of Pyrrhus are shown best by the Celtic armour dedicated in the sanctuary of Itonian Athena between Pherae and <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName>, with this inscription on them:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Pyrrhus the Molossian hung these shields</l></quote></p></div>

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>being usually readier to do what came first to hand, he was prevented by Cleonymus. This Cleonymus, who persuaded Pyrrhus to abandon his Macedonian adventure and to go to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, was a Lacedaemonian who led an hostile army into the Lacedaemonian territory for a reason which I will relate after giving the descent of Cleonymus.  Pausanias, who was in command of the Greeks at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0479">479 B.C.</date></note>, was the father of Pleistoanax, he of Pausanias, and he of Cleombrotus, who was killed at Leuctra fighting against Epaminondas and the Thebans.  Cleombrotus was the father of Agesipolis and Cleomenes, and, Agesipolis dying without issue, Cleomenes ascended the throne.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Cleomenes had two sons, the elder being Acrotatus and the younger Cleonymus.  Now Acrotatus died first; and when afterwards Cleomenes died, a claim to the throne was put forward by Areus son of Acrotatus, and Cleonymus took steps to induce Pyrrhus to enter the country. Before the battle of Leuctra<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0371">371 B.C.</date></note> the Lacedaemonians had suffered no disaster, so that they even refused to admit that they had yet been worsted in a land battle.  For Leonidas, they said, had won the victory<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note>, but his followers were insufficient for the entire destruction of the Persians; the achievement of Demosthenes and the Athenians on the island of <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0425">425 B.C.</date></note> was no victory, but only a trick in war.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Their first reverse took place in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, and they afterwards suffered a severe defeat at the hands of Antipater and the Macedonians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0330">330 B.C.</date></note>.  Thirdly the war with Demetrius<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0295">295 B.C.</date></note> came as an unexpected misfortune to their land.  Invaded by Pyrrhus and seeing a hostile army for the fourth time, they arrayed themselves to meet it along with the Argives and Messenians who had come as their allies. Pyrrhus won the day, and came near to capturing <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> without further fighting, but desisted for a while after ravaging the land and carrying off plunder.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0272">272 B.C.</date></note> The citizens prepared for a siege, and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> even before this in the war with Demetrius had been fortified with deep trenches and strong stakes, and at the most vulnerable points with buildings as well.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Just about this time, while the Laconian war was dragging on, Antigonus, having recovered the Macedonian cities, hastened to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> being well aware that if Pyrrhus were to reduce <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and the greater part of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, he would not return to Epeirus but to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to make war there again.  When Antigonus was about to lead his army from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, Pyrrhus himself reached <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.  Victorious once more he dashed into the city along with the fugitives, and his formation not unnaturally was broken up.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the fighting was now taking place by sanctuaries and houses, and in the narrow lanes, between detached bodies in different parts of the town, Pyrrhus left by himself was wounded in the head.  It is said that his death<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0272">272 B.C.</date></note> was caused by a blow from a tile thrown by a woman. The Argives however declare that it was not a woman who killed him but Demeter in the likeness of a woman.  This is what the Argives themselves relate about his end, and Lyceas, the guide for the neighborhood, has written a poem which confirms the story. They have a sanctuary of Demeter, built at the command of the oracle, on the spot where Pyrrhus died, and in it Pyrrhus is buried.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I consider it remarkable that of those styled Aeacidae three met their end by similar heaven-sent means; if, as Homer says, Achilles was killed by Alexander, son of Priam, and by Apollo, if the Delphians were bidden by the Pythia to slay Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, and if the end of the son of Aeacides was such as the Argives say and Lyceas has described in his poem.  The account, how ever, given by Hieronymus the Cardian is different, for a man who associates with royalty cannot help being a partial historian.  If Philistus was justified in suppressing the most wicked deeds of Dionysius, because he expected his return to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, surely Hieronymus may be fully forgiven for writing to please Antigonus.</p></div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So ended the period of Epeirot ascendancy. When you have entered the Odeum at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> you meet, among other objects, a figure of Dionysus worth seeing.  Hard by is a spring called Enneacrunos (Nine Jets), embellished as you see it by Peisistratus. There are cisterns all over the city, but this is the only fountain.  Above the spring are two temples, one to Demeter and the Maid, while in that of Triptolemus is a statue of him.  The accounts given of Triptolemus I shall write, omitting from the story as much as relates to Deiope.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Greeks who dispute most the Athenian claim to antiquity and the gifts they say they have received from the gods are the Argives, just as among those who are not Greeks the Egyptians compete with the Phrygians. It is said, then, that when Demeter came to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> she was received by Pelasgus into his home, and that Chrysanthis, knowing about the rape of the Maid, related the story to her. Afterwards Trochilus, the priest of the mysteries, fled, they say, from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> because of the enmity of Agenor, came to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and married a woman of <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, by whom he had two children, Eubuleus and Triptolemus.  That is the account given by the Argives.  But the Athenians and those who with them. . . know that Triptolemus, son of Celeus, was the first to sow seed for cultivation.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Some extant verses of Musaeus, if indeed they are to be included among his works, say that Triptolemus was the son of Oceanus and Earth; while those ascribed to Orpheus (though in my opinion the received authorship is again incorrect) say that Eubuleus and Triptolemus were sons of Dysaules, and that because they gave Demeter information about her daughter the sowing of seed was her reward to them. But Choerilus, an Athenian, who wrote a play called Alope, says that Cercyon and Triptolemus were brothers, that their mother was the daughter of Amphictyon, while the father of Triptolemus was Rarus, of Cercyon, Poseidon.  After I had intended to go further into this story, and to describe the contents of the sanctuary at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, called the Eleusinium, I was stayed by a vision in a dream.  I shall therefore turn to those things it is lawful to write of to all men.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In front of this temple, where is also the statue of Triptolemus, is a bronze bull being led as it were to sacrifice, and there is a sitting figure of Epimenides of <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. c. <date when="-0600">600 B.C.</date></note>, who they say entered a cave in the country and slept.  And the sleep did not leave him before the fortieth year, and afterwards he wrote verses and purified <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and other cities.  But Thales who stayed the plague for the Lacedaemonians was not related to Epimenides in any way, and belonged to a different city.  The latter was from <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>, but Thales was from <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>, according to Polymnastus of Colophon, who com posed a poem about him for the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Still farther of is a temple to Glory, this too being a thank-offering for the victory over the Persians, who had landed at Marathon.  This is the victory of which I am of opinion the Athenians were proudest; while Aeschylus, who had won such renown for his poetry and for his share in the naval battles before <placeName key="perseus,Artemisium">Artemisium</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, recorded at the prospect of death nothing else, and merely wrote his name, his father's name, and the name of his city, and added that he had witnesses to his valor in the grove at Marathon and in the Persians who landed there.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Above the Cerameicus and the portico called the King's Portico is a temple of Hephaestus.  I was not surprised that by it stands a statue of Athena, be cause I knew the story about Erichthonius.  But when I saw that the statue of Athena had blue eyes I found out that the legend about them is Libyan.  For the Libyans have a saying that the Goddess is the daughter of Poseidon and Lake Tritonis, and for this reason has blue eyes like Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hard by is a sanctuary of the Heavenly Aphrodite; the first men to establish her cult were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians the Paphians of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and the Phoenicians who live at <placeName key="tgn,1099922">Ascalon</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7004540">Palestine</placeName>; the Phoenicians taught her worship to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>. Among the Athenians the cult was established by Aegeus, who thought that he was childless (he had, in fact, no children at the time) and that his sisters had suffered their misfortune because of the wrath of Heavenly Aphrodite.  The statue still extant is of Parian marble and is the work of Pheidias.  One of the Athenian parishes is that of the Athmoneis, who say that Porphyrion, an earlier king than Actaeus, founded their sanctuary of the Heavenly One.  But the traditions current among the Parishes often differ altogether from those of the city.</p></div>

When he was about to set forth from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> with Alexander, and was sacrificing at <placeName key="perseus,Pella">Pella</placeName> to Zeus, the wood that lay on the altar advanced of its own accord to the image and caught fire without the application of a light.  On the death of Alexander, Seleucus, in fear of Antigonus, who had arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, fled to Ptolemy, son of Lagus, and then returned again to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>.  On his return he overcame the army of Antigonus and killed Antigonus himself, afterwards capturing Demetrius, son of Antigonus, who had advanced with an army.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After these successes, which were shortly followed by the fall of Lysimachus, he entrusted to his son Antiochus all his empire in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and himself proceeded rapidly towards <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, having with him an army both of Greeks and of foreigners.  But Ptolemy, brother of Lysandra, had taken refuge with him from Lysimachus; this man, an adventurous character named for this reason the Thunderbolt, when the army of Seleucus had advanced as far as Lysimachea, assassinated Seleucus, allowed the kings to seize his wealth<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0281">281 B.C.</date></note>, and ruled over <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> until, being the first of the kings to my knowledge to dare to meet the Gauls in battle, he was killed by the foreigners.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0280">280 B.C.</date></note> The empire was recovered by Antigonus, son of Demetrius.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I am persuaded that Seleucus was the most righteous, and in particular the most religious of the kings.  Firstly, it was Seleucus who sent back to <placeName key="tgn,7002494">Branchidae</placeName> for the Milesians the bronze Apollo that had been carried by Xerxes to <placeName key="tgn,7002115">Ecbatana</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.

<div n="17" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the Athenian market-place among the objects not generally known is an altar to Mercy, of all divinities the most useful in the life of mortals and in the vicissitudes of fortune, but honored by the Athenians alone among the Greeks.  And they are conspicuous not only for their humanity but also for their devotion to religion.  They have an altar to Shamefastness, one to Rumour and one to Effort. It is quite obvious that those who excel in piety are correspondingly rewarded by good fortune.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the gymnasium not far from the market-place, called Ptolemy's from the founder, are stone Hermae well worth seeing and a likeness in bronze of Ptolemy. Here also is <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> the Libyan and Chrysippus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Stoic philosopher, <date from="-0280" to="-0207">280-207 B.C.</date></note> of <placeName key="perseus,Soli">Soli</placeName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hard by the gymnasium is a sanctuary of Theseus, where are pictures of Athenians fighting Amazons. This war they have also represented on the shield of their Athena and upon the pedestal of the Olympian Zeus.  In the sanctuary of Theseus is also a painting of the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapithae.  Theseus has already killed a Centaur, but elsewhere the fighting is still undecided.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The painting on the third wall is not intelligible to those unfamiliar with the traditions, partly through age and partly because Micon has not represented in the picture the whole of the legend.  When Minos was taking Theseus and the rest of the company of young folk to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> he fell in love with Periboea, and on meeting with determined opposition from Theseus, hurled insults at him and denied that he was a son of Poseidon, since he could not recover for him the signet-ring, which he happened to be wearing, if he threw it into the sea.  With these words Minos is said to have thrown the ring, but they say that Theseus came up from the sea with that ring and also with a gold crown that Amphitrite gave him.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The accounts of the end of Theseus are many and inconsistent.  They say he was kept a prisoner until Heracles restored him to the light of day, but the most plausible account I have heard is this.  Theseus invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName> to carry off the wife of the Thesprotian king, and in this way lost the greater part of his army, and both he and Peirithous (he too was taking part in the expedition, being eager for the marriage) were taken captive.  The Thesprotian king kept them prisoners at Cichyrus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the sights of <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName> are a sanctuary of Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> and an oak sacred to the god.  Near Cichyrus is a lake called Acherusia, and a river called <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.  There is also Cocytus, a most unlovely stream.  I believe it was because Homer had seen these places that he made bold to describe in his poems the regions of Hades, and gave to the rivers there the names of those in <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName>.  While Theseus was thus kept in bonds, the sons of Tyndareus marched against <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>, captured it and restored Menestheus to the kingdom.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now Menestheus took no account of the children of Theseus, who had secretly withdrawn to Elephenor in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, but he was aware that Theseus, if ever he returned from <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName>, would be a doughty antagonist, and so curried favour with his subjects that Theseus on re covering afterwards his liberty was expelled.  So Theseus set out to Deucalion in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>.  Being carried out of his course by winds to the island of Scyros he was treated with marked honor by the inhabitants, both for the fame of his family and for the reputation of his own achievements.  Accordingly Lycomedes contrived his death. His close was built at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> after the Persians landed at Marathon, when Cimon, son of Miltiades, ravaged Scyros, thus avenging Theseus' death, and carried his bones to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Above the sanctuary of the Dioscuri is a sacred enclosure of Aglaurus.  It was to Aglaurus and her sisters, Herse and Pandrosus, that they say Athena gave Erichthonius, whom she had hidden in a chest, forbidding them to pry curiously into what was entrusted to their charge. Pandrosus, they say, obeyed, but the other two (for they opened the chest) went mad when they saw Erichthonius, and threw themselves down the steepest part of the Acropolis.  Here it was that the Persians climbed and killed the Athenians who thought that they understood the oracle<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That the Athenians were to trust their “wooden walls,” i.e. their ships.</note> better than did Themistocles, and fortified the Acropolis with logs and stakes.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hard by is the Prytaneum (Town-hall), in which the laws of Solon are inscribed, and figures are placed of the goddesses Peace and Hestia (Hearth), while among the statues is Autolycus the pancratiast.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.35.6">Paus. 1.35.6</bibl>.</note> For the likenesses of Miltiades and Themistocles have had their titles changed to a Roman and a Thracian.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you descend from here to the lower part of the city, is a sanctuary of Serapis, whose worship the Athenians introduced from Ptolemy.  Of the Egyptian sanctuaries of Serapis the most famous is at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, the oldest at <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>.  Into this neither stranger nor priest may enter, until they bury Apis. Not far from the sanctuary of Serapis is the place where they say that Peirithous and Theseus made their pact before setting forth to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and afterwards to <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hard by is built a temple of Eileithyia, who they say came from the Hyperboreans to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and helped Leto in her labour; and from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> the name spread to other peoples.  The Delians sacrifice to Eileithyia and sing a hymn of <placeName key="tgn,1115310">Olen</placeName>.  But the Cretans suppose that Eileithyia was born at Auunisus in the Cnossian territory, and that Hera was her mother.  Only among the Athenians are the wooden figures of Eileithyia draped to the feet.  The women told me that two are Cretan, being offerings of Phaedra, and that the third, which is the oldest, Erysichthon brought from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before the entrance to the sanctuary of Olympian Zeus—Hadrian the Roman emperor dedicated the temple and the statue, one worth seeing, which in size exceeds all other statues save the colossi at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and is made of ivory and gold with an artistic skill which is remarkable when the size is taken into account—before the entrance, I say, stand statues of Hadrian, two of Thasian stone, two of Egyptian.  Before the pillars stand bronze statues which the Athenians call “colonies.”  The whole circumference of the precincts is about four stades, and they are full of statues; for every city has dedicated a likeness of the emperor Hadrian, and the Athenians have surpassed them in dedicating, behind the temple, the remarkable colossus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Within the precincts are antiquities: a bronze Zeus, a temple of Cronus and Rhea and an enclosure of Earth surnamed Olympian.  Here the floor opens to the width of a cubit, and they say that along this bed flowed off the water after the deluge that occurred in the time of Deucalion, and into it they cast every year wheat meal mixed with honey.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On a pillar is a statue of Isocrates, whose memory is remarkable for three things: his diligence in continuing to teach to the end of his ninety-eight years, his self-restraint in keeping aloof from politics and from interfering with public affairs, and his love of liberty in dying a voluntary death, distressed at the news of the battle at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0338">338 B.C.</date></note>.  There are also statues in Phrygian marble of Persians supporting a bronze tripod; both the figures and the tripod are worth seeing.  The ancient sanctuary of Olympian Zeus the Athenians say was built by Deucalion, and they cite as evidence that Deucalion lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> a grave which is not far from the present temple.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hadrian constructed other buildings also for the Athenians: a temple of Hera and Zeus Panellenios (Common to all Greeks), a sanctuary common to all the gods, and, most famous of all, a hundred pillars of Phrygian marble.  The walls too are constructed of the same material as the cloisters.  And there are rooms there adorned with a gilded roof and with alabaster stone, as well as with statues and paintings.  In them are kept books. There is also a gymnasium named after Hadrian; of this too the pillars are a hundred in number from the Libyan quarries.</p></div>

<div n="19" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Close to the temple of Olympian Zeus is a statue of the Pythian Apollo. There is further a sanctuary of Apollo surnamed Delphinius.  The story has it that when the temple was finished with the exception of the roof Theseus arrived in the city, a stranger as yet to everybody.  When he came to the temple of the Delphinian, wearing a tunic that reached to his feet and with his hair neatly plaited, those who were building the roof mockingly inquired what a marriageable virgin was doing wandering about by herself.  The only answer that Theseus made was to loose, it is said, the oxen from the cart hard by, and to throw them higher than the roof of the temple they were building.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Concerning the district called The Gardens, and the temple of Aphrodite, there is no story that is told by them, nor yet about the Aphrodite which stands near the temple.  Now the shape of it is square, like that of the Hermae, and the inscription declares that the Heavenly Aphrodite is the oldest of those called Fates.  But the statue of Aphrodite in the Gardens is the work of Alcamenes, and one of the most note worthy things in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also the place called Cynosarges, sacred to Heracles; the story of the white dog<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">“Cynosarges” may mean white dog. </note> may be known by reading the oracle. There are altars of Heracles and Hebe, who they think is the daughter of Zeus and wife to Heracles. An altar has been built to Alcmena and to Iolaus, who shared with Heracles most of his labours.  The Lyceum has its name from Lycus, the son of Pandion, but it was considered sacred to Apollo from the be ginning down to my time, and here was the god first named Lyceus. There is a legend that the Termilae also, to whom Lycus came when he fled from Aegeus, were called Lycii after him.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Behind the Lyceum is a monument of Nisus, who was killed while king of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> by Minos, and the Athenians carried him here and buried him.  About this Nisus there is a legend. His hair, they say, was red, and it was fated that he should die on its being cut off.  When the Cretans attacked the country, they captured the other cities of the Megarid by assault, but <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName>, in which Nisus had taken refuge, they beleaguered.  The story says how the daughter of Nisus, falling in love here with Minos, cut off her father's hair.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the legend.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The rivers that flow through Athenian territory are the Ilisus and its tributary the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Eridanus</placeName>, whose name is the same as that of the Celtic river.  This Ilisus is the river by which Oreithyia was playing when, according to the story, she was carried off by the North Wind.  With Oreithyia he lived in wedlock, and be cause of the tie between him and the Athenians he helped them by destroying most of the foreigners' warships. The Athenians hold that the Ilisus is sacred to other deities as well, and on its bank is an altar of the Ilisian Muses. The place too is pointed out where the Peloponnesians killed Codrus, son of Melanthus and king of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Across the Ilisus is a district called Agrae and a temple of Artemis Agrotera (the Huntress).  They say that Artemis first hunted here when she came from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, and for this reason the statue carries a bow.  A marvel to the eyes, though not so impressive to hear of, is a race-course of white marble, the size of which can best be estimated from the fact that beginning in a crescent on the heights above the Ilisus it descends in two straight lines to the river bank.  This was built by Herodes, an Athenian, and the greater part of the Pentelic quarry was exhausted in its construction.</p></div>

<div n="20" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Leading from the prytaneum is a road called Tripods.  The place takes its name from the shrines, large enough to hold the tripods which stand upon them, of bronze, but containing very remarkable works of art, including a Satyr, of which Praxiteles is said to have been very proud.  Phryne once asked of him the most beautiful of his works, and the story goes that lover-like he agreed to give it, but refused to say which he thought the most beautiful.  So a slave of Phryne rushed in saying that a fire had broken out in the studio of Praxiteles, and the greater number of his works were lost, though not all were destroyed.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Praxiteles at once started to rush through the door crying that his labour was all wasted if indeed the flames had caught his Satyr and his Love.  But Phryne bade him stay and be of good courage, for he had suffered no grievous loss, but had been trapped into confessing which were the most beautiful of his works.  So Phryne chose the statue of Love; while a Satyr is in the temple of Dionysus hard by, a boy holding out a cup.  The Love standing with him and the Dionysus were made by Thymilus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The oldest sanctuary of Dionysus is near the theater.  Within the precincts are two temples and two statues of Dionysus, the Eleuthereus (Deliverer) and the one Alcamenes made of ivory and gold. There are paintings here—Dionysus bringing Hephaestus up to heaven.  One of the Greek legends is that Hephaestus, when he was born, was thrown down by Hera.  In revenge he sent as a gift a golden chair with invisible fetters.  When Hera sat down she was held fast, and Hephaestus refused to listen to any other of the gods save Dionysus—in him he reposed the fullest trust—and after making him drunk Dionysus brought him to heaven.  Besides this picture there are also represented Pentheus and Lycurgus paying the penalty of their insolence to Dionysus, Ariadne asleep, Theseus putting out to sea, and Dionysus on his arrival to carry off Ariadne.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the sanctuary of Dionysus and the theater is a structure, which is said to be a copy of Xerxes' tent. It has been rebuilt, for the old building was burnt by the Roman general Sulla when he took <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0086">86 B.C.</date></note>. The cause of the war was this.  Mithridates was king over the foreigners around the Euxine.  Now the grounds on which he made war against the Romans, how he crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the cities he took by force of arms or made his friends, I must leave for those to find out who wish to know the history of Mithridates, and I shall confine my narrative to the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There was an Athenian, Aristion, whom Mithridates employed as his envoy to the Greek cities.  He induced the Athenians to join Mithridates rather than the Romans, although he did not induce all, but only the lower orders, and only the turbulent among them.  The respectable Athenians fled to the Romans of their own accord. In the engagement that ensued the Romans won a decisive victory; Aristion and the Athenians they drove in flight into the city, Archelaus and the foreigners into the Peiraeus.  This Archelaus was another general of Mithridates, whom earlier than this the Magnetes, who inhabit Sipylus, wounded when he raided their territory, killing most of the foreigners as well. So <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was invested.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Taxilus, a general of Mithridates, was at the time besieging Elatea in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, but on receiving the news he withdrew his troops towards <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.  Learning this, the Roman general entrusted the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to a portion of his army, and with the greater part of his forces advanced in person to meet Taxilus in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.  On the third day from this, news came to both the Roman armies; Sulla heard that the Athenian fortifications had been stormed, and the besieging force learnt that Taxilus had been defeated in battle near <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.  When Sulla returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> he imprisoned in the Cerameicus the Athenians who had opposed him, and one chosen by lot out of every ten he ordered to be led to execution.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Sulla abated nothing of his wrath against the Athenians, and so a few effected an escape to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and asked if the time were now come when it was fated for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> also to be made desolate, receiving from the Pythia the response about the wine skin.  Afterwards Sulla was smitten with the disease which I learn attacked Pherecydes the Syrian.  Although Sulla's treatment of the Athenian people was so savage as to be unworthy of a Roman, I do not think that this was the cause of his calamity, but rather the vengeance of the suppliants' Protector, for he had dragged Aristion from the sanctuary of Athena, where he had taken refuge, and killed him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such wise was <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> sorely afflicted by the war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but she flourished again when Hadrian was emperor.</p></div>

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the theater the Athenians have portrait statues of poets, both tragic and comic, but they are mostly of undistinguished persons.  With the exception of Menander no poet of comedy represented here won a reputation, but tragedy has two illustrious representatives, Euripides and Sophocles.  There is a legend that after the death of Sophocles the Lacedaemonians invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and their commander saw in a vision Dionysus, who bade him honor, with all the customary honors of the dead, the new Siren.  He interpreted the dream as referring to Sophocles and his poetry, and down to the present day men are wont to liken to a Siren whatever is charming in both poetry and prose.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The likeness of Aeschylus is, I think, much later than his death and than the painting which depicts the action at Marathon Aeschylus himself said that when a youth he slept while watching grapes in a field, and that Dionysus appeared and bade him write tragedy. When day came, in obedience to the vision, he made an attempt and hereafter found composing quite easy.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such were his words.  On the South wall, as it is called, of the Acropolis, which faces the theater, there is dedicated a gilded head of Medusa the Gorgon, and round it is wrought an aegis. At the top of the theater is a cave in the rocks under the Acropolis.  This also has a tripod over it, wherein are Apollo and Artemis slaying the children of Niobe. This Niobe I myself saw when I had gone up to Mount Sipylus.  When you are near it is a beetling crag, with not the slightest resemblance to a woman, mourning or otherwise; but if you go further away you will think you see a woman in tears, with head bowed down.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the way to the Athenian Acropolis from the theater is the tomb of Calos.  Daedalus murdered this Calos, who was his sister's son and a student of his craft, and therefore he fled to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>; afterwards he escaped to Cocalus in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.  The sanctuary of Asclepius is worth seeing both for its paintings and for the statues of the god and his children.  In it there is a spring, by which they say that Poseidon's son Halirrhothius deflowered Alcippe the daughter of Ares, who killed the ravisher and was the first to be put on his trial for the shedding of blood.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the votive offerings there is a Sauromatic breast plate.  On seeing this a man will say that no less than Greeks are foreigners skilled in the arts.  For the Sauromatae have no iron, neither mined by them selves nor yet imported.  They have, in fact, no dealings at all with the foreigners around them.  To meet this deficiency they have contrived inventions. In place of iron they use bone for their spear-blades, and cornel-wood for their bows and arrows, with bone points for the arrows.  They throw a lasso round any enemy they meet, and then turning round their horses upset the enemy caught in the lasso.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Their breastplates they make in the following fashion. Each man keeps many mares, since the land is not divided into private allotments, nor does it bear any thing except wild trees, as the people are nomads. These mares they not only use for war, but also sacrifice them to the local gods and eat them for food.  Their hoofs they collect, clean, split, and make from them as it were python scales.  Whoever has never seen a python must at least have seen a pine-cone still green.  He will not be mistaken if he liken the product from the hoof to the segments that are seen on the pine-cone.  These pieces they bore and stitch together with the sinews of horses and oxen, and then use them as breastplates that are as handsome and strong as those of the Greeks.  For they can withstand blows of missiles and those struck in close combat.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Linen breastplates are not so useful to fighters, for they let the iron pass through, if the blow be a violent one.  They aid hunters, how ever, for the teeth of lions or leopards break off in them.  You may see linen breastplates dedicated in other sanctuaries, notably in that at Gryneum, where there is a most beautiful grove of Apollo, with cultivated trees, and all those which, although they bear no fruit, are pleasing to smell or look upon.</p></div>

<div n="22" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the sanctuary of Asclepius, as you go by this way towards the Acropolis, there is a temple of Themis.  Before it is raised a sepulchral mound to Hippolytus.  The end of his life, they say, came from curses.  Everybody, even a foreigner who has learnt Greek, knows about the love of Phaedra and the wickedness the nurse dared commit to serve her. The Troezenians too have a grave of Hippolytus, and their legend about it is this.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Theseus was about to marry Phaedra, not wishing, should he have children, Hippolytus either to be their subject or to be king in their stead, sent him to Pittheus to be brought up and to be the future king of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>. Afterwards Pallas and his sons rebelled against Theseus.  After putting them to death he went to <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> for purification, and Phaedra first saw Hippolytus there.  Falling in love with him she contrived the plot for his death.  The Troezenians have a myrtle with every one of its leaves pierced; they say that it did not grow originally in this fashion, the holes being due to Phaedra's disgust with love and to the pin which she wore in her hair.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Theseus had united into one state the many Athenian parishes, he established the cults of Aphrodite Pandemos (Common) and of Persuasion.  The old statues no longer existed in my time, but those I saw were the work of no inferior artists.  There is also a sanctuary of Earth, Nurse of Youth, and of Demeter Chloe (Green).  You can learn all about their names by conversing with the priests.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is but one entry to the Acropolis. It affords no other, being precipitous throughout and having a strong wall.  The gateway has a roof of white marble, and down to the present day it is unrivalled for the beauty and size of its stones.  Now as to the statues of the horsemen, I cannot tell for certain whether they are the sons of Xenophon or whether they were made merely to beautify the place.  On the right of the gateway is a temple of Wingless Victory.  From this point the sea is visible, and here it was that, according to legend, Aegeus threw him self down to his death.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For the ship that carried the young people to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> began her voyage with black sails; but Theseus, who was sailing on an adventure against the bull of Minos, as it is called, had told his father beforehand that he would use white sails if he should sail back victorious over the bull.  But the loss of Ariadne made him forget the signal.  Then Aegeus, when from this eminence he saw the vessel borne by black sails, thinking that his son was dead, threw himself down to destruction.  There is at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> a sanctuary dedicated to him, and called the hero-shrine of Aegeus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the left of the gateway is a building with pictures.  Among those not effaced by time I found Diomedes taking the Athena from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and Odysseus in <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> taking away the bow of Philoctetes.  There in the pictures is Orestes killing Aegisthus, and Pylades killing the sons of Nauplius who had come to bring Aegisthus succor.  And there is Polyxena about to be sacrificed near the grave of Achilles.  Homer did well in passing by this barbarous act.  I think too that he showed poetic insight in making Achilles capture Scyros, differing entirely from those who say that Achilles lived in Scyros with the maidens, as Polygnotus has re presented in his picture.  He also painted Odysseus coming upon the women washing clothes with Nausicaa at the river, just like the description in Homer. There are other pictures, including a portrait of Alcibiades,</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and in the picture are emblems of the victory his horses won at <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>.  There is also Perseus journeying to Seriphos, and carrying to Polydectes the head of Medusa, the legend about whom I am unwilling to relate in my description of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.  Included among the paintings—I omit the boy carrying the water-jars and the wrestler of Timaenetus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An unknown painter.</note>—is Musaeus. I have read verse in which Musaeus receives from the North Wind the gift of flight, but, in my opinion, Onomacritus wrote them, and there are no certainly genuine works of Musaeus except a hymn to Demeter written for the Lycomidae.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Right at the very entrance to the Acropolis are a Hermes (called Hermes of the Gateway) and figures of Graces, which tradition says were sculptured by Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, who the Pythia testified was the wisest of men, a title she refused to Anacharsis, although he desired it and came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to win it.</p></div>

<div n="23" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the sayings of the Greeks is one that there were seven wise men.  Two of them were the despot of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> and Periander the son of Cypselus.  And yet Peisistratus and his son Hippias were more humane than Periander, wiser too in war fare and in statecraft, until, on account of the murder of Hipparchus, Hippias vented his passion against all and sundry, including a woman named Leaena (Lioness).</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>What I am about to say has never before been committed to writing, but is generally credited among the Athenians. When Hipparchus died, Hippias tortured Leaena to death, because he knew she was the mistress of Aristogeiton, and therefore could not possibly, he held, be in ignorance of the plot. As a recompense, when the tyranny of the Peisistratidae was at an end, the Athenians put up a bronze lioness in memory of the woman, which they say Callias dedicated and Calamis made.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hard by is a bronze statue of Diitrephes shot through by arrows.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0413">413 B.C.</date></note> Among the acts reported of this Diitrephes by the Athenians is his leading back home the Thracian mercenaries who arrived too late to take part in the expedition of Demosthenes against <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.  He also put into the Chalcidic Euripus, where the Boeotians had an inland town Mycalessus, marched up to this town from the coast and took it. Of the inhabitants the Thracians put to the sword not only the combatants but also the women and children.  I have evidence to bring.  All the Boeotian towns which the Thebans sacked were inhabited in my time, as the people escaped just before the capture; so if the foreigners had not exterminated the Mycalessians the survivors would have afterwards reoccupied the town.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I was greatly surprised to see the statue of Diitrephes pierced with arrows, because the only Greeks whose custom it is to use that weapon are the Cretans.  For the Opuntian Locrians, whom Homer represents as coming to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with bows and slings, we know were armed as heavy infantry by the time of the Persian wars.  Neither indeed did the Malians continue the practice of the bow; in fact, I believe that they did not know it before the time of Philoctetes, and gave it up soon after.  Near the statue of Diitrephes—I do not wish to write of the less distinguished portraits—are figures of gods; of Health, whom legend calls daughter of Asclepius, and of Athena, also surnamed Health.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a smallish stone, just large enough to serve as a seat to a little man.  On it legend says Silenus rested when Dionysus came to the land.  The oldest of the Satyrs they call Sileni.  Wishing to know better than most people who the Satyrs are I have inquired from many about this very point.  Euphemus the Carian said that on a voyage to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> he was driven out of his course by winds and was carried into the outer sea, beyond the course of seamen.  He affirmed that there were many uninhabited islands, while in others lived wild men. The sailors did not wish to put in at the latter,</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>because, having put in before, they had some experience of the inhabitants, but on this occasion they had no choice in the matter.  The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the inhabitants were red haired, and had upon their flanks tails not much smaller than those of horses. As soon as they caught sight of their visitors, they ran down to the ship with out uttering a cry and assaulted the women in the ship.  At last the sailors in fear cast a foreign woman on to the island.  Her the Satyrs outraged not only in the usual way, but also in a most shocking manner.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I remember looking at other things also on the Athenian Acropolis, a bronze boy holding the sprinkler, by Lycius son of Myron, and Myron's Perseus after beheading Medusa.  There is also a sanctuary of Brauronian Artemis; the image is the work of Praxiteles, but the goddess derives her name from the parish of <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName>.  The old wooden image is in <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName>, the Tauric Artemis as she is called.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is the horse called Wooden set up in bronze. That the work of Epeius was a contrivance to make a breach in the Trojan wall is known to everybody who does not attribute utter silliness to the Phrygians. But legend says of that horse that it contained the most valiant of the Greeks, and the design of the bronze figure fits in well with this story.  Menestheus and Teucer are peeping out of it, and so are the sons of Theseus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the statues that stand after the horse, the likeness of Epicharinus who practised the race in armour was made by Critius, while Oenobius performed a kind service for Thucydides the son of Olorus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The great historian of the Peloponnesian war.</note> He succeeded in getting a decree passed for the return of Thucydides to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who was treacherously murdered as he was returning, and there is a monument to him not far from the Melitid gate.</p></div>

About Phormio, however, I have a detail to add.  Quite one of the best men at Athens and distinguished for the fame of his ancestors he chanced to be heavily in debt.  So he withdrew to the parish Paeania and lived there until the Athenians elected him to command a naval expedition.  But he refused the office on the ground that before his debts were discharged he lacked the spirit to face his troops.  So the Athenians, who were absolutely determined to have Phormio as their commander, paid all his creditors.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="24" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this place is a statue of Athena striking Marsyas the Silenus for taking up the flutes that the goddess wished to be cast away for good.  Opposite these I have mentioned is represented the fight which legend says Theseus fought with the so-called Bull of Minos, whether this was a man or a beast of the nature he is said to have been in the accepted story.  For even in our time women have given birth to far more extraordinary monsters than this.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a statue of Phrixus the son of Athamas carried ashore to the Colchians by the ram. Having sacrificed the animal to some god or other, presumably to the one called by the Orchomenians Laphystius, he has cut out the thighs in accordance with Greek custom and is watching them as they burn. Next come other statues, including one of Heracles strangling the serpents as the legend describes. There is Athena too coming up out of the head of Zeus, and also a bull dedicated by the Council of the Areopagus on some occasion or other, about which, if one cared, one could make many conjectures.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have already stated that the Athenians are far more devoted to religion than other men.  They were the first to surname Athena Ergane (Worker); they were the first to set up limbless Hermae, and the temple of their goddess is shared by the Spirit of Good men.  Those who prefer artistic workmanship to mere antiquity may look at the following: a man wearing a helmet, by Cleoetas, whose nails the artist  has made of silver, and an image of Earth beseeching Zeus to rain upon her; perhaps the Athenians them selves needed showers, or may be all the Greeks had been plagued with a drought.  There also are set up Timotheus the son of <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> himself; Procne too, who has already made up her mind about the boy, and Itys as well—a group dedicated by Alcamenes.  Athena is represented displaying the olive plant, and Poseidon the wave,</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and there are statues of Zeus, one made by Leochares<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.1.3">Paus. 1.1.3</bibl>.</note> and one called Polieus (Urban), the customary mode of sacrificing to whom I will give without adding the traditional reason thereof. Upon the altar of Zeus Polieus they place barley mixed with wheat and leave it unguarded.  The ox, which they keep already prepared for sacrifice, goes to the altar and partakes of the grain.  One of the priests they call the ox-slayer, who kills the ox and then, casting aside the axe here according to the ritual runs away.  The others bring the axe to trial, as though they know not the man who did the deed.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Their ritual, then, is such as I have described. As you enter the temple that they name the Parthenon, all the sculptures you see on what is called the pediment refer to the birth of Athena, those on the rear pediment represent the contest for the land between Athena and Poseidon.  The statue itself is made of ivory and gold.  On the middle of her helmet is placed a likeness of the Sphinx—the tale of the Sphinx I will give when I come to my description of Boeotia—and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These griffins, Aristeas<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">An early Greek traveller and writer.</note> of <placeName key="tgn,7002598">Proconnesus</placeName> says in his poem, fight for the gold with the Arimaspi beyond the Issedones.  The gold which the griffins guard, he says, comes out of the earth; the Arimaspi are men all born with one eye; griffins are beasts like lions, but with the beak and wings of an eagle.  I will say no more about the griffins.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory.  She holds a statue of Victory about four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a serpent.  This serpent would be Erichthonius. On the pedestal is the birth of Pandora in relief. Hesiod and others have sung how this Pandora was the first woman; before Pandora was born there was as yet no womankind.  The only portrait statue I remember seeing here is one of the emperor Hadrian, and at the entrance one of Iphicrates,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A famous Athenian soldier.fl. <date when="-0390">390 B.C.</date></note> who accomplished many remarkable achievements.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Opposite the temple is a bronze Apollo, said to be the work of Pheidias.  They call it the Locust God, because once when locusts were devastating the land the god said that he would drive them from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.  That he did drive them away they know, but they do not say how.  I myself know that locusts have been destroyed three times in the past on Mount Sipylus, and not in the same way.  Once a gale arose and swept them away; on another occasion violent heat came on after rain and destroyed them; the third time sudden cold caught them and they died.</p></div>

Most of their cities Philip captured; with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> he nominally came to terms, but really imposed the severest penalties upon her, taking away the islands and putting an end to her maritime empire.  For a time the Athenians remained passive, during the reign of Philip and subsequently of Alexander.  But when on the death of Alexander the Macedonians chose Aridaeus to be their king, though the whole empire had been entrusted to Antipater, the Athenians now thought it intolerable if <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> should be for ever under the Macedonians, and themselves embarked on war besides inciting others to join them.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The cities that took part were, of the Peloponnesians, <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, the Eleans, the Phliasians, <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>; on the other side of the Corinthian isthmus the Locrians, the Phocians, the Thessalians, Carystus, the Acarnanians belonging to the Aetolian League.  The Boeotians, who occupied the <placeName key="tgn,4011135">Thebaid</placeName> territory now that there were no Thebans left to dwell there, in fear lest the Athenians should injure them by founding a settlement on the site of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, refused to join the alliance and lent all their forces to furthering the Macedonian cause.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Each city ranged under the alliance had its own general, but as commander-in-chief was chosen the Athenian Leosthenes, both because of the fame of his city and also because he had the reputation of being an experienced soldier.

All the Greeks that were serving as mercenaries in the armies of Darius and his satraps Alexander had wished to deport to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, but Leosthenes was too quick for him, and brought them by sea to <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.  On this occasion too his brilliant actions surpassed expectation, and his death produced a general despair which was chiefly responsible for the defeat.  A Macedonian garrison was set over the Athenians, and occupied first Munychia and afterwards Peiraeus also and the Long Walls.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0322">322 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the death of Antipater Olympias came over from Epeirus, killed Aridaeus, and for a time occupied the throne; but shortly afterwards she was besieged by Cassander, taken and delivered up to the people. Of the acts of Cassander when he came to the throne my narrative will deal only with such as concern the Athenians.  He seized the fort of Panactum in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and also <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, and established as tyrant in Athens Demetrius the son of Phanostratus, a man who had won a reputation for wisdom.  This tyrant was put down by Demetrius the son of Antigonus, a young man of strong Greek sympathies.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Cassander, inspired by a deep hatred of the Athenians, made a friend of Lachares, who up to now had been the popular champion, and induced him also to arrange a tyranny.  We know no tyrant who proved so cruel to man and so impious to the gods.  Although Demetrius the son of Antigonus was now at variance with the Athenian people, he notwithstanding deposed Lachares too from his tyranny, who, on the capture of the fortifications, escaped to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.  Lachares took golden shields from the Acropolis, and stripped even the statue of Athena of its removable ornament; he was accordingly suspected of being a very wealthy man,</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and was murdered by some men of <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName> for the sake of this wealth. After freeing the Athenians from tyrants Demetrius the son of Antigonus did not restore the Peiraeus to them immediately after the flight of Lachares, but subsequently overcame them and brought a garrison even into the upper city, fortifying the place called the Museum.  This is a hill right opposite the Acropolis within the old city boundaries, where legend says Musaeus used to sing, and, dying of old age, was buried.  Afterwards a monument also was erected here to a Syrian.  At the time to which I refer Demetrius fortified and held it.</p></div>

<div n="26" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was delivered from the Macedonians, and though all the Athenians fought memorably, Leocritus the son of Protarchus is said to have displayed most daring in the engagement.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This is the greatest achievement of Olympiodorus, not to mention his success in recovering Peiraeus and Munychia; and again, when the Macedonians were raiding <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> he collected a force of Eleusinians and defeated the invaders.  Still earlier than this, when Cassander had invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, Olympiodorus sailed to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> and induced the Aetolians to help.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a building called the Erechtheum. Before the entrance is an altar of Zeus the Most High, on which they never sacrifice a living creature but offer cakes, not being wont to use any wine either. Inside the entrance are altars, one to Poseidon, on which in obedience to an oracle they sacrifice also to Erechtheus, the second to the hero Butes, and the third to Hephaestus.  On the walls are paintings representing members of the clan Butadae; there is also inside—the building is double—sea-water in a cistern.  This is no great marvel, for other inland regions have similar wells, in particular <placeName key="perseus,Aphrodisias">Aphrodisias</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About the olive they have nothing to say except that it was testimony the goddess produced when she contended for their land. Legend also says that when the Persians fired <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the olive was burnt down, but on the very day it was burnt it grew again to the height of two cubits.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Adjoining the temple of Athena is the temple of Pandrosus, the only one of the sisters to be faithful to the trust.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I was much amazed at something which is not generally known, and so I will describe the circumstances.  Two maidens dwell not far from the temple of Athena Polias, called by the Athenians Bearers of the Sacred Offerings.  For a time they live with the goddess, but when the festival comes round they perform at night the following rites.  Having placed on their heads what the priestess of Athena gives them to carry—neither she who gives nor they who carry have any knowledge what it is—the maidens descend by the natural underground passage that goes across the adjacent precincts, within the city, of Aphrodite in the Gardens.  They leave down below what they carry and receive something else which they bring back covered up.  These maidens they henceforth let go free, and take up to the Acropolis others in their place.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the temple of Athena is .... an old woman about a cubit high, the inscription calling her a handmaid of Lysimache, and large bronze figures of men facing each other for a fight, one of whom they call Erechtheus, the other Eumolpus; and yet those Athenians who are acquainted with antiquity must surely know that this victim of Erechtheus was Immaradus, the son of Eumolpus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the pedestal are also statues of Theaenetus, who was seer to Tolmides, and of Tolmides himself, who when in command of the Athenian fleet inflicted severe damage upon the enemy, especially upon the Peloponnesians who dwell along the coast, burnt the dock-yards at <placeName key="tgn,7012041">Gythium</placeName> and captured <placeName key="perseus,Boeae">Boeae</placeName>, belonging to the “provincials,” and the island of <placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>.  He made a descent on Sicyonia, and, attacked by the citizens as he was laying waste the country, he put them to flight and chased them to the city.  Returning afterwards to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he conducted Athenian colonists to <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> and invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> with an army.  Having ravaged the greater part of the land and reduced <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> by a siege, he advanced into the territory of Haliartus,where he was killed in battle and all his army worsted.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0447">447 B.C.</date></note> Such was the history of Tolmides that I learnt.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are also old figures of Athena, no limbs of which indeed are missing, but they are rather black and too fragile to bear a blow. For they too were caught by the flames when the Athenians had gone on board their ships and the King captured the city emptied of its able-bodied inhabitants. There is also a boar-hunt (I do not know for certain whether it is the Calydonian boar) and Cycnus fighting with Heracles.  This Cycnus is said to have killed, among others, Lycus a Thracian, a prize having been proposed for the winner of the duel, but near the river Peneius he was himself killed by Heracles.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>One of the Troezenian legends about Theseus is the following.  When Heracles visited Pittheus at <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, he laid aside his lion's skin to eat his dinner, and there came in to see him some Troezenian children with Theseus, then about seven years of age. The story goes that when they saw the skin the other children ran away, but Theseus slipped out not much afraid, seized an axe from the servants and straightway attacked the skin in earnest, thinking it to be a lion.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This is the first Troezenian legend about Theseus. The next is that Aegeus placed boots and a sword under a rock as tokens for the child, and then sailed away to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; Theseus, when sixteen years old, pushed the rock away and departed, taking what Aegeus had deposited.  There is a representation of this legend on the Acropolis, everything in bronze except the rock.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Another deed of Theseus they have represented in an offering, and the story about it is as follows:—The land of the Cretans and especially that by the river Tethris was ravaged by a bull.  It would seem that in the days of old the beasts were much more formidable to men, for example the Nemean lion, the lion of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, the serpents in many parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and the boars of Calydon, Eryrmanthus and Crommyon in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, so that it was said that some were sent up by the earth, that others were sacred to the gods, while others had been let loose to punish mankind. And so the Cretans say that this bull was sent by Poseidon to their land because, although Minos was lord of the Greek Sea, he did not worship Poseidon more than any other god.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that this bull crossed from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, and came to be one of what are called the Twelve Labours of Heracles.  When he was let loose on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> plain he fled through the isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, into the land of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> as far as the Attic parish of Marathon, killing all he met, including Androgeos, son of Minos. Minos sailed against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with a fleet, not believing that the Athenians were innocent of the death of Androgeos, and sorely harassed them until it was agreed that he should take seven maidens and seven boys for the Minotaur that was said to dwell in the Labyrinth at <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>.  But the bull at Marathon Theseus is said to have driven afterwards to the Acropolis and to have sacrificed to the goddess; the offering commemorating this deed was dedicated by the parish of Marathon.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In addition to the works I have mentioned, there are two tithes dedicated by the Athenians after wars.

There are two other offerings, a statue of Pericles, the son of Xanthippus, and the best worth seeing of the works of Pheidias, the statue of Athena called Lemnian after those who dedicated it.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All the Acropolis is surrounded by a wall; a part was constructed by Cimon, son of Miltiades, but all the rest is said to have been built round it by the Pelasgians, who once lived under the Acropolis.  The builders, they say, were Agrolas and Hyperbius.  On inquiring who they were I could discover nothing except that they were Sicilians originally who emigrated to <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On descending, not to the lower city, but to just beneath the Gateway, you see a fountain and near it a sanctuary of Apollo in a cave.  It is here that Apollo is believed to have met Creusa, daughter of Erechtheus.... when the Persians had landed in Attica Philippides was sent to carry the tidings to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.  On his return he said that the Lacedacmonians had postponed their departure, because it was their custom not to go out to fight before the moon was full.  Philippides went on to say that near Mount Parthenius he had been met by Pan, who told him that he was friendly to the Athenians and would come to Marathon to fight for them.  This deity, then, has been honored for this announcement.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also the Hill of Ares, so named because Ares was the first to be tried here; my narrative has already told that he killed Halirrhothius, and what were his grounds for this act.  Afterwards, they say, Orestes was tried for killing his mother, and there is an altar to Athena Areia (Warlike), which he dedicated on being acquitted.  The unhewn stones on which stand the defendants and the prosecutors, they call the stone of Outrage and the stone of Ruthlessness.</p></div>

There are images of Pluto, Hermes, and Earth, by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the Hill of Ares; sacrifices are also offered on other occasions by both citizens and aliens.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Within the precincts is a monument to Oedipus, whose bones, after diligent inquiry, I found were brought from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Athenians have other law courts as well, which are not so famous.  We have the Parabystum (Thrust aside) and the Triangle; the former is in an obscure part of the city, and in it the most trivial cases are tried; the latter is named from its shape. The names of Green Court and Red Court, due to their colors, have lasted down to the present day.  The largest court, to which the greatest numbers come, is called Heliaea.  One of the other courts that deal with bloodshed is called “At Palladium,” into which are brought cases of involuntary homicide.  All are agreed that Demophon was the first to be tried there, but as to the nature of the charge accounts differ.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is reported that after the capture of Troy Diomedes was returning home with his fleet when night overtook them as in their voyage they were off Phalerum.  The Argives landed, under the impression that it was hostile territory, the darkness preventing them from seeing that it was <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. Thereupon they say that Demophon, he too being unaware of the facts and ignorant that those who had landed were Argives, attacked them and, having killed a number of them, went off with the Palladium. An Athenian, however, not seeing before him in the dark, was knocked over by the horse of Demophon, trampled upon and killed.  Whereupon Demophon was brought to trial, some say by the relatives of the man who was trampled upon, others say by the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> commonwealth.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At Delphinium are tried those who claim that they have committed justifiable homicide, the plea put forward by Theseus when he was acquitted, after having killed Pallas, who had risen in revolt against him, and his sons.  Before Theseus was acquitted it was the established custom among all men for the shedder of blood to go into exile, or, if he remained, to be put to a similar death. The Court in the Prytaneum, as it is called, where they try iron and all similar inanimate things, had its origin, I believe, in the following incident.  It was when Erechtheus was king of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> that the ox-slayer first killed an ox at the altar of Zeus Polieus.  Leaving the axe where it lay he went out of the land into exile, and the axe was forthwith tried and acquitted, and the trial has been repeated year by year down to the present.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Furthermore, it is also said that inanimate objects have on occasion of their own accord inflicted righteous retribution upon men, of this the scimitar of Cambyses affords the best and most famous instance.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hdt. 3.64">Hdt. 3.64</bibl>.</note> Near the sea at the Peiraeus is Phreattys.  Here it is that men in exile, when a further charge has been brought against them in their absence, make their defense on a ship while the judges listen on land.  The legend is that Teucer first defended himself in this way before Telamon, urging that he was guiltless in the matter of the death of Ajax. Let this account suffice for those who are interested to learn about the law courts.</p></div>

<div n="29" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the Hill of Ares is shown a ship built for the procession of the Panathenaea.  This ship, I suppose, has been surpassed in size by others, but I know of no builder who has beaten the vessel at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, with its nine banks of oars below the deck.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Outside the city, too, in the parishes and on the roads, the Athenians have sanctuaries of the gods, and graves of heroes and of men.  The nearest is the Academy, once the property of a private individual, but in my time a gymnasium.  As you go down to it you come to a precinct of Artemis, and wooden images of Ariste (Best) and <placeName key="tgn,7002507">Calliste</placeName> (Fairest). In my opinion, which is supported by the poems of Pamphos, these are surnames of Artemis.  There is another account of them, which I know but shall omit.  Then there is a small temple, into which every year on fixed days they carry the image of Dionysus Eleuthereus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such are their sanctuaries here, and of the graves the first is that of Thrasybulus son of Lycus, in all respects the greatest of all famous Athenians, whether they lived before him or after him.  The greater number of his achievements I shall pass by, but the following facts will suffice to bear out my assertion.  He put down what is known as the tyranny of the Thirty<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0403">403 B.C.</date></note>, setting out from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with a force amounting at first to sixty men; he also persuaded the Athenians, who were torn by factions, to be reconciled, and to abide by their compact.  His is the first grave, and after it come those of Pericles, Chabrias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Died <date when="-0357">357 B.C.</date></note> and Phormio.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A famous Athenian admiral who fought well in the early part of the Peloponnesian War.</note></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a monument for all the Athenians whose fate it has been to fall in battle, whether at sea or on land, except such of them as fought at Marathon.  These, for their valor, have their graves on the field of battle, but the others lie along the road to the Academy, and on their graves stand slabs bearing the name and parish of each.  First were buried those who in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, after a victorious advance as far as <placeName key="perseus,Drabescus">Drabescus</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0465">465 B.C.</date></note>, were unexpectedly attacked by the Edonians and slaughtered.  There is also a legend that they were struck by lightning.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the generals were Leagrus, to whom was entrusted chief command of the army, and Sophanes of Decelea, who killed when he came to the help of the Aeginetans Eurybates the Argive, who won the prize in the pentathlon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A group of five contests: leaping, foot-racing, throwing the quoit, throwing the spear, wrestling.</note> at the Nemean games.  This was the third expedition which the Athenians dispatched out of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.  For against Priam and the Trojans war was made with one accord by all the Greeks; but by them selves the Athenians sent armies, first with Iolaus to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, secondly to what is now <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, and thirdly on the present occasion to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before the monument is a slab on which are horsemen fighting. Their names are Melanopus and Macartatus, who met their death fighting against the Lacedaemonians and Boeotians on the borders of Eleon and <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>. There is also a grave of Thessalian horsemen who, by reason of an old alliance, came when the Peloponnesians with Archidamus invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> with an army for the first time<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0431">431 B.C.</date></note>, and hard by that of Cretan bowmen.

There is also the grave of the Athenians who fought against the Aeginetans before the Persian invasion.  It was surely a just decree even for a democracy when the Athenians actually allowed slaves a public funeral, and to have their names inscribed on a slab, which declares that in the war they proved good men and true to their masters.  There are also monuments of other men, their fields of battle lying in various regions.  Here lie the most renowned of those who went against <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0349">349 B.C.</date></note>, and Melesander who sailed with a fleet along the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName> into upper <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0430">430 B.C.</date></note>;</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>also those who died in the war with Cassander, and the Argives who once fought as the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before the entrance to the Academy is an altar to Love, with an inscription that Charmus was the first Athenian to dedicate an altar to that god. The altar within the city called the altar of Anteros (Love Avenged) they say was dedicated by resident aliens, because the Athenian Meles, spurning the love of Timagoras, a resident alien, bade him ascend to the highest point of the rock and cast himself down. Now Timagoras took no account of his life, and was ready to gratify the youth in any of his requests, so he went and cast himself down.  When Meles saw that Timagoras was dead, he suffered such pangs of remorse that he threw himself from the same rock and so died.  From this time the resident aliens worshipped as Anteros the avenging spirit of Timagoras.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the Academy is an altar to Prometheus, and from it they run to the city carrying burning torches.  The contest is while running to keep the torch still alight; if the torch of the first runner goes out, he has no longer any claim to victory, but the second runner has.  If his torch also goes out, then the third man is the victor.  If all the torches go out, no one is left to be winner. There is an altar to the Muses, and another to Hermes, and one within to Athena, and they have built one to Heracles.  There is also an olive tree, accounted to be the second that appeared.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not far from the Academy is the monument of Plato, to whom heaven foretold that he would be the prince of philosophers.  The manner of the foretelling was this.  On the night before Plato was to become his pupil Socrates in a dream saw a swan fly into his bosom.  Now the swan is a bird with a reputation for music, because, they say, a musician of the name of Swan became king of the Ligyes on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Eridanus</placeName> beyond the Celtic territory, and after his death by the will of Apollo he was changed into the bird.  I am ready to believe that a musician became king of the Ligyes, but I cannot believe that a bird grew out of a man.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In this part of the country is seen the tower of Timon, the only man to see that there is no way to be happy except to shun other men. There is also pointed out a place called the Hill of Horses, the first point in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, they say, that Oedipus reached—this account too differs from that given by Homer, but it is nevertheless current tradition—and an altar to Poseidon, Horse God, and to Athena, Horse Goddess, and a chapel to the heroes Peirithous and Theseus, Oedipus and Adrastus. The grove and temple of Poseidon were burnt by Antigonus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.1.1">Paus. 1.1.1</bibl>.</note> when he invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, who at other times also ravaged the land of the Athenians.</p></div>

<div n="31" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The small parishes of Attica, which were founded severally as chance would have it, presented the following noteworthy features.  At Alimus is a sanctuary of Demeter Lawgiver and of the Maid, and at <placeName key="perseus,Zoster">Zoster</placeName> (Girdle) on the coast is an altar to Athena, as well as to Apollo, to Artemis and to Leto.  The story is that Leto did not give birth to her children here, but loosened her girdle with a view to her delivery, and the place received its name from this incident.  Prospalta has also a sanctuary of the Maid and Demeter, and Anagyrus a sanctuary of the Mother of the gods.  At Cephale the chief cult is that of the Dioscuri, for the in habitants call them the Great gods.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At Prasiae is a temple of Apollo.  Hither they say are sent the first-fruits of the Hyperboreans, and the Hyperboreans are said to hand them over to the Arimaspi, the Arimaspi to the Issedones, from these the Scythians bring them to Sinope, thence they are carried by Greeks to Prasiae, and the Athenians take them to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. The first-fruits are hidden in wheat straw, and they are known of none.  There is at Prasiae a monument to Erysichthon, who died on the voyage home from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, after the sacred mission thither.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>How Amphictyon banished Cranaus, his kinsman by marriage and king of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I have already related. They say that fleeing with his supporters to the parish of Lamptrae he died and was buried there, and at the present day there is a monument to Cranaus at Lamptrae.  At Potami in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> is also the grave of Ion the son of Xuthus—for he too dwelt among the Athenians and was their commander-in-chief in the war with <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the legend.  <placeName key="tgn,7012055">Phlya</placeName> and Myrrhinus have altars of Apollo Dionysodotus, Artemis Light-bearer, Dionysus Flower-god, the Ismenian nymphs and Earth, whom they name the Great goddess; a second temple contains altars of Demeter Anesidora (Sender-up of Gifts), Zeus Ctesius (God of Gain), Tithrone Athena, the Maid First-born and the goddesses styled August.  The wooden image at Myrrhinus is of Colaenis.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><placeName key="perseus,Athmonia">Athmonia</placeName> worships Artemis Amarysia. On inquiry I discovered that the guides knew nothing about these deities, so I give my own conjecture. Amarynthus is a town in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, the inhabitants of which worship Amarysia, while the festival of Amarysia which the Athenians celebrate is no less splendid than the Euboean.  The name of the goddess, I think, came to <placeName key="perseus,Athmonia">Athmonia</placeName> in this fashion and the Colaenis in Myrrhinus is called after Colaenus.  I have already written that many of the inhabitants of the parishes say that they were ruled by kings even before the reign of Cecrops.  Now Colaenus, say the Myrrhinusians, is the name of a man who ruled before Cecrops became king.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a parish called Acharnae, where they worship Apollo Agyieus (God of Streets) and Heracles, and there is an altar of Athena Health.  And they call upon the name of Athena Horse-goddess and Dionysus Singer and Dionysus Ivy, saying that the plant ivy first appeared there.</p></div>

<div n="32" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Attic mountains are Pentelicus, where there are quarries, Parnes, where there is hunting of wild boars and of bears, and <placeName key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</placeName>, which grows the most suitable pasture for bees, except that of the Alazones.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A people of S. Russia.</note> For these people have actually bees ranging free, tamely following the other creatures when they go to pasture.  These bees are not kept shut up in hives, and they work in any part of the land they happen to visit.  They produce a solid mass from which you cannot separate either wax or honey.  Such then is its nature.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Athenians have also statues of gods on their mountains.  On Pentelicus is a statue of Athena, on <placeName key="tgn,7010826">Hymettus</placeName> one of Zeus Hymettius.  There are altars both of Zeus Rain-god and of Apollo Foreseer.  On Parnes is a bronze Zeus Parnethius, and an altar to Zeus Semaleus (Sign-giving).  There is on Parnes another altar, and on it they make sacrifice, calling Zeus sometimes Rain-god, sometimes Averter of Ills. Anchesmus is a mountain of no great size, with an image of Zeus Anchesmius.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before turning to a description of the islands, I must again proceed with my account of the parishes. There is a parish called Marathon, equally distant from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and Carystus in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>.  It was at this point<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> that the foreigners landed, were defeated in battle, and lost some of their vessels as they were putting off from the land.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0490">490 B.C.</date></note> On the plain is the grave of the Athenians, and upon it are slabs giving the names of the killed according to their tribes; and there is another grave for the Boeotian Plataeans and for the slaves, for slaves fought then for the first time by the side of their masters.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>here is also a separate monument to one man, Miltiades, the son of Cimon, although his end came later, after he had failed to take <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> and for this reason had been brought to trial by the Athenians. At Marathon every night you can hear horses neighing and men fighting.  No one who has expressly set himself to behold this vision has ever got any good from it, but the spirits are not wroth with such as in ignorance chance to be spectators.  The Marathonians worship both those who died in the fighting, calling them heroes, and secondly Marathon, from whom the parish derives its name, and then Heracles, saying that they were the first among the Greeks to acknowledge him as a god.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus (He of the Plough-tail) as a hero.  A trophy too of white marble has been erected.  Although the Athenians assert that they buried the Persians, because in every case the divine law applies that a corpse should be laid under the earth, yet I could find no grave. There was neither mound nor other trace to be seen, as the dead were carried to a trench and thrown in anyhow.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In Marathon is a spring called Macaria with the following legend.  When Heracles left <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>, fleeing from Eurystheus, he went to live with his friend Ceyx, who was king of <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>.  But when Heracles departed this life Eurystheus demanded his children; whereupon the king of <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName> sent them to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, saying that he was weak but Theseus had power enough to succor them.  The arrival of the children as suppliants caused for the first time war between Peloponnesians and Athenians, Theseus refusing to give up the refugees at the demand of Eurystheus.  The story says that an oracle was given the Athenians that one of the children of Heracles must die a voluntary death, or else victory could not be theirs.  Thereupon Macaria, daughter of Deianeira and Heracles, slew herself and gave to the Athenians victory in the war and to the spring her own name.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is at Marathon a lake which for the most part is marshy.  Into this ignorance of the roads made the foreigners fall in their flight, and it is said that this accident was the cause of their great losses.  Above the lake are the stone stables of Artaphernes' horses, and marks of his tent on the rocks.  Out of the lake flows a river, affording near the lake itself water suitable for cattle, but near its mouth it becomes salt and full of sea fish.  A little beyond the plain is the Hill of Pan and a remarkable Cave of Pan.  The entrance to it is narrow, but farther in are chambers and baths and the so-called “Pan's herd of goats,” which are rocks shaped in most respects like to goats.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="33" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At some distance from Marathon is <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName>, where, according to the legend, Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, landed with the image of Artemis when she fled from the Tauri; leaving the image there she came to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> also and afterwards to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.  There is indeed an old wooden image of Artemis here, but who in my opinion have the one taken from the foreigners I will set forth in another place.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About sixty stades from Marathon as you go along the road by the sea to Oropus stands Rhamnus. The dwelling houses are on the coast, but a little way inland is a sanctuary of Nemesis, the most implacable deity to men of violence.  It is thought that the wrath of this goddess fell also upon the foreigners who landed at Marathon.  For thinking in their pride that nothing stood in the way of their taking <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, they were bringing a piece of Parian marble to make a trophy, convinced that their task was already finished.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of this marble Pheidias made a statue of Nemesis, and on the head of the goddess is a crown with deer and small images of Victory.  In her left hand she holds an apple branch, in her right hand a cup on which are wrought Aethiopians.  As to the Aethiopians, I could hazard no guess myself, nor could I accept the statement of those who are convinced that the Aethiopians have been carved upon the cup be cause of the river Ocean.  For the Aethiopians, they say, dwell near it, and Ocean is the father of Nemesis.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is not the river Ocean, but the farthest part of the sea navigated by man, near which dwell the Iberians and the Celts, and Ocean surrounds the island of <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>.  But of the Aethiopians beyond <placeName key="tgn,7001112">Syene</placeName>, those who live farthest in the direction of the <placeName key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName> are the Ichthyophagi (Fish-eaters), and the gulf round which they live is called after them. The most righteous of them inhabit the city <placeName key="tgn,7000856">Meroe</placeName> and what is called the Aethiopian plain.  These are they who show the Table of the Sun,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A meadow near the city of the Aethiopians, in which they dined.</note> and they have neither sea nor river except the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are other Aethiopians who are neighbours of the Mauri and extend as far as the Nasamones.  For the Nasamones, whom Herodotus calls the Atlantes, and those who profess to know the measurements of the earth name the Lixitae, are the Libyans who live the farthest close to Mount Atlas, and they do not till the ground at all, but live on wild vines.  But neither these Aethiopians nor yet the Nasamones have any river.  For the water near Atlas, which provides a beginning to three streams, does not make any of the streams a river, as the sand swallows it all up at once.  So the Aethiopians dwell near no river Ocean.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The water from Atlas is muddy,and near the source were crocodiles of not less than two cubits, which when the men approached dashed down into the spring. The thought has occurred to many that it is the reappearance of this water out of the sand which gives the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. Mount Atlas is so high that its peaks are said to touch heaven, but is inaccessible because of the water and the presence everywhere of trees.  Its region indeed near the Nasamones is known, but we know of nobody yet who has sailed along the parts facing the sea. I must now resume.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Neither this nor any other ancient statue of Nemesis has wings, for not even the holiest wooden images of the Smyrnaeans have them, but later artists, convinced that the goddess manifests herself most as a consequence of love, give wings to Nemesis as they do to Love.  I will now go onto describe what is figured on the pedestal of the statue, having made this preface for the sake of clearness. The Greeks say that Nemesis was the mother of Helen, while Leda suckled and nursed her.  The father of Helen the Greeks like everybody else hold to be not Tyndareus but Zeus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Having heard this legend Pheidias has represented Helen as being led to Nemesis by Leda, and he has represented Tyndareus and his children with a man Hippeus by name standing by with a horse.  There are Agamemnon and Menelaus and Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles and first husband of <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName>, the daughter of Helen.  Orestes was passed over because of his crime against his mother, yet <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName> stayed by his side in everything and bore him a child.  Next upon the pedestal is one called Epochus and another youth; the only thing I heard about them was that they were brothers of Oenoe, from whom the parish has its name.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="34" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The land of Oropus, between <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and the land of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, which originally belonged to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, in our time belongs to the Athenians, who always fought for it but never won secure pos session until Philip gave it to them after taking <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.  The city is on the coast and affords nothing remarkable to record.  About twelve stades from the city is a sanctuary of Amphiaraus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Legend says that when Amphiaraus was exiled from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> the earth opened and swallowed both him and his chariot. Only they say that the incident did not happen here, the place called the Chariot being on the road from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>.  The divinity of Amphiaraus was first established among the Oropians, from whom afterwards all the Greeks received the cult.  I can enumerate other men also born at this time who are worshipped among the Greeks as gods; some even have cities dedicated to them, such as Eleus in Chersonnesus dedicated to Protesilaus, and <placeName key="tgn,7011790">Lebadea</placeName> of the Boeotians dedicated to Trophonius.  The Oropians have both a temple and a white marble statue of Amphiaraus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The altar shows parts. One part is to Heracles, Zeus, and Apollo Healer, another is given up to heroes and to wives of heroes, the third is to Hestia and Hermes and Amphiaraus and the children of Amphilochus. But Alcmaeon, because of his treatment of Eriphyle, is honored neither in the temple of Amphiaraus nor yet with Amphilochus. The fourth portion of the altar is to Aphrodite and Panacea, and further to Iaso, Health and Athena Healer.  The fifth is dedicated to the nymphs and to Pan, and to the rivers Achelous and Cephisus. The Athenians too have an altar to Amphilochus in the city, and there is at <placeName key="tgn,7002594">Mallus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> an oracle of his which is the most trustworthy of my day.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Oropians have near the temple a spring, which they call the Spring of Amphiaraus; they neither sacrifice into it nor are wont to use it for purifications or for lustral water.  But when a man has been cured of a disease through a response the custom is to throw silver and coined gold into the spring, for by this way they say that Amphiaraus rose up after he had become a god.  Iophon the Cnossian, a guide, produced responses in hexameter verse, saying that Amphiaraus gave them to the Argives who were sent against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.  These verses unrestrainedly appealed to popular taste.  Except those whom they say Apollo inspired of old none of the seers uttered oracles, but they were good at explaining dreams and interpreting the flights of birds and the entrails of victims.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>My opinion is that Amphiaraus devoted him self most to the exposition of dreams.  It is manifest that, when his divinity was established, it was a dream oracle that he set up.  One who has come to consult Amphiaraus is wont first to purify himself. The mode of purification is to sacrifice to the god, and they sacrifice not only to him but also to all those whose names are on the altar.  And when all these things have been first done, they sacrifice a ram, and, spreading the skin under them, go to sleep and await enlightenment in a dream.</p></div>

<div n="35" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are islands not far from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and for this reason the name of the island is Helene.  <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> lies over against <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and stretches as far as the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.  It is said that the first to give this name to the island was Cychreus, who called it after his mother <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, the daughter of Asopus, and afterwards it was colonized by the Aeginetans with Telamon.  Philaeus, the son of Eurysaces, the son of Ajax, is said to have handed the island over to the Athenians, having been made an Athenian by them.  Many years afterwards the Athenians drove out all the Salaminians, having discovered that they had been guilty of treachery in the war with Cassander<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0318">318 B.C.</date></note>, and mainly of set purpose had surrendered to the Macedonians.  They sentenced to death Aeschetades, who on this occasion had been elected general for <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, and they swore never to forget the treachery of the Salaminians.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are still the remains of a market-place, a temple of Ajax and his statue in ebony.  Even at the present day the Athenians pay honors to Ajax himself and to Eurysaces, for there is an altar of Eurysaces also at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  In <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> is shown a stone not far from the harbor, on which they say that Telamon sat when he gazed at the ship in which his children were sailing away to <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> to take part in the joint expedition of the Greeks.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those who dwell about <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> say that it was when Ajax died that the flower first appeared in their country.  It is white and tinged with red, both flower and leaves being smaller than those of the lily; there are letters on it like to those on the iris.  About the judgment concerning the armour I heard a story of the Aeolians who afterwards settled at <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, to the effect that when Odysseus suffered shipwreck the armour was cast ashore near the grave of Ajax. As to the hero's size, a Mysian was my informant.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He said that the sea flooded the side of the grave facing the beach and made it easy a enter the tomb, and he bade me form an estimate of the size of the corpse in the following way.  The bones on his knees, called by doctors the knee-pan, were in the case of Ajax as big as the quoit of a boy in the pentathlon.  I saw nothing to wonder at in the stature of those Celts who live farthest of on the borders of the land which is uninhabited because of the cold; these people, the Cabares, are no bigger than Egyptian corpses.  But I will relate all that appeared to me worth seeing.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For the Magnesians on the Lethaeus, Protophanes, one of the citizens, won at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> in one day victories in the pancration<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Boxing and wrestling combined.</note> and in wrestling.  Into the grave of this man robbers entered, thinking to gain some advantage, and after the robbers people came in to see the corpse, which had ribs not separated but joined together from the shoulders to the smallest ribs, those called by doctors bastard. Before the city of the Milesians is an island called <placeName key="tgn,4006029">Lade</placeName>, and from it certain islets are detached. One of these they call the islet of Asterius, and say that Asterius was buried in it, and that Asterius was the son of Anax, and Anax the son of Earth.  Now the corpse is not less than ten cubits.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But what really caused me surprise is this.  There is a small city of upper <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> called The Doors of Temenus. There a crest broke away in a storm, and there appeared bones the shape of which led one to suppose that they were human, but from their size one would never have thought it.  At once the story spread among the multitude that it was the corpse of Geryon, the son of Chrysaor, and that the seat also was his.  For there is a man's seat carved on a rocky spur of the mountain.  And a torrent they called the river Ocean, and they said that men ploughing met with the horns of cattle, for the story is that Geryon reared excellent cows.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And when I criticized the account and pointed out to them that Geryon is at Gadeira, where there is, not his tomb, but a tree showing different shapes, the guides of the Lydians related the true story, that the corpse is that of Hyllus, a son of Earth, from whom the river is named.  They also said that Heracles from his sojourning with Omphale called his son Hyllus after the river.</p></div>

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is a sanctuary in which are set statues of Demeter, her daughter, Athena, and Apollo.  At the first it was built in honor of Apollo only.

<div n="38" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The streams called Rheiti are rivers only in so far as they are currents, for their water is sea water.  It is a reasonable belief that they flow beneath the ground from the Euripus of the Chalcidians, and fall into a sea of a lower level.  They are said to be sacred to the Maid and to Demeter, and only the priests of these goddesses are permitted to catch the fish in them.  Anciently, I learn, these streams were the boundaries between the land of the Eleusinians and that of the other Athenians,</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and the first to dwell on the other side of the Rheiti was Crocon, where at the present day is what is called the palace of Crocon.  This Crocon the Athenians say married Saesara, daughter of Celeus.  Not all of them say this, but only those who belong to the parish of Scambonidae.  I could not find the grave of Crocon, but Eleusinians and Athenians agreed in identifying the tomb of Eumolpus.  This Eumolpus they say came from <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, being the son of Poseidon and Chione.  Chione they say was the daughter of the wind Boreas and of Oreithyia.  Homer says nothing about the family of Eumolpus, but in his poems styles him “manly.”</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Eleusinians fought with the Athenians, Erechtheus, king of the Athenians, was killed, as was also Immaradus, son of Eumolpus.  These were the terms on which they concluded the war: the Eleusinians were to have in dependent control of the mysteries, but in all things else were to be subject to the Athenians.  The ministers of the Two Goddesses were Eumolpus and the daughters of Celeus, whom Pamphos and Homer agree in naming Diogenia, Pammerope, and the third Saesara.  Eumolpus was survived by Ceryx, the younger of his sons whom the Ceryces themselves say was a son of Aglaurus, daughter of Cecrops, and of Hermes, not of Eumolpus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also a shrine of the hero Hippothoon, after whom the tribe is named, and hard by one of Zarex.  The latter they say learned music from Apollo, but my opinion is that he was a Lacedaemonian who came as a stranger to the land, and that after him is named <placeName key="perseus,Zarax">Zarax</placeName>, a town in the Laconian territory near the sea.  If there is a native Athenian hero called Zarex, I have nothing to say concerning him.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> flows a Cephisus which is more violent than the Cephisus I mentioned above, and by the side of it is the place they call Erineus, saying that Pluto descended there to the lower world after carrying off the Maid. Near this Cephisus Theseus killed a brigand named Polypemon and surnamed Procrustes.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Eleusinians have a temple of Triptolemus, of Artemis of the Portal, and of Poseidon Father, and a well called Callichorum (Lovely dance), where first the women of the Eleusinians danced and sang in praise of the goddess. They say that the plain called Rharium was the first to be sown and the first to grow crops, and for this reason it is the custom to use sacrificial barley and to make cakes for the sacrifices from its produce. Here there is shown a threshing-floor called that of Triptolemus and an altar.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>My dream forbade the description of the things within the wall of the sanctuary, and the uninitiated are of course not permitted to learn that which they are prevented from seeing. The hero <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, after whom the city is named, some assert to be a son of Hermes and of Daeira, daughter of Ocean; there are poets, however, who have made Ogygus father of <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.  Ancient legends, deprived of the help of poetry, have given rise to many fictions, especially concerning the pedigrees of heroes.</p></div>

Formerly Eleutherae formed the boundary on the side towards <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but when it came over to the Athenians henceforth the boundary of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> was Cithaeron.  The reason why the people of Eleutherae came over was not because they were reduced by war, but because they desired to share Athenian citizenship and hated the Thebans. In this plain is a temple of Dionysus, from which the old wooden image was carried off to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. The image at Eleutherae at the present day is a copy of the old one.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A little farther on is a small cave, and beside it is a spring of cold water.  The legend about the cave is that Antiope after her labour placed her babies into it; as to the spring, it is said that the shepherd who found the babies washed them there for the first time, taking off their swaddling clothes.  Of Eleutherae there were still left the ruins of the wall and of the houses.  From these it is clear that the city was built a little above the plain close to Cithaeron.</p></div>

As you go along this road you come to a well called Anthium (Flowery Well).  Pamphos in his poems describes how Demeter in the likeness of an old woman sat at this well after the rape of her daughter, how the daughters of Celeus thence took her as an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> woman to their mother, and how Metaneira thereupon entrusted to her the rearing of her son.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A little farther on from the well is a sanctuary of Metaneira, and after it are graves of those who went against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.

But Adrastus having supplicated Theseus, the Athenians fought with the Boeotians, and Theseus being victorious in the fight carried the dead to the Eleusinian territory and buried them here.  The Thebans, however, say that they voluntarily gave up the dead for burial and deny that they engaged in battle.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the graves of the Argives is the tomb of Alope, who, legend says, being mother of Hippothoon by Poseidon was on this spot put to death by her father Cercyon.  He is said to have treated strangers wickedly, especially in wrestling with them against their will.  So even to my day this place is called the Wrestling Ground of Cercyon, being a little way from the grave of Alope.  Cercyon is said to have killed all those who tried a bout with him except Theseus, who out matched him mainly by his skill.  For Theseus was the first to discover the art of wrestling, and through him afterwards was established the teaching of the art.  Before him men used in wrestling only size and strength of body.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such in my opinion are the most famous legends and sights among the Athenians, and from the beginning my narrative has picked out of much material the things that deserve to be recorded.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next to <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> is the district called <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName>. This too belonged to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in ancient times, Pylas the king having left it to Pandion.  My evidence is this; in the land is the grave of Pandion, and Nisus, while giving up the rule over the Athenians to Aegeus, the eldest of all the family, was himself made king of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and of the territory as far as <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.  Even at the present day the port of the Megarians is called <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName> after him.  Subsequently in the reign of Codrus the Peloponnesians made an expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  Having accomplished nothing brilliant, on their way home they took <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> from the Athenians, and gave it as a dwelling-place to such of the Corinthians and of their other allies as wished to go there.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In this way the Megarians changed their customs and dialect and became Dorians, and they say that the city received its name when Car the son of Phoroneus was king in this land.  It was then they say that sanctuaries of Demeter were first made by them, and then that men used the name <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> (Chambers). This is their history according to the Megarians themselves. But the Boeotians declare that Megareus, son of Poseidon, who dwelt in Onchestus, came with an army of Boeotians to help Nisus wage the war against Minos; that falling in the battle he was buried on the spot, and the city was named <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> from him, having previously been called <placeName key="perseus,Nisa">Nisa</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the twelfth generation after Car the son of Phoroneus the Megarians say that <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName> arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and became king, and that in his reign the tribe Leleges received its name.  <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName> they say begat Cleson, Cleson Pylas and Pylas Sciron, who married the daughter of Pandion and afterwards disputed with Nisus, the son of Pandion, about the throne, the dispute being settled by Aeacus, who gave the kingship to Nisus and his descendants, and to Sciron the leadership in war.  They say further that Nisus was succeeded by Megareus, the son of Poseidon, who married Iphinoe, the daughter of Nisus, but they ignore altogether the Cretan war and the capture of the city in the reign of Nisus.</p></div>

<div n="40" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is in the city a fountain, which was built for the citizens by Theagenes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.28.1">Paus. 1.28.1</bibl>.</note> whom I have mentioned previously as having given his daughter in marriage to Cylon the Athenian.  This Theagenes upon becoming tyrant built the fountain, which is noteworthy for its size, beauty and the number of its pillars.  Water flows into it called the water of the Sithnid nymphs.  The Megarians say that the Sithnid nymphs are native, and that one of them mated with Zeus; that Megarus, a son of Zeus and of this nymph, escaped the flood in the time of Deucalion, and made his escape to the heights of Gerania. The mountain had not yet received this name, but was then named Gerania (Crane Hill) because cranes were flying and Megarus swam towards the cry of the birds.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from this fountain is an ancient sanctuary, and in our day likenesses stand in it of Roman emperors, and a bronze image is there of Artemis surnamed Saviour.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>until at last they used up all their arrows thinking that they were shooting at the enemy.  When the day broke, the Megarians attacked, and being men in armour fighting against men without armour who no longer had even a supply of missiles, they killed the greater number of their opponents.  For this reason they had an image made of Artemis Saviour.  Here are also images of the gods named the Twelve, said to be the work of Praxiteles.  But the image of Artemis herself was made by Strongylion.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this when you have entered the precinct of Zeus called the Olympieum you see a note worthy temple.  But the image of Zeus was not finished, for the work was interrupted by the war of the Peloponnesians against the Athenians, in which the Athenians every year ravaged the land of the Megarians with a fleet and an army, damaging public revenues and bringing private families to dire distress. The face of the image of Zeus is of ivory and gold, the other parts are of clay and gypsum.  The artist is said to have been Theocosmus, a native, helped by Pheidias. Above the head of Zeus are the Seasons and Fates, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Destiny, and that he apportions the seasons as is due. Behind the temple lie half-worked pieces of wood, which Theocosmus intended to overlay with ivory and gold in order a complete the image of Zeus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the temple itself is dedicated a bronze ram of a galley.  This ship they say that they captured off <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in a naval action with the Athenians.  The Athenians too admit that for a time they evacuated the island before the Megarians, saying that after wards Solon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The great legislator, who flourished early in the sixth century B.C.</note> wrote elegiac poems and encouraged them, and that thereupon the Athenians challenged their enemies, won the war and recovered <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On coming down from the citadel, where the ground turns northwards, is the tomb of Alcmena, near the Olympieum.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From this place the local guide took us to a place which he said was named Rhus (Stream), for that water once flowed here from the mountains above the city.  But Theagenes, who was tyrant at that time, turned the water into another direction and made here an altar to Achelous.  Hard by is the tomb of Hyllus, son of Heracles, who fought a duel with an Arcadian, Echemus the son of Aeropus. Who the Echemus was who killed Hyllus I will tell in another part of my narrative, but Hyllus also is buried at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.  These events might correctly be called an expedition of the Heracleidae into the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> in the reign of Orestes.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from the tomb of Hyllus is a temple of Isis, and beside it one of Apollo and of Artemis.  They say that Alcathous made it after killing the lion called Cithaeronian.

Megareus they say promised that he who killed the Cithaeronian lion should marry his daughter and succeed him in the kingdom.  Alcathous therefore, son of Pelops, attacked the beast and overcame it, and when he came to the throne he built this sanctuary, surnaming Artemis Agrotera (Huntress) and Apollo Agraeus (<placeName key="tgn,1124760">Hunter</placeName>).</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the account of the Megarians; but although I wish my account to agree with theirs, yet I cannot accept everything they say.  I am ready to believe that a lion was killed by Alcathous on Cithaeron, but what historian has re corded that Timalcus the son of Megareus came with the Dioscuri to <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>? And supposing he had gone there, how could one hold that he had been killed by Theseus, when Alcman wrote a poem on the Dioscuri<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0640" to="-0600">640-600 B.C.</date></note>, in which he says that they captured <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and carried into captivity the mother of Theseus, but Theseus himself was absent?</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pindar in his poems agrees with this account, saying that Theseus, wishing to be related to the Dioscuri, carried off Helen and kept her until he departed to carry out with Peirithous the marriage that they tell of.  Whoever has studied genealogy finds the Megarians guilty of great silliness, since Theseus was a descendant of Pelops. The fact is that the Megarians know the true story but conceal it, not wishing it to be thought that their city was captured in the reign of Nisus, but that both Megareus, the son-in-law of Nisus, and Alcathous, the son-in-law of Megareus, succeeded their respective fathers-in-law as king.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is evident that Alcathous arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> just at the time when Nisus had died and the Megarians had lost everything.  Witness to the truth of my statements the fact that he built the wall afresh from the beginning, the old one round the city having been destroyed by the Cretans.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let so much suffice for Alcathous and for the lion, whether it was on Cithaeron or elsewhere that the killing took place that caused him to make a temple to Artemis Agrotera and Apollo Agraeus.  On going down from this sanctuary you see the shrine of the hero Pandion.  My narrative has already told how Pandion was buried on what is called the Rock of Athena Aethyia (Gannet).  He receives honors from the Megarians in the city as well.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the shrine of the hero Pandion is the tomb of Hippolyte.  I will record the account the Megarians give of her.  When the Amazons, having marched against the Athenians because of Antiope, were over come by Theseus, most of them met their death in the fight, but Hippolyte, the sister of Antiope and on this occasion the leader of the women, escaped with a few others to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.  Having suffered such a military disaster, being in despair at her present situation and even more hopeless of reaching her home in Themiscyra, she died of a broken heart, and the Megarians gave her burial.  The shape of her tomb is like an Amazonian shield.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from this is the grave of Tereus, who married Procne the daughter of Pandion.  The Megarians say that Tereus was king of the region around what is called Pagae (Springs) of <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName>, but my opinion, which is confirmed by extant evidence, is that he ruled over <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName> beyond <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>, for in ancient times the greater part of what is now called <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was inhabited by foreigners. When Tereus did what he did to Philomela and Itys suffered at the hands of the women, Tereus found himself unable to seize them.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He committed suicide in <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, and the Megarians forthwith raised him a barrow, and every year sacrifice to him, using in the sacrifice gravel instead of barley meal; they say that the bird called the hoopoe appeared here for the first time.  The women came to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and while lamenting their sufferings and their revenge, perished through their tears; their reported metamorphosis into a nightingale and a swallow is due, I think, to the fact that the note of these birds is plaintive and like a lamentation.</p></div>

<div n="42" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Megarians have another citadel, which is named after Alcathous. As you ascend this citadel you see on the right the tomb of Megareus, who at the time of the Cretan invasion came as an ally from Onchestus. There is also shown a hearth of the gods called Prodomeis (Builders before).  They say that Alcathous was the first to sacrifice to them, at the time when he was about to begin the building of the wall.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near this hearth is a stone, on which they say Apollo laid his lyre when he was helping Alcathous in the building.  I am confirmed in my view that the Megarians used to be tributary to the Athenians by the fact that Alcathous appears to have sent his daughter Periboea with Theseus to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> in payment of the tribute.  On the occasion of his building the wall, the Megarians say, Apollo helped him and placed his lyre on the stone; and if you happen to hit it with a pebble it sounds just as a lyre does when struck.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This made me marvel, but the colossus in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> made me marvel far more than anything else. In Egyptian Thebes, on crossing the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> to the so called Pipes, I saw a statue, still sitting, which gave out a sound. The many call it Memnon, who they say from Aethiopia overran <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and as far as <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>. The Thebans, however, say that it is a statue, not of Memnon, but of a native named Phamenoph, and I have heard some say that it is Sesostris.  This statue was broken in two by Cambyses, and at the present day from head to middle it is thrown down; but the rest is seated, and every day at the rising of the sun it makes a noise, and the sound one could best liken to that of a harp or lyre when a string has been broken.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Megarians have a council chamber which once, they say, was the grave of Timalcus, who just now I said was not killed by Theseus.  On the top of the citadel is built a temple of Athena, with an image gilt except the hands and feet; these and the face are of ivory.  There is another sanctuary built here, of Athena Victory, and yet a third of Athena Aeantis (Ajacian).  About the last the Megarian guides have omitted to record anything, but I will write what I take to be the facts.  Telamon the son of Aeacus married Periboea the daughter of Alcathous; so my opinion is that Ajax, who succeeded to the throne of Alcathous, made the statue of Athena.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The ancient temple of Apollo was of brick, but the emperor Hadrian afterwards built it of white marble. The Apollo called Pythian and the one called Decatephorus (Bringer of Tithes) are very like the Egyptian wooden images, but the one surnamed Archegetes (Founder) resembles Aeginetan works.  They are all alike made of ebony.  I have heard a man of Cyprus, who was skilled at sorting herbs for medicinal purposes, say that the ebony does not grow leaves or bear fruit, or even appear in the sunlight at all, but consists of underground roots which are dug up by the Aethiopians, who have men skilled at finding ebony.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a sanctuary of Demeter Thesmophorus (Lawgiver).  On going down from it you see the tomb of <placeName key="tgn,7002520">Callipolis</placeName>, son of Alcathous.  Alcathous had also an elder son, Ischepolis, whom his father sent to help Meleager to destroy the wild beast in <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>.  There he died, and <placeName key="tgn,7004089">Callipolis</placeName> was the first to hear of his death.  Running up to the citadel, at the moment when his father was preparing a fire to sacrifice to Apollo, he flung the logs from the altar.  Alcathous, who had not yet heard of the fate of Ischepolis, judged that <placeName key="tgn,7004089">Callipolis</placeName> was guilty of impiety, and forthwith, angry as he was, killed him by striking his head with one of the logs that had been flung from the altar.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the road to the Town-hall is the shrine of the heroine Ino, about which is a fencing of stones, and beside it grow olives.  The Megarians are the only Greeks who say that the corpse of Ino was cast up on their coast, that Cleso and Tauropolis, the daughters of Cleson, son of <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName>, found and buried it, and they say that among them first was she named Leucothea, and that every year they offer her sacrifice.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="43" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They say that there is also a shrine of the heroine Iphigenia; for she too according to them died in <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>.  Now I have heard another account of Iphigenia that is given by Arcadians and I know that Hesiod, in his poem <title>A Catalogue of Women,</title> says that Iphigenia did not die, but by the will of Artemis is Hecate.  With this agrees the account of Herodotus, that the Tauri near <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> sacrifice castaways to a maiden who they say is Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon.  Adrastus also is honored among the Megarians, who say that he too died among them when he was leading back his army after taking <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and that his death was caused by old age and the fate of Aegialeus.  A sanctuary of Artemis was made by Agamemnon when he came to persuade Calchas, who dwelt in <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, to accompany him to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the Town-hall are buried, they say, Euippus the son of Megareus and Ischepolis the son of Alcathous. Near the Town-hall is a rock.  They name it Anaclethris (Recall), because Demeter (if the story be credible) here too called her daughter back when she was wandering in search of her.  Even in our day the Megarian women hold a performance that is a mimic representation of the legend.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the city are graves of Megarians. They made one for those who died in the Persian invasion, and what is called the Aesymnium (Shrine of Aesymnus) was also a tomb of heroes.  When Agamemnon's son Hyperion, the last king of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, was killed by Sandion for his greed and violence, they resolved no longer to be ruled by one king, but to have elected magistrates and to obey one another in turn.  Then Aesymnus, who had a reputation second to none among the Megarians, came to the god in <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and asked in what way they could be prosperous.  The oracle in its reply said that they would fare well if they took counsel with the majority.  This utterance they took to refer to the dead, and built a council chamber in this place in order that the grave of their heroes might be within it.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Between this and the hero-shrine of Alcathous, which in my day the Megarians used as a record office, was the tomb, they said, of Pyrgo, the wife of Alcathous before he married Euaechme, the daughter of Megareus, and the tomb of Iphinoe, the daughter of Alcathous; she died, they say, a maid. It is customary for the girls to bring libations to the tomb of Iphiaoe and to offer a lock of their hair before their wedding, just as the daughters of the Delians once cut their hair for Hecaerge and Opis.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside the entrance to the sanctuary of Dionysus is the grave of Astycratea and Manto.  They were daughters of Polyidus, son of Coeranus, son of Abas, son of Melampus, who came to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> to purify Alcathous when he had killed his son <placeName key="tgn,7002520">Callipolis</placeName>.  Polyidus also built the sanctuary of Dionysus, and dedicated a wooden image that in our day is covered up except the face, which alone is exposed.  By the side of it is a Satyr of Parian marble made by Praxiteles.  This Dionysus they call Patrous (Paternal); but the image of another, that they surname Dasyllius, they say was dedicated by Euchenor, son of Coeranus, son of Polyidus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the sanctuary of Dionysus is a temple of Aphrodite, with an ivory image of Aphrodite surnamed Praxis (Action).  This is the oldest object in the temple.  There is also Persuasion and another goddess, whom they name Consoler, works of Praxiteles.  By Scopas are Love and Desire and Yearning, if indeed their functions are as different as their names.  Near the temple of Aphrodite is a sanctuary of Fortune, the image being one of the works of Praxiteles.  In the temple hard by are Muses and a bronze Zeus by Lysippus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Megarians have also the grave of Coroebus. The poetical story of him, although it equally concerns <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, I will relate here.  They say that in the reign of Crotopus at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Psamathe, the daughter of Crotopus, bore a son to Apollo, and being in dire terror of her father, exposed the child. He was found and destroyed by sheepdogs of Crotopus, and Apollo sent Vengeance to the city to punish the Argives.  They say that she used to snatch the children from their mothers, until Coroebus to please the Argives slew Vengeance.  Whereat as a second punishment plague fell upon them and stayed not. So Coroebus of his own accord went to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to submit to the punishment of the god for having slain Vengeance.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Pythia would not allow Coroebus to return to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, but ordered him to take up a tripod and carry it out of the sanctuary, and where the tripod should fall from his hands, there he was to build a temple of Apollo and to dwell himself.  At Mount Gerania the tripod slipped and fell unawares. Here he dwelt in the village called the Little Tripods.  The grave of Coroebus is in the market-place of the Megarians.  The story of Psamathe and of Coroebus himself is carved on it in elegiac verses and further, upon the top of the grave is represented Coroebus slaying Vengeance.  These are the oldest stone images I am aware of having seen among the Greeks.</p></div>

<div n="44" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">

My own opinion is that at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> he intentionally let the girdle slip off him, realizing that a naked man can run more easily than one girt.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go down from the market-place you see on the right of the street called Straight a sanctuary of Apollo Prostaterius (Protecting). You must turn a little aside from the road to discover it. In it is a noteworthy Apollo, Artemis also, and Leto, and other statues, made by Praxiteles.  In the old gymnasium near the gate called the Gate of the Nymphs is a stone of the shape of a small pyramid.  This they name Apollo Carinus, and here there is a sanctuary of the Eileithyiae.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such are the sights that the city had to show.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When you have gone down to the port, which to the present day is called <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName>, you see a sanctuary of Demeter Malophorus (Sheep-bearer or Apple-bearer). One of the accounts given of the surname is that those who first reared sheep in the land named Demeter Malophorus.  The roof of the temple one might conclude has fallen in through age.  There is a citadel here, which also is called <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName>.  Below the citadel near the sea is the tomb of Lelex, who they say arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and became king, being the son of Poseidon and of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, daughter of Epphus. Parallel to <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName> lies the small island of <placeName key="tgn,7010928">Minoa</placeName>, where in the war against Nisus anchored the fleet of the Cretans.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The hilly part of <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName> borders upon <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, and in it the Megarians have built the city Pagae and another one called <placeName key="tgn,5004218">Aegosthena</placeName>.  As you go to Pagae, on turning a little aside from the highway, you are shown a rock with arrows stuck all over it, into which the Persians once shot in the night.  In Pagae a noteworthy relic is a bronze image of Artemis surnamed Saviour, in size equal to that at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and exactly like it in shape.  There is also a hero-shrine of Aegialeus, son of Adrastus. When the Argives made their second attack on <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> he died at <placeName key="perseus,Glisas">Glisas</placeName> early in the first battle, and his relatives carried him to Pagae in <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName> and buried him, the shrine being still called the Aegialeum.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="tgn,5004218">Aegosthena</placeName> is a sanctuary of Melampus, son of Amythaon, and a small figure of a man carved upon a slab.  To Melampus they sacrifice and hold a festival every year.  They say that he divines neither by dreams nor in any other way. Here is something else that I heard in Erenea, a village of the Megarians.  Autonoe, daughter of Cadmus, left <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to live here owing to her great grief at the death of Actaeon, the manner of which is told in legend, and at the general misfortune of her father's house.

There is also the tomb of Car, son of Phoroneus, which was originally a mound of earth, but afterwards, at the command of the oracle, it was adorned with mussel stone.  The Megarians are the only Greeks to possess this stone, and in the city also they have made many things out of it.  It is very white, and softer than other stone; in it throughout are sea mussels.  Such is the nature of the stone.  The road called Scironian to this day and named after Sciron, was made by him when he was war minister of the Megarians, and originally they say was constructed for the use of active men.  But the emperor Hadrian broadened it, and made it suitable even for chariots to pass each other in opposite directions.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are legends about the rocks, which rise especially at the narrow part of the road.  As to the Molurian, it is said that from it Ino flung her self into the sea with Melicertes, the younger of her children.  Learchus, the elder of them, had been killed by his father.  One account is that Athamas did this in a fit of madness; another is that he vented on Ino and her children unbridled rage when he learned that the famine which befell the Orchomenians and the supposed death of Phrixus were not accidents from heaven, but that Ino, the step-mother, had intrigued for all these things.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then it was that she fled to the sea and cast herself and her son from the Molurian Rock. The son, they say, was landed on the Corinthian Isthmus by a dolphin, and honors were offered to Melicertes, then renamed Palaemon, including the celebration of the Isthmian games.  The Molurian dock they thought sacred to Leucothea and Palaemon; but those after it they consider accursed, in that Sciron, who dwelt by them, used to cast into the sea all the strangers he met.  A tortoise used to swim under the rocks to seize those that fell in. Sea tortoises are like land tortoises except in size and for their feet, which are like those of seals.  Retribution for these deeds overtook Sciron, for he was cast into the same sea by Theseus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the top of the mountain is a temple of Zeus surnamed Aphesius (Releaser).  It is said that on the occasion of the drought that once afflicted the Greeks Aeacus in obedience to an oracular utterance sacrificed in <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> to Zeus God of all the Greeks, and Zeus rained and ended the drought, gaining thus the name Aphesius.

Farther on the pine still grew by the shore at the time of my visit, and there was an altar of Melicertes. At this place, they say, the boy was brought ashore by a dolphin; Sisyphus found him lying and gave him burial on the Isthmus, establishing the Isthmian games in his honor.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the beginning of the Isthmus is the place where the brigand Sinis used to take hold of pine trees and draw them down. All those whom he overcame in fight he used to tie to the trees, and then allow them to swing up again. Thereupon each of the pines used to drag to itself the bound man, and as the bond gave way in neither direction but was stretched equally in both, he was torn in two. This was the way in which Sinis himself was slain by Theseus.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Corinthian Isthmus stretches on the one hand to the sea at Cenchreae, and on the other to the sea at Lechaeum.

Where they began to dig is still to be seen, but into the rock they did not advance at all. So it still is mainland as its nature is to be. Alexander the son of Philip wished to dig through Mimas, and his attempt to do this was his only unsuccessful project. The Cnidians began to dig through their isthmus, but the Pythian priestess stopped them. So difficult it is for man to alter by violence what Heaven has made.</p></div>

On the temple, which is not very large, stand bronze Tritons. In the fore-temple are images, two of Poseidon, a third of Amphitrite, and a Sea, which also is of bronze.

There is also what is called his Holy of Holies, and an underground descent to it, where they say that Palaemon is concealed. Whosoever, whether Corinthian or stranger, swears falsely here, can by no means escape from his oath. There is also an ancient sanctuary called the altar of the Cyclopes, and they sacrifice to the Cyclopes upon it.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The graves of Sisyphus and of Neleus—for they say that Neleus came to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, died of disease, and was buried near the Isthmus—I do not think that anyone would look for after reading Eumelus. For he says that not even to Nestor did Sisyphus show the tomb of Neleus, because it must be kept unknown to everybody alike, and that Sisyphus is indeed buried on the Isthmus, but that few Corinthians, even those of his own day, knew where the grave was. The Isthmian games were not interrupted even when <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> had been laid waste by Mummius, but so long as it lay deserted the celebration of the games was entrusted to the Sicyonians, and when it was rebuilt the honor was restored to the present inhabitants.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The names of the Corinthian harbors were given them by Leches and Cenchrias, said to be the children of Poseidon and Peirene the daughter of Achelous, though in the poem called <title>The Great Eoeae</title><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Said to be a work of Hesiod.</note> Peirene is said to be a daughter of Oebalus.

In Cenchreae are a temple and a stone statue of Aphrodite, after it on the mole running into the sea a bronze image of Poseidon, and at the other end of the harbor sanctuaries of Asclepius and of Isis. Right opposite Cenchreae is Helen's Bath. It is a large stream of salt, tepid water, flowing from a rock into the sea.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> another tomb which claims to be that of Lais, for she went to that country also when she fell in love with Hippostratus. The story is that originally she was of Hycara in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Taken captive while yet a girl by Nicias and the Athenians, she was sold and brought to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, where she surpassed in beauty the courtesans of her time, and so won the admiration of the Corinthians that even now they claim Lais as their own.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The things worthy of mention in the city include the extant remains of antiquity, but the greater number of them belong to the period of its second ascendancy. On the market-place, where most of the sanctuaries are, stand Artemis surnamed Ephesian and wooden images of Dionysus, which are covered with gold with the exception of their faces; these are ornamented with red paint. They are called Lysius and Baccheus,</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and I too give the story told about them. They say that Pentheus treated Dionysus despitefully, his crowning outrage being that he went to Cithaeron, to spy upon the women, and climbing up a tree beheld what was done. When the women detected Pentheus, they immediately dragged him down, and joined in tearing him, living as he was, limb from limb. Afterwards, as the Corinthians say, the Pythian priestess commanded them by an oracle to discover that tree and to worship it equally with the god. For this reason they have made these images from the tree.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also a temple of Fortune, with a standing image of Parian marble. Beside it is a sanctuary for all the gods.

There is also a bronze Apollo surnamed Clarius and a statue of Aphrodite made by Hermogenes of <placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>. There are two bronze, standing images of Hermes, for one of which a temple has been made. The images of Zeus also are in the open; one had not a surname, another they call Chthonius (of the Lower World) and the third Most High.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On leaving the market-place along the road to Lechaeum you come to a gateway, on which are two gilded chariots, one carrying Phaethon the son of Helius (Sun), the other Helius himself. A little farther away from the gateway, on the right as you go in, is a bronze Heracles. After this is the entrance to the water of Peirene. The legend about Peirene is that she was a woman who became a spring because of her tears shed in lamentation for her son Cenchrias, who was unintentionally killed by Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The spring is ornamented with white marble, and there have been made chambers like caves, out of which the water flows into an open-air well. It Is pleasant to drink, and they say that the Corinthian bronze, when red-hot, is tempered by this water, since bronze . . . the Corinthians have not. Moreover near Peirene are an image and a sacred enclosure of Apollo; in the latter is a painting of the exploit of Odysseus against the suitors.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Proceeding on the direct road to Lechaeum we see a bronze image of a seated Hermes.

On the left of the entrance stands a Poseidon, and after him Artemis hunting. Throughout the city are many wells, for the Corinthians have a copious supply of flowing water, besides the water which the emperor Hadrian brought from Lake Stymphalus, but the most noteworthy is the one by the side of the image of Artemis. Over it is a Bellerophontes, and the water flows through the hoof of the horse Pegasus.</p></div>

Into this they say she threw herself in the belief that the water would be a cure for the drugs of Medea. Above this well has been built what is called the Odeum (Music Hall), beside which is the tomb of Medea's children. Their names were Mermerus and Pheres, and they are said to have been stoned to death by the Corinthians owing to the gifts which legend says they brought to Glauce.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But as their death was violent and illegal, the young babies of the Corinthians were destroyed by them until, at the command of the oracle, yearly sacrifices were established in their honor and a figure of Terror was set up.

Not far from this theater is the ancient gymnasium, and a spring called <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName>.

</div>

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the summit of the Acrocorinthus is a temple of Aphrodite. The images are Aphrodite armed, Helius, and Eros with a bow. The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus. The latter knew, so runs the legend, that Zeus had ravished <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, the daughter of Asopus, but refused to give information to the seeker before he had a spring given him on the Acrocorinthus. When Asopus granted this request Sisyphus turned informer, and on this account he receives—if anyone believes the story—punishment in Hades.  I have heard people say that this spring and Peirene are the same, the water in the city flowing hence under-ground.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Asopus rises in the Phliasian territory, flows through the Sicyonian, and empties itself into the sea here. His daughters, say the Phliasians, were <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, and Thebe. <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> gave new names to the islands called <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName> and Oenone, while from Thebe is named the city below the Cadmea. The Thebans do not agree, but say that Thebe was the daughter of the Boeotian, and not of the Phliasian, Asopus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The other stories about the river are current among both the Phliasians and the Sicyonians, for instance that its water is foreign and not native, in that the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName>, descending from Celaenae through <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, and emptying itself into the sea at <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, goes to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and forms the Asopus. I remember hearing a similar story from the Delians, that the stream which they call Inopus comes to them from the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>. Further, there is a story that the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> itself is the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>, which disappears into a marsh, rises again beyond Aethiopia and becomes the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the account I heard of the Asopus. When you have turned from the Acrocorinthus into the mountain road you see the Teneatic gate and a sanctuary of Eilethyia. The town called <placeName key="perseus,Tenea">Tenea</placeName> is just about sixty stades distant. The inhabitants say that they are Trojans who were taken prisoners in <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName> by the Greeks, and were permitted by Agamemnon to dwell in their present home.

There have, of course, been many wars carried on in Corinthian territory, and naturally houses and sanctuaries outside the wall have been fired. But this temple, they say, was Apollo's, and Pyrrhus the son of Achilles burned it down. Subsequently I heard another account, that the Corinthians built the temple for Olympian Zeus, and that suddenly fire from some quarter fell on it and destroyed it.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Sicyonians, the neighbours of the Corinthians at this part of the border, say about their own land that Aegialeus was its first and aboriginal inhabitant, that the district of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> still called Aegialus was named after him because he reigned over it, and that he founded the city Aegialea on the plain. Their citadel, they say, was where is now their sanctuary of Athena; further, that Aegialeus begat Europs, Europs Telchis, and Telchis Apis.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Apis reached such a height of power before Pelops came to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> that all the territory south of the Isthmus was called after him <placeName key="tgn,1099657">Apia</placeName>.

There is a story that this Calchinia mated with Poseidon; her child was reared by Leucippus, who at his death handed over to him the kingdom. His name was Peratus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What is reported of Plemnaeus, the son of Peratus, seemed to me very wonderful. All the children borne to him by his wife died the very first time they wailed.

Orthopolis had a daughter Chrysorthe, who is thought to have borne a son named Coronus to Apollo. Coronus had two sons, Corax and a younger one Lamedon.</p></div>

In his reign the first hostile army is said to have invaded the land, which before this had enjoyed unbroken peace. The reason was this. Antiope, the daughter of Nycteus, had a name among the Greeks for beauty, and there was also a report that her father was not Nycteus but Asopus, the river that separates the territories of <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011028">Plataea</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This woman Epopeus carried off but I do not know whether he asked for her hand or adopted a bolder policy from the beginning.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As to Epopeus, he forthwith offered sacrifice for his victory and began a temple of Athena, and when this was complete he prayed the goddess to make known whether the temple was finished to her liking, and after the prayer they say that olive oil flowed before the temple. Afterwards Epopeus also died of his wound, which he had neglected at first, so that Lycus had now no need to wage war. For Lamedon, the son of Coronus, who became king after Epopeus, gave up Antiope. As she was being taken to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> by way of Eleutherae, she was delivered there on the road.</p></div>

This tomb is a mound of earth, but the Sicyonians themselves usually bury their dead in a uniform manner. They cover the body in the ground, and over it they build a basement of stone upon which they set pillars. Above these they put something very like the pediment of a temple. They add no inscription, except that they give the dead man's name without that of his father and bid him farewell.</p></div>

On the stage of the theater built under the citadel is a statue of a man with a shield, who they say is Aratus, the son of Cleinias. After the theater is a temple of Dionysus. The god is of gold and ivory, and by his side are Bacchanals of white marble. These women they say are sacred to Dionysus and maddened by his inspiration. The Sicyonians have also some images which are kept secret. These one night in each year they carry to the temple of Dionysus from what they call the Cosmeterium (Tiring-room), and they do so with lighted torches and native hymns.</p></div>

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Within the market-place is a sanctuary of Persuasion; this too has no image. The worship of Persuasion was established among them for the following reason. When Apollo and Artemis had killed <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> they came to Aegialea to obtain purification. Dread coming upon them at the place now named Fear, they turned aside to Carmanor in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and the people of Aegialea were smitten by a plague.

They say that the deities, persuaded by these, came to what was then the citadel, and the place that they reached first is the sanctuary of Persuasion. Conformable with this story is the ceremony they perform at the present day; the children go to the Sythas at the feast of Apollo, and having brought, as they pretend, the deities to the sanctuary of Persuasion, they say that they take them back again to the temple of Apollo. The temple stands in the modern market-place, and was originally, it is said, made by Proetus, because in this place his daughters recovered from their madness.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The precinct near the sanctuary of Persuasion that is devoted to Roman emperors was once the house of the tyrant Cleon. He became tyrant in the modern city there was another tyranny while the Sicyonians still lived in the lower city,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0590">590 B.C.</date></note> that of Cleisthenes, the son of Aristonymus, the son of Myron. Before this house is a hero-shrine of Aratus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0271" to="-0213">271-213 B.C.</date></note> whose achievements eclipsed those of all contemporary Greeks. His history is as follows.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the despotism of Cleon, many of those in authority were seized with such an ungovernable passion for tyranny that two actually became tyrants together, Euthydemus and Timocleidas. These were expelled by the people, who made Cleinias, the father of Aratus, their champion. A few years afterwards Abantidas became tyrant. Before this time Cleinias had met his death, and Aratus went into exile, either of his own accord or because he was compelled to do so by Abantidas. Now Abantidas was killed by some natives, and his father Paseas immediately became tyrant.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He was killed by Nicocles, who succeeded him.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0251">251 B.C.</date></note> This Nicocles was attacked by Aratus with a force of Sicyonian exiles and <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> mercenaries. Making his attempt by night, he eluded some of the defenders in the darkness; the others he overcame, and forced his way within the wall. Day was now breaking, and taking the populace with him he hastened to the tyrant's house. This he easily captured, but Nicocles himself succeeded in making his escape. Aratus restored equality of political rights to the Sicyonians, striking a bargain for those in exile; he restored to them their houses and all their other possessions which had been sold, compensating the buyers out of his own purse.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Moreover, as all the Greeks were afraid of the Macedonians and of Antigonus, the guardian of Philip, the son of Demetrius, he induced the Sicyonians, who were Dorians, to join the Achaean League. He was immediately elected general by the Achaeans, and leading them against the Locrians of <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName> and into the land of the Aetolians, their enemies, he ravaged their territory. <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> was held by Antigonus, and there was a Macedonian garrison in the city, but he threw them into a panic by the suddenness of his assault, winning a battle and killing among others Persaeus, the commander of the garrison, who had studied philosophy under Zeno,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Stoic philosopher (c. <date from="-0360" to="-0270">360-270 B.C.</date>).</note> the son of Mnaseas.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Aratus had liberated <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, the League was joined by the Epidaurians and Troezenians inhabiting Argolian Acte, and by the Megarians among those beyond the Isthmus, while Ptolemy made an alliance with the Achaeans. The Lacedaemonians and king Agis, the son of Eudamidas, surprised and took <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> by a sudden onslaught, but when Aratus and his army arrived they were defeated in an engagement, evacuated <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>, and returned home under a truce.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After his success in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, Aratus thought it a shame to allow the Macedonians to hold unchallenged Peiraeus, Munychia, <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, and Sunium; but not expecting to be able to take them by force he bribed Diogenes, the commander of the garrisons, to give up the positions for a hundred and fifty talents, himself helping the Athenians by contributing a sixth part of the sum. He induced Aristomachus also, the tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, to restore to the Argives their democracy and to join the Achaean League; he captured <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> from the Lacedaemonians who held it. But no man finds all his plans turn out according to his liking, and even Aratus was compelled to become an ally of the Macedonians and Antigonus in the following way.</p></div>

Cleomenes had violated the peace which he had made with Antigonus and had openly acted in many ways contrary to treaty, especially in laying waste <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but of the children of Leonidas, Epicleidas was killed in the battle, and Cleomenes fled to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. Held in the highest honor by Ptolemy, he came to be cast into prison, being convicted of inciting Egyptians to rebel against their king. He made his escape from prison and began a riot among the Alexandrians, but at last, on being captured, he fell by his own hand. The Lacedaemonians, glad to be rid of Cleomenes, refused to be ruled by kings any longer, but the rest of their ancient constitution they have kept to the present day. Antigonus remained a constant friend of Aratus, looking upon him as a benefactor who hid helped him to accomplish brilliant deeds.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when Philip succeeded to the throne, since Aratus did not approve of his violent treatment of his subjects, and in some cases even opposed the accomplishment of his purposes, he killed Aratus by giving him secretly a dose of poison. This fate came upon Aratus at Aegium, from which place he was carried to <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> and buried, and there is still in that city the hero-shrine of Aratus. Philip treated two Athenians, Eurycleides and Micon, in a similar way. These men also, who were orators enjoying the confidence of the people, he killed by poison.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After all, Philip himself in his turn was fated to suffer disaster through the fatal cup. Philip's son, Demetrius, was poisoned by Perseus, his younger son, and grief at the murder brought the father also to his grave.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the hero-shrine of Aratus is an altar to Isthmian Poseidon, and also a Zeus Meilichius (Gracious) and an Artemis named Patroa (Paternal), both of them very inartistic works. The Meilichius is like a pyramid, the Artemis like a pillar. Here too stand their council-chamber and a portico called Cleisthenean from the name of him who built it.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hard by is a sanctuary of Apollo Lycius (Wolf-god), now fallen into ruins and not worth any attention. For wolves once so preyed upon their flocks that there was no longer any profit therefrom, and the god, mentioning a certain place where lay a dry log, gave an oracle that the bark of this log mixed with meat was to be set out for the beasts to eat. As soon as they tasted it the bark killed them, and that log lay in my time in the sanctuary of the Wolf-god, but not even the guides of the Sicyonians knew what kind of tree it was.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next after this are bronze portrait statues, said to be the daughters of Proetus, but the inscription I found referred to other women.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the gymnasium not far from the market-place is dedicated a stone Heracles made by Scopas.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Flourished first half of fourth century B.C.</note> There is also in another place a sanctuary of Heracles. The whole of the enclosure here they name Paedize; in the middle of the enclosure is the sanctuary, and in it is an old wooden figure carved by Laphaes the Phliasian. I will now describe the ritual at the festival. The story is that on coming to the Sicyonian land <placeName key="tgn,7010788">Phaestus</placeName> found the people giving offerings to Heracles as to a hero. <placeName key="tgn,7010788">Phaestus</placeName> then refused to do anything of the kind, but insisted on sacrificing to him as to a god. Even at the present day the Sicyonians, after slaying a lamb and burning the thighs upon the altar, eat some of the meat as part of a victim given to a god, while the rest they offer as to a hero. The first day of the festival in honor of Heracles they name . . . ; the second they call <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From here is a way to a sanctuary of Asclepius. On passing into the enclosure you see on the left a building with two rooms. In the outer room lies a figure of Sleep, of which nothing remains now except the head. The inner room is given over to the Carnean Apollo; into it none may enter except the priests. In the portico lies a huge bone of a sea-monster, and after it an image of the Dream-god and Sleep, surnamed Epidotes (Bountiful), lulling to sleep a lion. Within the sanctuary on either side of the entrance is an image, on the one hand Pan seated, on the other Artemis standing.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When you have entered you see the god, a beardless figure of gold and ivory made by Calamis.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A famous early fifth century sculptor.</note> He holds a staff in one hand, and a cone of the cultivated pine in the other. The Sicyonians say that the god was carried to them from <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> on a carriage drawn by two mules, that he was in the likeness of a serpent, and that he was brought by Nicagora of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, the mother of Agasicles and the wife of Echetimus. Here are small figures hanging from the roof. She who is on the serpent they say is Aristodama, the mother of Aratus, whom they hold to be a son of Asclepius.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such are the noteworthy things that this enclosure presented to me, and opposite is another enclosure, sacred to Aphrodite. The first thing inside is a statue of Antiope. They say that her sons were Sicyonians, and because of them the Sicyonians will have it that Antiope herself is related to themselves. After this is the sanctuary of Aphrodite, into which enter only a female verger, who after her appointment may not have intercourse with a man, and a virgin, called the Bath-bearer, holding her sacred office for a year. All others are wont to behold the goddess from the entrance, and to pray from that place.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The image, which is seated, was made by the Sicyonian Canachus, who also fashioned the Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Didyma">Didyma</placeName> of the Milesians, and the Ismenian Apollo for the Thebans. It is made of gold and ivory, having on its head a polos,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A curiously shaped head-gear.</note> and carrying in one hand a poppy and in the other an apple. They offer the thighs of the victims, excepting pigs; the other parts they burn for the goddess with juniper wood, but as the thighs are burning they add to the offering a leaf of the paideros.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This is a plant in the open parts of the enclosure, and it grows nowhere else either in Sicyonia or in any other land. Its leaves are smaller than those of the esculent oak, but larger than those of the holm; the shape is similar to that of the oak-leaf. One side is of a dark color, the other is white. You might best compare the color to that of white-poplar leaves.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Ascending from here to the gymnasium you see in the right a sanctuary of Artemis Pheraea. It is said that the wooden image was brought from Pherae. This gymnasium was built for the Sicyonians by Cleinias, and they still train the youths here. White marble images are here, an Artemis wrought only to the waist, and a Heracles whose lower parts are similar to the square Hermae.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="11" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Turning away from here towards the gate called Holy you see, not far from the gate, a temple of Athena. Dedicated long ago by Epopeus, it surpassed all its contemporaries in size and splendor. Yet the memory of even this was doomed to perish through lapse of time—it was burnt down by lightning—but the altar there, which escaped injury, remains down to the present day as Epopeus made it. Before the altar a barrow has been raised for Epopeus himself, and near the grave are the gods Averters of evil. Near them the Greeks perform such rites as they are wont to do in order to avert misfortunes. They say that the neighboring sanctuary of Artemis and Apollo was also made by Epopeus, and that of Hera after it by Adrastus. I found no images remaining in either. Behind the sanctuary of Hera he built an altar to Pan, and one to Helius (Sun) made of white marble.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the way down to the plain is a sanctuary of Demeter, said to have been founded by Plemnaeis as a thank-offering to the goddess for the rearing of his son. A little farther away from the sanctuary of Hera founded by Adrastus is a temple of the Carnean Apollo. Only the pillars are standing in it; you will no longer find there walls or roof, nor yet in that of Hera Pioneer. This temple was founded by Phalces, son of Temenus, who asserted that Hera guided him on the road to <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the direct road from <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> to Phlius, on the left of the road and just about ten stades from it, is a grove called Pyraea, and in it a sanctuary of Hera Protectress and the Maid. Here the men celebrate a festival by themselves, giving up to the women the temple called Nymphon for the purposes of their festival. In the Nymphon are images of Dionysus, Demeter, and the Maid, with only their faces exposed. The road to <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName> is sixty stades long, and too narrow to be used by carriages drawn by a yoke.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At a distance along it, in my opinion, of twenty stades, to the left on the other side of the Asopus, is a grove of holm oaks and a temple of the goddesses named by the Athenians the August, and by the Sicyonians the Kindly Ones. On one day in each year they celebrate a festival to them and offer sheep big with young as a burnt offering, and they are accustomed to use a libation of honey and water, and flowers instead of garlands. They practise similar rites at the altar of the Fates; it is in an open space in the grove.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On turning back to the road, and having crossed the Asopus again and reached the summit of the hill, you come to the place where the natives say that Titan first dwelt. They add that he was the brother of Helius (Sun), and that after him the place got the name <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName>. My own view is that he proved clever at observing the seasons of the year and the times when the sun increases and ripens seeds and fruits, and for this reason was held to be the brother of Helius. Afterwards Alexanor, the son of Machaon, the son of Asclepius, came to Sicyonia and built the sanctuary of Asclepius at <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The neighbors are chiefly servants of the god, and within the enclosure are old cypress trees. One cannot learn of what wood or metal the image is, nor do they know the name of the maker, though one or two attribute it to Alexanor himself. Of the image can be seen only the face, hands, and feet, for it has about it a tunic of white wool and a cloak. There is a similar image of Health; this, too, one cannot see easily because it is so surrounded with the locks of women, who cut them off and offer them to the goddess, and with strips of Babylonian raiment. With whichever of these a votary here is willing to propitiate heaven, the same instructions have been given to him, to worship this image which they are pleased to call Health.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are images also of Alexanor and of Euamerion; to the former they give offerings as to a hero after the setting of the sun; to Euamerion, as being a god, they give burnt sacrifices. If I conjecture aright, the Pergamenes, in accordance with an oracle, call this Euamerion Telesphorus (Accomplisher) while the Epidaurians call him Acesis (Cure). There is also a wooden image of Coronis, but it has no fixed position anywhere in the temple. While to the god are being sacrificed a bull, a lamb, and a pig, they remove Coronis to the sanctuary of Athena and honor her there. The parts of the victims which they offer as a burnt sacrifice, and they are not content with cutting out the thighs, they burn on the ground, except the birds, which they burn on the altar.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the gable at the ends are figures of Heracles and of Victories. In the portico are dedicated images of Dionysus and Hecate, with Aphrodite, the Mother of the gods, and Fortune. These are wooden, but Asclepius, surnamed Gortynian, is of stone. They are unwilling to enter among the sacred serpents through fear, but they place their food before the entrance and take no further trouble. Within the enclosure is a bronze statue of a Sicyonian named Granianus, who won the following victories at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>: the pentathlon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See note on <bibl n="Paus. 1.29.5">Paus. 1.29.5</bibl></note> twice, the foot-race, the double-course foot-race twice, once without and once with the shield.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName> there is also a sanctuary of Athena, into which they bring up the image of Coronis. In it is an old wooden figure of Athena, and I was told that it, too, was struck by lightning. The sanctuary is built upon a hill, at the bottom of which is an Altar of the Winds, and on it the priest sacrifices to the winds one night in every year. He also performs other secret rites at four pits, taming the fierceness of the blasts, and he is said to chant as well charms of Medea.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On reaching <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> from <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName>, as you go down to the shore you see on the left of the road a temple of Hera having now neither image nor roof. They say that its founder was Proetus, the son of Abas. When you have gone down to the harbor called the Sicyonians' and turned towards Aristonautae, the Port of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>, you see a little above the road on the left hand a sanctuary of Poseidon. Farther along the highway is a river called the Helisson, and after it the Sythas, both emptying themselves into the sea.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Phliasia borders on Sicyonia. The city is just about forty stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Titane">Titane</placeName>, and there is a straight road to it from <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>. That the Phliasians are in no way related to the Arcadians is shown by the passage in Homer that deals with the list of the Arcadians, in which the Sicyonians are not included among the Arcadian confederates. As my narrative progresses it will become clear that they were <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> originally, and became Dorian later after the return of the Heracleidae to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. I know that most of the traditions concerning the Phliasians are contradictory, but I shall make use of those which have been most generally accepted.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that the first man in this land was <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName>, who sprang from the soil. He founded a city around that hillock which even down to our day is called the Arantine Hill, not far distant from a second hill on which the Phliasians have their citadel and their sanctuary of Hebe. Here, then, he founded a city, and after him in ancient times both the land and the city were called Arantia. While he was king, Asopus, said to be the son of Celusa and Poseidon, discovered for him the water of the river which the present inhabitants call after him Asopus. The tomb of Aras is in the place called Celeae, where they say is also buried Dysaules of <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.</p></div>
    <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName> had a son Aoris and a daughter Araethyrea, who, the Phliasians say, were experienced hunters and brave warriors. Araethyrea died first, and Aoris, in memory of his sister, changed the name of the land to Araethyrea. This is why Homer, in making a list of Agamemnon's subjects, has the verse:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Orneae was their home and Araethyrea the delightful.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.571">Hom. Il. 2.571</bibl>The graves of the children of <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName> are, in my opinion, on the Arantine Hill and not in any other part of the land. On the top of them are far-seen gravestones, and before the celebration of the mysteries of Demeter the people look at these tombs and call <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName> and his children to the libations.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Argives say that Phlias, who has given the land its third name, was the son of Ceisus, the son of Temenus. This account I can by no means accept, but I know that he is called a son of Dionysus, and that he is said to have been one of those who sailed on the <placeName key="tgn,1094163">Argo</placeName>. The verses of the Rhodian poet confirm me in my opinion:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Came after these Phlias from Araethyrea to the muster;</l><l>Here did he dwell and prosper, because Dionysus his father</l><l>Cared for him well, and his home was near to the springs of Asopus.</l></quote><bibl n="Apollon. 1.115">Apollonius Rhodius Argonautica 1.115-117.</bibl>The account goes on to say that the mother of Phlias was Araethyrea and not Chthonophyle.

<div n="13" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the return of the Heracleidae disturbances took place throughout the whole of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> except <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, so that many of the cities received additional settlers from the Dorian race, and their inhabitants suffered yet more revolutions. The history of Phlius is as follows. The Dorian Rhegnidas, the son of Phalces, the son of Temenus, attacked it from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and Sicyonia. Some of the Phliasians were inclined to accept the offer of Rhegnidas, which was that they should remain on their own estates and receive Rhegnidas as their king, giving the Dorians with him a share in the land.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hippasus and his party, on the other hand, urged the citizens to defend themselves, and not to give up many advantages to the Dorians without striking a blow. The people, however, accepted the opposite policy, and so Hippasus and any others who wished fled to <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>. Great-grandson of this Hippasus was Pythagoras,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The philosopher and mathematician.Fl. c. <date when="-0527">527 B.C.</date></note> the celebrated sage. For Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, the son of Euphranor, the son of Hippasus. This is the account the Phliasians give about themselves, and the Sicyonians in general agree with them.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I will now add an account of the most remarkable of their famous sights. On the Phliasian citadel is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorities call her Hebe, whom Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.2">Hom. Il. 4.2</bibl> foll.</note> mentions in the duel between Menelaus and Alexander, saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of Odysseus to Hell,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.603">Hom. Od. 11.603</bibl></note> that she was the wife of Heracles. <placeName key="tgn,1115310">Olen</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A mythical poet of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, associated with Apollo.</note> in his hymn to Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Seasons, and that her children were Ares and Hebe. Of the honors that the Phliasians pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Ivy-cutters. There is no image, either kept in secret or openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of Hera with an image of Parian marble.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the citadel is another enclosure, which is sacred to Demeter, and in it are a temple and statue of Demeter and her daughter. Here there is also a bronze statue of Artemis, which appeared to me to be ancient. As you go down from the citadel you see on the right a temple of Asclepius with an image of the god as a beardless youth. Below this temple is built a theater. Not far from it is a sanctuary of Demeter and old, seated images.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the market-place is a votive offering, a bronze she-goat for the most part covered with gold. The following is the reason why it has received honors among the Phliasians. The constellation which they call the Goat on its rising causes continual damage to the vines. In order that they may suffer nothing unpleasant from it, the Phliasians pay honors to the bronze goat on the market-place and adorn the image with gold. Here also is the tomb of Aristias, the son of Pratinas.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. c. <date when="-0500">500 B.C.</date></note> This Aristias and his father Pratinas composed satyric plays more popular than any save those of Aeschylus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Behind the market-place is a building which the Phliasians name the House of Divination. Into it Amphiaraus entered, slept the night there, and then first, say the Phliasians, began to divine. According to their account Amphiaraus was for a time an ordinary person and no diviner. Ever since that time the building has been shut up. Not far away is what is called the Omphalos (Navel), the center of all the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, if they speak the truth about it. Farther on from the Omphalos they have an old sanctuary of Dionysus, a sanctuary of Apollo, and one of Isis. The image of Dionysus is visible to all, and so also is that of Apollo, but the image of Isis only the priests may behold.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Phliasians tell also the following legend. When Heracles came back safe from <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, bringing the apples of the Hesperides, as they were called, he visited Phlius on some private matter. While he was staying there Oeneus came to him from <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>. He had already allied himself to the family of Heracles, and after his arrival on this occasion either he entertained Heracles or Heracles entertained him. Be this as it may, displeased with the drink given him Heracles struck on the head with one of his fingers the boy Cyathus, the cup-bearer of Oeneus, who died on the spot from the blow. A chapel keeps the memory of the deed fresh among the Phliasians; it is built by the side of the sanctuary of Apollo, and it contains statues made of stone representing Cyathus holding out a cup to Heracles.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Celeae is some five stades distant from the city, and here they celebrate the mysteries in honor of Demeter, not every year but every fourth year. The initiating priest is not appointed for life, but at each celebration they elect a fresh one, who takes, if he cares to do so, a wife. In this respect their custom differs from that at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, but the actual celebration is modelled on the Eleusinian rites. The Phliasians themselves admit that they copy the “performance” at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that it was Dysaules, the brother of Celeus, who came to their land and established the mysteries, and that he had been expelled from <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> by Ion, when Ion, the son of Xuthus, was chosen by the Athenians to be commander-in-chief in the Eleusinian war. Now I cannot possibly agree with the Phliasians in supposing that an Eleusinian was conquered in battle and driven away into exile, for the war terminated in a treaty before it was fought out, and Eumolpus himself remained at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But it is possible that Dysaules came to Phlius for some other reason than that given by the Phliasians. I do not believe either that he was related to Celeus, or that he was in any way distinguished at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, otherwise Homer would never have passed him by in his poems. For Homer is one of those who have written in honor of Demeter, and when he is making a list of those to whom the goddess taught the mysteries he knows nothing of an Eleusinian named Dysaules. These are the verses:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">She to Triptolemus taught, and to Diocles, driver of horses,</l><l>Also to mighty Eumolpus, to Celeus, leader of peoples,</l><l>Cult of the holy rites, to them all her mystery telling.</l></quote><bibl n="HH 2.474">HH Dem. 474-476</bibl></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At all events, this Dysaules, according to the Phliasians, established the mysteries here, and he it was who gave to the place the name Celeae. I have already said that the tomb of Dysaules is here. So the grave of <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName> was made earlier, for according to the account of the Phliasians Dysaules did not arrive in the reign of <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName>, but later. For <placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName>, they say, was a contemporary of Prometheus, the son of Iapetus, and three generations of men older than Pelasgus the son of Arcas and those called at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> aboriginals. On the roof of what is called the Anactorum they say is dedicated the chariot of Pelops.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="15" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These are the things that I found most worthy of mention among the Phliasians. On the road from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> is a small city Cleonae. They say that Cleones was a son of Pelops, though there are some who say that Cleone was one of the daughters of Asopus, that flows by the side of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>. Be this as it may, one or other of these two accounts for the name of the city. Here there is a sanctuary of Athena, and the image is a work of Scyllis and Dipoenus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. sixth cent. B.C.</note> Some hold them to have been the pupils of Daedalus, but others will have it that Daedalus took a wife from <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>, and that Dipoenus and Scyllis were his sons by this woman. Cleonae possesses this sanctuary and the tomb of Eurytus and Cteatus. The story is that as they were going as ambassadors from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> to the Isthmian contest they were here shot by Heracles, who charged them with being his adversaries in the war against Augeas.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From Cleonae to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> are two roads; one is direct and only for active men, the other goes along the pass called Tretus (Pierced), is narrow like the other, being surrounded by mountains, but is nevertheless more suitable for carriages. In these mountains is still shown the cave of the famous lion, and the place <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName> is distant some fifteen stades. In <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName> is a noteworthy temple of Nemean Zeus, but I found that the roof had fallen in and that there was no longer remaining any image. Around the temple is a grove of cypress trees, and here it is, they say, that Opheltes was placed by his nurse in the grass and killed by the serpent.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Argives offer burnt sacrifices to Zeus in <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName> also, and elect a priest of Nemean Zeus; moreover they offer a prize for a race in armour at the winter celebration of the Nemean games. In this place is the grave of Opheltes; around it is a fence of stones, and within the enclosure are altars. There is also a mound of earth which is the tomb of Lycurgus, the father of Opheltes. The spring they call Adrastea for some reason or other, perhaps because Adrastus found it. The land was named, they say, after <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>, who was another daughter of Asopus. Above Nemea is Mount Apesas, where they say that Perseus first sacrificed to Zeus of Apesas.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Ascending to Tretus, and again going along the road to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, you see on the left the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>. The Greeks are aware that the founder of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> was Perseus, so I will narrate the cause of its foundation and the reason why the Argives afterwards laid <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> waste. The oldest tradition in the region now called <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> is that when Inachus was king he named the river after himself and sacrificed to Hera.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also another legend which says that Phoroneus was the first inhabitant of this land, and that Inachus, the father of Phoroneus, was not a man but the river. This river, with the rivers Cephisus and Asterion, judged concerning the land between Poseidon and Hera. They decided that the land belonged to Hera, and so Poseidon made their waters disappear. For this reason neither Inachus nor either of the other rivers I have mentioned provides any water except after rain. In summer their streams are dry except those at <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName>. Phoroneus, the son of Inachus, was the first to gather together the inhabitants, who up to that time had been scattered and living as isolated families. The place into which they were first gathered was named the City of Phoroneus.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="16" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Argus, the grandson of Phoroneus, succeeding to the throne after Phoroneus, gave his name to the land. Argus begat Peirasus and Phorbas, Phorbas begat Triopas, and Triopas begat Iasus and Agenor. Io, the daughter of Iasus, went to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, whether the circumstances be as Herodotus records or as the Greeks say. After Iasus, Crotopus, the son of Agenor, came to the throne and begat Sthenelas, but Danaus sailed from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> against Gelanor, the son of Sthenelas, and stayed the succession to the kingdom of the descendants of Agenor. What followed is known to all alike: the crime the daughters of Danaus committed against their cousins, and how, on the death of Danaus, Lynceus succeeded him.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the sons of Abas, the son of Lynceus, divided the kingdom between themselves; Acrisius remained where he was at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and Proetus took over the Heraeum, Mideia, <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>, and the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> coast region. Traces of the residence of Proetus in <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName> remain to the present day. Afterwards Acrisius, learning that Perseus himself was not only alive but accomplishing great achievements, retired to <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> on the Peneus. And Perseus, wishing at all costs to see the father of his mother and to greet him with fair words and deeds, visited him at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName>. Being in the prime of life and proud of his inventing the quoit, he gave displays before all, and Acrisius, as luck would have it, stepped unnoticed into the path of the quoit.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the prediction of the god to Acrisius found its fulfillment, nor was his fate prevented by his precautions against his daughter and grandson. Perseus, ashamed because of the gossip about the homicide, on his return to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> induced Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, to make an exchange of kingdoms; taking over himself that of Megapenthes, he founded <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>. For on its site the cap (myces) fell from his scabbard, and he regarded this as a sign to found a city. I have also heard the following account. He was thirsty, and the thought occurred to him to pick up a mushroom (myces) from the ground. Drinking with joy water that flowed from it, he gave to the place the name of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Homer in the <title>Odyssey</title> mentions a woman Mycene in the following verse:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Tyro and Alcmene and the fair-crowned lady Mycene.</l></quote><bibl>Hom. Od., unknown line</bibl>. She is said to have been the daughter of Inachus and the wife of Arestor in the poem which the Greeks call the <title>Great Eoeae</title>. So they say that this lady has given her name to the city. But the account which is attributed to Acusilaus, that Myceneus was the son of Sparton, and Sparton of Phoroneus, I cannot accept, because the Lacedaemonians themselves do not accept it either. For the Lacedaemonians have at Amyclae a portrait statue of a woman named Sparte, but they would be amazed at the mere mention of a Sparton, son of Phoroneus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was jealousy which caused the Argives to destroy <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>. For at the time of the Persian invasion the Argives made no move, but the Mycenaeans sent eighty men to Thermopylae who shared in the achievement of the Lacedaemonians. This eagerness for distinction brought ruin upon them by exasperating the Argives. There still remain, however, parts of the city wall, including the gate, upon which stand lions. These, too, are said to be the work of the Cyclopes, who made for Proetus the wall at <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> is a fountain called Persea; there are also underground chambers of Atreus and his children, in which were stored their treasures.

As for the tomb of Cassandra, it is claimed by the Lacedaemonians who dwell around Amyclae.

Beside the road flows the brook called Water of Freedom. The priestesses use it in purifications and for such sacrifices as are secret. The sanctuary itself is on a lower part of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> is the name they give to the hill here, saying that Asterion the river had three daughters, <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Prosymna">Prosymna</placeName>, and Acraea, and that they were nurses of Hera.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The hill opposite the Heraeum they name after Acraea, the environs of the sanctuary they name after <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, and the land beneath the Heraeum after <placeName key="perseus,Prosymna">Prosymna</placeName>. This Asterion flows above the Heraeum, and falling into a cleft disappears. On its banks grows a plant, which also is called asterion. They offer the plant itself to Hera, and from its leaves weave her garlands.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is said that the architect of the temple was Eupolemus, an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>.

Before the entrance stand statues of women who have been priestesses to Hera and of various heroes, including Orestes. They say that Orestes is the one with the inscription, that it represents the Emperor Augustus. In the fore-temple are on the one side ancient statues of the Graces, and on the right a couch of Hera and a votive offering, the shield which Menelaus once took from Euphorbus at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The statue of Hera is seated on a throne; it is huge, made of gold and ivory, and is a work of Polycleitus. She is wearing a crown with Graces and Seasons worked upon it, and in one hand she carries a pomegranate and in the other a sceptre. About the pomegranate I must say nothing, for its story is somewhat of a holy mystery. The presence of a cuckoo seated on the sceptre they explain by the story that when Zeus was in love with Hera in her maidenhood he changed himself into this bird, and she caught it to be her pet. This tale and similar legends about the gods I relate without believing them, but I relate them nevertheless.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the side of Hera stands what is said to be an image of Hebe fashioned by Naucydes; it, too, is of ivory and gold.

This is of silver, but the peacock dedicated by the Emperor Hadrian is of gold and gleaming stones. He dedicated it because they hold the bird to be sacred to Hera. There lie here a golden crown and a purple robe, offerings of Nero.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Above this temple are the foundations of the earlier temple and such parts of it as were spared by the flames. It was burnt down because sleep overpowered Chryseis, the priestess of Hera, when the lamp before the wreaths set fire to them. Chryseis went to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> and supplicated Athena Alea. Although so great a disaster had befallen them the Argives did not take down the statue of Chryseis; it is still in position in front of the burnt temple.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By the side of the road from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> there is on the left hand a hero-shrine of Perseus. The neighboring folk, then, pay him honors here, but the greatest honors are paid to him in Seriphus and among the Athenians, who have a precinct sacred to Perseus and an altar of Dictys and Clymene, who are called the saviours of Perseus. Advancing a little way in the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> territory from this hero-shrine one sees on the right the grave of Thyestes. On it is a stone ram, because Thyestes obtained the golden lamb after debauching his brother's wife. But Atreus was not restrained by prudence from retaliating, but contrived the slaughter of the children of Thyestes and the banquet of which the poets tell us.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But as to what followed, I cannot say for certain whether Aegisthus began the sin or whether Agamemnon sinned first in murdering Tantalus, the son of Thyestes. It is said that Tantalus had received Clytaemnestra in marriage from Tyndareus when she was still a virgin. I myself do not wish to condemn them of having been wicked by nature; but if the pollution of Pelops and the avenging spirit of Myirtilus dogged their steps so long, it was after all only consistent that the Pythian priestess said to the Spartan Glaucus, the son of Epicydes, who consulted her about breaking his oath, that the punishment for this also comes upon the descendants of the sinner.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A little beyond the Rams—this is the name they give to the tomb of Thyestes—there is on the left a place called <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName> and a sanctuary of Mysian Demeter, so named from a man Mysius who, say the Argives, was one of those who entertained Demeter. Now this sanctuary has no roof, but in it is another temple, built of burnt brick, and wooden images of the Maid, Pluto and Demeter. Farther on is a river called Inachus, and on the other side of it an altar of Helius (the Sun). After this you will come to a gate named after the sanctuary near it. This sanctuary belongs to Eileithyia.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Argives are the only Greeks that I know of who have been divided into three kingdoms. For in the reign of Anaxagoras, son of Argeus, son of Megapenthes, the women were smitten with madness, and straying from their homes they roamed about the country, until Melampus the son of Amythaon cured them of the plague on condition that he himself and his brother Bias had a share of the kingdom equal to that of Anaxagoras. Now descended from Bias five men, Neleids on their mother's side, occupied the throne for four generations down to Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, and descended from Melampus six men in six generations down to Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the native house of the family of Anaxagoras ruled longer than the other two. For Iphis, son of Alector, son of Anaxagoras, left the throne to Sthenelus, son of Capaneus his brother. After the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, Amphilochus migrated to the people now called the Amphilochians, and, Cyanippus having died without issue, Cylarabes, son of Sthenelus, became sole king. However, he too left no offspring, and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> was seized by Orestes, son of Agamemnon, who was a neighbor. Besides his ancestral dominion, he had extended his rule over the greater part of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and had succeeded to the throne of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; he also had a contingent of Phocian allies always ready to help him.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Orestes became king of the Lacedaemonians, they themselves consented to accept him for they considered that the sons of the daughter of Tyndareus had a claim to the throne prior to that of Nicostratus and Megapenthes, who were sons of Menelaus by a slave woman. On the death of Orestes, there succeeded to the throne Tisamenus, the son of Orestes and of <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName>, the daughter of Menelaus. The mother of Penthilus, the bastard son of Orestes, was, according to the poet Cinaethon, Erigone, the daughter of Aegisthus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was in the reign of this Tisamenus that the Heracleidae returned to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>; they were Temenus and Cresphontes, the sons of Aristomachus, together with the sons of the third brother, Aristodemus, who had died. Their claim to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and to the throne of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> was, in my opinion, most just, because Tisamenus was descended from Pelops, but the Heracleidae were descendants of Perseus. Tyndareus himself, they made out, had been expelled by Hippocoon, and they said that Heracles, having killed Hippocoon and his sons, had given the land in trust to Tyndareus. They gave the same kind of account about <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> also, that it had been given in trust to Nestor by Heracles after he had taken Pylus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they expelled Tisamenus from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and the descendants of Nestor from <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, namely Alcmaeon, son of Sillus, son of Thrasymedes, Peisistratus, son of Peisistratus, and the sons of Paeon, son of Antilochus, and with them Melanthus, son of Andropompus, son of Borus, son of Penthilus, son of Periclymenus. So Tisamenus and his sons went with his army to the land that is now <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="19" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is not to my purpose that I should set forth here the history of Cresphontes and of the sons of Aristodemus. But Temenus openly employed, instead of his sons, Delphontes, son of Antimachus, son of Thrasyanor, son of Ctesippus, son of Heracles, as general in war and as adviser on all occasions. Even before this he had made him his son-in-law, while Hyrnetho was his favorite daughter; he was accordingly suspected of intending to divert the throne to her and Delphontes. For this reason his sons plotted against him, and Ceisus, the eldest of them, seized the kingdom.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But from the earliest times the Argives have loved freedom and self-government, and they limited to the utmost the authority of their kings, so that to Medon, the son of Ceisus, and to his descendants was left a kingdom that was such only in name. Meltas, the son of Lacedas, the tenth descendant of Medon, was condemned by the people and deposed altogether from the kingship.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most famous building in the city of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> is the sanctuary of Apollo Lycius (Wolf-god). The modern image was made by the Athenian Attalus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A sculptor of unknown date</note> but the original temple and wooden image were the offering of Danaus. I am of opinion that in those days all images, especially Egyptian images, were made of wood. The reason why Danaus founded a sanctuary of Apollo Lycius was this. On coming to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> he claimed the kingdom against Gelanor, the son of Sthenelas. Many plausible arguments were brought forward by both parties, and those of Sthenelas were considered as fair as those of his opponent; so the people, who were sitting in judgment, put off, they say, the decision to the following day.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At dawn a wolf fell upon a herd of oxen that was pasturing before the wall, and attacked and fought with the bull that was the leader of the herd. It occurred to the Argives that Gelanor was like the bull and Danaus like the wolf, for as the wolf will not live with men, so Danaus up to that time had not lived with them. It was because the wolf overcame the bull that Danaus won the kingdom. Accordingly, believing that Apollo had brought the wolf on the herd, he founded a sanctuary of Apollo Lycius.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here is dedicated the throne of Danaus, and here Is placed a statue of Biton, in the form of a man carrying a bull on his shoulders. According to the poet Lyceas, when the Argives were holding a sacrifice to Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>, Biton by sheer physical strength took up a bull and carried it there. Next to this statue is a fire which they keep burning, calling it the fire of Phoroneus. For they do not admit that fire was given to mankind by Prometheus, but insist in assigning the discovery of fire to Phoroneus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As to the wooden images of Aphrodite and Hermes, the one they say was made by Epeus, while the other is a votive offering of Hypermnestra. She was the only one of the daughters of Danaus who neglected his command,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">To kill their husbands.</note> and was accordingly brought to justice by him, because be considered that his life was in danger so long as Lynceus was at large, and that the refusal to share in the crime of her sisters increased the disgrace of the contriver of the deed. On her trial she was acquitted by the Argives, and to commemorate her escape she dedicated an image of Aphrodite, the Bringer of Victory.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Within the temple is a statue of Ladas, the swiftest runner of his time, and one of Hermes with a tortoise which he has caught to make a lyre.

The maiden is thought to be Artemis. Danaus dedicated these, and some pillars hard by and wooden images of Zeus and Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here are graves; one is that of Linus, the son of Apollo by Psamathe, the daughter of Crotopus; the other, they say, is that of Linus the poet.

<div n="20" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Passing over a statue of Creugas, a boxer, and a trophy that was set up to celebrate a victory over the Corinthians, you come to a seated image of Zeus Meilichius (Gracious), made of white marble by Polycleitus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date from="-0480" to="-0410">480-410 B.C.</date></note> I discovered that it was made for the following reason. Ever since the Lacedaemonians began to make war upon the Argives there was no cessation of hostilities until Philip, the son of Amyntas, forced them to stay within the original boundaries of their territories. Before this, if the Lacedaemonians were not engaged on some business outside the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, they were always trying to annex a piece of <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> territory; or if they were busied with a war beyond their borders it was the turn of the Argives to retaliate.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the hatred of both sides was at its height, the Argives resolved to maintain a thousand picked men. The commander appointed over them was the Argive Bryas. His general behavior to the men of the people was violent, and a maiden who was being taken to the bridegroom he seized from those who were escorting her and ravished. When night came on, the girl waited until he was asleep and put out his eyes. Detected in the morning, she took refuge as a suppliant with the people. When they did not give her up to the Thousand for punishment both sides took up arms; the people won the day, and in their anger left none of their opponents alive.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0418">418 B.C.</date></note> Subsequently they had recourse to purifications for shedding kindred blood; among other things they dedicated an image of Zeus Meilichius.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hard by are Cleobis and Biton carved in relief on stone, themselves drawing the carriage and taking in it their mother to the sanctuary of Hera.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The tomb near this they call that of the maenad Chorea, saying that she was one of the women who joined Dionysus in his expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and that Perseus, being victorious in the battle, put most of the women to the sword. To the rest they gave a common grave, but to Chorea they gave burial apart because of her high rank.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A little farther on is a sanctuary of the Seasons. On coming back from here you see statues of Polyneices, the son of Oedipus, and of all the chieftains who with him were killed in battle at the wall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. These men Aeschylus has reduced to the number of seven only, although there were more chiefs than this in the expedition, from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, from <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, with some even from <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.

Among their company were also Euryalus, son of Mecisteus, and Adrastus and Timeas, sons of Polyneices.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from the statues are shown the tomb of Danaus and a cenotaph of the Argives who met their death at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> or on the journey home.

On the right of the entrance is the sanctuary of Cephisus. It is said that the water of this river was not utterly destroyed by Poseidon, but that just in this place, where the sanctuary is, it can be heard flowing under the earth.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beside the sanctuary of Cephisus is a head of Medusa made of stone, which is said to be another of the works of the Cyclopes. The ground behind it is called even at the present time the Place of Judgment, because it was here that they say Hypermnestra was brought to judgment by Danaus. Not far from this is a theater. In it are some noteworthy sights, including a representation of a man killing another, namely the Argive Perilaus, the son of Alcenor, killing the Spartan Othryadas. Before this, Perilaus had succeeded in winning the prize for wrestling at the Nemean games.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Above the theater is a sanctuary of Aphrodite, and before the image is a slab with a representation wrought on it in relief of Telesilla, the lyric poetess. Her books lie scattered at her feet, and she herself holds in her hand an helmet, which she is looking at and is about to place on her head. Telesilla was a distinguished woman who was especially renowned for her poetry. It happened that the Argives had suffered an awful defeat at the hands of Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandrides, and the Lacedaemonians. Some fell in the actual fighting; others, who had fled to the grove of Argus, also perished. At first they left sanctuary under an agreement, which was treacherously broken, and the survivors, when they realized this, were burnt to death in the grove. So when Cleomenes led his troops to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> there were no men to defend it.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0510">510 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Telesilla mounted on the wall all the slaves and such as were incapable of bearing arms through youth or old age, and she herself, collecting the arms in the sanctuaries and those that were left in the houses, armed the women of vigorous age, and then posted them where she knew the enemy would attack. When the Lacedaemonians came on, the women were not dismayed at their battle-cry, but stood their ground and fought valiantly. Then the Lacedaemonians, realizing that to destroy the women would be an invidious success while defeat would mean a shameful disaster, gave way before the women.</p></div>

The sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed Persuasion, is another offering of Hypermnestra after winning the trial to which she was brought by her father because of Lynceus. Here there is also a bronze statue of Aeneas, and a place called Delta. I intentionally do not discuss the origin of the name, because I could not accept the traditional accounts.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In front of it stands an altar of Zeus Phyxius (God of Fight), and near is the tomb of Hypermnestra, the mother of Amphiaraus, the other tomb being that of Hypermnestra, the daughter of Danaus, with whom is also buried Lynceus. Opposite these is the grave of Talaus, the son of Bias; the history of Bias and his descendants I have already given.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A sanctuary of Athena Trumpet they say was founded by Hegeleos. This Hegeleos, according to the story, was the son of Tyrsenus, and Tyrsenus was the son of Heracles and the Lydian woman; Tyrsenus invented the trumpet, and Hegeleos, the son of Tyrsenus, taught the Dorians with Temenus how to play the instrument, and for this reason gave Athena the surname Trumpet. Before the temple of Athena is, they say, the grave of Epimenides. The <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> story is that the Lacedaemonians made war upon the Cnossians and took Epimenides alive; they then put him to death for not prophesying good luck to them, and the Argives taking his body buried it here.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The building of white marble in just about the middle of the marketplace is not, as the Argives declare, a trophy in honor of a victory over Pyrrhus of Epeirus, but it can be shown that his body was burnt here, and that this is his monument, on which are carved in relief the elephants and his other instruments of warfare. This building then was set up where the pyre stood, but the bones of Pyrrhus lie in the sanctuary of Demeter, beside which, as I have shown in my account of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, his death occurred.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from the building in the market-place of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> is a mound of earth, in which they say lies the head of the Gorgon Medusa. I omit the miraculous, but give the rational parts of the story about her. After the death of her father, Phorcus, she reigned over those living around Lake Tritonis, going out hunting and leading the Libyans to battle. On one such occasion, when she was encamped with an army over against the forces of Perseus, who was followed by picked troops from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, she was assassinated by night. Perseus, admiring her beauty even in death, cut off her head and carried it to show the Greeks.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Procles, the son of Eucrates, a Carthaginian, thought a different account more plausible than the preceding. It is as follows. Among the incredible monsters to be found in the Libyan desert are wild men and wild women. Procles affirmed that he had seen a man from them who had been brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. So he guessed that a woman wandered from them, reached Lake Tritonis, and harried the neighbours until Perseus killed her; Athena was supposed to have helped him in this exploit, because the people who live around Lake Tritonis are sacred to her.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, by the side of this monument of the Gorgon, is the grave of Gorgophone (Gorgon-kilIer), the daughter of Perseus. As soon as you hear the name you can understand the reason why it was given her. On the death of her husband, Perieres, the son of Aeolus, whom she married when a virgin, she married Oebalus, being the first woman, they say, to marry a second time; for before this wives were wont, on the death of their husbands, to live as widows.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In front of the grave is a trophy of stone made to commemorate a victory over an Argive Laphaes.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the Argives say that these two built originally the temple to Leto, but I think that none of Niobe's children survived, for I place more reliance than others on the poetry of Homer, one of whose verses bears out my view:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Though they were only two, yet they gave all to destruction.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

For when the Greeks, as they were returning from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, met with the shipwreck at Caphereus, those of the Argives who were able to escape to land suffered from cold and hunger. Having prayed that someone of the gods should prove himself a saviour in their present distress, straightway as they advanced they came upon a cave of Dionysus; in the cave was an image of the god, and on this occasion wild she-goats had gathered there to escape from the storm. These the Argives killed, using the flesh as food and the skins as raiment. When the storm was over and the Argives, having refitted their ships, were returning home, they took with them the wooden image from the cave, and continue to honor it to the present day.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Very near to the temple of Dionysus you will see the house of Adrastus, farther on a sanctuary of Amphiaraus, and opposite the sanctuary the tomb of Eriphyle.

When the rout took place at the wall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the earth opened and received Amphiaraus and his chariot, swallowing up this Baton at the same time.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Returning from Hollow Street, you see what they say is the grave of Hyrnetho. If they allow that it is merely a cenotaph erected to the memory of the lady, their account is likely enough but if they believe that the corpse lies here I cannot credit it, and leave anyone to do so who has not learnt the history of <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Argives, like the Athenians and Sicyorians, worship Artemis Pheraea, and they, too, assert that the image of the goddess was brought from Pherae in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. But I cannot agree with them when they say that in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> are the tombs of Deianeira, the daughter of Oeneus, and of Helenus, son of Priam, and that there is among them the image of Athena that was brought from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, thus causing the capture of that city. For the Palladium, as it is called, was manifestly brought to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by Aeneas.

Now even the guides of the Argives themselves are aware that their account is not entirely correct.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>for instance, an underground building over which was the bronze chamber which Acrisius once made to guard his daughter.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was afterwards called the precinct of the Cretan god, because, when Ariadne died, Dionysus buried her here.

As you go up the citadel you come to the sanctuary of Hera of the Height, and also a temple of Apollo, which is said to have been first built by Pythaeus when he came from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. The present image is a bronze standing figure called Apollo Deiradiotes, because this place, too, is called Deiras (Ridge). Oracular responses are still given here, and the oracle acts in the following way. There is a woman who prophesies, being debarred from intercourse with a man. Every month a lamb is sacrificed at night, and the woman, after tasting the blood, becomes inspired by the god.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Adjoining the temple of Apollo Deiradiotes is a sanctuary of Athena Oxyderces (Sharp-sighted), dedicated by Diomedes, because once when he was fighting at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> the goddess removed the mist from his eyes.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the top of <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> is a temple of Zeus, surnamed Larisaean, which has no roof; the wooden image I found no longer standing upon its pedestal. There is also a temple of Athena worth seeing. Here are placed votive offerings, including a wooden image of Zeus, which has two eyes in the natural place and a third on its forehead. This Zeus, they say, was a paternal god of Priam, the son of Laomedon, set up in the uncovered part of his court, and when <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was taken by the Greeks Priam took sanctuary at the altar of this god. When the spoils were divided, Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus, received the image, and for this reason it has been dedicated here.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The reason for its three eyes one might infer to be this. That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men.

On the right is Mount Lycone, which has trees on it, chiefly cypresses. On the top of the mountain is built a sanctuary of Artemis Orthia (of the Steep), and there have been made white-marble images of Apollo, Leto, and Artemis, which they say are works of Polycleitus. On descending again from the mountain you see on the left of the highway a temple of Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A little farther on there is on the right of the road a mountain called Chaon.

On this road is a sanctuary built with two rooms, having an entrance on the west side and another on the east. At the latter is a wooden image of Aphrodite, and at the west entrance one of Ares. They say that the images are votive offerings of Polyneices and of the Argives who joined him in the campaign to redress his wrongs.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Farther on from here, across the torrent called Charadrus (Gully), is Oenoe, named, the Argives say, after Oeneus.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Above Oenoe is Mount Artemisius, with a sanctuary of Artemis on the top. On this mountain are also the springs of the river Inachus. For it really has springs, though the water does not run far.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here I found nothing else that is worth seeing.  There is another road, that leads to Lyrcea from the gate at the Ridge. The story is that to this place came Lynceus, being the only one of the fifty brothers to escape death, and that on his escape he raised a beacon here. Now to raise the beacon was the signal he had agreed with Hypermnestra to give if he should escape Danaus and reach a place of safety. She also, they say, lighted a beacon on <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> as a sign that she too was now out of danger. For this reason the Argives hold every year a beacon festival.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the first the place was called Lyncea; its present name is derived from Lyrcus, a bastard son of Abas, who afterwards dwelt there.

The distance from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> to Lyrcea is about sixty stades, and the distance from Lyrcea to Orneae is the same. Homer in the Catalogue makes no mention of the city Lyrcea, because at the time of the Greek expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> it already lay deserted; Omeae, however, was inhabited, and in his poem he places it<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The name is derived from Orneus, the son of Erechtheus. This Orneus begat Peteos, and Peteos begat Menestheus, who, with a body of Athenians, helped Agamemnon to destroy the kingdom of Priam. From him then did Omeae get its name, and afterwards the Argives removed all its citizens, who thereupon came to live at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. At Orneae are a sanctuary and an upright wooden image of Artemis; there is besides a temple devoted to all the gods in common. On the further side of Orneae are Sicyonia and Phliasia.</p></div>

Here took place a fight for the throne between Proetus and Acrisius; the contest, they say, ended in a draw, and a reconciliation resulted afterwards, as neither could gain a decisive victory. The story is that they and their hosts were armed with shields, which were first used in this battle. For those that fell on either side was built here a common tomb, as they were fellow citizens and kinsmen.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Going on from here and turning to the right, you come to the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>.

The hero <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>, from whom the city derived its name, is said to have been a son of Argus, a son of Zeus. The wall, which is the only part of the ruins still remaining, is a work of the Cyclopes made of unwrought stones, each stone being so big that a pair of mules could not move the smallest from its place to the slightest degree.

But before you reach <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> itself you will come to the sanctuary of Asclepius. Who dwelt in this land before <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> came to it I do not know, nor could I discover from the natives the descendants of <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> either. But the last king before the Dorians arrived in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> was, they say, Pityreus, a descendant of Ion, son of Xuthus, and they relate that he handed over the land to Deiphontes and the Argives without a struggle.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He went to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with his people and dwelt there, while Deiphontes and the Argives took possession of Epidauria. These on the death of Temenus seceded from the other Argives; Deiphontes and Hyrnetho through hatred of the sons of Temenus, and the army with them, because it respected Deiphontes and Hyrnetho more than Ceisus and his brothers. Epidaurus, who gave the land its name, was, the Eleans say, a son of Pelops but, according to <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> opinion and the poem the <title>Great Eoeae</title>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A poem attributed to Hesiod.</note> the father of <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> was Argus, son of Zeus, while the Epidaurians maintain that <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> was the child of Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That the land is especially sacred to Asclepius is due to the following reason. The Epidaurians say that Phlegyas came to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, ostensibly to see the land, but really to spy out the number of the inhabitants, and whether the greater part of them was warlike. For Phlegyas was the greatest soldier of his time, and making forays in all directions he carried off the crops and lifted the cattle.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he went to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, he was accompanied by his daughter, who all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by Apollo. In the country of the Epidaurians she bore a son, and exposed him on the mountain called Nipple at the present day, but then named Myrtium. As the child lay exposed he was given milk by one of the goats that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-dog of the herd. And when Aresthanas (for this was the herdsman's name)</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>discovered that the tale of the goats was not full, and that the watch-dog also was absent from the herd, he left, they say, no stone unturned, and on finding the child desired to take him up. As he drew near he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and, thinking that it was something divine, as in fact it was, he turned away. Presently it was reported over every land and sea that Asclepius was discovering everything he wished to heal the sick, and that he was raising dead men to life.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also another tradition concerning him. Coronis, they say, when with child with Asclepius, had intercourse with Ischys, son of Elatus. She was killed by Artemis to punish her for the insult done to Apollo, but when the pyre was already lighted Hermes is said to have snatched the child from the flames.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The third account is, in my opinion, the farthest from the truth; it makes Asclepius to be the son of <placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName>, the daughter of Leucippus. For when Apollophanes the Arcadian, came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and asked the god if Asclepius was the son of <placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName> and therefore a Messenian, the Pythian priestess gave this response:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">0 Asclepius, born to bestow great joy upon mortals,</l><l>Pledge of the mutual love I enjoyed with Phlegyas' daughter,</l><l>Lovely Coronis, who bare thee in rugged land <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>.</l></quote><bibl>Unknown</bibl>. This oracle makes it quite certain that Asclepius was not a son of <placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName>, and that the story was a fiction invented by Hesiod, or by one of Hesiod's interpolators, just to please the Messenians.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is other evidence that the god was born in <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> for I find that the most famous sanctuaries of Asclepius had their origin from <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>. In the first place, the Athenians, who say that they gave a share of their mystic rites to Asclepius, call this day of the festival Epidauria, and they allege that their worship of Asclepius dates from then. Again, when Archias, son of Aristaechmus, was healed in Epidauria after spraining himself while hunting about Pindasus, he brought the cult to <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From the one at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> has been built in our own day the sanctuary of Asclepius by the sea at <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>. Further, at Balagrae of the Cyreneans there is an Asclepius called Healer, who like the others came from <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>. From the one at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> was founded the sanctuary of Asclepius at Lebene, in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. There is this difference between the Cyreneans and the Epidaurians, that whereas the former sacrifice goats, it is against the custom of the Epidaurians to do so.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That Asclepius was considered a god from the first, and did not receive the title only in course of time, I infer from several signs, including the evidence of Homer, who makes Agamemnon say about Machaon:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Talthybius, with all speed go summon me hither Machaon,</l><l>Mortal son of Asclepius.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

Over against the temple is the place where the suppliants of the god sleep.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near has been built a circular building of white marble, called Tholos (Round House), which is worth seeing. In it is a picture by Pausias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">1. A famous painter of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>.</note> representing Love, who has cast aside his bow and arrows, and is carrying instead of them a lyre that he has taken up. Here there is also another work of Pausias, Drunkenness drinking out of a crystal cup. You can see even in the painting a crystal cup and a woman's face through it. Within the enclosure stood slabs; in my time six remained, but of old there were more. On them are inscribed the names of both the men and the women who have been healed by Asclepius, the disease also from which each suffered, and the means of cure. The dialect is Doric.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Apart from the others is an old slab, which declares that Hippolytus dedicated twenty horses to the god. The Aricians tell a tale that agrees with the inscription on this slab, that when Hippolytus was killed, owing to the curses of Theseus, Asclepius raised him from the dead. On coming to life again he refused to forgive his father rejecting his prayers, he went to the Aricians in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. There he became king and devoted a precinct to Artemis, where down to my time the prize for the victor in single combat was the priesthood of the goddess. The contest was open to no freeman, but only to slaves who had run away from their masters.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Epidaurians have a theater within the sanctuary, in my opinion very well worth seeing. For while the Roman theaters are far superior to those anywhere else in their splendor, and the Arcadian theater at <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> is unequalled for size, what architect could seriously rival Polycleitus in symmetry and beauty? For it was Polycleitus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Probably the younger artist of that name.</note> who built both this theater and the circular building. Within the grove are a temple of Artemis, an image of Epione, a sanctuary of Aphrodite and Themis, a race-course consisting, like most Greek race-courses, of a bank of earth, and a fountain worth seeing for its roof and general splendour.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A Roman senator, Antoninus, made in our own day a bath of Asclepius and a sanctuary of the gods they call Bountiful.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="0138">138</date> or <date when="0161">161 A.D.</date></note> He made also a temple to Health, Asclepius, and Apollo, the last two surnamed Egyptian. He moreover restored the portico that was named the Portico of Cotys, which, as the brick of which it was made had been unburnt, had fallen into utter ruin after it had lost its roof. As the Epidaurians about the sanctuary were in great distress, because their women had no shelter in which to be delivered and the sick breathed their last in the open, he provided a dwelling, so that these grievances also were redressed. Here at last was a place in which without sin a human being could die and a woman be delivered.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Above the grove are the Nipple and another mountain called Cynortium; on the latter is a sanctuary of Maleatian Apollo. The sanctuary itself is an ancient one, but among the things Antoninus made for the Epidaurians are various appurtenances for the sanctuary of the Maleatian, including a reservoir into which the rain-water collects for their use.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The serpents, including a peculiar kind of a yellowish color, are considered sacred to Asclepius, and are tame with men. These are peculiar to Epidauria, and I have noticed that other lands have their peculiar animals. For in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> only are to be found land crocodiles at least two cubits long; from <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> alone are brought, among other creatures, parrots.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go up to Mount Coryphum you see by the road an olive tree called Twisted. It was Heracles who gave it this shape by bending it round with his hand, but I cannot say whether he set it to be a boundary mark against the Asinaeans in <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, since in no land, which has been depopulated, is it easy to discover the truth about the boundaries. On the Top of the mountain there is a sanctuary of Artemis Coryphaea (of the Peak), of which Telesilla<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A famous lyric poetess. See p. 355.</note> made mention in an ode.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On going down to the city of the Epidaurians, you come to a place where wild olives grow; they call it Hyrnethium. I will relate the story of it, which is probable enough, as given by the Epidaurians. Ceisus and the other sons of Temenus knew that they would grieve Deiphontes most if they could find a way to part him and Hyrnetho. So Cerynes and Phalces (for Agraeus, the youngest, disapproved of their plan) came to <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>. Staying their chariot under the wall, they sent a herald to their sister, pretending that they wished to parley with her.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When she obeyed their summons, the young men began to make many accusations against Deiphontes, and besought her much that she would return to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, promising, among other things, to give her to a husband in every respect better than Deiphontes, one who ruled over more subjects and a more prosperous country. But Hyrnetho, pained at their words, gave as good as she had received, retorting that Deiphontes was a dear husband to her, and had shown himself a blameless son-in-law to Temenus; as for them, they ought to be called the murderers of Temenus rather than his sons.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Without further reply the youths seized her, placed her in the chariot, and drove away. An Epidaurian told Deiphontes that Cerynes and Phalces had gone, taking with them Hyrnetho against her will; he himself rushed to the rescue with all speed, and as the Epidaurians learned the news they reinforced him. On overtaking the runaways, Deiphontes shot Cerynes and killed him, but he was afraid to shoot at Phalces, who was holding Hyrnetho, lest he should miss him and become the slayer of his wife; so he closed with them and tried to get her away. But Phalces, holding on and dragging her with greater violence, killed her, as she was with child.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Realizing what he had done to his sister, he began to drive the chariot more recklessly, as he was anxious to gain a start before all the Epidaurians could gather against him. Deiphontes and his children—for before this children had been born to him, Antimenes, Xanthippus, and Argeus, and a daughter, Orsobia, who, they say, after-wards married Pamphylus, son of Aegimius—took up the dead body of Hyrnetho and carried it to this place, which in course of time was named Hyrnethium.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They built for her a hero-shrine, and bestowed upon her various honors; in particular, the custom was established that nobody should carry home, or use for any purpose, the pieces that break off the olive trees, or any other trees, that grow there; these are left there on the spot to be sacred to Hyrnetho.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The most noteworthy things which I found the city of <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> itself had to show are these. There is, of course, a precinct of Asclepius, with images of the god himself and of Epione. Epione, they say, was the wife of Asclepius. These are of Parian marble, and are set up in the open. There is also in the city a temple of Dionysus and one of Artemis. The figure of Artemis one might take to be the goddess hunting. There is also a sanctuary of Aphrodite, while the one at the harbor, on a height that juts out into the sea, they say is Hera's. The Athena on the citadel, a wooden image worth seeing, they surname Cissaea (Ivy Goddess).</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Aeginetans dwell in the island over against Epidauria. It is said that in the beginning there were no men in it; but after Zeus brought to it, when uninhabited, <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, daughter of Asopus, its name was changed from Oenone to <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>; and when Aeacus, on growing up, asked Zeus for settlers, the god, they say, raised up the inhabitants out of the earth. They can mention no king of the island except Aeacus, since we know of none even of the sons of Aeacus who stayed there; for to Peleus and Telamon befell exile for the murder of Phocus, while the sons of Phocus made their home about <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, in the land that is now called <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This name had already been given to the land, at the time when Phocus, son of Ornytion, came to it a generation previously. In the time, then, of this Phocus only the district about <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> was called <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, but in the time of Aeacus the name spread to all from the borders of the Minyae at <placeName key="perseus,Orchomenos">Orchomenos</placeName> to Scarphea among the <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From Peleus sprang the kings in Epeirus; but as for the sons of Telamon, the family of Ajax is undistinguished, because he was a man who lived a private life; though Miltiades, who led the Athenians to Marathon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0490">490 B.C.</date></note> and Cimon, the son of Miltiades, achieved renown; but the family of Teucer continued to be the royal house in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> down to the time of Evagoras. Asius the epic poet says that to Phocus were born Panopeus and Crisus. To Panopeus was born Epeus, who made, according to Homer, the wooden horse; and the grandson of Crisus was Pylades, whose father was Strophius, son of Crisus, while his mother was Anaxibi ,sister of Agamemnon. Such was the pedigree of the Aeacidae (family of. Aeacus), as they are called, but they departed from the beginning to other lands.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Subsequently a division of the Argives who, under Deiphontes, had seized <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, crossed to <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, and, settling among the old Aeginetans, established in the island Dorian manners and the Dorian dialect. Although the Aeginetans rose to great power, so that their navy was superior to that of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and in the Persian war supplied more ships than any state except <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, yet their prosperity was not permanent but when the island was depopulated by the Athenians,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0431">431 B.C.</date></note> they took up their abode at Thyrea, in <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, which the Lacedaemonians gave them to dwell in. They recovered their island when the Athenian warships were captured in the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0405">405 B.C.</date></note> yet it was never given them to rise again to their old wealth or power.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the Greek islands, <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> is the most difficult of access, for it is surrounded by sunken rocks and reefs which rise up. The story is that Aeacus devised this feature of set purpose, because he feared piratical raids by sea, and wished the approach to be perilous to enemies. Near the harbor in which vessels mostly anchor is a temple of Aphrodite, and in the most conspicuous part of the city what is called the shrine of Aeacus, a quadrangular enclosure of white marble.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Wrought in relief at the entrance are the envoys whom the Greeks once dispatched to Aeacus. The reason for the embassy given by the Aeginetans is the same as that which the other Greeks assign. A drought had for some time afflicted <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and no rain fell either beyond the Isthmus or in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, until at last they sent envoys to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to ask what was the cause and to beg for deliverance from the evil. The Pythian priestess bade them propitiate Zeus, saying that he would not listen to them unless the one to supplicate him were Aeacus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And so envoys came with a request to Aeacus from each city. By sacrifice and prayer to Zeus, God of all the Greeks (Panellenios), he caused rain to fall upon the earth, and the Aeginetans made these likenesses of those who came to him. Within the enclosure are olive trees that have grown there from of old, and there is an altar which is raised but a little from the ground. That this altar is also the tomb of Aeacus is told as a holy secret.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside the shrine of Aeacus is the grave of Phocus, a barrow surrounded by a basement, and on it lies a rough stone. When Telamon and Peleus had induced Phocus to compete at the pentathlon, and it was now the turn of Peleus to hurl the stone, which they were using for a quoit, he intentionally hit Phocus. The act was done to please their mother; for, while they were both born of the daughter of Sciron, Phocus was not, being, if indeed the report of the Greeks be true, the son of a sister of Thetis. I believe it was for this reason, and not only out of friendship for Orestes, that Pylades plotted the murder of Neoptolemus.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When this blow of the quoit killed Phocus, the sons of Endeis boarded a ship and fled. Afterwards Telamon sent a herald denying that he had plotted the death of Phocus. Aeacus, however, refused to allow him to land on the island, and bade him make his defence standing on board ship, or if he wished, from a mole raised in the sea. So he sailed into the harbor called Secret, and proceeded to make a mole by night. This was finished, and still remains at the present day. But Telamon, being condemned as implicated in the murder of Phocus, sailed away a second time and came to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not far from the Secret Harbor is a theater worth seeing; it is very similar to the one at <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, both in size and in style. Behind it is built one side of a race-course, which not only itself holds up the theater, but also in turn uses it as a support.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="30" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are three temples close together, one of Apollo, one of Artemis, and a third of Dionysus. Apollo has a naked wooden image of native workmanship, but Artemis is dressed, and so, too, is Dionysus, who is, moreover, represented with a beard. The sanctuary of Asclepius is not here, but in another place, and his image is of stone, and seated.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the gods, the Aeginetans worship most Hecate, in whose honor every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thracian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. c. <date when="-0460">460 B.C.</date></note> and it has one face and one body. It was Alcamenes,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A contemporary of Pheidias.</note> in my opinion, who first made three images of Hecate attached to one another, a figure called by the Athenians Epipurgidia (on the Tower); it stands beside the temple of the Wingless Victory.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, as you go towards the mountain of Zeus, God of all the Greeks, you reach a sanctuary of Aphaea, in whose honor Pindar composed an ode for the Aeginetans. The Cretans say (the story of Aphaea is Cretan) that Carmanor, who purified Apollo after he had killed <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, was the father of Eubulus, and that the daughter of Zeus and of Carme, the daughter of Eubulus, was Britomartis. She took delight, they say, in running and in the chase, and was very dear to Artemis. Fleeing from Minos, who had fallen in love with her, she threw herself into nets which had been cast (aphemena) for a draught of fishes. She was made a goddess by Artemis, and she is worshipped, not only by the Cretans, but also by the Aeginetans, who say that Britomartis shows herself in their island. Her surname among the Aeginetans is Aphaea; in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> it is Dictynna (Goddess of Nets).</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Mount of all the Greeks, except for the sanctuary of Zeus, has, I found, nothing else worthy of mention. This sanctuary, they say, was made for Zeus by Aeacus. The story of Auxesia and Damia, how the Epidaurians suffered from drought, how in obedience to an oracle they had these wooden images made of olive wood that they received from the Athenians, how the Epidaurians left off paying to the Athenians what they had agreed to pay, on the ground that the Aeginetans had the images, how the Athenians perished who crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> to fetch them—all this, as Herodotus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hdt. 5.82">Hdt. 5.82-87</bibl></note> has described it accurately and in detail, I have no intention of relating, because the story has been well told already; but I will add that I saw the images, and sacrificed to them in the same way as it is customary to sacrifice at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So much I must relate about <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, for the sake of Aeacus and his exploits. Bordering on Epidauria are the Troezenians, unrivalled glorifiers of their own country. They say that Orus was the first to be born in their land. Now, in my opinion, Orus is an Egyptian name and utterly un-Greek; but they assert that he became their king, and that the land was called Oraea after him and that Althepus, the son of Poseidon and of Leis, the daughter of Orus, inheriting the kingdom after Orus, named the land Althepia.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>During his reign, they say, Athena and Poseidon disputed about the land, and after disputing held it in common, as Zeus commanded them to do. For this reason they worship both Athena, whom they name both Polias (Urban) and Sthenias (Strong), and also Poseidon, under the surname of King. And moreover their old coins have as device a trident and a face of Athena.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After Althepus, Saron became king. They said that this man built the sanctuary for Saronian Artemis by a sea which is marshy and shallow, so that for this reason it was called the Phoebaean lagoon. Now Saron was very fond of hunting. As he was chasing a doe, it so chanced that it dashed into the sea and he dashed in alter it. The doe swam further and further from the shore, and Saron kept close to his prey, until his ardor brought him to the open ocean. Here his strength failed, and he was drowned in the waves. The body was cast ashore at the grove of Artemis by the Phoebaean lagoon, and they buried it within the sacred enclosure, and after him they named the sea in these parts the Saronic instead of the Phoebaean lagoon.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They know nothing of the later kings down to Hyperes and Anthas. These they assert to be sons of Poseidon and of Alcyone, daughter of Atlas, adding that they founded in the country the cities of Hyperea and <placeName key="perseus,Anthea">Anthea</placeName>; Aetius, however, the son of Anthas, on inheriting the kingdoms of his father and of his uncle, named one of the cities Poseidonias. When <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> and Pittheus came to Aetius there were three kings instead of one, but the sons of Pelops enjoyed the balance of power.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here is evidence of it. When <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> died, Pittheus gathered the inhabitants together, incorporating both Hyperea and <placeName key="perseus,Anthea">Anthea</placeName> into the modern city, which he named <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> after his brother. Many years afterwards the descendants of Aetius, son of Anthas, were dispatched as colonists from <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, and founded <placeName key="tgn,7016142">Halicarnassus</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Myndus">Myndus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>. Anaphlystus and Sphettus, sons of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, migrated to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and the parishes are named after them. As my readers know it already, I shall not relate the story of Theseus, the grandson of Pittheus. There is, however, one incident that I must add.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the return of the Heracleidae, the Troezenians too received Dorian settlers from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. They had been subject at even an earlier date to the Argives; Homer, too, in the Catalogue, says that their commander was Diomedes. For Diomedes and Euryalus, son of Mecisteus, who were guardians of the boy Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, led the Argives to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Sthenelus, as I have related above, came of a more illustrious family, called the Anaxagoridae, and he had the best claim to the Kingdom of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. Such is the story of the Troezenians, with the exception of the cities that claim to be their colonies. I will now proceed to describe the appointments of their sanctuaries and the remarkable sights of their country.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="31" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the market-place of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> is a temple of Artemis Saviour, with images of the goddess. It was said that the temple was founded and the name Saviour given by Theseus when he returned from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> after overcoming Asterion the son of Minos. This victory he considered the most noteworthy of his achievements, not so much, in my opinion, because Asterion was the bravest of those killed by Theseus, but because his success in unravelling the difficult Maze and in escaping unnoticed after the exploit made credible the saying that it was divine providence that brought Theseus and his company back in safety.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In this temple are altars to the gods said to rule under the earth. It is here that they say Semele was brought out of Hell by Dionysus, and that Heracles dragged up the Hound of Hell.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Cerberus, the fabulous watch-dog.</note> But I cannot bring myself to believe even that Semele died at all, seeing that she was the wife of Zeus; while, as for the so-called Hound of Hell, I will give my views in another place.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 3.25.6">Paus. 3.25.6</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Behind the temple is the tomb of Pittheus, on which are placed three seats of white marble. On them they say that Pittheus and two men with him used to sit in judgment. Not far off is a sanctuary of the Muses, made, they told me, by Ardalus, son of Hephaestus. This Ardalus they hold to have invented the flute, and after him they name the Muses Ardalides. Here, they say, Pittheus taught the art of rhetoric, and I have myself read a book purporting to be a treatise by Pittheus, published by a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>. Not far from the Muses' Hall is an old altar, which also, according to report, was dedicated by Ardalus. Upon it they sacrifice to the Muses and to Sleep, saying that Sleep is the god that is dearest to the Muses.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near the theater a temple of Artemis Lycea (Wolfish) was made by Hippolytus. About this surname I could learn nothing from the local guides, but I gathered that either Hippolytus destroyed wolves that were ravaging the land of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, or else that Lycea is a surname of Artemis among the Amazons, from whom he was descended through his mother. Perhaps there may be another explanation that I am unaware of. The stone in front of the temple, called the Sacred Stone, they say is that on which nine men of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> once purified Orestes from the stain of matricide.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from Artemis Lycea are altars close to one another. The first of them is to Dionysus, surnamed, in accordance with an oracle, Saotes (Saviour); the second is named the altar of the Themides (Laws), and was dedicated, they say, by Pittheus. They had every reason, it seems to me, for making an altar to Helius Eleutherius (Sun, God of Freedom), seeing that they escaped being enslaved by Xerxes and the Persians.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary of Thearian Apollo, they told me, was set up by Pittheus; it is the oldest I know of. Now the Phocaeans, too, in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> have an old temple of Athena, which was once burnt by Harpagus the Persian, and the Samians also have an old one of Pythian Apollo; these, however, were built much later than the sanctuary at <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>. The modern image was dedicated by Auliscus, and made by Hermon of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>. This Hermon made also the wooden images of the Dioscuri.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Under a portico in the market-place are set up women; both they and their children are of stone. They are the women and children whom the Athenians gave to the Troezenians to be kept safe, when they had resolved to evacuate <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and not to await the attack of the Persians by land. They are said to have dedicated likenesses, not of all the women—for, as a matter of fact, the statues are not many—but only of those who were of high rank.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In front of the sanctuary of Apollo is a building called the Booth of Orestes. For before he was cleansed for shedding his mother's blood, no citizen of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> would receive him into his home; so they lodged him here and gave him entertainment while they cleansed him, until they had finished the purification. Down to the present day the descendants of those who cleansed Orestes dine here on appointed days. A little way from the booth were buried, they say, the means of cleansing, and from them grew up a bay tree, which, indeed, still remains, being the one before this booth.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Among the means of cleansing which they say they used to cleanse Orestes was water from Hippocrene (Horse's Fount) for the Troezenians too have a fountain called the Horse's, and the legend about it does not differ from the one which prevails in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>. For they, too, say that the earth sent up the water when the horse Pegasus struck the ground with his hoof, and that Bellerophontes came to <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> to ask Pittheus to give him Aethra to wife, but before the marriage took place he was banished from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here there is also a Hermes called Polygius. Against this image, they say, Heracles leaned his club. Now this club, which was of wild olive, taking root in the earth (if anyone cares to believe the story), grew up again and is still alive; Heracles, they say, discovering the wild olive by the Saronic Sea, cut a club from it. There is also a sanctuary of Zeus surnamed Saviour, which, they say, was made by Aetius, the son of Anthas, when he was king. To a water they give the name River of Gold. They say that when the land was afflicted with a drought for nine years, during which no rain fell, all the other waters dried up, but this River of Gold even then continued to flow as before.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, is devoted a very famous precinct, in which is a temple with an old image. Diomedes, they say, made these, and, moreover, was the first to sacrifice to Hippolytus. The Troezenians have a priest of Hippolytus, who holds his sacred office for life, and annual sacrifices have been established. They also observe the following custom. Every maiden before marriage cuts off a lock for Hippolytus, and, having cut it, she brings it to the temple and dedicates it. They will not have it that he was dragged to death by his horses, and, though they know his grave, they do not show it. But they believe that what is called the Charioteer in the sky is the Hippolytus of the legend, such being the honor he enjoys from the gods.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Within this enclosure is a temple of Apollo Seafaring, an offering of Diomedes for having weathered the storm that came upon the Greeks as they were returning from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>. They say that Diomedes was also the first to hold the Pythian games in honor of Apollo. Of Damia and Auxesia (for the Troezenians, too, share in their worship) they do not give the same account as the Epidaurians and Aeginetans, but say that they were maidens who came from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. A general insurrection having arisen in the city, these too, they say, were stoned to death by the opposite party; and they hold a festival in their honor that they call Stoning.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the other part of the enclosure is a race-course called that of Hippolytus, and above it a temple of Aphrodite Spy. For from here, whenever Hippolytus practised his exercises, Phaedra, who was in love with him, used to gaze upon him. Here there still grew the myrtle, with its leaves, as I have described above, pierced with holes. When Phaedra was in despair and could find no relief for her passion, she used to vent her spleen upon the leaves of this myrtle.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also the grave of Phaedra, not far from the tomb of Hippolytus, which is a barrow near the myrtle. The image of Asclepius was made by Timotheus, but the Troezenians say that it is not Asclepius, but a likeness of Hippolytus. I remember, too, seeing the house of Hippolytus; before it is what is called the Fountain of Heracles, for Heracles, say the Troezenians, discovered the water.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the citadel is a temple of Athena, called Sthenias. The wooden image itself of the goddess I was made by CalIon, of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">early fifth cent.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On going down from here you come to a sanctuary of Pan Lyterius (Releasing), so named because he showed to the Troezenian magistrates dreams which supplied a cure for the epidemic that had afflicted Troezenia, and the Athenians more than any other people. Having crossed the sanctuary, you can see a temple of Isis, and above it one of Aphrodite of the Height. The temple of Isis was made by the Halicarnassians in <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, because this is their mother-city, but the image of Isis was dedicated by the people of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the road that leads through the mountains to <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName> is a spring of the river Hyllicus, originally called Taurius (Bull-like), and a rock called the Rock of Theseus; when Theseus took up the boots and sword of Aegeus under it, it, too, changed its name, for before it was called the altar of Zeus Sthenius (Strong). Near the rock is a sanctuary of Aphrodite Nymphia (Bridal), made by Theseus when he took Helen to wife.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Outside the wall there is also a sanctuary of Poseidon Nurturer (Phytalmios). For they say that, being wroth with them, Poseidon smote the land with barrenness, brine (halme) reaching the seeds and the roots of the plants (phyta),<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The epithet phytalmios means nourishing, but to judge from the story he gives, Pausanias must have connected it with the Greek words for brine and plant.</note> until, appeased by sacrifices and prayers, he ceased to send up the brine upon the earth. Above the temple of Poseidon is Demeter Lawbringer (Thesmophoros), set up, they say, by Althepus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On going down to the harbor at what is called Celenderis, you come to a place called Birthplace (Genethlion), where Theseus is said to have been born. Before this place is a temple of Ares, for here also did Theseus conquer the Amazons in battle. These must have belonged to the army that strove in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> against Theseus and the Athenians.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you make your way to the Psiphaean Sea you see a wild olive growing, which they call the Bent <term>Rhacos</term>. The Troezenians call <term>rhacos</term> every kind of barren olive—<term>cotinos</term>, <term>phylia</term>, or <term>elaios</term>—and this tree they call Bent because it was when the reins caught in it that the chariot of Hippolytus was upset. Not far from this stands the sanctuary of Saronian Artemis, and I have already given an account of it. I must add that every year they hold in honor of Artemis a festival called Saronia.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Troezenians possess islands, one of which is near the mainland, and it is possible to wade across the channel. This was formerly called Sphaeria, but its name was changed to Sacred Island for the following reason. In it is the tomb of Sphaerus, who, they say, was charioteer to Pelops. In obedience forsooth to a dream from Athena, Aethra crossed over into the island with libations for Sphaerus. After she had crossed, Poseidon is said to have had intercourse with her here. So for this reason Aethra set up here a temple of Athena Apaturia,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Apparently here derived from the Greek word for deceit.</note> and changed the name from Sphaeria to Sacred Island. She also established a custom for the Troezenian maidens of dedicating their girdles before wedlock to Athena Apaturia.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Calaurea, they say, was sacred to Apollo of old, at the time when <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> was sacred to Poseidon.

At any rate, there is a holy sanctuary of Poseidon here, and it is served by a maiden priestess until she reaches an age fit for marriage.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Within the enclosure is also the tomb of Demosthenes. His fate, and that of Homer before him, have, in my opinion, showed most plainly how spiteful the deity is; for Homer, after losing his sight, was, in addition to this great affliction, cursed with a second—a poverty which drove him in beggary to every land; while to Demosthenes it befell to experience exile in his old age and to meet with such a violent end. Now, although concerning him, not only others, but Demosthenes himself, have again and again declared that assuredly he took no part of the money that Harpalus brought from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>,</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>yet I must relate the circumstances of the statement made subsequently.

The steward of his money fled to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and was arrested by a Macedonian, Philoxenus, who also had demanded Harpalus from the Athenians.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Stretching out far into the sea from Troezenia is a peninsula, on the coast of which has been founded a little town called <placeName key="perseus,Methana">Methana</placeName>. Here there is a sanctuary of Isis, and on the market-place is an image of Hermes, and also one of Heracles. Some thirty stades distant from the town are hot baths. They say that it was when Antigonus, son of Demetrius, was king of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName> that the water first appeared, and that what appeared at once was not water, but fire that gushed in great volume from the ground, and when this died down the water flowed; indeed, even at the present day it wells up hot and exceedingly salt. A bather here finds no cold water at hand, and if he dives into the sea his swim is full of danger. For wild creatures live in it, and it swarms with sharks.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I will also relate what astonished me most in <placeName key="perseus,Methana">Methana</placeName>. The wind called Lips,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A S.W. wind.</note> striking the budding vines from the Saronic Gulf, blights their buds. So while the wind is still rushing on, two men cut in two a cock whose feathers are all white, and run round the vines in opposite directions, each carrying half of the cock. When they meet at their starting place, they bury the pieces there.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such are the means they have devised against the Lips. The islets, nine in number, lying off the land are called the Isles of Pelops, and they say that when it rains one of them is not touched. If this be the case I do not know, though the people around <placeName key="perseus,Methana">Methana</placeName> said that it was true, and I have seen before now men trying to keep off hail by sacrifices and spells.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><placeName key="perseus,Methana">Methana</placeName>, then, is a peninsula of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. Within it, bordering on the land of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, is <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName>. The founder of the old city, the Hermionians say, was <placeName key="tgn,5004284">Hermion</placeName>, the son of Europs. Now Europs, whose father was certainly Phoroneus, Herophanes of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> said was an illegitimate child. For surely the kingdom of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> would never have devolved upon Argus, Niobe's son, the grandchild of Phoroneus, in the presence of a legitimate son.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But even supposing that Europs was a legitimate child who died before Phoroneus, I am quite sure that his son was not likely to stand a fair chance against Niobe's child, whose father was supposed to be Zeus. Subsequently the Dorians from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> settled, among other places, at <placeName key="tgn,5004284">Hermion</placeName>, but I do not think there was war between the two peoples, or it would have been spoken of by the Argives.</p></div>

As you go, then, along a mountain road by way of this rock, you reach a temple of Apollo surnamed Platanistius (God of the Plane-tree Grove), and a place called Eilei, where are sanctuaries of Demeter and of her daughter Core (Maid). Seawards, on the borders of Hermionis, is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Thermasia (Warmth).</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Just about eighty stades away is a headland Scyllaeum, which is named alter the daughter of Nisus. For when, owing to her treachery,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.19">Paus. 1.19</bibl>.</note> Minos had taken <placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, he said that now he would not have her to wife, and ordered his Cretans to throw her from the ship. She was drowned, and the waves cast up her body on this headland. They do not show a grave of her, but say that the sea birds were allowed to tear the corpse to pieces.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you sail from Scyllaeum in the direction of the city, you reach another headland, called Bucephala (Ox-head), and, after the headland, islands, the first of which is Haliussa (Salt Island). This provides a harbor where there is good anchorage. After it comes <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Pityussa</placeName> (<placeName key="tgn,2582768">Pine Island</placeName>), and the third they call Aristerae. On sailing past these you come to another headland, Colyergia, jutting out from the mainland, and after it to an island, called Tricrana (Three Heads), and a mountain, projecting into the sea from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, called Buporthmus (<placeName key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName>). On Buporthmus has been built a sanctuary of Demeter and her daughter, as well as one of Athena, surnamed Promachorma (Champion of the Anchorage).</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before Buporthmus lies an island called Aperopia, not far from which is another island, Hydrea.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here the Hermionians had their former city. They still have sanctuaries here: one of Poseidon at the east end of the spit, and a temple of Athena further inland by the side of the latter are the foundations of a race-course, in which legend says the sons of Tyndareus contended. There is also another sanctuary of Athena, of no great size, the roof of which has fallen in. There is a temple to Helius (Sun), another to the Graces, and a third to Serapis and Isis. There are also circuits of large unhewn stones, within which they perform mystic ritual to Demeter.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such are the possessions of the Hermionians in these parts. The modern city is just about four stades distant from the headland, upon which is the sanctuary of Poseidon, and it lies on a site which is level at first, gently rising up a slope, which presently merges into Pron, for so they name this mountain. A wall stands all round <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName>, a city which I found afforded much to write about, and among the things which I thought I myself must certainly mention are a temple of Aphrodite, surnamed both <placeName key="tgn,7006720">Pontia</placeName> (of the Deep Sea) and <placeName key="tgn,5000700">Limenia</placeName> (of the Harbor), and a white-marble image of huge size, and worth seeing for its artistic excellence.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also another temple of Aphrodite. Among the honors paid her by the Hermionians is this custom: maidens, and widows about to remarry, all sacrifice to her before wedding. Sanctuaries have also been built of Demeter Thermasia (Warmth), one at the border towards Troezenia, as I have stated above, while there is another in <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName> itself.</p></div>

<div n="35" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the latter is a temple of Dionysus of the Black Goatskin. In his honor every year they hold a competition in music, and they offer prizes for swimming-races and boat-races. There is also a sanctuary of Artemis surnamed Iphigenia, and a bronze Poseidon with one foot upon a dolphin. Passing by this into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of Apollo there are three temples and three images. One has no surname; the second they call Pythaeus, and the third Horius (of the Borders). The name Pythaeus they have learned from the Argives, for Telesilla<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.20.8">Paus. 2.20.8</bibl>.</note> tells us that they were the first Greeks to whose country came Pythaeus, who was a son of Apollo. I cannot say for certain why they call the third Horius, but I conjecture that they won a victory, either in war or by arbitration, in a dispute concerning the borders (horoi) of their land, and for this reason paid honors to Apollo Horius.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary of Fortune is said by the Hermionians to be the newest in their city; a colossus of Parian marble stands there. Of their wells, one is very old; nobody can see the water flowing into it, but it would never run dry, even if everybody descended and drew water from it. Another well they made in our own day, and the name of the place from which the water flows into it is Leimon (Meadow).</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The object most worthy of mention is a sanctuary of Demeter on Pron. This sanctuary is said by the Hermionians to have been founded by Clymenus, son of Phoroneus, and Chthonia, sister of Clymenus. But the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> account is that when Demeter came to <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, while Atheras and Mysius afforded hospitality to the goddess, Colontas neither received her into his home nor paid her any other mark of respect. His daughter Chthoia disapproved of this conduct. They say that Colontas was punished by being burnt up along with his house, while Chthonia was brought to <placeName key="tgn,5004284">Hermion</placeName> by Demeter, and made the sanctuary for the Hermionians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At any rate, the goddess herself is called Chthonia, and Chthonia is the name of the festival they hold in the summer of every year. The manner of it is this. The procession is headed by the priests of the gods and by all those who hold the annual magistracies; these are followed by both men and women. It is now a custom that some who are still children should honor the goddess in the procession. These are dressed in white, and wear wreaths upon their heads. Their wreaths are woven of the flower called by the natives <term>cosmosandalon</term>, which, from its size and color, seems to me to be an iris; it even has inscribed upon it the same letters of mourning.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The letters AI, an exclamation of woe supposed to be inscribed on the flower.</note></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those who form the procession are followed by men leading from the herd a full-grown cow, fastened with ropes, and still untamed and frisky. Having driven the cow to the temple, some loose her from the ropes that she may rush into the sanctuary, others, who hitherto have been holding the doors open, when they see the cow within the temple, close the doors.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Four old women, left behind inside, are they who dispatch the cow. Whichever gets the chance cuts the throat of the cow with a sickle. Afterwards the doors are opened, and those who are appointed drive up a second cow, and a third after that, and yet a fourth. All are dispatched in the same way by the old women, and the sacrifice has yet another strange feature. On whichever of her sides the first cow falls, all the others must fall on the same.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the manner in which the sacrifice is performed by the Hermionians. Before the temple stand a few statues of the women who have served Demeter as her priestess, and on passing inside you see seats on which the old women wait for the cows to be driven in one by one, and images, of no great age, of Athena and Demeter. But the thing itself that they worship more than all else, I never saw, nor yet has any other man, whether stranger or Hermionian. The old women may keep their knowledge of its nature to themselves.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also another temple, all round which stand statues. This temple is right opposite that of Chthonia, and is called that of Clymenus, and they sacrifice to Clymenus here. I do not believe that Clymenus was an Argive who came to Hermion “Clymenus” is the surname of the god, whoever legend says is king in the underworld.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside this temple is another; it is of Ares, and has an image of the god, while to the right of the sanctuary of Chthonia is a portico, called by the natives the Portico of Echo. It is such that if a man speaks it reverberates at least three times. Behind the temple of Chthonia are three places which the Hermionians call that of Clymenus, that of Pluto, and the Acherusian Lake. All are surrounded by fences of stones, while in the place of Clymenus there is also a chasm in the earth. Through this, according to the legend of the Hermionians, Heracles brought up the Hound of Hell.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the gate through which there is a straight road leading to <placeName key="perseus,Mases">Mases</placeName>, there is a sanctuary of Eileithyia within the wall.

I know, however, no other authentic document in which mention is made either of the city Halice or of its citizens. Well, to this city also there is a road, which lies midway between Pron and another mountain, called in old days Thornax; but they say that the name was changed because, according to legend, it was here that the transformation of Zeus into a cuckoo took place.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For a time the Asinaeans defended themselves from their wall, and killed among others Lysistratus, one of the most notable men of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is a sacred grove beginning on the mountain they call Pontinus. Now Mount Pontinus does not let the rain-water flow away, but absorbs it into itself. From it flows a river, also called Pontinus. Upon the top of the mountain is a sanctuary of Athena Saitis, now merely a ruin; there are also the foundations of a house of Hippomedon, who went to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to redress the wrongs of Polyneices, son of Oedipus.</p></div>

<div n="37" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this mountain begins the grove, which consists chiefly of plane trees, and reaches down to the sea. Its boundaries are, on the one side the river Pantinus, on the other side another river, called Amymane, after the daughter of Danaus. Within the grave are images of Demeter Prosymne and of Dionysus. Of Demeter there is a seated image of no great size.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Both are of stone, but in another temple is a seated wooden image of Dionysus Saotes (Savior), while by the sea is a stone image of Aphrodite. They say that the daughters of Danaus dedicated it, while Danaus himself made the sanctuary of Athena by the Pontinus. The mysteries of the Lernaeans were established, they say, by Philammon. Now the words which accompany the ritual are evidently of no antiquity</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and the inscription also, which I have heard is written on the heart made of orichalcum, was shown not to be Philammon's by Arriphon, an Aetolian of Triconium by descent, who now enjoys a reputation second to none among the Lycians; excellent at original research, he found the clue to this problem in the following way: the verses, and the prose interspersed among the verses, are all written in Doric. But before the return of the Heracleidae to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> the Argives spoke the same dialect as the Athenians, and in Philammon's day I do not suppose that even the name Dorians was familiar to all Greek ears.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All this was proved in the demonstration. At the source of the Amymone grows a plane tree, beneath which, they say, the hydra (water-snake) grew. I am ready to believe that this beast was superior in size to other water-snakes, and that its poison had something in it so deadly that Heracles treated the points of his arrows with its gall. It had, however, in my opinion, one head, and not several. It was Peisander<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Peisander wrote a poem on the labors of Heracles. His date is uncertain, but perhaps he flourished about <date when="-0645">645 B.C.</date></note> of Camirus who, in order that the beast might appear more frightful and his poetry might be more remarkable, represented the hydra with its many heads.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I saw also what is called the Spring of Amphiaraus and the Alcyonian Lake, through which the Argives say Dionysus went down to Hell to bring up Semele, adding that the descent here was shown him by Palymnus. There is no limit to the depth of the Alcyonian Lake, and I know of nobody who by any contrivance has been able to reach the bottom of it since not even Nero, who had ropes made several stades long and fastened them together, tying lead to them, and omitting nothing that might help his experiment, was able to discover any limit to its depth.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This, too, I heard. The water of the lake is, to all appearance, calm and quiet but, although it is such to look at, every swimmer who ventures to cross it is dragged down, sucked into the depths, and swept away. The circumference of the lake is not great, being about one-third of a stade. Upon its banks grow grass and rushes. The nocturnal rites performed every year in honor of Dionysus I must not divulge to the world at large.</p></div>

According to the tradition of the Lacedaemonians themselves, <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName>, an aboriginal was the first king in this land, after whom his subjects were named Leleges. <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName> had a son Myles, and a younger one Polycaon. Polycaon retired into exile, the place of this retirement and its reason I will set forth elsewhere. On the death of Myles his son Eurotas succeeded to the throne.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Having no male issue, he left the kingdom to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, whose mother was Taygete, after whom the mountain was named, while according to report his father was none other than Zeus. <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> was wedded to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, a daughter of Eurotas.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Amyclas, too, son of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, wished to leave some memorial behind him, and built a town in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. Hyacinthus, the youngest and most beautiful of his sons, died before his father, and his tomb is in Amyclae below the image of Apollo. On the death of Amyclas the empire came to Aigalus, the eldest of his sons, and afterwards, when Aigalus died, to Cynortas. Cynortas had a son Oebalus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He took a wife from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus, and begat a son Tyndareus, with whom Hippocoon disputed about the kingship, claiming the throne on the ground of being the eldest. With the end of Icarius and his partisans he had surpassed Tyndareus in power, and forced him to retire in fear; the Lacedaemonians say that he went to Pellana, but a Messenian legend about him is that he fled to Aphareus in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, Aphareus being the son of Perieres and the brother of Tyndareus on his mother's side.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Subsequently Tyndareus was brought back by Heracles and recovered his throne.

In <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, as the sons of Aristodemus were twins, there arose two royal houses; for they say that the Pythian priestess approved.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tradition has it that Aristodemus himself died at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> before the Dorians returned to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, but those who glorify his fate assert that he was shot by Apollo for not going to the oracle, having learned from Heracles, who met him before he arrived there, that the Dorians would make this return to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. But the more correct account is that Aristodemus was murdered by the sons of Pylades and Electra, who were cousins of Tisamenus son of Orestes.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p> The names given to the sons of Aristodemus were Procles and Eurysthenes, and although they were twins they were bitter enemies. Their enmity reached a high pitch, but nevertheless they combined to help Theras, the son of Autesion and the brother of their mother Argeia and their guardian as well, to found a colony. This colony Theras was dispatching to the island that was then called <placeName key="tgn,7002507">Calliste</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, “Fairest.”</note> and he hoped that the descendants of Membliarus would of their own accord give up the kingship to him.

Procles and Eurysthenes were of one mind in their eagerness to serve Theras; but in all else their purposes were always widely different.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Even if they had agreed together, I should never have ventured to include their descendants in a common list; for they did not altogether coincide in respect of age, so that cousins, cousins' children, and later generations were not born so as to make the steps in one pedigree coincide with those of the other. So I shall give the history of each house by itself separately, instead of combining them both in one narrative.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="2" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Eurysthenes, the elder of the sons of Aristodemus, had, they say, a son Agis, after. whom the family of Eurysthenes is called the Agiadae. In his time, when Patreus the son of Preugenes was founding in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName> a city which even at the present day is called <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> from this Patreus, the Lacedaemonians took part in the settlement. They also joined in an expedition oversea to found a colony. Gras the son of Echelas the son of Penthilus the son of Orestes was the leader, who was destined to occupy the land between <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, called at the present day <placeName key="tgn,5004216">Aeolis</placeName>; his ancestor Penthilus had even before this seized the island of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> that lies over against this part of the mainland.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Echestratus, son of Agis, was king at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians removed all the Cynurians of military age, alleging as a reason that freebooters from the Cynurian territory were harrying <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, the Argives being their kinsmen, and that the Cynurians themselves openly made forays into the land. The Cynurians are said to be Argives by descent, and tradition has it that their founder was Cynurus, son of Perseus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not many years afterwards Labotas, son of Echestratus, became king in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. This Labotas Herodotus, in his history of Croesus, says was in his childhood the ward of Lycurgus the lawgiver, but he calls him Leobotes and not Labotas. It was then that the Lacedaemonians first resolved to make war upon the Argives, bringing as charges against them that they were annexing the Cynurian territory which they themselves had captured, and were causing revolts among their subjects the Perioeci (Dwellers around). On this occasion neither of the belligerents, according to the account, achieved anything worthy of mention,</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and the next kings of this house, Doryssus, son of Labotas, and Agesilaus, son of Doryssus, were soon both killed. Lycurgus too laid down their laws for the Lacedaemonians in the reign of Artesilaus; some say that he was taught how to do this by the Pythian priestess, others that he introduced Cretan institutions. The Cretans say that these laws of theirs were laid down by Minos, and that Minos was not without divine aid in his deliberations concerning them. Homer too, I think, refers in riddling words to the legislation of Minos in the following verses:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact"><placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName> too, great city, among them, where Minos for nine years</l><l>Ruled as king, and enjoyed familiar converse with great Zeus.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.178">Hom. Od. 19.178</bibl></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of Lycurgus I shall make further mention later. Agesilaus had a son Archelaus. In his reign the Lacedaemonians took by force of arms Aegys, a city of the Perioeci, and sold the inhabitants into slavery, suspecting them of Arcadian sympathies. Charilaus, the king of the other house, helped Archelaus to destroy Aegys, but the exploits he achieved when leading the Lacedaemonians by himself, these too I shall relate when my narrative comes to treat of those called the Eurypontidae.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Archelaus had a son Teleclus. In his reign the Lacedaemonians conquered in war and reduced Amyclae, Pharis, and Geranthrae, cities of the Perioeci, which were still in the possession of the Achaeans. The inhabitants of Pharis and Geranthrae, panic-stricken at the onslaught of the Dorians, made an agreement to retire from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> under a truce, but those of Amyclae were not driven out at the first assault, but only after a long and stubborn resistance, in which they distinguished themselves by glorious achievements. To this heroism the Dorians bore witness by raising a trophy against the Amyclaeans, implying that their success was the most memorable exploit of that time. Not long after this Teleclus was murdered by Messenians in a sanctuary of Artemis. This sanctuary was built on the frontier of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, in a place called Limniae (Lakes).</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the death of Teleclus, Alcamenes his son succeeded to the throne, and the Lacedaemonians sent to Crete Charmidas the son of Euthys, who was a distinguished Spartan, to put down the civil strife among the Cretans, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland towns, and to help them to people instead those that were conveniently situated for the coasting voyage. They also laid waste <placeName key="perseus,Helos">Helos</placeName>, an Achaean town on the coast, and won a battle against the Argives who came to give aid to the Helots.</p></div>

<div n="3" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the death of Alcamenes, Polydorus his son succeeded to the throne, and the Lacedaemonians sent colonies to <placeName key="perseus,Croton">Croton</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and to the <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName> by the Western headland. The war called the Messenian reached its height in the reign of this king. As to the causes of the war, the Lacedaemonian version differs from the Messenian.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The accounts given by the belligerents, and the manner in which this war ended, will be set forth later in my narrative. For the present I must state thus much; the chief leader of the Lacedaemonians in the first war against the Messenians was Theopompus the son of Nicander, a king of the other house. When the war against <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> had been fought to a finish, and <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> was enslaved to the Lacedaemonians, Polydorus, who had a great reputation at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and was very popular with the masses—for he never did a violent act or said an insulting word to anyone, while as a judge he was both upright and humane—</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>his fame having by this time spread throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, was murdered by Polemarchus, a member of a distinguished family in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, but, as he showed, a man of an unscrupulous temper. After his death Polydorus received many signal marks of respect from the Lacedaemonians. However, Polemarchus too has a tomb in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; either he had been considered a good man before this murder, or perhaps his relatives buried him secretly.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>During the reign of Eurycrates, son of Polydorus, the Messenians submitted to be subjects of the Lacedaemonians, neither did any trouble befall from the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> people. But in the reign of Anaxander, son of Eurycrates—for destiny was by this time driving the Messenians out of all the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>—the Messenians revolted from the Lacedaemonians. For a time they held out by force of arms, but at last they were overcome and retired from the Peloponnesus under a truce. The remnant of them left behind in the land became the slaves of the Lacedaemonians, with the exception of those in the towns on the coast.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The incidents of the war which the Messenians waged after the revolt from the Lacedaemonians it is not pertinent that I should set forth in the present part of my narrative. Anaxander had a son Eurycrates, and this second Eurycrates a son <placeName key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName>. While these two kings were on the throne the Lacedaemonians were generally unsuccessful in the war with <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>. But in the reign of Anaxandrides, son of <placeName key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians won the war with <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> in the following manner. A Lacedaemonian, by name Lichas, came to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> when there chanced to be a truce between the cities.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0560" to="-0550">560-550 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Lichas arrived the Spartans were seeking the bones of Orestes in accordance with an oracle. Now Lichas inferred that they were buried in a smithy, the reason for this inference being this. Everything that he saw in the smithy he compared with the oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, likening to the winds the bellows, for that they too sent forth a violent blast, the hammer to the “stroke,” the anvil to the “counterstroke” to it, while the iron is naturally a “woe to man,” because already men were using iron in warfare. In the time of those called heroes the god would have called bronze a woe to man.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Similar to the oracle about the bones of Orestes was the one afterwards given to the Athenians, that they were to bring back Theseus from Scyros to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> otherwise they could not take Scyros. Now the bones of Theseus were discovered by Cimon the son of Miltiades, who displayed similar sharpness of wit, and shortly afterwards took Scyros.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have evidence that in the heroic age weapons were universally of bronze in the verses of Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.611">Hom. Il. 23.611</bibl> foIl. and 650.</note> about the axe of Peisander and the arrow of Meriones. My statement is likewise confirmed by the spear of Achilles dedicated in the sanctuary of Athena at Phaselis, and by the sword of Memnon in the Nicomedian temple of Asclepius. The point and butt-spike of the spear and the whole of the sword are made of bronze. The truth of these statements I can vouch for.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Anaxandrides the son of <placeName key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName> was the only Lacedaemonian to possess at one and the same time two wives and two households. For his first consort, though an excellent wife, had the misfortune to he barren. When the ephors bade him pot her away he firmly refused to do so, but made this concession to them, that he would take another wife in addition to her. The fruit of this union was a son, Cleomenes; and the former wife, who up to this time had not conceived, after the birth of Cieomenes bore Dorieus, then Leonidas, and finally Cleombrotus.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And when Anaxandrides died, the Lacedaemonians, believing Dorieus to be both of a sounder judgment than Cleomenes and a better soldier, much against their will rejected him as their king, and obeyed the laws by giving the throne to the elder claimant Cleomenes.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="4" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now Dorieus could not bear to stay at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and be subject to his brother, and so he went on a colonizing expedition. As soon as he became king, Cleomenes gathered together an army, both of the Lacedaemonians themselves and of their allies, and invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>. The Argives came out under arms to meet them, but Cleomenes won the day. Near the battlefield was a grove sacred to Argus, son of Niobe, and on being routed some five thousand of the Argives took refuge therein. Cleomenes was subject to fits of mad excitement, and on this occasion he ordered the Helots to set the grove on fire, and the flames spread all over the grove, which, as it burned, burned up the suppliants with it.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He also conducted campaigns against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, by the first of which he delivered the Athenians from the sons of Peisistratus and won a good report among the Greeks both for himself personally and for the Lacedaemonians;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0510">510 B.C.</date></note> while the second campaign was to please an Athenian, Isagoras, by helping him to establish a tyranny over <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0508">508 B.C.</date></note> When he was disappointed, and the Athenians fought strenuously for their freedom, Cleomenes devastated the country, including, they say, the district called Orgas, which was sacred to the deities in <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>. He advanced as far as <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, and proceeded to arrest such influential Aeginetans as had shown Persian sympathies, and had persuaded the citizens to give earth and water to king Dareius, son of Hystaspes.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>While Cleomenes was occupied in <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, Demaratus, the king of the other house, was slandering him to the Lacedaemonian populace. On his return from <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, Cleomenes began to intrigue for the deposition of king Demaratus. He bribed the Pythian prophetess to frame responses about Demaratus according to his instructions, and instigated Leotychides, a man of royal birth and of the same family as Demaratus, to put in a claim to the throne.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Leotychides seized upon the remark that Ariston in his ignorance blurted out when Demaratus was born, denying that he was his child. On the present occasion the Lacedaemonians, according to their wont, referred to the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> the claim against Demaratus, and the prophetess gave them a response which favoured the designs of Cleomenes.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Demaratus was deposed, not rightfully, but because Cleomenes hated him. Subsequently Cleomenes met his end in a fit of madness for seizing a sword he began to wound himself, and hacked and maimed his body all over. The Argives assert that the manner of his end was a punishment for his treatment of the suppliants of Argus; the Athenians say that it was because he had devastated Orgas; the Delphians put it down to the bribes he gave the Pythian prophetess, persuading her to give lying responses about Demaratus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It may well be too that the wrath of heroes and the wrath of gods united together to punish Cleomenes since it is a fact that for a personal wrong Protesilaus, a hero not a whit more illustrious than Argus, punished at Elaeus Artayctes, a Persian; while the Megarians never succeeded in propitiating the deities at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> for having encroached upon the sacred land. As to the tampering with the oracle, we know of nobody, with the exception of Cleomenes, who has had the audacity even to attempt it.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cleomenes had no male issue, and the kingdom devolved on Leonidas, son of Anaxandrides and full brother of Dorieus. At this time Xerxes led his host against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and Leonidas with three hundred Lacedaemonians met him at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. Now although the Greeks have waged many wars, and so have foreigners among themselves, yet there are but few that have been made more illustrious by the exceptional valor of one man, in the way that Achilles shed luster on the Trojan war and Miltiades on the engagement at Marathon. But in truth the success of Leonidas surpassed, in my opinion, all later as well as all previous achievements.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For Xerxes, the proudest of all who have reigned over the Medes, or over the Persians who succeeded them, the achiever of such brilliant exploits, was met on his march by Leonidas and the handful of men he led to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note> and they would have prevented him from even seeing <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at all, and from ever burning <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if the man of <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName> had not guided the army with Hydarnes by the path that stretches across Oeta, and enabled the enemy to surround the Greeks; so Leonidas was overwhelmed and the foreigners passed along into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus never became king.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Mardonius fell in the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, and the foreigners were destroyed, Pausanias sent the lady back to Cos, and she took with her the apparel that the Persian had procured for her as well as the rest of her belongings. Pausanias also refused to dishonor the body of Mardonius, as Lampon the Aeginetan advised him to do.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Shortly after Pleistarchus the son of Leonidas came to the throne he died, and the kingdom devolved on Pleistoanax, son of the Pausanias who commanded at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. Pleistoanax had a son Pausanias; he was the Pausanias who invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, ostensibly to oppose Thrasybulus and the Athenians, but really to establish firmly the despotism of those to whom the government had been entrusted by Lysander.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0479">479 B.C.</date></note> Although he won a battle against the Athenians holding the Peiraens, yet immediately after the battle he resolved to lead his army back home, and not to bring upon <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> the most disgraceful of reproaches by increasing the despotic power of wicked men.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he returned from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with only a fruitless battle to his credit, he was brought to trial by his enemies. The court that sat to try a Lacedaemonian king consisted of the senate, “old men” as they were called, twenty eight in number, the members of the ephorate, and in addition the king of the other house. Fourteen senators, along with Agis, the king of the other house, declared that Pausanias was guilty; the rest of the court voted for his acquittal.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Shortly after this the Lacedaemonians gathered an army against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; the reason for so doing will be given in my account of Agesilaus. On this occasion Lysander came to <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, took along with him the entire Phocian army, and without any further delay entered <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and began assaults upon the wall of Haliartus, the citizens of which refused to revolt from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Already a band of Thebans and Athenians had secretly entered the city; these came out and offered battle before the wall, and there fell here several Lacedaemonians, including Lysander himself.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pausanias was too late for the fight, having been collecting forces from <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> generally; when he finally reached <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, although he heard of the defeat of the forces with Lysander and of the death of Lysander himself, he nevertheless led his army against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and purposed to take the offensive. Thereupon the Thebans offered battle, and Thrasybulus was reported to be not far away with the Athenians. He was waiting for the Lacedaemonians to take the offensive, on which his intention was to launch an attack himself against their rear.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Pausanias, fearing lest he should be caught between two enemy forces, made a truce with the Thebans and took up for burial those who had fallen under the wall of Haliartus. The Lacedaemonians disapproved of this decision, but the following reason leads me to approve it. Pausanias was well aware that the disasters of the Lacedaemonians always took place when they had been caught between two enemy forces, and the defeats at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and on the island of <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName> made him afraid lest he himself should prove the occasion of a third misfortune for them.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when his fellow citizens charged him with his slowness in this Boeotian campaign, he did not wait to stand his trial, but was received by the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> as a suppliant of Athena Alea. Now this sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the Peloponnesians, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants, as the Lacedaemonians showed in the case of Pausanias and of Leotychides before him, and the Argives in the case of Chrysis; they never wanted even to ask for these refugees, who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuary, to be given up.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Pausanias fled, his sons Agesipolis and Cleombrotus were still quite boys, and Aristodemus, their nearest relative, was their guardian. This Aristodemus was in command of the Lacedaemonians when they won their success at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Agesipolis grew up and came to the throne, the first Peloponnesians against whom he waged war were the Argives. When he led his army from the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> into that of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the Argives sent a herald to make for them with Agesipolis a certain ancestral truce, which from ancient times had been an established custom between Dorians and Dorians. But Agesipolis did not make the truce with the herald, but advancing with his army proceeded to devastate the land. Then there was an earthquake, but not even so would Agesipolis consent to take away his forces. And yet more than any other Greeks were the Lacedaemonians (in this respect like the Athenians) frightened by signs from heaven.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the time that he was encamping under the wall of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the earthquakes were still occurring, some of the troops had actually been killed by lightning, and some moreover had been driven out of then senses by the thunder. In this circumstance he reluctantly withdrew from <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> territory, and began another campaign, attacking <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>. Victorious in the war, having captured most of the cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002716">Chalcidice</placeName>, and hoping to capture <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName> itself, he was suddenly attacked by a disease which ended in his death.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0380">380 B.C.</date></note></p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Agesipolis, the elder of the sons of Cleombrotus, is not a striking figure in history, and was succeeded by his younger brother Cleomenes. His first son was Acrotatus, his second Cleonymus. Acrotatus did not outlive his father, and when Cleomenes afterwards died, there arose a dispute about the throne between Cleonymus the son of Cleomenes and Areus the son of Acrotatus. So the senators acted as arbitrators, and decided that the dignity was the inheritance of Areus the son of Acrotatus, and not of Cleonymus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Deprived of his kingship Cleonymus became violently angry, and the ephors tried to soothe his feelings by bestowing upon him various honors, especially the leadership of the armies, so as to prevent his becoming one day an enemy of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. But at last he committed many hostile acts against his fatherland, and induced Pyrrhus the son of Aeacides to invade <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>While Areus the son of Acrotatus was king in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, Antigonus the son of Demetrius attacked <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with an army and a fleet.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0262">262 B.C.</date></note> To the help of the Athenians there came the Egyptian expedition with Patroclus, and every available man of the Lacedaemonians with Areus their king at their head.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Antigonus invested <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and prevented the Athenian reinforcements from entering the city; so Patroclus dispatched messengers urging Areus and the Lacedaemonians to take the offensive against Antigonus. On their doing so, he would himself, he said, attack the Macedonians in rear; but before such a move it was not fair for Egyptian sailors to attack Macedonians on land. The Lacedaemonians were eager to make the venture, both because of their friendship for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and also because they were ambitious to hand down to posterity a famous achievement,</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but as their supplies were exhausted Areus led his army back home, thinking that desperate measures should be reserved for one's own advantage and not risked recklessly for the benefit of others. After they had held out as long as they could, Antigonus made peace with the Athenians, on condition that he brought a garrison into the Museum to be a guard over them. After a time Antigonus himself removed the garrison from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> of his own accord while Areus begat Acrotatus, and Acrotatus Areus, who died of disease when he was just about eight years old.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And as the only male representative of the house of Eurysthenes was Leonidas the son of Cleonymus, by this time a very old man, the Lacedaemonians gave him the throne. Leonidas, it so happened, had a bitter opponent in Lysander, a descendant of Lysander the son of Aristocritus. This Lysander won over to his side Leonidas' son-in-law Cleombrotus. After gaining his support he brought various charges against Leonidas, in particular that when a boy he had sworn to his father Cleonymus to ruin <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Leonidas ceased to be king and Cleombrotus came to the throne in his stead. Now if Leonidas had given way to impulse and retired, like Demaratus the son of Ariston, either to the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> or to the Egyptian king, he would have profited nothing even by the Spartans changing their minds. But as it was, when the citizens sentenced him to exile, he went to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, whence not many years later he was recalled by the Lacedaemonians, who made him king again.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now how Cleomenes the son of Leonidas performed daring feats of valor, and how after him the Spartans ceased to be ruled by kings, I have already shown in my account of Aratus of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>.

Procles the son of Aristodemus called his son <placeName key="tgn,1027538">Sous</placeName>, whose son Eurypon they say reached such a pitch of renown that this house, hitherto called the Procleidae, came to be named after him the Eurypontidae.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The son of Eurypon was Prytanis, in whose reign began the enmity of the Lacedaemonians against the Argives, although even before this quarrel they made war against the Cynurians.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but Charillus the son of Polydectes devastated the land of the Argives—for he it was who invaded Argolis—and not many years afterwards, under the leadership of Charillus, took place the campaign of the Spartans against <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, when lured on by a deceptive oracle the Lacedaemonians hoped to capture the city and to annex the Tegean plain from <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the death of Charillus, Nicander his son succeeded to the throne, in whose reign the Messenians murdered, in the sanctuary of the Lady of the Lake, Teleclus the king of the other house. Nicander also invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> with an army, and laid waste the greater part of the land.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About Theopompus, the son of Nicander, who ascended the throne after him, I shall have more to say later on, when I come to the history of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>.

Theopompus personally took no part in the affair, chiefly because of old age and sorrow, for while he was yet alive Archidamus died.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Nevertheless Archidamus did not die childless, but left a son Zeuxidamus, whose son Anaxidamus succeeded to the throne.

As he was sitting in council with the ephors there came to him a servant with the news that a child was born to him. Ariston, forgetting the lines in the <title>Iliad</title> about the birth of Eurystheus, or else never having understood them at all, declared that because of the number of months the child was not his.</p></div>

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Agis used also to make continual incursions into <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and established the fortified post at Decelea to annoy the Athenians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0413">413 B.C.</date></note> When the Athenian navy was destroyed at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0405">405 B.C.</date></note> Lysander, the son of Aristocritus, and Agis violated the oaths which the Lacedaemonians as a state had sworn by the gods to the Athenians, and it was on their own initiative, and without the approval of the Spartan state, that they put before their allies the proposal to destroy <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> root and branch.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such were the most remarkable military achievements of Agis. The rash remark that Ariston made about Demaratus was also made by Agis about his son Leotychides; at the suggestion of some evil spirit he said in the hearing of the ephors that he did not believe Leotychides to be his son. Yet Agis, too, repented afterwards; he was at the time being carried home sick from <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and when he reached <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName>, he not only called the people to witness that he sincerely believed Leotychides to be his very own son, but also with prayers and tears charged them to take the tidings to the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the death of Agis, Agesilaus tried to keep Leotychides from the throne, recalling to the minds of the Lacedaemonians what Agis once said about Leotychides. But the Arcadians from <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName> arrived and bore witness for Leotychides, stating what they had heard the dying Agis say.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Yet further fuel for the controversy between Agesilaus and Leotychides was supplied by the oracle that was delivered at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to this effect:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact"><placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> beware! though haughty, pay heed to the warning I give thee.</l><l>Never let thy sound limbs give birth to a kingdom that lame is.</l><l>Too long then shalt thou lie in the clutches of desperate hardships;</l><l>Turmoil of war shall arise, o'erwhelming men in its billows.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Leotychides on this occasion said that these words pointed to Agesilaus, who was lame in one of his feet, while Agesilaus interpreted them as alluding to the illegitimacy of Leotychides. Although they might have done so, the Lacedaemonians did not refer the disputed point to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>; the reason was in my opinion that Lysander, the son of Aristocritus, an active supporter of Agesilaus, would have him king at all costs.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="9" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Agesilaus, son of Archidamus, became king, and the Lacedaemonians resolved to cross with a fleet to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> in order to put down Artaxerxes, son of Dareius.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0398">398 B.C.</date></note> For they were informed by several of their magistrates, especially by Lysander, that it was not Artaxerxes but Cyrus who had been supplying the pay for the fleet during the war with <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Agesilaus, who was appointed to lead the expedition across to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and to be in command of the land forces, sent round to all parts of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, except <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and to the Greeks north of the Isthmus, asking for allies.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the Corinthians were most eager to take part in the expedition to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, but considering it a bad omen that their temple of Zeus surnamed Olympian had been suddenly burnt down, they reluctantly remained behind. The Athenians excused themselves on the ground that their city was returning to its former state of prosperity after the Peloponnesian war and the epidemic of plague, and the news brought by messengers, that <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, son of Timotheus, had gone up to the Persian king, strongly confirmed them in their policy of inactivity.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The envoy dispatched to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was Aristomelidas, the father of the mother of Agesilaus, a close friend of the Thebans who, when the wall of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> had been taken, had been one of the judges voting that the remnant of the garrison should be put to death. Now the Thebans like the Athenians refused, saying that they would give no help. When Agesilaus had assembled his Lacedaemonian forces and those of the allies, and at the same time the fleet was ready, he went to <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> to sacrifice to Artemis, because Agamemnon too had propitiated the goddess here before leading the expedition to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Agesilaus, then, claimed to be king of a more prosperous city than was Agamemnon, and to be like him overlord of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and that it would be a more glorious success to conquer Artaxerxes and acquire the riches of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> than to destroy the empire of Priam. but even as he was sacrificing armed Thebans came upon him, threw dawn from the altar the still burning thighbones of the victims, and drove him from the sanctuary.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Though vexed that the sacrifice was not completed, Agesilaus nevertheless crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and launched an attack against <placeName key="tgn,7002615">Sardes</placeName> for <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> at this period was the most important district of lower <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002615">Sardes</placeName>, pre-eminent for its wealth and resources, had been assigned as a residence to the satrap of the coast region, just as <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName> had been to the king himself.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A battle was fought on the plain of the Hermus with Tissaphernes, satrap of the parts around <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, in which Agesilaus conquered the cavalry of the Persians and the infantry, of which the muster on this occasion had been surpassed only in the expedition of Xerxes and in the earlier ones of Dareius against the Scythians and against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. The Lacedaemonians, admiring the energy of Agesilaus, added to his command the control of the fleet. But Agesilaus made his brother-in-law, Peisander, admiral, and devoted himself to carrying on the war vigorously by land. </p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The jealousy of some deity prevented him from bringing his plans to their conclusion. For when Artaxerxes heard of the victories won by Agesilaus, and how, by attending to the task that lay before him, he advanced with his army even further and further, he put Tissaphernes to death in spite of his previous services, and sent down to the sea Tithraustes, a clever schemer who had some grudge against the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7002615">Sardes</placeName> he at once thought out a plan by which to force the Lacedaemonians to recall their army from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. He sent Timocrates, a Rhodian, to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with money, instructing him to stir up in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> a war against the Lacedaemonians. Those who shared in this money are said to have been the Argives Cylon and Sodamas, the Thebans Androcleides, Ismenias and Amphithemis, the Athenians Cephalus and Epicrates, with the Corinthians who had <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> sympathies, Polyanthes and Timolaus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But those who first openly started the war were the Locrians from <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>. For there happened to be a piece of land the ownership of which was a matter of dispute between the Locrians and the Phocians. Egged on by Ismenias and his party at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the Locrians cut the ripe corn in this land and drove off the booty. The Phocians on their side invaded <placeName key="tgn,7010899">Locris</placeName> with all their forces, and laid waste the land.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the Locrians brought in the Thebans as allies, and devastated <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>. Going to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> the Phocians inveighed against the Thebans, and set forth what they had suffered at their hands. The Lacedaemonians determined to make war against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, chief among their grievances being the outrageous way the Thebans behaved towards Agesilaus when he was sacrificing at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Athenians receiving early intimation of the Lacedaemonians' intentions, sent to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> begging them to submit their grievances to a court of arbitration instead of appealing to arms, but the Lacedaemonians dismissed the envoys in anger. The sequel, how the Lacedaemonians set forth and how Lysander died, I have already described in my account of Pausanias.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 3.5.3">Paus. 3.5.3</bibl> foll.</note></p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And what was called the Corinthian war, which continually became more serious, had its origin in the expedition of the Lacedaemonians into <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0394" to="-0387">394-387 B.C.</date></note> So these circumstances compelled Agesilaus to lead his army back from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Crossing with his fleet from <placeName key="tgn,6000031">Abydos</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Sestos">Sestos</placeName> he passed through <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> as far as <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, where the Thessalians, to please the Thebans, tried to prevent his further progress; there was also an old friendship between them and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Agesilaus put the Thessalian cavalry to flight and passed through <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, and again made his way through <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, winning a victory over <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and the allies at <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>. When the Boeotians were put to flight, certain of them took refuge in the sanctuary of Athena surnamed Itonia. Agesilaus, although suffering from a wound received in the battle, did not sin against the suppliants.</p></div>

<div n="10" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not long afterwards the Corinthians in exile for pro-Spartan sympathies held the Isthmian games. The Corinthians in the city made no move at the time, through their fear of Agesilaus but when he marched to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, they too celebrated the Isthmian games along with the Argives. Agesilaus again marched with an army against <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and, as the festival Hyacinthia was at hand, he gave the Amycleans leave to go back home and perform the traditional rites in honor of Apollo and Hyacinthus. This battalion was attacked on the way and annihilated by the Athenians under Iphicrates.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Agesilaus went also to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> to give assistance to the Aetolians, who were hard pressed in a war with, the Acarnanians;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0390">390 B.C.</date></note> these he compelled to put an end to the war, although they had come very near capturing Calydon and the other towns of the Aetolians.

Agesilaus performed many noteworthy achievements in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, but, being by this time ah old man, he died on the march. then his dead body was brought home, the Lacedaemonians buried it with greater honors than they had given to any other king.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the reign of Archidamus, son of Agesilaus, the Phocians seized the sanctuary at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0356">356 B.C.</date></note> To help in a war with <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> the Phocians hired with its wealth independent mercenaries, but they here also aided publicly by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, the latter calling to mind some old service rendered by the Phocians, the former, too, pretending to be friends when their real reason was, I think, hatred of the Thebans. Theopompus, son of Damasistratus, said that Archidamus himself had a share of the Delphic money, and further that Deinicha the wife of Archidamus, receiving a bribe from the chief men of the Phocians, made Archidamus more ready to bring them reinforcements.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>To accept sacred money and to help men who had pillaged the most famous of oracles I do not hold praiseworthy, but the following incident does redound to his praise. The Phocians were contemplating the cruel course of killing the Delphians of vigorous age, enslaving the women and children, and levelling the city itself to the ground; it was due to the intercession of Archidamus that they escaped this fate at the hands of the Phocians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Archidamus afterwards also crossed over into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> to help the Tarentines to wage war against their foreign neighbors. Here he was killed by the foreigners, and his corpse missed burial owing to the anger of Apollo. Agis, the elder son of this Archidamus, met his death fighting against Antipater and the Macedonians, but while the younger son, Eudamidas, was king, the Lacedaemonians enjoyed peace. The history of Agis, son of Eudamidas, and of Eurydamidas, son of Agis, my account of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> has already set forth.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the way from the Hermae the whole of the region is full of oak-trees. The name of the district, Scotitas (Dark), is not due to the unbroken woods but to Zeus surnamed Scotitas, and there is a sanctuary of Zeus Scotitas on the left of the road and about ten stades from it. If you go back from the sanctuary to the road, advance a little and then turn again to the left, you come to an image of Heracles and a trophy, which I was told Heracles raised after killing Hippocoon and his sons.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The third branch from the straight road is on the right, and leads to Caryae (Walnut-trees) and to the sanctuary of Artemis. For Caryae is a region sacred to Artemis and the nymphs, and here stands in the open an image of Artemis Caryatis. Here every year the Lacedaemonian maidens hold chorus-dances, and they have a traditional native dance. On returning, as you go along the highway, you come to the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In Thornax, which you will reach as you go along, is an image of Apollo Pythaeus, made after the style of the one at Amyclae; the fashion of it I will describe when I come to speak of the latter.

To prevent misconception, I added in my account of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> that I had not mentioned everything in order, but had made a selection of what was most noteworthy. This I will repeat before beginning my account of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; for from the beginning the plan of my work has been to discard the many trivial stories current among the several communities, and to pick out the things most worthy of mention—an excellent rule which I will never violate.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians who live in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> have a market-place worth seeing; the council-chamber of the senate, and the offices of the ephors, of the guardians of the laws, and of those called the Bidiaeans, are all in the market-place. The senate is the council which has the supreme control of the Lacedaemonian constitution, the other officials form the executive. Both the ephors and the Bidiaeans are five in number; it is customary for the latter to hold competitions for the lads, particularly the one at the place called Platanistas (Plane-tree Grove), while the ephors transact the most serious business, one of them giving his name to the year, just as at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> this privilege belongs to one of those called the Nine Archons.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most striking feature in the marketplace is the portico which they call Persian because it was made from spoils taken in the Persian wars. In course of time they have altered it until it is as large and as splendid as it is now. On the pillars are white-marble figures of Persians, including Mardonius, son of Gobryas. There is also a figure of Artemisia, daughter of Lygdamis and queen of <placeName key="tgn,7016142">Halicarnassus</placeName>. It is said that this lady voluntarily joined the expedition of Xerxes against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and distinguished herself at the naval engagement off <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the market-place are temples; there is one of Caesar, the first Roman to covet monarchy and the first emperor under the present constitution, and also one to his son Augustus, who put the empire on a firmer footing, and became a more famous and a more powerful man than his father. His name “Augustus” means in Greek <term>sebastos</term> (reverend).</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the altar of Augustus they show a bronze statue of Agias. This Agias, they say, by divining for Lysander captured the Athenian fleet at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName> with the exception of ten ships of war.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0405">405 B.C.</date></note> These made their escape to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>; all the rest the Lacedaemonians captured along with their crews. Agias was a son of Agelochus, a son of Tisamenus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tisamenus belonged to the family of the Iamidae at <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, and an oracle was given to him that he should win five most famous contests.

And yet he was first in two events, beating Hieronymus of <placeName key="tgn,7010719">Andros</placeName> in running and in jumping.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians, hearing of the oracle the Pythian priestess had given to Tisamenus, persuaded him to migrate from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> and to be state-diviner at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such I learned was the history of Tisamenus. On their market-place the Spartans have images of Apollo Pythaeus, of Artemis and of Leto. The whole of this region is called Choros (Dancing), because at the Gymnopaediae, a festival which the Lacedaemonians take more seriously than any other, the lads perform dances in honor of Apollo. Not far from them is a sanctuary of Earth and of Zeus of the Market-place, another of Athena of the Market-place and of Poseidon surnamed Securer, and likewise one of Apollo and of Hera.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also dedicated a colossal statue of the Spartan People. The Lacedaemonians have also a sanctuary of the Fates, by which is the grave of Orestes, son of Agamemnon. For when the bones of Orestes were brought from <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> in accordance with an oracle they were buried here. Beside the grave of Orestes is a statue of Polydorus, son of Alcamenes, a king who rose to such honor that the magistrates seal with his likeness everything that requires sealing.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also Hermes of the Market-place carrying Dionysus as a child, besides the old Courts of the Ephors, as they are called, in which are the tombs of Epimenides the Cretan and of Aphareus the son of Perieres. As to Epimenides, I think the Lacedaemonian story is more probable than the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>. Here, where the Fates are, the Lacedaemonians also have a sanctuary of Hestia. There is also Zeus Hospitable and Athena Hospitable.</p></div>

<div n="12" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go from the market-place by the road they name the Aphetaid Road, you come to the so-called Booneta.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, Office of the Ox-buyer's.</note> But my narrative must first explain why the road has this name.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is said that Icarius proposed a foot-race for the wooers of Penelope; that Odysseus won is plain, but they say that the competitors were let go (aphethenai) for the race along the Aphetaid Road. In my opinion, Icarius was imitating Danaus when he held the running-race. For Danaus contrived the following plan to solve the difficulty about his daughters. Nobody would take a wife from among them because of their pollution so Danaus sent round a notice that he would give away his daughters without bride-gifts, and that each suitor could choose the one whose beauty pleased him most. A few men came, among whom he held a foot-race the first comer was allowed to choose before all the others, after him the second, and so on to the last. The daughters that were left had to wait until other suitors arrived and competed in another foot-race.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On this road the Lacedaemonians have, as I have already said, what is called the Booneta, which once was the house of their king Polydorus. When he died, they bought it from his widow, paying the price in oxen.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those who sail to <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> say that the natives give other merchandise in exchange for Greek cargoes, knowing nothing about coinage, and that though they have plenty of gold and of bronze.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the opposite side of the office of the Bidiaeans is a sanctuary of Athena. Odysseus is said to have set up the image and to have named it Keleuthea (Lady of the Road), when he had beaten the suitors of Penelope in the foot-race.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a place in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> called Theomelida. In this part of the city are the graves of the Agiad kings, and near is what is called the lounge of the Crotani, who form a part of the Pitanatans. Not far from the lounge is a sanctuary of Asclepius, called “in the place of the Agiadae.” Farther on is the tomb of Taenarus, after whom they say the headland was named that juts out into the sea. Here are sanctuaries of Poseidon Hippocurius (Horse-tending) and of Artemis Aiginaea (Goat-goddess?). On returning to the lounge you see a sanctuary of Artemis Issoria. They surname her also Lady of the Lake, though she is not really Artemis hut Britomartis of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary of Thetis was set up, they say, for the following reason.

This Cleo the wife of Anaxander asked for from her husband, and discovering that she had the wooden image of Thetis, she set up with her a temple for the goddess. This Leandris did because of a vision in a dream,</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but the wooden image of Thetis is guarded in secret. The cult of Demeter Chthonia (of the Lower World) the Lacedaemonians say was handed on to them by Orpheus, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.35">Paus. 2.35.4-8</bibl>.</note> that the Lacedaemonians also began to worship Demeter Chthonia.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians give the name Running Course to the place where it is the custom for the young men even down to the present day to practise running. As you go to this Course from the grave of the Agiadae, you see on the left the tomb of Eumedes—this Eumedes was one of the children of Hippocoon—and also an old image of Heracles, to whom sacrifice is paid by the Sphaereis. These are those who are just passing from youth to manhood. In the Course are two gymnastic schools, one being a votive gift of Eurycles, a Spartan. Outside the Course, over against the image of Heracles, there is a house belonging now to a private individual, but in olden times to Menelaus. Farther away from the Course are sanctuaries of the Dioscuri, of the Graces, of Eileithyia, of Apollo Carneus, and of Artemis Leader.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary of Agnitas has been made on the right of the Course; Agnitas is a surname of Asclepius, because the god had a wooden image of agnus castus. The agnus is a willow like the thorn. Not far from Asclepius stands a trophy, raised, they say, by Polydeuces to celebrate his victory over Lynceus. This is one of the pieces of evidence that confirm my statement that the sons of Aphareus were not buried in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. At the beginning of the Course are the Dioscuri Starters, and a little farther on a hero-shrine of Alcon, who they say was a son of Hippocoon.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beside the shrine of Alcon is a sanctuary of Poseidon, whom they surname “of the House.”</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And there is a place called Platanistas (Plane-tree Grove) from the unbroken ring of tall plane trees growing round it. The place itself, where it is customary for the youths to fight, is surrounded by a moat just like an island in the sea; you enter it by bridges. On each of the two bridges stand images; on one side an image of Heracles, on the other a likeness of Lycurgus. Among the laws Lycurgus laid down for the constitution are those regulating the fighting of the youths.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are other acts performed by the youths, which I will now describe. Before the fighting they sacrifice in the Phoebaeum, which is outside the city, not far distant from Therapne. Here each company of youths sacrifices a puppy to Enyalius, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the people of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the Wayside Goddess.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the sacrifice the youths set trained boars to fight; the company whose boar happens to win generally gains the victory in Plane-tree Grove. Such are the performances in the Phoebaeum. A little before the middle of the next day they enter by the bridges into the place I have mentioned. They cast lots during the night to decide by which entrance each band is to go in. In fighting they use their hands, kick with their feet, bite, and gouge out the eyes of their opponents. Man to man they fight in the way I have described, but in the melee they charge violently and push one another into the water.</p></div>

Behind the portico built by the side of Plane-tree Grove are other hero-shrines, of Alcimus, of Enaraephorus, at a little distance away one of Dorceus, and close to it one of Sebrus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These are said to be sons of Hippocoon. The fountain near the hero-shrine of Dorceus they call Dorcean after him; the place Sebrium is named after Sebrus. On the right of Sebrium is the tomb of Alcman, the lyric poet, the charm of whose works was not in the least spoilt by the Laconian dialect, which is the least musical of them all.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are sanctuaries of Helen and of Heracles; the former is near the grave of Alcman, the latter is quite close to the wall and contains an armed image of Heracles. The attitude of the image is due, they say, to the fight with Hippocoon and his sons. The enmity of Heracles towards the family of Hippocoon is said to have sprung out of their refusing to cleanse him when he came to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> for cleansing after the death of Iphitus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following incident, too, helped to begin the feud. Oeonus, a stripling cousin of Heracles—he was the son of Licymnius the brother of Alcmene—came to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> along with Heracles, and went round to view the city. When he came to the house of Hippocoon, a house-dog attacked him. Oeonus happened to throw a stone which knocked over the dog. So the sons of Hippocoon ran out, and dispatched Oeonus with their clubs.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This made Heracles most bitterly wroth with Hippocoon and his sons, and straightway, angry as he was, he set out to give them battle. On this occasion he was wounded, and made good his retreat by stealth but afterwards he made an expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and succeeded in avenging himself on Hippocoon, and also on the sons of Hippocoon for their murder of Oeonus. The tomb of Oeonus is built by the side of the sanctuary of Heracles.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go from the Course towards the east, there is a path on the right, with a sanctuary of Athena called Axiopoinos (Just Requital or Tit for Tat). For when Heracles, in avenging himself on Hippocoon and his sons, had inflicted upon them a just requital for their treatment of his relative, he founded a sanctuary of Athena, and surnamed her Axiopoinos because the ancients used to call vengeance <term>poinai</term>. There is another sanctuary of Athena on another road from the Course. It was dedicated, they say, by Theras son of Autesion son of Tisamenus son of Thersander, when he was leading a colony to the island now called <placeName key="tgn,7002507">Thera</placeName> after him, the name of which in ancient times was <placeName key="tgn,7002507">Calliste</placeName> (Fairest).</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near is a temple of Hipposthenes, who won so many victories in wrestling. They worship Hipposthenes in accordance with an oracle, paying him honors as to Poseidon. Opposite this temple is an old image of Enyalius in fetters. The idea the Lacedaemonians express by this image is the same as the Athenians express by their Wingless Victory; the former think that Enyalius will never run away from them, being bound in the fetters, while the Athenians think that Victory, having no wings, will always remain where she is.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this fashion, and with such a belief have these cities set up the wooden images. In <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is a lounge called Painted, and by it hero-shrines of Cadmus the son of Agenor, and of his descendants Oeolycus, son of Theras, and Aegeus, son of Oeolycus. They are said to have been made by Maesis, Laeas and Europas, sons of Hyraeus, son of Aegeus. They made for Amphilochus too his hero-shrine, because their ancestor Tisamenus had for his mother Demonassa, the sister of Amphilochus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians are the only Greeks who surname Hera Goat-eater, and sacrifice goats to the goddess. They say that Heracles founded the sanctuary and was the first to sacrifice goats, because in his fight against Hippocoon and his children he met with no hindrance from Hera, although in his other adventures he thought that the goddess opposed him. He sacrificed goats, they say, because he lacked other kinds of victims.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of Poseidon God of Kin, and there are hero-shrines of Cleodaeus, son of Hyllus, and of Oebalus.

<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is a sanctuary of Morpho, a surname of Aphrodite, who sits wearing a veil and with fetters on her feet. The story is that the fetters were put on her by Tyndareus, who symbolized by the bonds the faithfulness of wives to their husbands. The other account, that Tyndareus punished the goddess with fetters because he thought that from Aphrodite had come the shame of his daughters, I will not admit for a moment.

They said that they had come from <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, and asked to lodge with him, requesting to have the chamber which had pleased them most when they dwelt among men.</p></div>

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such is the story.

The reason of their setting out was that they held that the Erycine district belonged to the descendants of Heracles and not to the foreigners who held it. The story is that Heracles wrestled with <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> on these terms: if Heracles won, the land of <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> was to belong to him but if he were beaten, <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> was to depart with the cows of Geryon;</p></div>

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians have also made a sanctuary for Lycurgus, who drew up the laws, looking upon him as a god. Behind the temple is the grave of Eucosmus, the son of Lycurgus, and by the altar the grave of Lathria and Anaxandra. Now these were themselves twins, and therefore the sons of Aristodemus, who also were twins likewise, took them to wife; they were daughters of Thersander son of Agamedidas, king of the Cleonaeans and great-grandson of Ctesippus, son of Heracles. Opposite the temple is the tomb of Theopompus son of Nicander, and also that of Eurybiades, who commanded the Lacedaemonian warships that fought the Persians at <placeName key="perseus,Artemisium">Artemisium</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The place named Limnaeum (Marshy) is sacred to Artemis Orthia (Upright). The wooden image there they say is that which once Orestes and Iphigenia stole out of the Tauric land, and the Lacedaemonians say that it was brought to their land because there also Orestes was king. I think their story more probable than that of the Athenians. For what could have induced Iphigenia to leave the image behind at <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName>? Or why did the Athenians, when they were preparing to abandon their land, fail to include this image in what they put on board their ships?</p></div>

But the Athenians, we are asked to believe, made light of it becoming booty of the Persians. For the image at <placeName key="perseus,Brauron">Brauron</placeName> was brought to <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>, and afterwards Seleucus gave it to the Syrians of Laodicea, who still possess it.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I will give other evidence that the Orthia in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> is the wooden image from the foreigners. Firstly, Astrabacus and Alopecus, sons of Irbus, son of Amphisthenes, son of Amphicles, son of Agis, when they found the image straightway became insane. Secondly, the Spartan Limnatians, the Cynosurians, and the people of Mesoa and <placeName key="perseus,Pitane">Pitane</placeName>, while sacrificing to Artemis, fell to quarreling, which led also to bloodshed; many were killed at the altar and the rest died of disease.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Whereat an oracle was delivered to them, that they should stain the altar with human blood. He used to be sacrificed upon whomsoever the lot fell, but Lycurgus changed the custom to a scourging of the lads, and so in this way the altar is stained with human blood. By them stands the priestess, holding the wooden image. Now it is small and light,</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but if ever the scourgers spare the lash because of a lad's beauty or high rank, then at once the priestess finds the image grow so heavy that she can hardly carry it. She lays the blame on the scourgers, and says that it is their fault that she is being weighed down. So the image ever since the sacrifices in the Tauric land keeps its fondness for human blood. They call it not only Orthia, but also Lygodesma (Willow-bound), because it was found in a thicket of willows, and the encircling willow made the image stand upright.</p></div>

<div n="17" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not far from the Orthia is a sanctuary of Eileithyia.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here is built a sanctuary of Athena, who is called both City-protecting and Lady of the Bronze House. The building of the sanctuary was begun, they say, by Tyndareus. On his death his children were desirous of making a second attempt to complete the building, and the resources they intended to use were the spoils of <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>. They too left it unfinished, and it was many years afterwards that the Lacedaemonians made of bronze both the temple and the image of Athena. The builder was Gitiadas, a native of Sparta, who also composed Dorian lyrics, including a hymn to the goddess.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"> c. <date when="-0500">500 B.C</date></note></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the bronze are wrought in relief many of the labours of Heracles and many of the voluntary exploits he successfully carried out, besides the rape of the daughters of Leucippus and other achievements of the sons of Tyndareus. There is also Hephaestus releasing his mother from the fetters. The legend about this I have already related in my history of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.20.3">Paus. 1.20.3</bibl>.</note> There are also represented nymphs bestowing upon Perseus, who is starting on his enterprise against Medusa in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, a cap and the shoes by which he was to be carried through the air. There are also wrought the birth of Athena, Amphitrite, and Poseidon, the largest figures, and those which I thought the best worth seeing.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is here another sanctuary of Athena; her surname is the Worker. As you go to the south portico there is a temple of Zeus surnamed Cosmetas (Orderer), and before it is the tomb of Tyndareus. The west portico has two eagles, and upon them are two Victories. Lysander dedicated them to commemorate both his exploits; the one was off <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, when he conquered Antiochus, the captain of Alcibiades, and the Athenian warships and the second occurred later, when he destroyed the Athenian fleet at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the left of the Lady of the Bronze House they have set up a sanctuary of the Muses, because the Lacedaemonians used to go out to fight, not to the sound of the trumpet, but to the music of the flute and the accompaniment of lyre and harp. Behind the Lady of the Bronze House is a temple of Aphrodite Areia (Warlike). The wooden images are as old as any in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the right of the Lady of the Bronze House has been set up an image of Zeus Most High, the oldest image that is made of bronze. It is not wrought in one piece. Each of the limbs has been hammered separately; these are fitted together, being prevented from coming apart by nails. They say that the artist was Clearchus of Rhegium, who is said by some to have been a pupil of Dipoenus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.15.1">Paus. 2.15.1</bibl> and <bibl n="Paus. 2.32.5">Paus. 2.32.5</bibl>.</note> and Scyllis, by others of Daedalus himself. By what is called the Scenoma (Tent) there is a statue of a woman, whom the Lacedaemonians say is Euryleonis. She won a victory at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> with a two-horse chariot.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By the side of the altar of the Lady of the Bronze House stand two statues of Pausanias, the general at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. His history, as it is known, I will not relate. The accurate accounts of my predecessors suffice; I shall content myself with adding to them what I heard from a man of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>. Pausanias was detected in his treachery, and was the only suppliant of the Lady of the Bronze House who failed to win security, solely because he had been unable to wipe away a defilement of bloodshed.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he was cruising about the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> with the Lacedaemonian and allied fleets, he fell in love with a Byzantine maiden. And straightway at the beginning of night Cleonice —that was the girl's name—was brought by those who had been ordered to do so. But Pausanias was asleep at the time and the noise awoke him. For as she came to him she unintentionally dropped her lighted lamp. And Pausanias, conscious of his treason to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and therefore always nervous and fearful, jumped up then and struck the girl with his sword.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From this defilement Pausanias could not escape, although he underwent all sorts of purifications and became a suppliant of Zeus Phyxius (God of Flight), and finally went to the wizards at <placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phigalia</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> but he paid a fitting penalty to Cleonice and to the god. The Lacedaemonians, in fulfillment of a command from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, had the bronze images made and honor the spirit Bountiful, saying that it was this Bountiful that turns aside the wrath that the God of Suppliants shows because of Pausanias.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="18" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the statues of Pausanias is an image of Aphrodite Ambologera (Postponer of Old Age), which was set up in accordance with an oracle; there are also images of Sleep and of Death. They think them brothers, in accordance with the verses in the Iliad.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go towards what is called the Alpium is a temple of Athena Ophthalmitis (Goddess of the Eye). They say that Lycurgus dedicated it when one of his eyes had been struck out by Alcander, because the laws he had made happened not to find favour with Alcander. Having fled to this place he was saved by the Lacedaemonians from losing his remaining eye, and so he made this temple of Athena Ophthalmitis.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Farther on from here is a sanctuary of Ammon. From the first the Lacedaemonians are known to have used the oracle in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> more than any other Greeks. It is said also that when Lysander was besieging Aphytis in Pallene Ammon appeared by night and declared that it would be better for him and for <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> if they ceased from warring against Aphytis. And so Lysander raised the siege, and induced the Lacedaemonians to worship the god still more. The people of Aphytis honor Ammon no less than the Ammonian Libyans.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The story of Artemis Cnagia is as follows. Cnageus, they say, was a native who joined the Dioscuri in their expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName>. Being taken prisoner in the battle and sold into <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, he lived as a slave where the Cretans had a sanctuary of Artemis; but in course of time he ran away in the company of the maiden priestess, who took the image with her. It is for this reason that they name Artemis Cnagia.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But I am of opinion that Cnageus came to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> in some other way, and not in the manner the Lacedaemonians state; for I do not think there was a battle at <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName> at all, Theseus being detained among the Thesprotians and the Athenians not being unanimous, their sympathies inclining towards Menestheus. Moreover, even if a fight occurred, nobody would believe that prisoners were taken from the conquerors, especially as the victory was overwhelming, so that <placeName key="perseus,Aphidna">Aphidna</placeName> itself was captured.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I must now end my criticisms. As you go down to Amyclae from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> you come to a river called Tiasa. They hold that Tiasa was a daughter of Eurotas, and by it is a sanctuary of Graces, Phaenna and Cleta, as Alcman calls them in a poem. They believe that <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> founded the sanctuary for the Graces here, and gave them their names.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The things worth seeing in Amyclae include a victor in the pentathlon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.29.5">Paus. 1.29.5</bibl>.</note> named Aenetus, on a slab. The story is that he won a victory at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, but died while the crown was being placed on his head. So there is the statue of this man; there are also bronze tripods. The older ones are said to be a tithe of the Messenian war.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Under the first tripod stood an image of Aphrodite, and under the second an Artemis. The two tripods themselves and the reliefs are the work of Gitiadas<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0500">500 B.C.</date></note>. The third was made by Gallon of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, and under it stands an image of the Maid, daughter of Demeter. Aristander of <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> and Polycleitus of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0440">440 B.C.</date></note> have statues here; the former a woman with a lyre, supposed to be <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, the latter an Aphrodite called “beside the Amyclaean.” These tripods are larger than the others, and were dedicated from the spoils of the victory at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Bathycles of <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">c. <date when="-0550">550 B.C.</date></note> who made the throne of the Amyclaean, dedicated, on the completion of the throne, Graces and an image of Artemis Leucophryene. Whose pupil this Bathycles was, and who was king of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> when he made the throne, I pass over; but I saw the throne and will describe its details.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is supported in front, and similarly behind, by two Graces and two Seasons. On the left stand Echidna and Typhos, on the right Tritons. To describe the reliefs one by one in detail would have merely bored my readers; but to be brief and concise (for the greater number of them are not unknown either) Poseidon and Zeus are carrying Taygete, daughter of Atlas, and her sister Alcyone. There are also reliefs of Atlas, the single combat of Heracles and Cycnus, and the battle of the Centaurs at the cave of Pholus.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I cannot say why Bathycles has represented the so-called Bull of Minos bound, and being led along alive by Theseus. There is also on the throne a band of Phaeacian dancers, and Demodocus singing. Perseus, too, is represented killing Medusa. Passing over the fight of Heracles with the giant Thurius and that of Tyndareus with Eurytus, we have next the rape of the daughters of Leucippus. Here are Dionysus, too, and Heracles; Hermes is bearing the infant Dionysus to heaven, and Athena is taking Heracles to dwell henceforth with the gods.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is Peleus handing over Achilles to be reared by Cheiron, who is also said to have been his teacher. There is Cephalus, too, carried off by Day because of his beauty. The gods are bringing gifts to the marriage of Harmonia. There is wrought also the single combat of Achilles and Memnon , and Heracles avenging himself upon Diomedes the Thracian, and upon Nessus at the river Euenus. Hermes is bringing the goddesses to Alexander to be judged. Adrastus and Tydeus are staying the fight between Amphiaraus and Lycurgus the son of Pronax.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hera is gazing at Io, the daughter of Inachus, who is already a cow, and Athena is running away from Hephaestus, who chases her. Next to these have been wrought two of the exploits of Heracles—his slaying the hydra, and his bringing up the Hound of Hell. Anaxias and Mnasinous are each seated on horseback, but there is one horse only carrying Megapenthes, the son of Menelaus, and Nicostratus. Bellerophontes is destroying the beast in <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName>, and Heracles is driving off the cows of Geryones.</p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the upper edge of the throne are wrought, one on each side, the sons of Tyndareus on horses. There are sphinxes under the horses, and beasts running upwards, on the one side a leopard, by Polydeuces a lioness. On the very top of the throne has been wrought a band of dancers, the Magnesians who helped Bathycles to make the throne.</p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Underneath the throne, the inner part away from the Tritons contains the hunting of the Calydonian boar and Heracles killing the children of Actor. <placeName key="tgn,7009002">Calais</placeName> and Zetes are driving the Harpies away from Phineus. Peirithous and Theseus have seized Helen, and Heracles is strangling the lion. Apollo and Artemis are shooting Tityus.</p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is represented the fight between Heracles and Oreius the Centaur, and also that between Theseus and the Bull of Minos. There are also represented the wrestling of Heracles with Achelous, the fabled binding of Hera by Hephaestus, the games Acastus held in honor of his father, and the story of Menelaus and the Egyptian Proteus from the Odyssey.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I know of nobody who has measured the height of the image, but at a guess one would estimate it to be as much as thirty cubits. It is not the work of Bathycles, being old and uncouth; for though it has face, feet, and hands, the rest resembles a bronze pillar. On its head it has a helmet, in its hands a spear and a bow.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The pedestal of the statue is fashioned into the shape of an altar and they say that Hyacinthus is buried in it, and at the Hyacinthia, before the sacrifice to Apollo, they devote offerings to Hyacinthus as to a hero into this altar through a bronze door, which is on the left of the altar. On the altar are wrought in relief, here an image of Biris, there Amphitrite and Poseidon. Zeus and Hermes are conversing; near stand Dionysus and Semele, with Ino by her side.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the altar are also Demeter, the Maid, Pluto, next to them Fates and Seasons, and with them Aphrodite, Athena and Artemis. They are carrying to heaven Hyacinthus and Polyboea, the sister, they say, of Hyacinthus, who died a maid. Now this statue of Hyacinthus represents him as bearded, but Nicias<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">fl. c. <date when="-0320">320 B.C.</date></note>, son of Nicomedes, has painted him in the very prime of youthful beauty, hinting at the love of Apollo for Hyacinthus of which legend tells.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Wrought on the altar is also Heracles; he too is being led to heaven by Athena and the other gods.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Amyclae was laid waste by the Dorians, and since that time has remained a village; I found there a sanctuary and image of Alexandra worth seeing. Alexandra is said by the Amyclaeans to be Cassandra, the daughter of Priam. Here is also a statue of Clytaemnestra, together with what is supposed to be the tomb of Agamemnon. The natives worship the Amyclaean god and Dionysus, surnaming the latter, quite correctly I think, Psilax. For psila is Doric for wings, and wine uplifts men and lightens their spirit no less than wings do birds.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such I found were the things worth mentioning about Amyclae. Another road from the city leads to Therapne,</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and on this road is a wooden image of Athena Alea. Before the Eurotas is crossed, a little above the bank is shown a sanctuary of Zeus Wealthy. Across the river is a temple of Asclepius Cotyleus (of the Hip-joint); it was made by Heracles, who named Asclepius Cotyleus, because he was cured of the wound in the hip-joint that he received in the former fight with Hippocoon and his sons. Of all the objects along this road the oldest is a sanctuary of Ares.

My own belief is that the surname Theritas<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Pausanias connects the name with<term>ther</term>, a wild beast.</note> was not given to Ares because of his nurse, but because when a man meets an enemy in battle he must cast aside all gentleness, as Homer says of Achilles:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">And he is fierce as a lion.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

The account of the Rhodians is different. They say that when Menelaus was dead, and Orestes still a wanderer, Helen was driven out by Nicostratus and Megapenthes and came to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, where she had a friend in Polyxo,</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>the wife of Tlepolemus.

At the time she was queen of the island, having been left with an orphan boy. They say that this Polyxo desired to avenge the death of Tlepolemus on Helen, now that she had her in her power. So she sent against her when she was bathing handmaidens dressed up as Furies, who seized Helen and hanged her on a tree, and for this reason the Rhodians have a sanctuary of Helen of the Tree.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A story too I will tell which I know the people of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName> tell about Helen. The people of Himera too agree with this account. In the Euxine at the mouths of the Ister is an island sacred to Achilles. It is called White Island, and its circumference is twenty stades. It is wooded throughout and abounds in animals, wild and tame, while on it is a temple of Achilles with an image of him.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first to sail thither legend says was Leonymus of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName>.

So Leonymus the general of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName> attacked his enemy at that point where he heard that Ajax was posted in the front line. Now he was wounded in the breast, and weak with his hurt came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. When he arrived the Pythian priestess sent Leonynius to White Island, telling him that there Ajax would appear to him and cure his wound.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In time he was healed and returned from White Island, where, he used to declare, he saw Achilles, as well as Ajax the son of Oileus and Ajax the son of Telamon.

Il. 2.584">Hom. Il. 2.584</bibl>It was founded by Helius, the youngest of the sons of Perseus, and the Dorians afterwards reduced it by siege.

The slaves afterwards acquired, although they were Dorians of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, also came to be called Helots, just as the whole Greek race were called Hellenes from the region in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> once called <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>From this <placeName key="perseus,Helos">Helos</placeName>, on stated days, they bring up to the sanctuary of the Eleusinian a wooden image of the Maid, daughter of Demeter. Fifteen stades distant from the sanctuary is Lapithaeum, named after Lapithus, a native of the district. So this Lapithaeum is on Taygetus, and not far off is Dereium, where is in the open an image of Artemis Dereatis, and beside it is a spring which they name Anonus. About twenty stades past Dereum is Harpleia, which extends as far as the plain.</p></div>

This it is not customary to open, but all the youths who are going to take part in the contest in Plane-tree Grove are wont to sacrifice to Achilles before the fight. The Spartans say that the sanctuary was made for them by Prax, a grandson of <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> the son of Neoptolemus.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Further on is what is called the Tomb of Horse. For Tyndareus, having sacrificed a horse here, administered an oath to the suitors of Helen, making them stand upon the pieces of the horse. The oath was to defend Helen and him who might be chosen to marry her if ever they should be wronged. When he had sworn the suitors he buried the horse here. Seven pillars, which are not far from this tomb ... in the ancient manner, I believe, which they say are images of the planets. On the road is a precinct of Cranius surnamed Stemmatias, and a sanctuary of Mysian Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The image of Modesty, some thirty stades distant from the city, they say was dedicated by Icarius, the following being the reason for making it. When Icarius gave Penelope in marriage to Odysseus, he tried to make Odysseus himself settle in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, but failing in the attempt, he next besought his daughter to remain behind, and when she was setting forth to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> he followed the chariot, begging her to stay.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Odysseus endured it for a time, but at last he bade Penelope either to accompany him willingly, or else, if she preferred her father, to go back to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>. They say that she made no reply, but covered her face with a veil in reply to the question, so that Icarios, realizing that she wished to depart with Odysseus, let her go, and dedicated an image of Modesty; for Penelope, they say, had reached this point of the road when she veiled herself.</p></div>

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the conclusion of the Trojan war and the death of Nestor after his return home, the Dorian expedition and return of the Heracleidae, which took place two generations later, drove the descendants of Nestor from <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>. This has already formed a part of my account of Tisamenus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 4.2.18">Paus. 4.2.18</bibl>.</note> I will only add the following: When the Dorians assigned <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> to Temenus, Cresphontes asked them for the land of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, in that he was older than Aristodemus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Aristodemus was now dead, but Cresphontes was vigorously opposed by Theras the son of Autesion, who was of Theban origin and fourth in descent from Polyneices the son of Oedipus. He was at that time guardian of the sons of Aristodemus, being their uncle on the mother's side, Aristodemus having married a daughter of Autesion, called Argeia. Cresphontes, wishing to obtain <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> as his portion at all costs, approached Temenus, and having suborned him pretended to leave the decision to the lot.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Temenus put the lots of the children of Aristodemus and of Cresphontes into a jar containing water, the terms being that the party whose lot came up first should be the first to choose a portion of the country. Temenus had caused both lots to be made of clay, but for the sons of Aristodemus sun-dried, for Cresphontes baked with fire. So the lot of the sons of Aristodemus was dissolved, and Cresphontes, winning in this way, chose <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The common people of the old Messenians were not dispossessed by the Dorians, but agreed to be ruled by Cresphontes and to divide the land with the Dorians. They were induced to give way to them in this by the suspicion which they felt for their rulers, as the Neleidae were originally of <placeName key="tgn,7011081">Iolcos</placeName>. Cresphontes took to wife Merope the daughter of Cypselus, then king of the Arcadians, by whom with other children was born to him Aepytus his youngest.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He had the palace, which he and his children were to occupy, built in <placeName key="perseus,Stenyclerus">Stenyclerus</placeName>.

In the time of Nestor and his descendants the palace was at <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, but Cresphontes ordained that the king should live in <placeName key="perseus,Stenyclerus">Stenyclerus</placeName>. As his government for the most part was directed in favour of the people, the rich rebelled and killed Cresphontes and all his sons except Aepytus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He was still a boy and being brought up by Cypselus, and was the sole survivor of his house.

On becoming king, Aepytus punished his father's murderers and all who had been accessories to the crime. By winning the Messenian nobles to his side by deference, and all who were of the people by gifts, he attained to such honor that his descendants were given the name of Aepytidae instead of Heracleidae.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Glaucus, his son and successor, was content to imitate his father in all other matters, both publicly and in his treatment of individuals, but attained to greater piety.

</div>

<div n="4" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the reign of Phintas the son of Sybotas the Messenians for the first time sent an offering and chorus of men to Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. Their processional hymn to the god was composed by Eumelus, this poem being the only one of his that is considered genuine. It was in the reign of Phintas that a quarrel first took place with the Lacedaemonians. The very cause is disputed, but is said to have been as follows:</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a sanctuary of Artemis called Limnatis (of the Lake) on the frontier of Messenian, in which the Messenians and the Lacedaemonians alone of the Dorians shared. According to the Lacedaemonians their maidens coming to the festival were violated by Messenian men and their king was killed in trying to prevent it. He was Teleclus the son of Archelaus, son of Agesilaus, son of Doryssus, son of Labotas, son of Echestratus, son of Agis. In addition to this they say that the maidens who were violated killed themselves for shame.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians say that a plot was formed by Teleclus against persons of the highest rank in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> who had come to the sanctuary, his incentive being the excellence of the Messenian land; in furtherance of his design he selected some Spartan youths, all without beards, dressed them in girls' clothes and ornaments, and providing them with daggers introduced them among the Messenians when they were resting; the Messenians, in defending themselves, killed the beardless youths and Teleclus himself; but the Lacedaemonians, they say, whose king did not plan this without the general consent, being conscious that they had begun the wrong, did not demand justice for the murder of Teleclus. These are the accounts given by the two sides; one may believe them according to one's feelings towards either side.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A generation later in the reign of Alcamenes the son of Teleclus in Lacedaemon—the king of the other house was Theopompus the son of Nicander, son of Charillus, son of Polydectes, son of Eunomus, son of Prytanis, son of Eurypon in Messenia Antiochus and Androcles, the sons of Phintas were reigning—the mutual hatred of the Lacedaemonians and Messenians was aroused, and the Lacedaemonians began war, obtaining a pretext which was not only sufficient for them, eager for a quarrel as they were and resolved on war at all costs, but also plausible in the highest degree, although with a more peaceful disposition it could have been settled by the decision of a court. What happened was as follows.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There was a Messenian Polychares, a man of no small distinction in all respects and an Olympic victor. (The Eleians were holding the fourth Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">B.C. 764.</note> the only event being the short foot-race, when Polychares won his victory.) This man, possessing cattle without land of his own to provide them with sufficient grazing, gave them to a Spartan Euaephnus to feed on his own land, Euaephnus to have a share of the produce.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now Euaephnus was a man who set unjust gain above loyalty, and a trickster besides. He sold the cattle of Polychares to some merchants who put in to <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, and went himself to inform Polychares but he said that pirates had landed in the country, had overcome him and carried off the cattle and the herdsmen. While he was trying to deceive him by his lies, one of the herdsmen, escaping in the meantime from the merchants, returned and found Euaephnus there with his master, and convicted him before Polychares.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thus caught and unable to deny it, he made many appeals to Polychares himself and to his son to grant him pardon; for among the many inducements to be found in human nature which drive us to wrongdoing the love of gain exercises the greatest power. He stated the price which he had received for the cattle and begged that the son of Polychares should come with him to receive it. When on their way they reached <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, Euaephnus dared a deed more impious than the first; he murdered Polychares' son.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Polychares, when he heard of this new misfortune, went to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and plagued the kings and ephors, loudly lamenting his son and recounting the wrongs that he had suffered from Euaephnus, whom he had made his friend and trusted above all the Lacedaemonians. Obtaining no redress in spite of continual visits to the authorities, Polychares at last was driven out of his mind, gave way to his rage, and, regardless of himself, dared to murder every Lacedaemonian whom he could capture.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians say that they went to war because Polychares was not surrendered to them, and on account of the murder of Teleclus; even before this they had been suspicious on account of the wrongdoing of Cresphontes in the matter of the lot. The Messenians make the reply that I have already given with regard to Teleclus, and point to the fact that the sons of Aristodemus helped to restore Aepytus the son of Cresphontes, which they would never have done if they had been at variance with Cresphontes.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that they did not surrender Polychares to the Lacedaemonians for punishment because they also had not surrendered Euaephnus, but that they offered to stand trial at the meeting of the league before the Argives, kinsmen of both parties, and to submit the matter to the court at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> called the Areopagus, as this court was held to exercise an ancient jurisdiction in cases pertaining to murder.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that these were not the reasons of the Lacedaemonians in going to war, but that they had formed designs on their country through covetousness, as in others of their actions, bringing forward against them their treatment of the Arcadians and of the Argives; for in both cases they have never been satisfied with their continual encroachments. When Croesus sent them presents they were the first to become friends with the barbarian, after he had reduced the other Greeks of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> and all the Dorians who live on the Carian mainland.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They point out too that when the Phocian leaders had seized the temple at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, the kings and every Spartan of repute privately, and the board of ephors and senate publicly, had a share of the god's property. As the most convincing proof that the Lacedaemonians would stick at nothing for the sake of gain, they reproach them with their alliance with Apollodorus, who became tyrant in Cassandreia.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I could not introduce into the present account the reasons why the Messenians have come to regard this as so bitter a reproach. Although the courage of the Messenians and the length of time for which they fought differ from the facts of the tyranny of Apollodorus, in their disastrous character the sufferings of the people of Cassandreia would not fall far short of the Messenian.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These then are the reasons for the war which the two sides allege. An embassy then came from the Lacedaemonians to demand the surrender of Polychares. The Messenian kings replied to the ambassadors that after deliberation with the people they would send the findings to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and after their departure they themselves summoned the citizens to a meeting. The views put forward differed widely, Androcles urging the surrender of Polychares as guilty of an impious and abominable crime. Antiochus among other arguments urged against him that it would be the most piteous thing that Polychares should suffer before the eyes of Euaephnus, and enumerated in detail all that he would have to undergo.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Finally the supporters of Androcles and of Antiochus were so carried away that they took up arms. But the battle did not last long, for the party of Antiochus, far outnumbering the other, killed Androcles and his principal supporters, Antiochus, now sole king, sent to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> that he was ready to submit the matter to the courts which I have already mentioned. But the Lacedaemonians are said to have made no reply to the bearers of the letter.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not many months later Antiochus died and his son Euphaes succeeded to the kingdom. The Lacedaemonians, without sending a herald to declare war on the Messenians or renouncing their friendship beforehand, had made their preparations secretly and with all the concealment possible; they first took an oath that neither the length of the war, should it not be decided soon, nor their disasters, however great they might be, would deter them until they won the land of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> by the sword.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After taking this oath, they attacked Ampheia by night, appointing Alcamenes the son of Teleclus leader of the force. Ampheia is a small town in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> near the Laconian border, of no great size, but situated on a high hill and possessing copious springs of water. It seemed generally a suitable base for the whole war. The gates being open and the town not garrisoned, they took it and killed the Messenians captured there, some still in their beds and others who had taken refuge at the sanctuaries and altars of the gods when they realized what had happened. Those who escaped were few.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This was the first attack which the Lacedaemonians made on the Messenians, in the second year of the ninth Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">B.C. 743.</note> when Xenodocus of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> won the short foot-race.

<div n="6" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before I wrote the history of the war and all the sufferings and actions that heaven prepared in it for both sides, I wished to reach a decision regarding the age of a certain Messenian. This war was fought between the Lacedaemonians with their allies and the Messenians with their supporters, but received its name not from the invaders like the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, but was called Messenian from their disasters, just as the name Trojan war, rather than Greek, came to be universally applied to the war at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. An account of this war of the Messenians has been given by Rhianus of <placeName key="tgn,1052372">Bene</placeName> in his epic, and by Myron of <placeName key="perseus,Priene">Priene</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Myron of <placeName key="tgn,7016803">Priene</placeName> is of unknown date.  Rhianus of Bene in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> was of the third century B.C., a Homeric scholar and the author of various works of a mythological and quasi-historical character. Besides his <title>Messeniaca</title>, largely used by the author in the present account, we hear of his <title>Heracleia</title>, <title>Achaica</title>, <title>Eliaca</title>, and <title>Thessalica</title>.</note> <placeName key="tgn,2009018">Myron</placeName>'s history is in prose.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Neither writer achieved a complete and continuous account of the whole war from its beginning to the end, but only of the part which each selected: <placeName key="tgn,2009018">Myron</placeName> narrated the capture of Ampheia and subsequent events down to the death of Aristodemus; Rhianus did not touch this first war at all. He described the events that in time befell the Messenians after their revolt from the Lacedaemonians, not indeed the whole of them, but those subsequent to the battle which they fought at the Great Trench, as it is called.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenian, Aristomenes, on whose account I have made my whole mention of Rhianus and Myron, was the man who first and foremost raised the name of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messene</placeName> to renown. He was introduced by <placeName key="tgn,2009018">Myron</placeName> into his history, while to Rhianus in his epic Aristomenes is as great a man as is the Achilles of the <title>Iliad</title> to Homer. As their statements differ so widely, it remained for me to adopt one or other of the accounts, but not both together, and Rhianus appeared to me to have given the more probable account as to the age of Aristomenes.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>One may realize in others of his works that Myron gives no heed to the question of his statements seeming to lack truth and credibility, and particularly in this Messenian history. For he has made Aristomenes kill Theopompus, the king of the Lacedaemonians, shortly before the death of Aristodemus but we know that Theopompus was not killed either in battle or in any other way before the war was concluded.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was this Theopompus who put an end to the war, and my evidence is the lines of Tyrtaeus, which say:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">To our king beloved of the gods, Theopompus, through whom we took <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> with wide dancing-grounds.</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus, unknown location.</bibl> Aristomenes then in my view belongs to the time of the second war, and I will relate his history when I come to this.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians, when they heard of the events at Ampheia from the actual survivors from the captured town, mustered in <placeName key="perseus,Stenyclerus">Stenyclerus</placeName> from their cities. When the people had gathered in the assembly, first the leading men and finally the king exhorted them not to be panic-stricken at the sack of Ampheia, or to suppose that the issue of the whole war had already been decided thereby, or to be afraid of the power of the Lacedaemonians as superior to their own. For the Lacedaemonians had longer practice in warfare, but they themselves had a stronger necessity to show themselves brave men, and greater goodwill would be shown by the gods to men defending their country, who were not the authors of injustice.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="7" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words Euphaes dismissed the gathering, and henceforward kept all the Messenians under arms, compelling the untrained to learn the art of war and the trained men to undergo a more rigorous discipline than before. The Lacedaemonians carried out raids into <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, but did no harm to the country, regarding it as their own, nor did they cut down trees or demolish buildings, but they drove off any cattle that they met with, and carried off the corn and other produce.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They made assaults on the towns but captured none, as they were fortified with walls and carefully garrisoned. They withdrew with loss and without effecting anything, and finally gave up attempting the towns. The Messenians also ravaged the Laconian coast and all the cultivated land round Taygetos.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Three years after the capture of Ampheia, being eager to put to use the spirit of the Messenians, now at the height of their passion against the Lacedaemonians, and considering too that they had undergone sufficient training, Euphaes ordered an advance. He bade the slaves also accompany him, bringing wood and all else that was required for the making of an entrenched camp. The Lacedaemonians heard from their garrison at Ampheia that the Messenians were marching out, so they also came out to battle.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There was a place in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> which was in other ways suitable for an engagement, but had a deep ravine in front of it. Here Euphaes drew up the Messenians and appointed Cleonnis general; the cavalry and light-armed, together amounting to less than 500, were commanded by Pytharatus and Antander.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As the two forces were about to engage, the ravine which divided them prevented the heavy-armed from coming to close quarters, though they approached one another eagerly and with a recklessness born of hate. The cavalry and light-armed engaged above the ravine, but as they were equally matched in numbers and skill, for this reason the fight was indecisive.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>While they were involved, Euphaes ordered the slaves to fortify with a palisade first the rear of his force and afterwards both flanks, and when the battle had been broken off at nightfall, they fortified his front also on the ravine. So at daybreak the Lacedaemonians realized the forethought of Euphaes. They had no means of fighting the Messenians unless they came out from the stockade, and despaired of forming a siege, for which they were unprepared in all things alike.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They then returned home; but a year later, when the older men reviled them and taunted them both with cowardice and disregard of their oath, they made a second expedition openly against the Messenians. Both kings were in command, Theopompus the son of Nicander and Polydorus the son of Alcamenes, Alcamenes being no longer alive. The Messenians encamped opposite them, and when the Spartans endeavored to join battle, went out to meet them.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonian commander on the left wing was Polydorus, and Theopompus on the right. The center was held by Euryleon, now a Lacedaemonian, but of Theban origin of the house of Cadmus, fourth in descent from Aegeus the son of Oeolycus, son of Theras, son of Autesion. On the side of the Messenians Antander and Euphaes were posted opposite the Lacedaemonian right; the other wing, opposite Polydorus, was held by Pytharatus, with Cleonnis in the center.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As they were about to engage, the kings came forward to encourage their men. The words of encouragement addressed by Theopompus to the Lacedaemonians were few, according to their native custom. He reminded them of their oath against the Messenians, and said how noble was their ambition, to prove themselves to have done a deed more glorious than their fathers, who subdued the neighboring peoples, and to have won a more fortunate land. Euphaes spoke at greater length than the Spartan, but no more than he saw the occasion admitted.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He declared that the contest would be not only for land and possessions, but he knew well what would overtake them if defeated. Their wives and children would be carried off as slaves, and death unaccompanied by outrage would be the mildest fate for their grown men their sanctuaries would be despoiled and their ancestral homes burnt. His words were not supposition, the fate of the men captured at Ampheia was evidence that all could see.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Better a noble death than such evils; it was far easier for them, while still undefeated and equally matched in courage, to outdo their adversaries in zeal than to repair their losses when once they had lost heart.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="8" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the words of Euphaes. When the leaders on either side gave the signal, the Messenians charged the Lacedaemonians recklessly like men eager for death in their wrath, each one of them eager to be the first to join battle. The Lacedaemonians also advanced to meet them eagerly, but were careful not to break their ranks.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When they were about to come to close quarters, they threatened one another by brandishing their arms and with fierce looks, and fell to recriminations, these calling the Messenians already their slaves, no freer than the Helots; the others answering that they were impious in their undertaking, who for the sake of gain attacked their kinsmen and outraged all the ancestral gods of the Dorians, and Heracles above all. And now with their taunts they come to deeds, mass thrusting against mass, especially on the Lacedaemonian side, and man attacking man.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians were far superior both in tactics and training, and also in numbers, for they had with them the neighboring peoples already reduced and serving in their ranks, and the Dryopes of Asine, who a generation earlier had been driven out of their own country by the Argives and had come as suppliants to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, were forced to serve in the army. Against the Messenian light-armed they employed Cretan archers as mercenaries.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians were inspired alike by desperation and readiness to face death, regarding all their sufferings as necessary rather than terrible to men who honored their country, and exaggerating their achievements and the consequences to the Lacedaemonians. Some of them leapt forth from the ranks, displaying glorious deeds of valor, in others fatally wounded and scarce breathing the frenzy of despair still reigned.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They encouraged one another, the living and unwounded urging the stricken before their last moment came to sell their lives as dearly as they could and accept their fate with joy. And the wounded, when they felt their strength ebbing and breath failing, urged the unwounded to prove themselves no less valorous than they and not to render their death of no avail to their fatherland.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians refrained from exhorting one another, and were less inclined than the Messenians to engage in striking deeds of valor. As they were versed in warfare from boyhood, they employed a deeper formation and hoped that the Messenians would not endure the contest for so long as they, or sustain the toil of battle or wounds.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These were the differences in both sets of combatants in action and in feeling; but on both sides alike the conquered made no appeals or promises of ransom, perhaps in their enmity despairing of getting quarter, but mainly because they scorned to disgrace their previous achievements. The victorious refrained alike from boasting and from taunts, neither side having yet sure hopes of victory. The most remarkable was the death of those who tried to strip any of the fallen. For if they exposed any part of their bodies, they were struck with javelins or were struck down while intent on their present occupation, or were killed by those whom they were plundering who still lived. </p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The kings fought in a manner that deserves mention. Theopompus rushed wildly forward to slay Euphaes himself. Euphaes, seeing him advancing, said to Antander that the action of Theopompus was no different from the attempt of his ancestor Polyneices; for Polyneices led an army from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> against his fatherland, and slaying his brother with his own hand was slain by him. Theopompus was ready to involve the race of the Heracleidae in pollution as great as that of the house of Laius and Oedipus, but he would not leave the field unscathed. With these words he too advanced.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thereupon the battle, though the combatants had wearied, everywhere broke out again in full force. Their strength was renewed and recklessness of death heightened on both sides, so that it might have been thought that they were engaging for the first time. Finally Euphaes and his men in a frenzy of despair that was near to madness (for picked Messenian troops formed the whole of the king's bodyguard), overpowering the enemy by their valor, drove back Theopompus himself and routed the Lacedaemonian troops opposed to them.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the other Messenian wing was in difficulties, for the general Pytharatus had been killed, and the men, without a commander, were fighting in a disorganized and confused manner, though not without heart. Polydorus did not pursue the Messenians when they gave way, nor Euphaes' men the Lacedaemonians. It seemed better to him and his men to support the defeated wing; they did not, however, engage with Polydorus' force, for darkness had already descended on the field;</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>moreover, the Lacedaemonians were prevented from following the retiring force further not least by their ignorance of the country. Also it was an ancient practice with them not to carry out a pursuit too quickly, as they were more careful about maintaining their formation than about slaying the flying.  In the center, where Euryleon was commanding the Lacedaemonians, and Cleonnis on the Messenian side, the contest was undecided; the coming of night separated them here also.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This battle was fought principally or entirely by the heavy-armed troops on both sides.  The mounted men were few and achieved nothing worth mention; for the Peloponnesians were not good horsemen then.  The Messenian light-armed and the Cretans on the Lacedaemonian side did not engage at all; for on both sides according to the ancient practice they were posted in reserve to their own infantry.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following day neither side was minded to begin battle or to be the first to set up a trophy, but as the day advanced they made proposals for taking up the dead; when this was agreed on both sides, they proceeded to bury them.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="9" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But after the battle the affairs of the Messenians began to get serious.  They were exhausted by the expenditure of money devoted to the garrisoning of the towns, and their slaves were deserting to the Lacedaemonians.  They were visited also by disease, which caused alarm, as resembling plague, although it did not attack all.  In these circumstances they resolved to desert all their numerous towns inland and to settle on Mount <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A small town existed here, which they say Homer mentions in the <title>Catalogue</title>:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Stepped <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.729">Hom. Il. 2.729</bibl>To this town they withdrew, extending the old circuit to form a sufficient protection for them all. The place was strong in other respects, for Ithome falls short of none of the mountains within the Isthmus in height and at this point was most difficult to climb.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They also resolved to send an envoy to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and despatched Tisis the son of Alcis, a man of the highest reputation, considered to be fully versed in divination. While he was returning from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> men from the Lacedaemonian garrison at Ampheia laid an ambush for him. Though trapped, he did not submit to be made a prisoner, but stood his ground to resist in spite of the wounds he received, until a voice was heard from an unseen quarter, “Let the bearer of the oracle go free.”</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tisis, reaching <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> with all speed, delivered the oracle to the king, and soon afterwards died of his wounds. Euphaes assembled the Messenians and made known the oracle:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Ye shall sacrifice a pure maiden to the gods below, appointed by lot of the blood of the sons of Aepytus, and slay her by night. But if that ye cannot do, offer a maiden from another house, if the father gives her freely for the slaughter.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the god declared this, all the maidens of the house of the Aepytidae forthwith cast lots, and the lot fell on the daughter of Lyciscus. But Epebolus the seer forbade them to offer her, for she was not the daughter of Lyciscus, but the woman who was married to Lyciscus being unable to bear a child had palmed off the girl as hers. While Epebolus was making this declaration, Lyciscus took the girl away and deserted to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians were in despair when they saw that Lyciscus had fled; thereupon Aristodemus, a son of the house of the Aepytidae, of higher standing than Lyciscus both in reputation and in war, freely offered his daughter for the sacrifice. But human affairs and human purpose above all are obscured by fate, just as the mud of a river hides a pebble; for when Aristodemus was striving his utmost to save <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, fate set this obstacle in his path.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A Messenian, whose name is not recorded, was in love with the daughter of' Aristodemus, and was already about to make her his wife. He at first disputed the rights of Aristodemus over the girl for Aristodemus, since he had betrothed her to himself had no further rights over the girl, but he to whom she was betrothed had greater rights than the father. Next, when he saw that this was of no avail, he had recourse to a shameless plea, that the girl was with child by him.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At last he drove Aristodemus to such a fury of passion that lie killed his daughter; then cutting her open he showed that she was not pregnant. Epebolus, who was present, ordered another man to come forward and offer his daughter, for the daughter of Aristodemus was of no avail to them dead; for the father had murdered her, not offered her to the gods whom the Pythia ordained.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the seer said this, the multitude of the Messenians rushed on the girl's lover to kill him, since he had fixed the guilt of bloodshed on Aristodemus to no purpose, and had made their hopes of safety doubtful. But as he was a close friend of Euphaes, Euphaes persuaded the Messenians that the oracle was fulfilled by the death of the girl and that the deed done by Aristodemus sufficed for them. </p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he said this, all the members of the house of the Aepytidae said that he spoke truth, for each was eager to be rid of the terror threatening his daughter. The people took the advice of' the king and broke up the assembly and thereupon turned to sacrifices to the gods and feasting.</p></div>

<div n="10" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the Lacedaemonians, when they heard the oracle given to the Messenians, were in despair, both they and their kings, and for the future shrank from offering battle.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But five years after the escape of Lyciscus from <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, the victims being auspicious, the Lacedaemonians marched against <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>. The Cretans were no longer with them. The allies of the Messenians also were late, for the Spartans had now incurred the suspicion of others of the Peloponnesians, especially of the Arcadians and Argives. The Argives intended to come without the knowledge of the Lacedaemonians, and by private enterprise rather than by public declaration. The expedition was openly proclaimed among the Arcadians, but they did not arrive either. For the Messenians were induced by the credit placed in the oracle to face the risk without allies.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This engagement did not differ in most points from the first, as on this occasion too daylight failed the combatants, but they record that on neither side was a wing or division broken, as they did not maintain the formation in which they were originally posted, champions on either side meeting in the middle, and there supporting the whole combat.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Euphaes, who showed more eagerness than a king should and recklessly attacked Theopompus' bodyguard, received a number of mortal wounds.  When he swooned and fell, the Lacedaemonians did their utmost to drag him into their own ranks, as he still breathed.  But the Messenians were roused by the affection which they felt for their king and by the reproach which would be theirs.  It seemed better to die for their kings and sacrifice their lives than that he should be abandoned while one of them escaped.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the fall of Euphaes prolonged the battle and called forth further deeds of daring on both sides.  He came to himself later and saw that his men had not had the worst of the fight, but he died in a few days, having reigned thirteen years over the Messenians, and having been at war with the Lacedaemonians for the whole of his reign.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Euphaes, having no children, left his kingdom to the man chosen by the people.  Cleonnis and Damis came forward to dispute it with Aristodemus, as they were considered superior to him in war and all else. Antander had been killed by the enemy, risking his life for Euphaes in the battle. The views of both the seers, Epebolus and Ophioneus, were identical, that they should not give the honors of Aepytus and his descendants to a man who was accursed and polluted by the murder of his daughter. Nevertheless Aristodemus was chosen and became king.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Ophioneus, the Messenian seer, was blind from birth and practised the following method of divination. By learning the facts relevant to each case, both private and public, he thus foretold the future. This then was the way he practised his art. Aristodemus, becoming king, constantly was ready to show all reasonable favour to the people, and held all the nobles in honor, especially Cleonnis and Damis. He maintained good relations with the allies, sending gifts to the Arcadian leaders and to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They carried on the war during his reign by means of constant forays with small parties, and made incursions into one another's country at harvest time, the Messenians being supported by the Arcadians in their raids into <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. The Argives did not think fit to declare their hatred for the Lacedaemonians beforehand, but prepared to take part in the contest when it came.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="11" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the fifth year of the reign of Aristodemus, being exhausted by the length of the war and by their expenditure, after due notice that a battle would be fought, both sides were joined by their allies, the Lacedaemonians by the Corinthians alone of the Peloponnesians, the Messenians by the full muster of' the Arcadians and by picked troops from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>. The Lacedaemonians entrusted their center to the Corinthians, Helots and all the neighboring peoples who were serving with them; they themselves and the kings were posted on the wings in a deeper and closer formation than ever before.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The dispositions of Aristodemus and his men were as follows: he selected the most serviceable of the arms for all the Arcadians and Messenians who were physically strong and stout hearted but did not possess powerful weapons, and as the matter was urgent, posted them with the Argives and Sicyonians, extending the line that they might not be surrounded by the enemy. He also took care that they should be drawn up with Mount <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> in their rear. Placing Cleonnis in command of these troops,</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>he himself and Damis remained in reserve with the light troops consisting of a few slingers or archers, the bulk of the force being physically suited to rapid assaults and retirements and lightly armed. Not all of them possessed a breastplate or shield, but those who lacked them were protected with the skins of goats and sheep, some of them, particularly the Arcadian mountaineers, having the hides of wild beasts, wolves and bears.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Each carried several javelins, and some of them spears. While these were in ambush in a part of Ithome where they were least likely to be visible, the heavy-armed troops of the Messenians and their allies withstood the first assault of the Lacedaemonians, and continued after this to show courage in every way. They were inferior in numbers to the enemy, but were picked men fighting against levies, not selected troops like themselves, and so, by their bravery and training were more able to maintain a lengthy resistance.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then the mobile Messenian force, when the signal was given to them, charged the Lacedaemonians and enveloping them threw javelins on their flanks. All who were of higher courage ran in and struck at close quarters. The Lacedaemonians, faced simultaneously with a second and unforeseen danger, were not demoralized, but turning on the light troops, tried to defend themselves. But, as the enemy with their light equipment drew off without difficulty, the Lacedaemonians were filled with perplexity and, as a consequence, with anger.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Men are apt to be most annoyed by what they regard as beneath them. So then the Spartans who had already been wounded and all who after the fall of their comrades were the first to meet the attack of the light troops, ran out to meet them when they saw the light troops advancing and hotly extended the pursuit as they retired. The Messenian light troops maintained their original tactics, striking and shooting at them when they stood still, and outstripping them in flight when they pursued, attacking again as they tried to retire.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They did this in separate parties and at different points of the enemy's line. The Messenian heavy-armed and their allies meantime pressed more boldly on the troops facing them. Finally the Lacedaemonians, worn out by the length of the battle and their wounds, and demoralized contrary to their custom by the light troops, broke their ranks. When they had been routed, the light troops inflicted greater damage on them.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was impossible to reckon the Lacedaemonian losses in the battle, but I for my part am convinced that they were heavy. The rest made their retreat homewards without molestation, but for the Corinthians it was likely to be difficult, for whether they tried to retire through the <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolid</placeName> or by <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, in either case it was through enemy country.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="12" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians were distressed by the reverse that had befallen them. Their losses in the battle were great and included important men, and they were inclined to despair of all hope in the war. For this reason they sent envoys to Delphi, who received the following reply from the Pythia:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Phoebus bids thee pursue not only the task of war with the hand, but by guile a people holds the Messenian land, and by the same arts as they first employed shall the people fall.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At this the kings and ephors were eager to invent stratagems, but failed. They imitated that deed of Odysseus at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and sent a hundred men to <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> to observe what the enemy were planning, but pretending to be deserters. A sentence of banishment had been openly pronounced on them. On their arrival Aristodemus at once sent them away, saying that the crimes of the Lacedaemonians were new, but their tricks old.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Failing in their attempt, the Lacedaemonians next attempted to break up the Messenian alliance. But when repulsed by the Arcadians, to whom their ambassadors came first, they put off going to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. Aristodemus, hearing of the Lacedaemonian intrigues, also sent men to enquire of the god. And the Pythia replied to them:</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">The god gives thee glory in war, but beware lest by guile the hated company of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> scale the well-built walls, for mightier is their god of war. And harsh shall be the dwellers in the circle of the dancing ground, when the two have started forth by one chance from the hidden ambush. Yet the holy day shall not behold this ending until their doom o'ertake those which have changed their nature.</l></quote>At the time Aristodemus and the seers were at a loss to interpret the saying, but in a few years the god was like to reveal it and bring it to fulfillment.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Other things befell the Messenians at that time: while Lyciscus was living abroad in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, death overtook the daughter whom he carried with him on his flight from <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. As he often visited her tomb, Arcadian horsemen lay in wait and captured him. When carried to <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> and brought into the assembly he urged that he had not departed a traitor to his country, but because he believed the words of the seer that the girl was not his own.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>His defence did not win credence until the woman who was then holding the priesthood of Hera came into the theater. She confessed that she was the mother of the girl and had given her to Lyciscus' wife to pass off as her own. “And now,” she said, “revealing the secret, I have come to lay down my office.” She said this because it was an established custom in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> that, if a child of a man or woman holding a priesthood died before its parent, the office should pass to another. Accepting the truth of her statement, they chose another woman to take her place as priestess of the goddess, and said that Lyciscus' deed was pardonable.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, as the twentieth year of the war was approaching, they resolved to send again to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to ask concerning victory. The Pythia made answer to their question:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">To those who first around the altar set up tripods ten times ten to Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, heaven grants glory in war and the Messenian land. For thus hath Zeus ordained. Deceit raised thee up and punishment follows after, nor would'st thou deceive the god. Act as fate wills, destruction comes on this man before that.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hearing this they thought that the oracle was in their favour and granted them victory; for as they themselves possessed the sanctuary of Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> within the walls, the Lacedaemonians could not forestall them in making the dedication. They set about making tripods of wood, as they had not money enough to make them of bronze. But one of the Delphians reported the oracle to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. When they heard it, no plan occurred to them in public,</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but Oebalus, a man of no repute in general, but evidently shrewd, made a hundred tripods, as best he might, of clay, and hiding them in a bag, carried nets with them like a hunter. As he was unknown even to most of the Lacedaemonians, he would more easily escape detection by the Messenians. Joining some countrymen, he entered <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> with them, and as soon as night fell, dedicated these tripods of clay to the god, and returned to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to tell the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians, when they saw them, were greatly disturbed, thinking, rightly enough, that they were from the Lacedaemonians. Nevertheless Aristodemus encouraged them, saying what the occasion demanded, and setting up the wooden tripods, which had already been made, round the altar of the god of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>. It happened also that Ophioneus, the seer who had been blind from birth, received his sight in the most remarkable way. He was seized with a violent pain in the head, and thereupon received his sight.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="13" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next, as fate was already inclining towards the conquest of the Messenians, the god revealed to them the future. For the armed statue of Artemis, which was all of bronze, let its shield fall. And as Aristodemus was about to sacrifice the victims to Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, the rams of their own accord leapt towards the altar, and dashing their horns violently against it were killed by the force of the blow. A third portent befell them. The dogs assembled together and howled every night, and at last fled together to the camp of the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Aristodemus was alarmed by this and by the following dream which came to him. He thought that he was about to go forth armed to battle and the victims' entrails were lying before him on a table, when his daughter appeared, wearing a black robe and showing her breast and belly cut open; when she appeared she flung down what was on the table, stripped him of his arms, and instead set a golden crown on his head and put a white robe about him.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Aristodemus, who was already in despair, thought the dream foretold the end of life for him, because the Messenians used to carry out their chiefs for burial wearing a crown and dressed in white garments. Then he received news that Ophioneus the seer could no longer see but had suddenly become blind, as he was at first. Then they understood the oracle, that by the two starting forth from the ambush and again meeting their doom the Pythia meant the eyes of Ophioneus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then Aristodemus, reckoning up his private sorrows, that to no purpose he had become the slayer of his daughter, and seeing that no hope of safety remained for his country, slew himself upon the tomb of his child. He had done all that human calculation could do to save the Messenians, but fortune brought to naught both his achievements and his plans. He had reigned six years and a few months when he died.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians were plunged into despair, and were even ready to send to the Lacedaemonians to ask mercy, so demoralized were they by the death of Aristodemus. Their pride, however, prevented them from doing this. But they met in the assembly and chose not a king, but Damis as general with absolute power. He selected Cleonnis and Phyleus as colleagues, and even with their present resources made ready to join battle. For he was forced to this by the blockade, and above all by famine and by the consequent terror that they would be destroyed by want.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Even then the Messenians were not inferior in courage and brave deeds, but all their generals were killed and their most notable men. After this they held out for some five months, but as the year was coming to an end deserted <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, the war having lasted twenty years in all, as is stated in the poems of Tyrtaeus:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">But in the twentieth year they left their rich tilled lands, and fled from out the lofty mountains of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>.</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus, unknown location.</bibl></p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians first razed <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> to the ground, then attacked and captured the remaining towns.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Dedicating these offerings at Amyclae, they gave to the people of Asine, who had been driven out by the Argives, that part of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> on the coast which they still occupy; to the descendants of Androcles (he had a daughter, who with her children had fled at his death and come to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>) they assigned the part called Hyamia.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians themselves were treated in this way: First they exacted an oath that they would never rebel or attempt any kind of revolution.

It was also ordained that for the funerals of the kings and other magistrates men should come from <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> with their wives in black garments, and a penalty was laid on those who disobeyed.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As to the wanton punishments which they inflicted on the Messenians, this is what is said in Tyrtaeus' poems:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Like asses worn by their great burdens, bringing of dire necessity to their masters the half of all the fruits the corn-land bears.</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus, unknown location.</bibl>That they were compelled to share their mourning, he shows by the following:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Wailing for their masters, they and their wives alike, whensoever the baneful doom of death came upon any.</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus, unknown location.</bibl></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In these straits the Messenians, foreseeing no kindness from the Lacedaemonians, and thinking death in battle or a complete migration from <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> preferable to their present lot, resolved at all costs to revolt. They were incited to this mainly by the younger men, who were still without experience of war but were of high spirit and preferred death in a free country, even though slavery might bring happiness in all else.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the young men who had grown up in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> the best and most numerous were round <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName>, and among them was Aristomenes, who to this day is worshipped as a hero among the Messenians. They think that even the circumstances of his birth were notable, for they assert that a spirit or a god united with his mother, Nicoteleia, in the form of a serpent. I know that the Macedonians tell a similar story about Olympias, and the Sicyonians about Aristodama, but there is this difference:</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians do not make Aristomenes the son of Heracles or of Zeus, as the Macedonians do with Alexander and Ammon, and the Sicyonians with Aratus and Asclepius. Most of the Greeks say that Pyrrhus was the father of Aristomenes, but I myself know that in their libations the Messenians call him Aristomenes son of Nicomedes. He then, being in the full vigor of youth and courage, with others of the nobles incited them to revolt. This was not done openly at first, but they sent secretly to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and to the Arcadians, to ask if they were ready to help unhesitatingly and no less energetically than in the former war.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When all their preparations were made for the war, the readiness of their allies exceeding expectation (for now the hatred which the Argives and Arcadians felt for the Lacedaemonians had blazed up openly), they revolted in the thirty-ninth year after the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, and in the fourth year of the twenty-third Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">B.C. 685</note> when Icarus of Hyreresia won the short footrace. At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the archonship was now of annual tenure, and Tlesias held office.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tyrtaeus has not recorded the names of the kings then reigning in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, but Rhianos stated in his epic that Leotychides was king at the time of this war. I cannot agree with him at all on this point. Though Tyrtaeus makes no statement, he may be regarded as having done so by the following; there are lines of his which refer to the first war:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Around it they fought unceasingly for nineteen years, ever maintaining a stout heart, the warrior fathers of our fathers.</l></quote><bibl>Tyrtaeus, unknown.</bibl></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is obvious then that the Messenians went to war now in the second generation after the first war, and the sequence of time shows that the kings of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> at that time were Anaxander the son of Eurycrates, son of Polydorus, and of the other house Anaxidamus the son of Zeuxidamus, son of Archidamus, son of Theopompus. I go as far as the third in descent from Theopompus, because Archidamus the son of Theopompus died before his father, and the kingdom of Theopompus passed to his grandson, Zeuxidamus. But Leotychides clearly succeeded Demaratus the son of Ariston, Ariston being sixth in descent from Theopompus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the first year after the revolt the Messenians engaged the Lacedaemonians at a place called Derae in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, both sides being without their allies. Neither side won a clear victory, but Aristomenes is said to have achieved more than it seemed that one man could, so that, as he was of the race of the Aepytidae, they were for making him king after the battle. As he declined, they appointed him general with absolute power.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was the view of Aristomenes that any man would be ready to die in battle if he had first done deeds worthy of record, but that it was his own especial task at the very beginning of the war to prove that he had struck terror into the Lacedaemonians and that he would be more terrible to them for the future. With this purpose he came by night to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and fixed on the temple of Athena of the Brazen House a shield inscribed “The Gift of Aristomenes to the Goddess, taken from Spartans.”</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Spartans received an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> that they should procure the Athenian as counsellor. So they sent messengers to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to announce the oracle, asking for a man to advise what they must do. The Athenians, who were not anxious either that the Lacedaemonians should add to their possessions the best part of <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> without great dangers, or that they themselves should disobey the god, made their plans accordingly. There was a man Tyrtaeus, a teacher of letters, who was considered of poor intellect and was lame in one foot. Him they sent to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. On his arrival he recited his poems in elegiacs and anapaests to the nobles in private and to all whom he could collect.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A year after the fight at Derae, both sides being joined by their allies, they prepared to join battle at the Boar's Tomb, as it is called. The Messenians had the Eleians and Arcadians and also succors from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and from <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>. They were joined by all the Messenians who had previously been in voluntary exile, together with those from <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, whose hereditary task it was to perform the rites of the Great Goddesses, and the descendants of Androcles. These indeed were their most zealous supporters.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Corinthians came to fight on the side of the Lacedaemonians, and some of the Lepreans owing to their hatred of the Eleians. But the people of <placeName key="perseus,Asine">Asine</placeName> were bound by oaths to both sides. This spot, the Boar's Tomb, lies in <placeName key="perseus,Stenyclerus">Stenyclerus</placeName> of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, and there, as is said, Heracles exchanged oaths with the sons of Neleus over the pieces of a boar.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="16" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Sacrifice was offered by the seers on both sides before the battle; on the Lacedaemonian side by Hecas, descendant and namesake of the Hecas who had come with the sons of Aristodemus to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, on the Messenian side by Theoclus, who was descended from Eumantis, an Eleian of the house of the Iamidae, whom Cresphontes had brought to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. Then in the presence of the seers both sides were spurred by greater ardor for the fight.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All showed the zeal that befitted their age and strength, but Anaxander, the Lacedaemonian king, and his Spartan guard above all. On the Messenian side the descendants of Androcles, Phintas and Androcles, and their company tried to acquit themselves like brave men. Tyrtaeus and the chief priests of the Great Goddesses took no part in the action, but urged on the hindmost on their own sides.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As to Aristomenes himself he had with him eighty picked men of the Messenians of the same age as himself, each one of them thinking it the highest honor that he had been thought worthy of a place in the troop with Aristomenes. They were quick to understand each other's movements, especially those of their leader, when he began or contemplated any manoeuvre. They themselves with Aristomenes were at first hard pressed in face of Anaxander and the Lacedaemonian champions, but receiving wounds unflinchingly and slowing every form of desperate courage they repulsed Anaxander and his men by their long endurance and valor.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As they fled, Aristomenes ordered another Messenian troop to undertake the pursuit. He himself attacked the enemies' line where it was firmest, and after breaking it at this point sought a new point of assault. Soon successful here, he was the more ready to assail those who stood their ground, until he threw into confusion the whole line of the Lacedaemonians themselves and of their allies. They were now running without shame and without waiting for one another, while he assailed them with a terror that seemed more than one man's fury could inspire.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There was a wild pear-tree growing in the plain, beyond which Theoclus the seer forbade him to pass, for he said that the Dioscuri were seated on the tree. Aristomenes, in the heat of passion, did not hear all that the seer said, and when he reached the tree, lost his shield, and his disobedience gave to the Lacedaemonians an opportunity for some to escape from the rout. For he lost time trying to recover his shield.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians were thrown into despair after this blow and purposed to put an end to the war. But Tyrtaeus by reciting his poems contrived to dissuade them, and filled their ranks from the Helots to replace the slain. When Aristomenes returned to <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName>, the women threw ribbons and flower blossoms over him, singing also a song which is sung to this day:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">To the middle of <placeName key="perseus,Stenyclerus">Stenyclerus</placeName>' plain and to the hilltop Aristomenes followed after the Lacedaemonians.</l></quote><bibl>Unknown.</bibl></p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He recovered his shield also, going to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and descending into the holy shrine of Trophonius at <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName>, as the Pythia bade. Afterwards he took the shield to <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> and dedicated it, and I myself have seen it there among the offerings. The device on it is an eagle with both wings outspread to the rim. Now on his return from <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> having learnt of the shield at the shrine of Trophonius and recovered it, he at once engaged in greater deeds.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Collecting a force of Messenians, together with his own picked troop, he waited for night and went to a city of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> whose ancient name in Homer's <title>Catalogue</title> is Pharis,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.582">Hom. Il. 2.582</bibl></note> but is called Pharae by the Spartans and neighboring people. Arriving here he killed those who offered resistance and surrounding the cattle started to drive them off to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. On the way he was attacked by Lacedaemonian troops under king Anaxander, but put them to flight and began to pursue Anaxander; but he stopped the pursuit when wounded in the buttocks with a javelin; he did not, however, lose the booty which he was driving away.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After waiting only for the wound to heal, he was making an attack by night on <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> itself, but was deterred by the appearance of Helen and of the Dioscuri. But he lay in wait by day for the maidens who were performing the dances in honor of Artemis at Caryae, and capturing those who were wealthiest and of noblest birth, carried them off to a village in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, entrusting them to men of his troop to guard, while he rested for the night.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There the young men, intoxicated, I suppose, and without any self-control, attempted to violate the girls. When Aristomenes attempted to deter them from an action contrary to Greek usage, they paid no attention, so that he was compelled to kill the most disorderly. He released the captives for a large ransom, maidens, as when he captured them.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="17" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is a place <placeName key="perseus,Aegila">Aegila</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, where is a sanctuary sacred to Demeter. Aristomenes and his men knowing that the women were keeping festival there . . . the women were inspired by the goddess to defend themselves, and most of the Messenians were wounded with the knives with which the women sacrificed the victims and the spits on which they pierced and roasted the meat. Aristomenes was struck with the torches and taken alive. Nevertheless he escaped to <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> during the same night. Archidameia, the priestess of Demeter, was charged with having released him, not for a bribe but because she had been in love with him before; but she maintained that Aristomenes had escaped by burning through his bonds.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the third year of the war, when an engagement was about to take place at what is called The Great Trench, and the Messenians had been joined by Arcadians from all the cities, the Lacedaemonians bribed Aristocrates the son of Hicetas of Trapezus, who was then king and general of the Arcadians. The Lacedaemonians were the first of whom we know to give bribes to an enemy, and the first to make victory in war a matter of purchase.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before the Lacedaemonians committed this crime in the Messenian war in the matter of the treachery of Aristocrates the Arcadian, the decision in battle was reached by valor and the fortune of heaven. Again it is clear that at a later date, when they were lying opposite the Athenian fleet at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians bought Adeimantus and other Athenian generals.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>However in course of time the punishment of Neoptolemus, as it is called, came upon the Lacedaemonians themselves in their turn. Now it was the fate of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, after killing Priam on the altar of Zeus Herkeios (Of the Courtyard), himself to be slain by the altar of Apollo in <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. Thenceforward to suffer what a man has himself done to another is called the Punishment of Neoptolemus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So in the case of the Lacedaemonians, when they were at the height of their power after the destruction of the Athenian fleet, and Agesilaus had already reduced the greater part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, they were unable to capture the whole empire of the Persians but the barbarian overreached them with their own invention, sending money to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> as the result of this bribery the so-called Corinthian war broke out, compelling Agesilaus to abandon his conquests in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus it was the purpose of heaven to turn the trick employed by the Lacedaemonians against the Messenians to their own destruction. After receiving the money from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, Aristocrates concealed his plot from the Arcadians for the present, but when they were about to come into action, he alarmed them by saying that they were caught in a difficult place and there would be no means of retreat for them, if defeated, also that the offerings had not been satisfactory. He ordered everyone therefore to take to flight when he gave the signal.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Lacedaemonians were about to close and the Messenians were occupied on their own front, then Aristocrates withdrew the Arcadians as the battle began, leaving the Messenian left and center without troops. For the Arcadians occupied both positions in the absence of the Eleians from the battle and of the Argives and Sicyonians. To complete his work Aristocrates caused his men to fly through the Messenians.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They were amazed at the unexpected state of affairs, and moreover were thrown into confusion by the passage of the Arcadians through their ranks, so that they almost forgot what lay before them; for instead of the advance of the Lacedaemonians they watched the Arcadian retirement, some begging them to stand by them, others cursing them for traitors and scoundrels.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was not difficult for the Lacedaemonians to surround the Messenians thus isolated, and they won without trouble the easiest of victories. Aristomenes and his men held together and tried to check the fiercest of the Lacedaemonian assaults but, being few in number, were unable to render much assistance. So great were the numbers of the people of the Messenians slain that in lieu of their former thoughts of becoming the masters instead of the slaves of the Lacedaemonians they now despaired of safety itself. Among the chieftains killed were Androcles and Phintas, and Phanas after the most glorious resistance. He had previously been victorious in the long foot race at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Aristomenes collected the Messenian survivors after the battle and persuaded them to desert <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName> and most of the other towns that lay in the interior and to settle on Mount Eira. When they had been driven to this spot, the Lacedaemonians sat down to besiege them, thinking that they would soon reduce them. Nevertheless the Messenians maintained their resistance for eleven years after the disaster at the Trench.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The length of the siege is proved by these lines of the poet Rhianus, regarding the Lacedaemonians:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">In the folds of the white mountain were they encamped, for two and twenty winters and green herbs.</l></quote><bibl>Rhianus, unknown location.</bibl>He reckons winters and summers, by “green herbs” meaning the green corn or the time just before harvest.</p></div>

<div n="18" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Settling on Eira and cut off from the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, except in so far as the people of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and Mothone maintained the coastal districts for them, the Messenians plundered both <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> and their own territory, regarding it now as enemy country. The men taking part in the raids were drawn from all sources, and Aristomenes raised the number of his chosen troop to three hundred.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They harried and plundered whatever Lacedaemonian property they could; when corn, cattle and wine were captured, they were consumed, but movable property and men were sold. The Lacedaemonians, as their labours were more profitable to the men at Eira than to themselves, accordingly resolved that <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> and the neighboring part of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> should be left uncultivated during the war.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As a result scarcity arose in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and with it revolution. For those who had property here could not endure its lying idle. Their differences were being composed by Tyrtaeus, when Aristomenes and his troop, starting in the late evening and by rapid movement reaching Amyclae before sunrise, captured and plundered the town, retiring before a force from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> could come to its relief.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He continued to overrun the country afterwards, until in an engagement with more than half the Lacedaemonian infantry and both the kings he received various wounds while defending himself and was struck on the head by a stone, so that his eyes became dizzy. When he fell a number of the Lacedaemonians closed upon him and took him alive with some fifty of his followers. The Lacedaemonians resolved to fling them all into the Ceadas, into which they throw men punished for the greatest crimes.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The rest of the Messenians were killed at once as they fell, but Aristomenes now as on other occasions was preserved by one of the gods. His panegyrists say that, when Aristomenes was thrown into the Ceadas, an eagle flew below him and supported him with its wings, bringing him to the bottom without any damage to his body and without wound. Even from here, as it seems, it was the will of heaven to show him a means of escape.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For when he came to the bottom of the chasm he lay down, and covering himself with his cloak awaited the death that fate had surely decreed. But after two days he heard a noise and uncovered, and being by this time able to see through the gloom, saw a fox devouring the dead bodies. Realizing that the beast must have some entrance, he waited for the fox to come near him, and then seized it. Whenever it turned on him he used one hand to hold out his cloak for it to bite. For the most part he kept pace with it as it ran, but over the more difficult ground he was dragged along by it. At last he saw a hole big enough for a fox to get through and daylight showing through it.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The fox, when released by Aristomenes, made of presumably, to its earth. But Aristomenes enlarged the hole, which was not large enough to let him through, with his hands and reached his home at Eira in safety, having undergone a remarkable chance in the matter of his capture, for his courage and prowess were so high that no one would have expected Aristomenes to be made a prisoner. Still more remarkable, and a convincing example of divine assistance, was his escape from the Ceadas.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="19" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians at once received information from deserters that Aristomenes had returned in safety. Though they thought it as incredible as the news that anyone had risen from the dead, their belief was ensured by the following action on the part of Aristomenes himself. The Corinthians were sending a force to assist the Lacedaemonians in the reduction of Eira.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Learning from his scouts that their march discipline was lax and that their encampments were made without precaution, Aristomenes attacked them by night. He slew most of them while the rest were still sleeping, and killed the leaders Hypermenides, Achladaeus, Lysistratus and Sidectus. And having plundered the generals' tent, he made it clear to the Spartans that it was Aristomenes and no other Messenian who had done this.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He also made the sacrifice called the Offering for the hundred slain to Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>. This was an old-established custom, all Messenians making it who had slain their hundred enemies. Aristomenes first offered it after the battle at the Boar's Tomb, his second offering was occasioned by the slaughter of the Corinthians in the night. It is said that he made a third offering as the result of his later raids.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the Lacedaemonians, as the festival of Hyacinthus was approaching, made a truce of forty days with the men of Eira. They themselves returned home to keep the feast, but some Cretan archers, whom they had summoned as mercenaries from <placeName key="perseus,Lyctus">Lyctus</placeName> and other cities, were patrolling <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> for them. Aristomenes then, in view of the truce, was at a distance from Eira and was advancing somewhat carelessly, when seven of these archers laid an ambush for him. They captured him and bound him with the thongs which they had on their quivers, as evening was coming on.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So two of them went to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, bringing the glad news that Aristomenes had been captured. The rest went to one of the farms in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, where there dwelt a fatherless girl with her mother. On the previous night the girl had seen a dream. Wolves brought a lion to their farm bound and without talons; but she herself loosed the lion from his bonds and found and gave to him his talons, and thus it seemed that the wolves were torn in pieces by the lion.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And now when the Cretans brought in Aristomenes, the girl realized that the dream of the night had come true, and asked her mother who he was. On learning she was encouraged, and looking intently at him understood what she had been bidden to do. Accordingly she plied the Cretans with wine, and when they were overcome with drunkenness she stole away the dagger of the man who was sleeping most heavily. Then the girl cut the bonds of Aristomenes, and he took the sword and despatched the men. This maiden was taken to wife by <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> the son of Aristomenes. Aristomenes gave him to the girl as a recompense for saving his life, for <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> had not yet completed his eighteenth year when he wedded her.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="20" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But in the eleventh year of the siege it was fated that Eira should be taken and the Messenians dispersed, and the god fulfilled for them an oracle given to Aristomenes and Theoclus. They had come to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> after the disaster at the Trench and asked concerning safety, receiving this reply from the Pythia:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Whensoever a he-goat drinks of Neda's winding stream, no more do I protect <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, for destruction is at hand.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The springs of the Neda are in Mount Lycaeus. The river flows through the land of the Arcadians and turning again towards <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> forms the boundary on the coast between <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>. Then they were afraid of the he-goats drinking from the Neda, but it appeared that what the god foretold to them was this. Some of the Greeks call the wild fig-tree <term>olynthe</term>, but the Messenians themselves <term>tragos</term> (he-goat). Now at that time a wild fig-tree growing on the bank of the Neda had not grown straight up, but was bending towards the stream and touching the water with the tips of its leaves.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the seer Theoclus saw it, he guessed that the goat who drinks of the Neda foretold by the Pythia was this wild fig-tree, and that their fate had already come upon the Messenians. He kept it secret from the rest, but led Aristomenes to the fig-tree and showed him that their time of safety had gone by. Aristomenes believed that it was so and that there was no delaying their fate, and made provision such as circumstances demanded.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For the Messenians possessed a secret thing. If it were destroyed, <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messene</placeName> would be overwhelmed and lost for ever, but if it were kept, the oracles of Lycus the son of Pandion said that after lapse of time the Messenians would recover their country. Aristomenes, knowing the oracles, took it towards nightfall, and coming to the most deserted part of <placeName key="tgn,7010924">Ithome</placeName>, buried it on the mountain, calling on Zeus who keeps <placeName key="tgn,7010924">Ithome</placeName> and the gods who had hitherto protected the Messenians to remain guardians of the pledge, and not to put their only hope of return into the power of the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, as formerly for the Trojans, the beginning of the Messenian misfortunes was in adultery. The Messenians commanded the mountain of Eira and its slopes as far as the Neda, some of them having their dwellings outside the gates. The only deserter that came to them from <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> was a herdsman, slave of Emperamus, bringing his master's cattle. Emperamus was a man of repute in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This herdsman, who kept his cattle not far from the Neda, saw the wife of one of the Messenians, who had their dwellings outside the wall, as she came to draw water. Falling in love with her, he dared to speak with her and seduced her with gifts. Thenceforward he marked the time when her husband went away to mount guard, garrison duty on the acropolis being undertaken by the Messenians in turn. For it was at this point that they were most afraid of the enemy making their way into the town. Whenever he went away, then the herdsman used to visit the lady.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now once when it happened that the turn for duty fell to him and others in the night, it chanced that there was heavy rain, and the Messenians deserted their post. For they were overcome by the density of the rain that streamed from heaven, as there were no battlements or towers erected on the wall owing to the hurried nature of its building; moreover they did not expect the Lacedaemonians even to stir on a moonless night that was so stormy.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A few days earlier a merchant from Cephallenia, who was a friend of Aristomenes and was bringing to Eira all that they needed, had been captured by the Lacedaemonians and archers from <placeName key="perseus,Aptera">Aptera</placeName>, commanded by Euryalus the Spartan; Aristomenes rescued him and recovered all the goods that he was bringing, but had himself been wounded and was unable to visit rounds, as was his custom. This was the main reason that the acropolis was deserted.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All of them left their posts and with them the husband of the woman seduced by the herdsman. She was entertaining the herdsman at the time but heard her husband coming and at once hid the man away as quickly as possible. When the husband entered, she treated him with greater affection than ever before and asked him what was the reason of his return. But knowing that she was unfaithful or that the herdsman was in the house, he told her the truth, that owing to the violence of the rain he and all the rest had deserted their post.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The herdsman listened to him speaking, and learning the exact position, again deserted from the Messenians to the Lacedaemonians. The Kings were absent at the time from the Lacedaemonian camp, but Emperamus, his master, who was commandant, was conducting the siege of Eira. Coming to him he first begged forgiveness for his crime of deserting and then showed him that now was the time for them to take Eira, recounting everything that he had learnt from the Messenian.</p></div>

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>His story seemed to be reliable, and he led the way for Emperamus and the Spartans. Their march was difficult, as it was dark and the rain never ceased. Nevertheless they accomplished it in their eagerness, and arriving before the acropolis of Eira, mounted by raising ladders and in any other way that was possible. Various indications of the trouble that was upon them were given to the Messenians, especially by the dogs barking, not in their usual fashion, but uttering more loud and continuous howls. realizing that the supreme and most desperate crisis had come upon them, they did not wait to collect all their arms but snatched whatever lay ready to the hand of each, to defend the fatherland that alone was left to them of all <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first to realize that the enemy were within and to go against them were <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> the son of Aristomenes, Aristomenes himself, Theoclus the seer and Manticlus his son, and with them Euergetidas a man of high repute in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> who had attained to greater honor through his wife for he was wedded to Hagnagora, the sister of Aristomenes. Then the rest, though understanding that they were caught as in a net, nevertheless derived some hope even from their present plight.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Aristomenes and the seer knew that there was no putting off destruction for the Messenians, for they knew the riddle of the oracle which the Pythia had uttered concerning the goat. Nevertheless they would not declare it, and kept it secret from the rest. As they hastened through the city, visiting all, they exhorted those whom they encountered, when they saw that they were Messenians, to be brave men, and summoned from the houses those who still remained.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>During the night nothing worthy of mention was done on either side; for their ignorance of the ground and the daring of Aristomenes gave pause to the Lacedaemonians, while the Messenians had not previously received a watchword from their generals, and the rain would put out torches or any other light that they kindled.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When it was day and they could see one another Aristomenes and Theoclus tried to rouse the fury of despair in the Messenians, setting forth all that suited the occasion and reminding them of the valor of the men of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, how, though an Ionian people, by their valor and courage they had driven out Cyges the son of Dascylus and the Lydians, when they were in occupation of their town.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians, when they heard, were filled with desperate courage, and mustering as they happened to be gathered rushed on the Lacedaemonians. Women too were eager to fling tiles and what they could upon the enemy, yet the violence of the rain prevented them from doing this and from mounting to the house-tops. But they dared to take arms, and they too further inflamed the ardor of the men, when they saw their women preferring to perish with their fatherland rather than be taken as slaves to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, so that they might yet have been able to escape their fate.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the god caused the rain to descend more densely, with loud claps of thunder, and dazzled their eyes with lightning flashing in their faces. All this put courage in the Lacedaemonians, who said that heaven itself was-helping them and as the lightning was on their right, Hecas the seer declared the sign of good omen.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was he who devised the following plan. The Lacedaemonians far outnumbered the Messenians, but as the battle was not being fought on open ground with troops in line, but they were fighting over different quarters of the town, the rearmost of each detachment were rendered useless. Hecas ordered these to retire to the camp, take food and sleep, and return before evening to relieve their own men who were to remain on duty.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians, by resting and fighting by turns, held out the longer, but the Messenians were faced with difficulties on all sides. They fought continuously day and night until the third day with none to relieve them. When the next day dawned, worn out by lack of sleep and by the rain and cold from heaven, they were assailed by hunger and thirst. The women especially, unaccustomed to war, were exhausted by the continuous suffering.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the seer Theoclus came to Aristomenes' side and said: “Why vainly maintain this toil? The decree of fate stands fast that <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> should fall; long since the Pythia declared to us the disaster now before our eyes, and lately the fig-tree revealed it. On me the gods have laid one doom with my country, but do thou save the Messenians with what power thou hast and save thyself.” When he had spoken to Aristomenes he rushed upon the enemy, and these were the words that he was constrained to fling at the Lacedaemonians. “Yet not for all time shall you enjoy the fruits of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> with impunity.”</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then falling upon the men who faced him he killed them and himself was wounded, and having sated his passion with the slaughter of his foes, he breathed his last. But Aristomenes called the Messenians back from the fight, except those who by virtue of their courage were fighting to cover them. These he allowed to remain at their post. The rest he ordered to receive the women and children within their ranks and follow him wherever he should show a passage.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He appointed <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> and Manticlus to command the rear, he himself ran to the head of the company and by the gestures of his head and movement of his spear signified that he asked a passage and had resolved to depart. Emperamus and the Spartans present were pleased to let the Messenians pass, without further inflaming men who had reached the bounds of frenzy and despair. Moreover Hecas the seer ordered them to act thus.</p></div>

<div n="22" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As soon as the Arcadians heard of the Capture of Eira, they at once ordered Aristocrates to lead them to the rescue of the Messenians or to death with them. But he, being in receipt of bribes from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, refused to lead them, and said that he knew that no Messenian survived for them to help.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When they obtained more certain news, that they survived and had been forced to desert Eira, they themselves proposed to receive them at Mount Lycaeus after preparing clothing and food, and sent some of their leading men to comfort the Messenians and also to be their guides on the way. After their safe arrival at Mount Lycaeus, the Arcadians entertained them and treated them kindly in every way, offering to distribute them among their towns and to make a new distribution of their land on their account.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Aristomenes' grief for the sack of Eira and his hatred of the Lacedaemonians suggested to him the following plan. He chose from the body of the Messenians five hundred men whom he knew to be the most unsparing of themselves, and asked them in the hearing of Aristocrates and the rest of the Arcadians if they were ready to die with him, avenging their country He did not know that Aristocrates was a traitor, for he thought that he had fled from the battle formerly from lack of courage and through cowardice, not for any knavery; so he asked the five hundred in his presence.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When they said that they were ready, he revealed the whole plan, that he proposed at all costs to lead them against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> during the following evening. For now was the time when the majority of the Lacedaemonians was away at Eira, and others were scouring <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> for booty and plunder. “If we can capture and occupy <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>,” said Aristomenes, “we can give back to the Lacedaemonians what is theirs and receive our own. If we fail, we shall die together, having done a deed for posterity to remember.”</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he said this, as many as three hundred of the Arcadians were ready to share his enterprise. For the time they delayed their departure, as the victims were unfavorable, but on the following day they learnt that the Lacedaemonians had been forewarned of their secret, and that they themselves had been a second time betrayed by Aristocrates. For Aristocrates had at once written the designs of Aristomenes in a letter, and having entrusted it to the slave whom he knew to be most loyal, sent him to Anaxander in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As the slave was returning, he was intercepted by some of the Arcadians, who had formerly been at variance with Aristocrates and regarded him then with some suspicion. Having intercepted the slave they brought him before the Arcadians and made known to the people the answer from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>. Anaxander was writing that his retreat from the Great Trench formerly had not gone unrewarded on the part of the Lacedaemonians and that he would receive an additional recompense for his information on the present occasion.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When this was declared to all, the Arcadians themselves stoned Aristocrates and urged the Messenians to join them. They looked to Aristomenes. But he was weeping, with his eyes fixed on the ground. So the Arcadians stoned Aristocrates to death and flung him beyond their borders without burial, and set up a tablet in the precinct of Zeus Lycaeus with the words:<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Truly time hath declared justice upon an unjust king and with the help of Zeus hath easily declared the betrayer of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>.

Thence they sent to the Messenians in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, proposing to unite their forces and seek a new country to dwell in, enjoining Aristomenes to lead them to a colony.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But he said that while he lived, he would make war on the Lacedaemonians, as he knew well that trouble would always be brewing for <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> through him, but he gave them <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> and Manticlus as leaders. Euergetidas too had retired to Mount Lycaeus with the rest of the Messenians.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they occupied <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> it was not enough for them to have received a city and country at the hands of the Athenians, but they were filled with a strong desire to show that they had won something notable with their own hands. Knowing that the Acarnanians of Oeniadae possessed a good land and were continually at war with the Athenians, they marched against them. They had no numerical advantage, but defeating them by their superior courage, they shut them up in the fortress and besieged them.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They neglected no human invention in the matter of siege-craft, tried to carry the town by raising scaling-ladders, mined the walls, and by bringing up such engines as could be made ready at short notice proceeded with the destruction of the fortifications. The inhabitants, fearing that if the city were taken they would be put to death and their wives and children enslaved, elected to withdraw on terms.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians held the town and occupied the country for about a year. In the following year the Acarnanians collected a force from all their towns and discussed an attack on <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>. They rejected this, as they saw that their line of march would be through the Aetolians, who were always their enemies; moreover they suspected that the men of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> possessed a fleet, which was the fact; and while they commanded the sea, it was impossible to achieve anything of importance with a land force.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they changed their plans and at once turned on the Messenians in Oeniadae and prepared to besiege them, for they never supposed that men so few in number would show such desperate courage as to fight against the full levy of the Acarnanians. The Messenians had previously prepared food and all else that was requisite, expecting to stand a long siege.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But they were determined before the siege was formed to fight a battle in the open, and being Messenians, who had not been surpassed in valor even by Lacedaemonians, but in fortune only, were determined not to be dismayed at the horde which had come from <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>. They recalled the achievement of the Athenians at Marathon, how thirty myriad Persians had been destroyed by men not numbering ten thousand.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they joined battle with the Acarnanians, and the course of the battle is said to have been thus. The enemy, being far superior in numbers, had no difficulty in surrounding the Messenians, except where prevented by the gates in the Messenian rear and by the zealous help of their men posted on the wall. Here they could not be surrounded, hut the Acarnanians enveloped both their flanks and shot volleys at them from all sides.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians, in close formation, whenever they charged the Acarnanians in a body, threw the enemy at that point into confusion, killing and wounding many of them, but they could not effect a complete rout. For wherever the Acarnanians saw a part of their own line being broken by the Messenians they went to the support of their harassed troops at this point and checked the Messenians, overwhelming them by numbers.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians, beaten back and again attempting to pierce the massed troops of the Acarnanians at another point, would meet with the same result. Wherever they attacked, they threw the enemy into confusion and drove them a short distance, but as the Acarnanians again streamed eagerly to this point, they were driven back against their will. The battle was evenly contested until evening, but when at nightfall the Acarnanians received reinforcements from their cities, the blockade of the Messenians was formed.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They had no fear of the wall being taken by assault, either by the Acarnanians scaling it or by themselves being forced to abandon their posts. But in the eighth month all their provisions alike had been consumed.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They shouted to the Acarnanians from the wall in mockery that their supplies would not fail them until the tenth year of the siege, but they themselves sallied out of Oeniadae at the time of the first sleep.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A year before the victory of the Thebans at Leuctra, heaven foretold their return to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> to the Messenians. It is said that in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> on the Straits the priest of Heracles saw a vision in a dream: it seemed that Heracles Manticlus was bidden by Zeus as a guest to <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>. Also among the Euesperitae Comon dreamt that he lay with his dead mother, but that afterwards she came to life again. He hoped that as the Athenians had recovered their seapower, they would be restored to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>. But the dream really indicated the recovery of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not long afterwards the Lacedaemonians suffered at Leuctra the disaster that had long been due. For at the end of the oracle given to Aristodemus, who reigned over the Messenians, are the words:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Act as fate wills, destruction comes on this man before that,</l></quote>signifying that he and the Messenians must suffer evil at the present, but that hereafter destruction would overtake <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then after their victory at Leuctra the Thebans sent messengers to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and to the Euesperitae, and summoned the Messenians to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> from every other quarter where they might be, and they, with longing for their country and through the hatred which had ever remained with them for the Lacedaemonians, assembled quicker than could have been expected.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>To Epaminondas it seemed in no way easy to found a city that could resist the Lacedaemonians, nor could he discover where in the land to build it. For the Messenians refused to settle again in <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Oechalia">Oechalia</placeName>, because their disasters had befallen them when they dwelt there. To Epaminondas in his difficulty it is said that an ancient man, closely resembling a priest of Demeter, appeared in the night and said: “My gift to thee is that thou shalt conquer whomsoever thou dost assail; and when thou dost pass from men, Theban, I will cause thy name to be unforgotten and give thee glory. But do thou restore to the Messenians their fatherland and cities, for now the wrath of the Dioscuri against them hath ceased.”</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This he said to Epaminondas, and revealed this to Epiteles the son of Aeschines, who had been chosen by the Argives to be their general and to refound <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. He was bidden by the dream, wherever he found yew and myrtle growing on <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, to dig between them and recover the old woman, for, shut in her brazen chamber, she was overcome and well-nigh fainting. When day dawned, Epiteles went to the appointed place, and as he dug, came upon a brazen urn.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He took it at once to Epaminondas, told him the dream and bade him remove the lid and see what was within. Epaminondas, after sacrifice and prayer to the vision that had appeared, opened the urn and having opened it found some tin foil, very thin, rolled like a book. On it were inscribed the mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and this was the pledge deposited by Aristomenes. They say that the man who appeared to Epiteles and Epaminondas in their sleep was Caucon, who came from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> the daughter of Triopas at <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians were keeping a feast of the Dioscuri in camp and had turned to drinking and sports after the midday meal, when Gonippus and <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> appeared to them, riding on the finest horses and dressed in white tunics and scarlet cloaks, with caps on their heads and spears in their hands.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When once they had come among them, the youths rode right through them, striking with their spears, and when many had been killed, returned to <placeName key="perseus,Andania">Andania</placeName>, having outraged the sacrifice to the Dioscuri. It was this, in my view, that roused the Dioscuri to their hatred of the Messenians. But now, as the dream declared to Epaminondas, the Dioscuri no longer opposed the return of the Messenians.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Epaminondas was most strongly drawn to the foundation by the oracles of Bacis, who was inspired by the Nymphs and left prophecies regarding others of the Greeks as well as the return of the Messenians:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Then indeed shall the bright bloom of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> perish and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> again shall be inhabited for all time.</l></quote>I have discovered that Bacis also told in what manner Eira would be captured, and this too is one of his oracles:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">The men of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> o'ercome by the thunder's roll and spouting rain.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the mysteries were recovered, all who were of the priestly family set them down in books. As Epaminondas considered the spot where the city of the Messenians now stands most convenient for the foundation, he ordered enquiry to be made by the seers if the favour of the gods would follow him here. When they announced that the offerings were auspicious, he began preparations for the foundation, ordering stone to be brought, and summoning men skilled in laying out streets and in building houses, temples, and ring-walls.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When all was in readiness, victims being provided by the Arcadians, Epaminondas himself and the Thebans then sacrificed to Dionysus and Apollo Ismenius in the accustomed manner, the Argives to Argive Hera and Nemean Zeus, the Messenians to Zeus of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> and the Dioscuri, and their priests to the Great Goddesses and Caucon. And together they summoned heroes to return and dwell with them, first <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> the daughter of Triopas, after her Eurytus, Aphareus and his children, and of the sons of Heracles Cresphontes and Aepytus. But the loudest summons from all alike was to Aristomenes.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For that day they were engaged in sacrifice and prayer, but on the following days they raised the circuit of the walls, and within built houses and the temples. They worked to the sound of music, but only from Boeotian and <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> flutes, and the tunes of Sacadas and Pronomus were brought into keen competition. The city itself was given the name <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, but they founded other towns. The men of <placeName key="tgn,7011013">Nauplia</placeName> were not disturbed at Mothone,</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and they allowed the people of <placeName key="perseus,Asine">Asine</placeName> to remain in their home, remembering their kindness when they refused to join the Lacedaemonians in the war against them.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians returned to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> and recovered their own land two hundred and eighty-seven years after the capture of Eira, in the archonship of Dyscinetus at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and in the third year of the hundred and second Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">B.C. 370</note> when <placeName key="tgn,2274807">Damon</placeName> of <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName> was victorious for the second time.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Minyae, driven by the Thebans from <placeName key="perseus,Orchomenos">Orchomenos</placeName> after the battle of Leuctra, were restored to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> by Philip the son of Amyntas, as were also the Plataeans. When Alexander had destroyed the city of the Thebans themselves, Cassander the son of Antipater rebuilt it after a few years. The exile of the Plataeans seems to have lasted the longest of those mentioned, but even this was not for more than two generations.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the wanderings of the Messenians outside the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> lasted almost three hundred years, during which it is clear that they did not depart in any way from their local customs, and did not lose their Doric dialect, but even to our day they have retained the purest Doric in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="28" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After their return they had nothing to fear at first from the Lacedaemonians. For the Lacedaemonians, restrained by fear of the Thebans, submitted to the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and to the gathering of the Arcadians into one city. But when the Phocian or, as it is called, the Sacred War caused the Thebans to withdraw from <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians regained courage and could no longer refrain from attacking the Messenians.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Messenians maintained the war with the help of the Argives and Arcadians, and asked the Athenians for help. They refused to join in an attack on <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, but promised to render assistance in person if the Lacedaemonians began war and invaded <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>. Finally the Messenians formed an alliance with Philip the son of Amyntas and the Macedonians; it was this, they say, that prevented them from taking part in the battle which the Greeks fought at Chaeroneia. They refused, however, to bear arms against the Greeks.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the death of Alexander, when the Greeks had raised a second war against the Macedonians, the Messenians took part, as I have shown earlier in my account of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 1.25.4">Paus. 1.25.4</bibl></note> They did not join the Greeks against the Gauls, as Cleonymus and the Lacedaemonians refused to grant them a truce.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not long afterwards the Messenians occupied <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, employing strategy and daring alike. The Eleians in the earliest times were the most law-abiding of the Peloponnesians, but when Philip the son of Amyntas did all the harm to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> that has been related, he also bribed the leading men in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; the Eleians were divided by factions for the first time and came to blows, it is said.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Henceforward it was likely to be more easy for quarrels to arise among men whose counsels were divided on account of the Lacedaemonians, and they arrived at civil war. Learning this, the Lacedaemonians were preparing to assist their partisans in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. While they were being organized in squadrons and distributed in companies, a thousand picked Messenian troops arrived hurriedly at <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> with Laconian blazons on their shields.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Seeing their shields, all the Laconising party in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> thought their supporters had arrived and received them into the fortress.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The trick is Homer's, but the Messenians plainly imitated it opportunely, for Homer represents Patroclus in the <title>Iliad</title><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom.

Il. 16.281</bibl></note> clad in the arms of Achilles, and says that the barbarians were filled with the belief that it was Achilles attacking them, and that their front ranks were thrown into confusion.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Philip was in need of money, and as it was necessary to raise it at all costs, he sent Demetrius with a fleet to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. He put in to one of the less frequented harbors of the <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolid</placeName>, and at once marched his army by the shortest route to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. With an advance guard consisting of all the light-armed troops who knew the road to <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, he succeeded just before dawn in scaling the wall unnoticed at a point where it lay between the city and the peak of <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When day dawned and the inhabitants had realized the danger that beset them, they were at first under the impression that the Lacedaemonians had forced an entry into the town, and attacked them more recklessly owing to their ancient hatred. But when they discovered from their equipment and speech that it was the Macedonians and Demetrius the son of Philip, they were filled with great fear, when they considered the Macedonian training in warfare and the good fortune which they saw that they enjoyed in all their ventures.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Nevertheless the magnitude of the present evil caused them to display a courage beyond their strength, also they were inspired with hope for the best, since it seemed not without divine help that they had accomplished their return to <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> after so long an absence. So the Messenians in the town went against the Macedonians full of courage, and the garrison on the acropolis attacked from the high ground above.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In like manner the Macedonians, brave and experienced troops, at first offered a firm resistance. But worn out by their march, attacked by the men and bombarded with tiles and stones by the women, they took to flight in disorder. The majority were pushed over the precipices and killed, for <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> is very steep at this point. A few escaped by throwing away their arms.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians refrained at first from joining the Achaean league for the following reason, I think. When Pyrrhus the son of Aeacides made war on the Lacedaemonians, they came unasked to their assistance, and as a result of this service a more peaceful disposition towards them came to be established at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. Therefore they were unwilling to revive the feud by joining the league, which was openly declared the bitterest enemy of the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I realize, as of course did the Messenians, that even without their joining the league the policy of the Achaeans was hostile to the Lacedaemonians. For the Argives and the Arcadian group formed not the smallest element in the league. However, in the course of time they joined the league. And not long afterwards Cleomenes the son of Leonidas, son of Cleonymus, captured the Arcadian Megalopolis in peace-time.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.9.2">Paus. 2.9.2</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the people of Megalopolis who were caught in the city, some were killed at the time of its capture, but Philopoemen the son of Craugis and all who withdrew with him (the number of the citizens who escaped is said to have been more than two-thirds) were received by the Messenians, who for the sake of the former services rendered by the Arcadians in the time of Aristomenes and again at the founding of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> now repaid the like.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such, it would seem, are the vicissitudes of human affairs, that it was the will of heaven that the Messenians should in their turn preserve the Arcadians, and what is still more surprising, that they should capture <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.

<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>the Spartan tyrant retired on terms.

<div n="30" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is in our time a city <placeName key="perseus,Abia">Abia</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> on the coast, some twenty stades distant from the Choerius valley.

There was a notable temple of Heracles here, and also of Asclepius.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Pharae is seventy stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Abia">Abia</placeName>. On the road is a salt spring. The Emperor Augustus caused the Messenians of Pharae to be incorporated in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. The founder Pharis is said to have been the son of Hermes and Phylodameia the daughter of Danaus. He had no male children, but a daughter Telegone. Homer, tracing her descendants in the <title>Iliad</title>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.541">Hom.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I heard also at Pharae that besides the twins a daughter Anticleia was born to Diocles, and that her children were Nicomachus and Gorgasus, by Machaon the son of Asclepius. They remained at Pharae and succeeded to the kingdom on the death of Diocles. The power of healing diseases and curing the maimed has remained with them to this day, and in return for this, sacrifices and votive offerings are brought to their sanctuary. The people of Pharae possess also a temple of Fortune (Tyche) and an ancient image.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Homer is the first whom I know to have mentioned Fortune in his poems. He did so in the <title>Hymn to Demeter</title>, where he enumerates the daughters of Ocean, telling how they played with Kore the daughter of Demeter, and making Fortune one of them.

It received its name from the daughter of Leucippus and is fed from a source called Clepsydra. There are sanctuaries of the gods Poseidon and Aphrodite, and, what is most deserving of mention, a statue of the Mother of the Gods, of Parian marble, the work of Damophon,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The date of Damophon of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> has now been fixed in the first half of the second century B.C.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But all cities worship Artemis of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, and individuals hold her in honor above all the gods. The reason, in my view, is the renown of the Amazons, who traditionally dedicated the image, also the extreme antiquity of this sanctuary. Three other points as well have contributed to her renown, the size of the temple, surpassing all buildings among men, the eminence of the city of the Ephesians and the renown of the goddess who dwells there.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians have a temple erected to Eileithyia with a stone statue, and near by a hall of the Curetes, where they make burnt offerings of every kind of living creature, thrusting into the flames not only cattle and goats, but finally birds as well. There is a holy shrine of Demeter at <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and statues of the Dioscuri, carrying the daughters of Leucippus. I have already explained in an earlier passage<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 3.26.3">Paus. 3.26.3</bibl></note> that the Messenians argue that the sons of Tyndareus belong to them rather than to the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most numerous statues and the most worth seeing are to be found in the sanctuary of Asclepius.

The stone statues are the work of Damophon (I know of no other Messenian sculptor of merit apart from him); the statue of Epaminondas is of iron and the work of some other artist.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a temple of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> the daughter of Triopas with a statue of gold and Parian marble.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I learnt by enquiry that Aethidas was a man older than myself, who gained influence through his wealth and is honored by the Messenians as a hero. There are certain Messenians, who, while admitting that Aethidas was a man of great wealth, maintain that it is not he who is represented on the relief but an ancestor and namesake. The elder Aethidas was their leader, when Demetrius the son of Philip and his force surprised them in the night and succeeded in penetrating into the town unnoticed.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also the tomb of Aristomenes here. They say that it is not a cenotaph, but when I asked whence and in what manner they recovered the bones of Aristomenes, they said that they sent to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> for them, and that it was the god of Delphi who ordered it. They also instructed me in the nature of the rites carried out at the tomb. The bull which is to be offered to the dead man is brought to the tomb and bound to the pillar which stands upon the grave. Being fierce and unused to bonds he will not stand; and if the pillar is moved by his struggles and bounds, it is a good omen to the Messenians, but if the pillar is not moved the sign portends misfortune.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They have it that Aristomenes was present at the battle of Leuctra, though no longer among men, and say that he helped the Thebans and was the chief cause of the Lacedaemonian disaster. I know that the Chaldaeans and Indian sages were the first to say that the soul of man is immortal, and have been followed by some of the Greeks, particularly by Plato the son of Ariston. If all are willing to accept this, this too cannot be denied, that his hatred for the Lacedaemonians was imparted to Aristomenes for all time.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>What I myself heard in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> gives probability to the Messenian account, although it does not coincide in all respects. The Thebans say that when the battle of Leuctra was imminent, they sent to other oracles and to enquire of the god of <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName>. The replies of the Ismenian and Ptoan Apollo are recorded, also the responses given at Abae and at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. Trophonius, they say, answered in hexameters:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Or ever ye join battle with the foe, set up a trophy and deck it with my shield, which impetuous Aristomenes the Messenian placed in my temple. And I will destroy the host of foemen bearing shield.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the oracle was brought, they say that Epaminondas urged Xenocrates, who sent for the shield of Aristomenes and used it to adorn a trophy in a spot where it could be seen by the Lacedaemonians. Those of them who had seen the shield at <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> in peace-time knew it, and all knew it by repute. After their victory the Thebans restored the offering to Trophonius. There is also a bronze statue of Aristomenes in the Messenian running-ground. Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of Sarapis and Isis.</p></div>

It is a hopeless task, however zealously undertaken, to enumerate all the peoples who claim that Zeus was born and brought up among them. The Messenians have their share in the story for they too say that the god was brought up among them and that his nurses were <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> and Neda, the river having received its name from the latter, while the former, <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName>, gave her name to the mountain.

He was the son of Philammon and the nymph Argiope, who once dwelt on <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, but settled among the Odrysae when pregnant, for Philammon refused to take her into his house.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before the mustering of the army for the Trojan war, and during the war, Mothone was called Pedasus. Later, as the people themselves say, it received a new name from the daughter of Oeneus. They say that Mothone was born of a concubine to Oeneus the son of Porthaon, when he had taken refuge with Diomede in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> after the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. But in my view it was the rock Mothon that gave the place its name. It is this which forms their harbor. For projecting under water, it makes the entrance for ships more narrow and also serves as a breakwater against a heavy swell.</p></div>

The Nauplians in my view were Egyptians originally, who came by sea with Danaus to the <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolid</placeName>, and two generations later were settled in <placeName key="tgn,7011013">Nauplia</placeName> by Nauplius the son of Amymone.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Emperor Trajan granted civic freedom and autonomy to the people of Mothone. In earlier days they were the only people of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> on the coast to suffer a disaster like the following: Thesprotian <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> was ruined by anarchy. For Deidameia the daughter of Pyrrhus, being without children, handed over the government to the people when she was on the point of death. She was the daughter of Pyrrhus, son of Ptolemy, son of Alexander, son of Pyrrhus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have told the facts relating to Pyrrhus the son of Aeacides in my account of the Athenians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 1.1.11">Paus. 1.1.11-13</bibl></note> Procles the Carthaginian<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.21.6">Paus. 2.21.6</bibl></note> indeed rated Alexander the son of Philip higher on account of his good fortune and for the brilliance of his achievements, but said that Pyrrhus was the better man in infantry and cavalry tactics and in the invention of stratagems of war.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Epirots were rid of their kings, the people threw off all control and disdained to listen to their magistrates, and the Illyrians who live on the Ionian sea above Epirus reduced them by a raid. We have yet to hear of a democracy bringing prosperity to a nation other than the Athenians; the Athenians attained to greatness by its means, for they surpassed the Greek world in native wit, and least disregarded the established laws.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the Illyrians, having tasted empire and being always desirous of more, built ships, and plundering others whom they fell in with, put in to the coast of Mothone and anchored as in a friendly port. Sending a messenger to the city they asked for wine to be brought to their ships. A few men came with it and they bought the wine at the price which the inhabitants asked, and themselves sold a part of their cargo.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When on the following day a larger number arrived from the town, they allowed them also to make their profit. Finally women and men came down to the ships to sell wine and trade with the barbarians. Thereupon by a bold stroke the Illyrians carried off a number of men and still more of the women. Carrying them on board ship, they set sail for the Ionian sea, having desolated the city of the Mothonaeans.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In Mothone is a temple of Athena Of the Winds, with a statue dedicated, it is said, by Diomede, who gave the goddess her name. The country being damaged by violent and unseasonable blasts, Diomede prayed to the goddess, and henceforward no disaster caused by the winds has visited their country. There is also a shrine of Artemis here and water in a well mixed with pitch, in appearance very like the iris-oil of Cyzicos. Water can assume every color and scent.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The bluest that I know from personal experience is that at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, not all of it, but that which flows into the swimming-baths, called locally the Women's Pots. Red water, in color like blood, is found in the land of the Hebrews near the city of <placeName key="tgn,7001369">Joppa</placeName>. The water is close to the sea, and the account which the natives give of the spring is that Perseus, after destroying the sea-monster, to which the daughter of Cepheus was exposed, washed off the blood in the spring.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have myself seen water coming up black from springs at Astyra. Astyra opposite <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> is the name of the hot baths in the district called <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName>. It was this <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName>, which the Chians received as a reward from the Persians as a reward for surrendering the suppliant, Pactyas the Lydian.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hdt. 1.160">Hdt. 1.160</bibl></note> This water then has a black color; but the Romans have a white water, above the city across the river called Anio. When a man enters it, he is at first attacked with cold and shivering, but after a little time it warms him like the hottest drug.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All these springs that had something wonderful to show I have seen myself. For I pass over the less wonderful that I know, and it is no great marvel to find water that is salt and harsh. But there are two other kinds. The water in the White Plain, as it is called, in <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, by the village with the name Dascylou Come, is warm and sweeter than milk to drink.  I know that Herodotus says that a spring of bitter water flows into the river Hypanis. We can assuredly admit the truth of his statement, when in our days at Dicaearchia (<placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>), in the land of the Tyrrhenians, a hot spring has been found, so acid that in a few years it dissolved the lead through which its water passed.</p></div>

<div n="36" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is a journey of about a hundred stades from Mothone to the promontory of Coryphasium, on which <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> lies. This was founded by <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> the son of Cleson, bringing from the Megarid the Leleges who then occupied the country. But he did not enjoy it, as he was driven out by Neleus and the Pelasgians of <placeName key="tgn,7011081">Iolcos</placeName>, on which he departed to the adjoining country and there occupied the <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. When Neleus became king, he raised <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to such renown that Homer in his epics calls it the city of Neleus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.632">Hom. Il. 11.632</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Od. 3.4">Hom. Od. 3.4</bibl></note></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It contains a sanctuary of Athena with the title Coryphasia, and a house called the house of Nestor, in which there is a painting of him. His tomb is inside the city; the tomb at a little distance from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> is said to be the tomb of Thrasymedes. There is a cave inside the town, in which it is said that the cattle belonging to Nestor and to Neleus before him were kept.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These cattle must have been of Thessalian stock, having once belonged to Iphiclus the father of Protesilaus. Neleus demanded these cattle as bride gifts for his daughter from her suitors, and it was on their account that Melampus went to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> to gratify his brother Bias. He was put in bonds by the herdsmen of Iphiclus, but received them as his reward for the prophecies which he gave to Iphiclus at his request. So it seems the men of those days made it their business to amass wealth of this kind, herds of horses and cattle, if it is the case that Nestor desired to get possession of the cattle of Iphiclus and that Eurystheus, in view of the reputation of the Iberian cattle, ordered Heracles to drive off the herd of Geryones.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> too, who was reigning then in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, plainly had so violent a desire for the cattle from Erytheia that he wrestled with Heracles, staking his kingdom on the match against these cattle. As Homer says in the <title>Iliad</title>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.244">Hom. Il. 11.244</bibl></note> a hundred kine were the first of the bride gifts paid by Iphidamas the son of Antenor to his bride's father. This confirms my argument that the men of those days took the greatest pleasure in cattle.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the cattle of Neleus were pastured for the most part across the border, I think. For the country of the Pylians in general is sandy and unable to provide so much grazing. Homer testifies to this, when he mentions Nestor, always adding that he was king of sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The island of <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName> lies in front of the harbor just as <placeName key="tgn,5004151">Rheneia</placeName> off the anchorage at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. It seems that places hitherto unknown have been raised to fame by the fortunes of men. For Caphereus in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> is famous since the storm that here befell the Greeks with Agamemnon on their voyage from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Psyttaleia by <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> we know from the destruction of the Persians there. In like manner the Lacedaemonian reverse made <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName> known to all mankind. The Athenians dedicated a bronze statue of Victory also on the acropolis as a memorial of the events at <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Cyparissiae is reached from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, there is a spring below the city near the sea, the water of which they say gushed forth for Dionysus when he struck he ground with a thyrsus. For this reason they call the spring Dionysias. There is a shrine of Apollo in Cyparissiae and of Athena with the title Cyparissia. In the depression called <placeName key="tgn,7010744">Aulon</placeName> there is a temple and statue of Asclepius Aulonius.

Of the races dwelling in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> the Arcadians and Achaeans are aborigines. When the Achaeans were driven from their land by the Dorians, they did not retire from <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, but they cast out the Ionians and occupied the land called of old Aegialus, but now called <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName> from these Achaeans.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Eleans we know crossed over from Calydon and <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> generally. Their earlier history I found to be as follows. The first to rule in this land, they say, was Aethlius, who was the son of Zeus and of Protogeneia, the daughter of Deucalion, and the father of Endymion.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Moon, they say, fell in love with this Endymion and bore him fifty daughters. Others with greater probability say that Endymion took a wife Asterodia—others say she was Cromia, the daughter of Itonus, the son of Amphictyon; others again, Hyperippe, the daughter of Arcas—but all agree that Endymion begat Paeon, Epeius, Aetolus, and also a daughter Eurycyda. Endymion set his sons to run a race at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> for the throne; Epeius won, and obtained the kingdom, and his subjects were then named Epeans for the first time.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of his brothers they say that Aetolus remained at home, while Paeon, vexed at his defeat, went into the farthest exile possible, and that the region beyond the river <placeName key="tgn,7015932">Axius</placeName> was named after him Paeonia. As to the death of Endymion, the people of Heracleia near <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName> do not agree with the Eleans for while the Eleans show a tomb of Endymion, the folk of Heracleia say that he retired to Mount Latmus and give him honor, there being a shrine of Endymion on Latmus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Epeius married Anaxiroe, the daughter of Coronus, and begat a daughter Hyrmina, but no male issue. In the reign of Epeius the following events also occurred. Oenomaus was the son of Alxion (though poets proclaimed his father to be Ares, and the common report agrees with them), but while lord of the land of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> he was put down by Pelops the Lydian, who crossed over from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the death of Oenomaus, Pelops took possession of the land of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> and its bordering country <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, separating it from the land of Epeius. The Eleans said that Pelops was the first to found a temple of' Hermes in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and to sacrifice to the god, his purpose being to avert the wrath of the god for the death of Myrtilus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Aetolus, who came to the throne after Epeius, was made to flee from <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, because the children of Apis tried and convicted him of unintentional homicide. For Apis, the son of Jason, from Pallantium in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, was run over and killed by the chariot of Aetolus at the games held in honor of Azan. Aetolus, son of Endymion, gave to the dwellers around the Achelous their name, when he fled to this part of the mainland. But the kingdom of the Epeans fell to Eleius, the son of Eurycyda, daughter of Endymion and, believe the tale who will, of Poseidon. It was Eleius who gave the inhabitants their present name of Eleans in place of Epeans.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Eleius had a son Augeas. Those who exaggerate his glory give a turn to the name Eleius and make Helius<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the Sun.</note> to be the father of Augeas. This Augeas had so many cattle and flocks of goats that actually most of his land remained untilled because of the dung of the animals. Now he persuaded Heracles to cleanse for him the land from dung, either in return for a part of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> or possibly for some other reward.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Heracles accomplished this feat too, turning aside the stream of the Menius into the dung. But, because Heracles had accomplished his task by cunning, without toil, Augeas refused to give him his reward, and banished Phyleus, the elder of his two sons, for objecting that he was wronging a man who had been his benefactor. He made preparations himself to resist Heracles, should he attack <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; more particularly he made friends with the sons of Actor and with Amarynceus. Amarynceus, besides being a good soldier,</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>had a father, Pyttius, of Thessalian descent, who came from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. To Amarynceus, therefore, Augeas also gave a share in the government of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; Actor and his sons had a share in the kingdom and were natives of the country. For the father of Actor was Phorbas, son of Lapithus, and his mother was Hyrmina, daughter of Epeius. Actor named after her the city of Hyrmina, which he founded in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="2" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Heracles accomplished no brilliant feat in the war with Augeas. For the sons of Actor were in the prime of courageous manhood, and always put to flight the allies under Heracles, until the Corinthians proclaimed the Isthmian truce, and the sons of Actor came as envoys to the meeting. Heracles set an ambush for then, at Cleonae and murdered them. As the murderer was unknown, Moline, more than any of the other children, devoted herself to detecting him.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When she discovered him, the Eleans demanded satisfaction for the crime from the Argives, for at the time Heracles had his home at <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName>. When the Argives refused them satisfaction, the Eleans as an alternative pressed the Corinthians entirely to exclude the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> people from the Isthmian games. When they failed in this also, Moline is said to have laid curses on her countrymen, should they refuse to boycott the Isthmian festival. The curses of Moline are respected right down to the present day, and no athlete of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> is wont to compete in the Isthmian games.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are two other accounts, differing from the one that I have given. According to one of them Cypselus, the tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, dedicated to Zeus a golden image at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>. As Cypselus died before inscribing his own name on the offering, the Corinthians asked of the Eleans leave to inscribe the name of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> on it, but were refused. Wroth with the Eleans, they proclaimed that they must keep away from the Isthmian games. But how could the Corinthians themselves take part in the Olympic games if the Eleans against their will were shut out by the Corinthians from the Isthmian games?</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The other account is this. Prolaus, a distinguished Elean, had two sons, Philanthus and Lampus, by his wife Lysippe. These two came to the Isthmian games<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">If the proposed emendation be adopted the meaning will be: “one to compete in the boys' pancratium, the other in wrestling.”</note> to compete in the boys' pancratium, and one of them intended to wrestle. Before they entered the ring they were strangled or done to death in some other way by their fellow competitors. Hence the curses of Lysippe on the Eleans, should they not voluntarily keep away from the Isthmian games. But this story too proves on examination to be silly.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For Timon, a man of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, won victories in the pentathlum at the Greek games, and at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> there is even a statue of him, with an elegiac inscription giving the crowns he won and also the reason why he secured no Isthmian victory. The inscription sets forth the reason thus:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">But from going to the land of Sisyphus he was hindered by a quarrel</l><l>About the baleful death of the Molionids.</l></quote></p></div>

The Eleans were aided by the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> and of Pylus in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. The men of Pylus were punished by Heracles, but his expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> was stopped by an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to this effect<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">My father cares for <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>, but to me in the hollows of <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Hermann's emendation would mean: “but unto me be assigned <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>.”</note></l></quote>This oracle proved the salvation of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>. To Phyleus Heracles gave up the land of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> and all the rest, more out of respect for Phyleus than because he wanted to do so: he allowed him to keep the prisoners, and Augeas to escape punishment.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The women of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, it is said, seeing that their land had been deprived of its vigorous manhood, prayed to Athena that they might conceive at their first union with their husbands.

Both wives and husbands were so delighted at their union that they named the place itself, where they first met, Bady (sweet), and the river that runs thereby Bady Water, this being a word of their native dialect.</p></div>

For the sons of Actor married twin sisters, the daughters of Dexamenus who was king at <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName>; Amphimachus was born to one son and Theronice, Thalpius to her sister Theraephone and Eurytus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>However, neither Amarynceus himself nor his son Diores remained common people.

Polyxenus came back safe from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and begat a son, Amphimachus.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Amphimachus begat Eleius, and it was while Eleius was king in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> that the assembly of the Dorian army under the sons of Aristomachus took place, with a view to returning to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. To their kings was delivered this oracle, that they were to choose the “one with three eyes” to lead them on their return.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Cresphontes inferred that this was the man indicated by the oracle, and so the Dorians made him one of themselves. He urged them to descend upon the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> in ships, and not to attempt to go across the Isthmus with a land army. Such was his advice, and at the same time he led them on the voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> to Molycrium.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The following story is also told of Oxylus. He suspected that, when the sons of Aristomachus saw that the land of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> was a goodly one, and cultivated throughout, they would be no longer willing to give it to him. He accordingly led the Dorians through <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and not through <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. Oxylus was anxious to get the kingdom of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> without a battle, but Dius would not give way; he proposed that, instead of their fighting a pitched battle with all their forces, a single soldier should be chosen from each army to fight as its champion.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This proposal chanced to find favour with both sides, and the champions chosen were the Elean Degmenus, an archer, and Pyraechmes, a slinger, to represent the Aetolians. Pyraechmes won and Oxylus got the kingdom. He allowed the old inhabitants, the Epeans, to keep their possessions, except that he introduced among them Aetolian colonists, giving them a share in the land. He assigned privileges to Dius, and kept up after the ancient manner the honors paid to heroes, especially the worship of Augeas, to whom even at the present day hero-sacrifice is offered.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He is also said to have induced to come into the city the dwellers in the villages near the wall, and by increasing the number of the inhabitants to have made <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> larger and generally more prosperous. There also came to him an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, that he should bring in as co-founder “the descendant of Pelops.” Oxylus made diligent search, and in his search he discovered Agorius, son of Damasius, son of Penthilus, son of Orestes. He brought Agorius himself from Helice in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and with him a small body of Achaeans.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The wife of Oxylus they say was called <placeName key="tgn,7002729">Pieria</placeName>, but beyond this nothing more about her is recorded. Oxylus is said to have had two sons, Aetolus and Laias. Aetolus died before his parents, who buried him in a tomb which they caused to be made right in the gate leading to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and the sanctuary of Zeus. That they buried him thus was due to an oracle forbidding the corpse to be laid either without the city or within it. Right down to our own day the gymnasiarch sacrifices to Aetolus as to a hero every year.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Oxylus the kingdom devolved on Laias, son of Oxylus. His descendants, however, I find did not reign, and so I pass them by, though I know who they were; my narrative must not descend to men of common rank. Later on Iphitus, of the line of Oxylus and contemporary with Lycurgus, who drew up the code of laws for the Lacedaemonians, arranged the games at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and reestablished afresh the Olympic festival and truce, after an interruption of uncertain length. The reason for this interruption I will set forth when my narrative deals with <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 5.8">Paus. 5.8</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At this time <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was grievously worn by internal strife and plague, and it occurred to Iphitus to ask the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> for deliverance from these evils. The story goes that the Pythian priestess ordained that Iphitus himself and the Eleans must renew the Olympic games. Iphitus also induced the Eleans to sacrifice to Heracles as to a god, whom hitherto they had looked upon as their enemy. The inscription at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> calls Iphitus the son of Haemon, but most of the Greeks say that his father was Praxonides and not Haemon, while the ancient records of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> traced him to a father of the same name.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Eleans played their part in the Trojan war, and also in the battles of the Persian invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. I pass over their struggles with the Pisans and Arcadians for the management of the Olympian games. Against their will they joined the Lacedaemonians in their invasion of Athenian territory, and shortly afterwards they rose up with the Mantineans and Argives against the Lacedaemonians, inducing <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> too to join the alliance.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0420">420 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Agis invaded the land, and Xenias turned traitor, the Eleans won a battle near <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, routed the Lacedaemonians and drove them out of the sacred enclosure; but shortly afterwards the war was concluded by the treaty I have already spoken of in my account of the Lacedaemonians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0401" to="-0399">401-399 B.C.</date></note><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 3.8">Paus. 3.8</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Philip the son of Amyntas would not let <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> alone, the Eleans, weakened by civil strife, joined the Macedonian alliance, but they could not bring themselves to fight against the Greeks at Chaeroneia. They joined Philip's attack on the Lacedaemonians because of their old hatred of that people, but on the death of Alexander they fought on the side of the Greeks against Antipater and the Macedonians.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Later on Aristotimus, the son of Damaretus, the son of Etymon, became despot of <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>, being aided in his attempt by Antigonus, the son of Demetrius, who was king in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. After a despotism of six months Aristotimus was deposed, a rising against him having been organized by Chilon, Hellanicus, Lampis and Cylon; Cylon it was who with his own hand killed the despot when he had sought sanctuary at the altar of Zeus the Saviour.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the wars of the Eleans, of which my present enumeration must serve as a summary.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The land of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> contains two marvels. Here, and here only in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, does fine flax grow; and secondly, only over the border, and not within it, can the mares be impregnated by asses. The cause of this is said to have been a curse. The fine flax of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> is as fine as that of the Hebrews, but it is not so yellow.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> there is a district stretching down to the sea. It is called Samicum, and above it on the right is what is called Triphylia, in which is the city Lepreus. The citizens of this city wish to belong to the Arcadians, but it is plain that from the beginning they have been subject to the Eleans. Such of them as have won Olympic victories have been announced by the herald as Eleans from Lepreus, and Aristophanes<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 149">Aristoph. Birds 149</bibl></note> in a comedy calls Lepreus a town of the Eleans. Leaving the river Anigrus on the left there is a road leading to Lepreus; from Samicum another leads to it from <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and a third from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. The longest of them is a day's journey.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The city got its name, they say, from its founder Lepreus the son of Pyrgeus. There was also a story that Lepreus contended with Heracles: that he was as good a trencherman. Each killed an ox at the same time and prepared it for the table. It turned out, even as Lepreus maintained, that he was as powerful a trencherman as Heracles. Afterwards he made bold to challenge him to a duel. Lepreus, they say, lost, was killed, and was buried in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Phigaleia">Phigaleia</placeName>. The Phigalians, however, could not show a tomb of Lepreus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have heard some who maintained that Lepreus was founded by Leprea, the daughter of Pyrgeus. Others say that the first dwellers in the land were afflicted with the disease leprosy,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Not our leprosy, but a whitish, rough, scaly, skin-disease, possibly our psoriasis. See <bibl n="Gal. 14.758">Galen 14.758</bibl>.</note> and that the city received its name from the misfortune of the inhabitants. The Lepreans told me that in their city once was a temple of Zeus Leucaeus (Of the White Poplar), the grave of Lycurgus, son of Aleus, and the grave of Caucon, over which was the figure of a man holding a lyre.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But as far as I could see they had no tomb of distinction, and no sanctuary of any deity save one of Demeter. Even this was built of unburnt brick, and contained no image. Not far from the city of the Lepreans is a spring called <placeName key="perseus,Arene">Arene</placeName>, and they say that it derives its name from the wife of Aphareus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Returning again to Samicum, and passing through the district, we reach the mouth of the Anigrus. The current of this river is often held back by violent gales, which carry the sand from the open sea against it and stop the onward flow of the water. So whenever the sand has become soaked on both sides, by the sea without and by the river within, beasts and still more travellers on foot are in danger of sinking into it.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Anigrus descends from the mountain Lapithus in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and right from its source its water does not smell sweet but actually stinks horribly. Before it receives the tributary Acidas it plainly cannot support fish-life at all. After the rivers unite, the fish that come down into the Anigrus with the water are uneatable, though before, if they are caught in the Acidas, they are eatable.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I heard from an Ephesian that the Acidas was called Iardanus in ancient times. I repeat his statement, though I have nowhere found evidence in support of it. I am convinced that the peculiar odor of the Anigrus is due to the earth through which the water springs up, just as those rivers beyond <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, the exhalation from which is deadly to man, owe their peculiarity to the same cause. Some Greeks say that Chiron,</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>others that Pylenor, another Centaur, when shot by Heracles fled wounded to this river and washed his hurt in it, and that it was the hydra's poison which gave the Anigrus its nasty smell. Others again attribute the quality of the river to Melampus the son of Amythaon, who threw into it the means he used to purify the daughters of Proetus.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is in Samicum a cave not far from the river, and called the Cave of the Anigrid Nymphs. Whoever enters it suffering from alphos or leuke<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">For these skin.diseases see <bibl n="Gal. 14.758">Galen 14.758</bibl>. Alphos was probably our vitiligo, and leuce our leucodermia.</note> first has to pray to the nymphs and to promise some sacrifice or other, after which he wipes the unhealthy parts of his body. Then, swimming through the river, he leaves his old uncleanness in its water, coming up sound and of one color.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Crossing the Anigrus and going to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> by the straight road, not far away on the right of the road you reach a high district with a city called Samia on it. This they say Polysperchon the Aetolian used as a fortified post against the Arcadians.</p></div>
    <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As to the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Arene">Arene</placeName>, no Messenian and no Elean could point them out to me with certainty. Those who care to do so may make all sorts of different guesses about it, but the most plausible account seemed to me that of those who held that in the heroic age and even earlier Samicum was called <placeName key="perseus,Arene">Arene</placeName>. These quoted too the words of the <title>Iliad</title>:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">There is a river Minyeius flowing into the sea</l><l>near <placeName key="perseus,Arene">Arene</placeName>.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These ruins are very near to the Anigrus; and, although it might be questioned whether Samicum was called <placeName key="perseus,Arene">Arene</placeName>, yet the Arcadians are agreed that of old the Anigrus was called the Minyeius. One might well hold that the Neda near the sea was made the boundary between <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> at the time of the return of the Heracleidae to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the Anigrus, if you travel for a considerable distance through a district that is generally sandy and grows wild pines, you will see behind you on the left the ruins of Scillus. It was one of the cities of Triphylia but in the war between <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> the citizens of Scillus openly helped <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> against her enemy, and for this reason the Eleans utterly destroyed it.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians afterwards separated Scillus from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> and gave it to Xenophon, the son of Grylus, when he had been exiled from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, The reason for his banishment was that he had taken part in an expedition which Cyrus, the greatest enemy of the Athenian people, had organized against their friend, the Persian king.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0401">401 B.C.</date></note> Cyrus, in fact, with his seat at <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>, had been providing Lysander, the son of Aristocritus, and the Lacedaemonians with money for their fleet. Xenophon, accordingly, was banished and having made Scillus his home he built in honor of Ephesian Artemis a temple with a sanctuary and a sacred enclosure.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Scillus is also a hunting-ground for wild boars and deer, and the land is crossed by a river called the <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>. The guides of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> said that the Eleans recovered Scillus again, and that Xenophon was tried by the Olympic Council for accepting the land from the Lacedaemonians, and, obtaining pardon from the Eleans, dwelt securely in Scillus. Moreover, at a little distance from the sanctuary was shown a tomb, and upon the grave is a statue of marble from the Pentelic quarry. The neighbors say that it is the tomb of Xenophon.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go from Scillus along the road to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, before you cross the Alpheius,there is a mountain with high, precipitous cliffs. It is called Mount Typaeum. It is a law of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> to cast down it any women who are caught present at the Olympic games, or even on the other side of the Alpheius, on the days prohibited to women. However, they say that no woman has been caught, except Callipateira only; some, however, give the lady the name of Pherenice and not Callipateira.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>She, being a widow, disguised herself exactly like a gymnastic trainer, and brought her son to compete at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.

So her sex was discovered, but they let her go unpunished out of respect for her father, her brothers and her son, all of whom had been victorious at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By the time you reach <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> the Alpheius is a large and very pleasant river to see, being fed by several tributaries, including seven very important ones.  The Helisson joins the Alpheius passing through <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>; the Brentheates comes out of the territory of that city; past <placeName key="tgn,7010812">Gortyna</placeName>, where is a sanctuary of Asclepius, flows the Gortynius; from Melaeneae, between the territories of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName>, comes the Buphagus; from the land of the Clitorians the <placeName key="tgn,1033742">Ladon</placeName>; from Mount Erymanthus a stream with the same name as the mountain. These come down into the Alpheius from <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>; the Cladeus comes from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> to join it.  The source of the Alpheius itself is in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and not in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another legend about the Alpheius.  They say that there was a hunter called Alpheius, who fell in love with Arethusa, who was herself a huntress. Arethusa, unwilling to marry, crossed, they say, to the island opposite <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> called Ortygia, and there turned from a woman to a spring.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This account of Alpheius<gap reason="lost"></gap>to Ortygia.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This sentence, obviously corrupt, seems to show a lacuna after<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀλφειόν.</foreign>The meaning probably would be to the effect that the story was an invention, to account for the disappearance of the Alpheius in the sea and its reappearance at Ortygia (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὴν Ὀρτυγίαν</foreign>).</note> But that the Alpheius passes through the sea and mingles his waters with the spring at this place I cannot disbelieve, as I know that the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> confirms the story.  For when he despatched Archias the Corinthian to found <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> he uttered this oracle:<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">An isle, Ortygia, lies on the misty ocean</l><l>Over against <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Trinacria</placeName>, where the mouth of Alpheius bubbles</l><l>Mingling with the springs of broad Arethusa.</l></quote>For this reason, therefore, because the water of the Alpheius mingles with the Arethusa, I am convinced that the legend arose of the river's love-affair.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those Greeks or Egyptians who have gone up into <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName> beyond <placeName key="tgn,7001112">Syene</placeName> as far as the Ethiopian city of <placeName key="tgn,7000856">Meroe</placeName> all say that the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> enters a lake, and passes through it as though it were dry land, and that after this it flows through lower Aethiopia into <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> before coming down into the sea at Pharos.  And in the land of the Hebrews, as I can myself bear witness, the river <placeName key="tgn,1000121">Jordan</placeName> passes through a lake called <placeName key="tgn,7017529">Tiberias</placeName>, and then, entering another lake called the <placeName key="tgn,7018638">Dead Sea</placeName>, it disappears in it.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Dead Sea has the opposite qualities to those of any other water.  Living creatures float in it naturally without swimming; dying creatures sink to the bottom.  Hence the lake is barren of fish; their danger stares them in the face, and they flee back to the water which is their native element.  The peculiarity of the Alpheius is shared by a river of <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>.  The source of it is on Mount Mycale, and having gone through the intervening sea the river rises again opposite <placeName key="tgn,7002494">Branchidae</placeName> at the harbor called <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These things then are as I have described them.  As for the Olympic games, the most learned antiquaries of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> say that Cronus was the first king of heaven, and that in his honor a temple was built in <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> by the men of that age, who were named the Golden Race.  When Zeus was born, Rhea entrusted the guardianship of her son to the Dactyls of Ida, who are the same as those called Curetes.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Heracles, being the eldest, matched his brothers, as a game, in a running-race, and crowned the winner with a branch of wild olive, of which they had such a copious supply that they slept on heaps of its leaves while still green.  It is said to have been introduced into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> by Heracles from the land of the Hyperboreans, men living beyond the home of the North Wind.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><placeName key="tgn,1115310">Olen</placeName> the Lycian, in his hymn to Achaeia, was the first to say that from these Hyperboreans Achaeia came to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>.

So he established the custom of holding them every fifth<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, in the Greek way of counting.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now some say that Zeus wrestled here with Cronus himself for the throne, while others say that he held the games in honor of his victory over Cronus.  The record of victors include Apollo, who outran Hermes and beat Ares at boxing.  It is for this reason, they say, that the Pythian flute-song is played while the competitors in the pentathlum are jumping; for the flute-song is sacred to Apollo, and Apollo won Olympic victories.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Later on there came (they say) from Crete Clymenus, the son of Cardys, about fifty years after the flood came upon the Greeks in the time of Deucalion.  He was descended from Heracles of Ida; he held the games at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and set up an altar in honor of Heracles, his ancestor, and the other Curetes, giving to Heracles the surname of Parastates (Assistant).  And Endymion, the son of Aethlius, deposed Clymenus, and set his sons a race in <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> with the kingdom as the prize.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And about a generation later than Endymion, Pelops held the games in honor of Olympian Zeus in a more splendid manner than any of his predecessors.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Augeas too held them, and likewise Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, after the conquest of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Moreover, Iolaus used to be charioteer to Heracles.  So Iolaus won the chariot-race, and Iasius, an Arcadian, the horse-race; while of the sons of Tyndareus one won the foot-race and Polydeuces the boxing-match.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the reign of Oxylus, who also celebrated the games, the Olympic festival was discontinued until the reign of Iphitus.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The contests for boys have no authority in old tradition, but were established by the Eleans themselves because they approved of them.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The race for men in armour was approved at the sixty-fifth Festival, to provide, I suppose, military training; the first winner of the race with shields was Damaretus of <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName>.

The pentathlum for boys was instituted at the thirty-eighth Festival; but after Eutelidas of Lace-daemon had received the wild olive for it, the Eleans disapproved of boys entering for this competition.  The races for mule-carts, and the trotting-race, were instituted respectively at the seventieth Festival and the seventy-first, but were both abolished by proclamation at the eighty-fourth.  When they were first instituted, Thersius of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> won the race for mule-carts, while Pataecus, an Achaean from <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>, won the trotting-race.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The trotting-race was for mares, and in the last part of the course the riders jumped off and ran beside the mares, holding on to the bridle, just as at the present day those do who are called “mounters.”  The mounters, however, differ from the riders in the trotting-race by having different badges, and by riding horses instead of mares.  The cart-race was neither of venerable antiquity nor yet a graceful performance.  Moreover, each cart was drawn by a pair of mules, not horses, and there is an ancient curse on the Eleans if this animal is even born in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The order of the games in our own day, which places the sacrifices to the god for the pentathlum and chariot-races second, and those for the other competitions first, was fixed at the seventy-seventh Festival.  Previously the contests for men and for horses were held on the same day.  But at the Festival I mentioned the pancratiasts prolonged their contests till night-fall, because they were not summoned to the arena soon enough.  The cause of the delay was partly the chariot-race, but still more the pentathlum.  Callias of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was champion of the pancratiasts on this occasion, but never afterwards was the pancratium to be interfered with by the pentathlum or the chariots.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The rules for the presidents of the games are not the same now as they were at the first institution of the festival.  Iphitus acted as sole president, as likewise did the descendants of Oxylus after Iphitus.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But at the ninety-fifth Festival nine umpires were appointed.  To three of them were entrusted the chariot-races, another three were to supervise the pentathlum, the rest superintended the remaining contests.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But they were hard pressed in a war with the Arcadians and lost a portion of their territory, along with all the parishes included in the surrendered district, and so the number of tribes was reduced to eight in the hundred and fourth Olympiad.

At the hundred and eighth Festival they returned again to the number of ten umpires, which has continued unchanged down to the present day.</p></div>

Myrtilus too, the charioteer of Oenomaus, sits in front of the horses, which are four in number.  After him are two men.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The god sits on a throne, and he is made of gold and ivory.  On his head lies a garland which is a copy of olive shoots.  In his right hand he carries a Victory, which, like the statue, is of ivory and gold; she wears a ribbon and—on her head—a garland.  In the left hand of the god is a scepter, ornamented with every kind of metal, and the bird sitting on the scepter is the eagle.  The sandals also of the god are of gold, as is likewise his robe.  On the robe are embroidered figures of animals and the flowers of the lily.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The throne is adorned with gold and with jewels, to say nothing of ebony and ivory.  Upon it are painted figures and wrought images.  There are four Victories, represented as dancing women, one at each foot of the throne, and two others at the base of each foot.  On each of the two front feet are set Theban children ravished by sphinxes, while under the sphinxes Apollo and Artemis are shooting down the children of Niobe.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Between the feet of the throne are four rods, each one stretching from foot to foot.  The rod straight opposite the entrance has on it seven images; how the eighth of them disappeared nobody knows.  These must be intended to be copies of obsolete contests, since in the time of Pheidias contests for boys had not yet been introduced.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This statement is certainly incorrect; Pausanias himself says that contests for the boys were introduced at the thirty-seventh Festival, i.e. in <date when="-0632">632 B.C.</date>  Several suggestions have been made for correcting the text.  One of the most attractive is that of C. Robert (see <title>Hermes</title> XXIII. 1888, p. 451), who would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνιστῶν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνισμάτων</foreign> and transpose <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γάρ</foreign> (for which he reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω . . . τῆς Φειδίου</foreign> to after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀγδοήκοντα.</foreign> This would mean: “So P. had not reached the age of boys at the time of Pheidias.”</note> The figure of one binding his own head with a ribbon is said to resemble in appearance Pantarces, a stripling of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> said to have been the love of Pheidias.  Pantarces too won the wrestling-bout for boys at the eighty-sixth Festival.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the other rods is the band that with Heracles fights against the Amazons. The number of figures in the two parties is twenty-nine, and Theseus too is ranged among the allies of Heracles.  The throne is supported not only by the feet, but also by an equal number of pillars standing between the feet.  It is impossible to go under the throne, in the way we enter the inner part of the throne at Amyclae.  At <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> there are screens constructed like walls which keep people out.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of these screens the part opposite the doors is only covered with dark-blue paint; the other parts show pictures by Panaenus.  Among them is Atlas, supporting heaven and earth, by whose side stands Heracles ready to receive the load of Atlas, along with Theseus;  Perithous, <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> carrying in her hand the ornament made for the top of a ship's bows; then Heracles' exploit against the Nemean lion, the outrage committed by Ajax on Cassandra,</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hippodameia the daughter of Oenomaus with her mother, and Prometheus still held by his chains, though Heracles has been raised up to him.  For among the stories told about Heracles is one that he killed the eagle which tormented Prometheus in the <placeName key="tgn,1108814">Caucasus</placeName>, and set free Prometheus himself from his chains.  Last in the picture come Penthesileia giving up the ghost and Achilles supporting her; two Hesperides are carrying the apples, the keeping of which, legend says, had been entrusted to them.  This Panaenus was a brother of Pheidias; he also painted the picture of the battle of Marathon in the painted portico at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the uppermost parts of the throne Pheidias has made, above the head of the image, three Graces on one side and three Seasons on the other.  These in epic poetry<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hes. Th. 901">Hes. Th. 901</bibl></note> are included among the daughters of Zeus.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the pedestal supporting the throne and Zeus with all his adornments are works in gold: the Sun mounted on a chariot, Zeus and Hera, Hephaestus, and by his side Grace.  Close to her comes Hermes, and close to Hermes Hestia.  After Hestia is Eros receiving Aphrodite as she rises from the sea, and Aphrodite is being crowned by Persuasion.  There are also reliefs of Apollo with Artemis, of Athena and of Heracles; and near the end of the pedestal Amphitrite and Poseidon, while the Moon is driving what I think is a horse.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I know that the height and breadth of the Olympic Zeus have been measured and recorded; but I shall not praise those who made the measurements, for even their records fall far short of the impression made by a sight of the image.  Nay, the god himself according to legend bore witness to the artistic skill of Pheidias.  For when the image was quite finished Pheidias prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was to his liking.  Immediately, runs the legend, a thunderbolt fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze jar stood to cover the place.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All the floor in front of the image is paved, not with white, but with black tiles.  In a circle round the black stone runs a raised rim of Parian marble, to keep in the olive oil that is poured out.  For olive oil is beneficial to the image at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, and it is olive oil that keeps the ivory from being harmed by the marshiness of the Altis.  On the Athenian Acropolis the ivory of the image they call the Maiden is benefited, not by olive oil, but by water.  For the Acropolis, owing to its great height, is over-dry, so that the image, being made of ivory, needs water or dampness.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When I asked at <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> why they pour neither water nor olive oil on the image of Asclepius, the attendants at the sanctuary informed me that both the image of the god and the throne were built over a cistern.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those who think that the projections from the mouth of an elephant are not horns but teeth of the animal should consider both the elk, a beast of the Celtic land, and also the Aethiopian bull.  Male elks have horns on their brows, but the female does not grow them at all.  Ethiopian bulls grow their horns on their noses.  Who therefore would be greatly surprised at horns growing out of an animal's mouth?</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They may also correct their error from the following considerations.  Horns drop off animals each year and grow again; the deer and the antelope undergo this experience, and so likewise does the elephant.  But a tooth will never be found to grow again, at least after the animal is full-grown.  So if the projections through the mouth were teeth and not horns, how could they grow up again?  Again, a tooth refuses to yield to fire; but fire turns the horns of oxen and elephants from round to flat, and also into other shapes.  However, the hippopotamus and the boar have tusks growing out of the lower jaw, but we do not see horns growing out of jaws.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So be assured that an elephant's horns descend through the temples from above, and so bend outwards.

The sanctuary is about thirty stades from <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, which is the capital of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>.  So the elephant differs from all other animals in the way its horns grow, just as its size and shape are peculiar to itself.  And the Greeks in my opinion showed an unsurpassed zeal and generosity in honoring the gods, in that they imported ivory from <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> and Aethiopia to make images.</p></div>

It is surrounded by a stone fence, within which trees grow and statues have been dedicated.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The entrance is on the west.  The sanctuary is said to have been set apart to Pelops by Heracles the son of Amphitryon.  Heracles too was a great-grandson of Pelops, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him into the pit.  Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacrifice to him, and the victim is a black ram.  No portion of this sacrifice goes to the sooth-sayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the “woodman,” as he is called.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The woodman is one of the servants of Zeus, and the task assigned to him is to supply cities and private individuals with wood for sacrifices at a fixed rate, wood of the white poplar, but of no other tree, being allowed.  If anybody, whether Elean or stranger, eat of the meat of the victim sacrificed to Pelops, he may not enter the temple of Zeus.  The same rule applies to those who sacrifice to Telephus at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> on the river <placeName key="tgn,1121615">Caicus</placeName>; these too may not go up to the temple of Asclepius before they have bathed.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following tale too is told.  When the war of the Greeks against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was prolonged, the soothsayers prophesied to them that they would not take the city until they had fetched the bow and arrows of Heracles and a bone of Pelops. So it is said that they sent for Philoctetes to the camp, and from <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> was brought to them a bone of Pelops—a shoulder-blade.  As they were returning home, the ship carrying the bone of Pelops was wrecked off <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> in the storm.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Many years later than the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, Damarmenus, a fisherman from <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>, cast a net into the sea and drew up the bone.  Marvelling at its size he kept it hidden in the sand.  At last he went to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, to inquire whose the bone was, and what he ought to do with it.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It happened that by the providence of Heaven there was then at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> an Elean embassy praying for deliverance from a pestilence.  So the Pythian priestess ordered the Eleans to recover the bones of Pelops, and Damarmenus to give back to the Eleans what he had found.  He did so, and the Eleans repaid him by appointing him and his descendants to be guardians of the bone.  The shoulder-blade of Pelops had disappeared by my time, because, I  suppose, it had been hidden in the depths so long, and besides its age it was greatly decayed through the salt water.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That Pelops and Tantalus once dwelt in my country there have remained signs right down to the present day.  There is a lake called after Tantalus and a famous grave, and on a peak of Mount Sipylus there is a throne of Pelops beyond the sanctuary of Plastene the Mother.  If you cross the river Hermus you see an image of Aphrodite in Temnus made of a living myrtle-tree.  It is a tradition among us that it was dedicated by Pelops when he was propitiating the goddess and asking for Hippodameia to be his bride.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The altar of Olympic Zeus is about equally distant from the Pelopium and the sanctuary of Hera, but it is in front of both.  Some say that it was built by Idaean Heracles, others by the local heroes two generations later than Heracles.  It has been made from the ash of the thighs of the victims sacrificed to Zeus, as is also the altar at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName>.  There is an ashen altar of Samian Hera not a bit grander than what in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> the Athenians call “improvised hearths.”</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first stage of the altar at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, called prothysis, has a circumference of one hundred and twenty-five feet; the circumference of the stage on the prothysis is thirty-two feet; the total height of the altar reaches to twenty-two feet.  The victims themselves it is the custom to sacrifice on the lower stage, the prothysis. But the thighs they carry up to the highest part of the altar and burn them there.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The steps that lead up to the prothysis from either side are made of stone, but those leading from the prothysis to the upper part of the altar are, like the altar itself, composed of ashes.  The ascent to the prothysis may be made by maidens, and likewise by women, when they are not shut out from <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, but men only can ascend from the prothysis to the highest part of the altar.  Even when the festival is not being held, sacrifice is offered to Zeus by private individuals and daily<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is possible that<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ πᾶσαν ἠμέραν</foreign>must be understood in the first clause from the second; “daily by individuals and by the Eleans.”</note> by the Eleans.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Every year the soothsayers, keeping carefully to the nineteenth day of the month Elaphius,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">End of March and the beginning of April.</note> bring the ash from the town-hall, and making it into a paste with the water of the Alpheius they daub the altar therewith.  But never may the ash be made into paste with other water, and for this reason the Alpheius is thought to be of all rivers the dearest to Olympic Zeus.  There is also an altar at <placeName key="perseus,Didyma">Didyma</placeName> of the Milesians, which Heracles the Theban is said by the Milesians to have made from the blood of the victims.  But in later times the blood of the sacrifices has not made the altar excessively large.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The altar at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> shows another strange peculiarity, which is this.  The kite, the bird of prey with the most rapacious nature, never harms those who are sacrificing at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.  Should ever a kite seize the entrails or some of the flesh, it is regarded as an unfavorable sign for the sacrificer.  There is a story that when Heracles the son of Alcmena was sacrificing at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> he was much worried by the flies.  So either on his own initiative or at somebody's suggestion he sacrificed to Zeus Averter of Flies, and thus the flies were diverted to the other side of the Alpheius.  It is said that in the same way the Eleans too sacrifice to Zeus Averter of Flies, to drive<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">I take<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξελαύνοντες</foreign>to be a conative present participle;  Frazer takes it as an ordinary temporal participle; “when they drive out.”</note> the flies out of <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Eleans are wont to use for the sacrifices to Zeus the wood of the white poplar and of no other tree, preferring the white poplar, I think, simply and solely because Heracles brought it into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName>.  And it is my opinion that when Heracles sacrificed to Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> he himself burned the thigh bones of the victims upon wood of the white poplar.  Heracles found the white poplar growing on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, the river in <placeName key="tgn,7002709">Thesprotia</placeName>, and for this reason Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.389">Hom. Il. 13.389</bibl>, and <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.482">Hom. Il. 16.482</bibl>.</note> calls it “Acheroid.”</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So from the first down to the present all rivers have not been equally suited for the growth of plants and trees.  Tamarisks grow best and in the greatest numbers by the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName>;  the Boeotian Asopus can produce the tallest reeds;  the persea tree flourishes only in the water of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>.  So it is no wonder that the white poplar grew first by the <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> and the wild olive by the Alpheius, and that the dark poplar is a nursling of the Celtic land of the Celtic Eridanus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that I have finished my account of the greatest altar, let me proceed to describe all the altars in <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.  My narrative will follow in dealing with them the order in which the Eleans are wont to sacrifice on the altars.  They sacrifice to Hestia first, secondly to Olympic Zeus, going to the altar within the temple, thirdly to Zeus Laoetas and to Poseidon Laoetas.  This sacrifice too it is usual to offer on one altar.  Fourthly and fifthly they sacrifice to Artemis and to Athena, Goddess of Booty,</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>sixthly to the Worker Goddess.  The descendants of Pheidias, called Cleansers, have received from the Eleans the privilege of cleaning the image of Zeus from the dirt that settles on it, and they sacrifice to the Worker Goddess before they begin to polish the image.  There is another altar of Athena near the temple, and by it a square altar of Artemis rising gently to a height.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the altars I have enumerated there is one on which they sacrifice to Alpheius and Artemis together.  The cause of this Pindar<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Pind. N. 1">Pind. N. 1</bibl></note>, I think, intimates in an ode, and I give it<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 6.22">Paus. 6.22</bibl></note> in my account of <placeName key="perseus,Letrini">Letrini</placeName>.  Not far from it stands another altar of Alpheius, and by it one of Hephaestus.  This altar of Hephaestus some Eleans call the altar of Warlike Zeus.  These same Eleans also say that Oenomaus used to sacrifice to Warlike Zeus on this altar whenever he was about to begin a chariot-race with one of the suitors of Hippodameia.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After this stands an altar of Heracles surnamed Parastates (Assistant); there are also altars of the brothers of Heracles—Epimedes, Idas, Paeonaeus, and Iasus; I am aware, however, that the altar of Idas is called by others the altar of Acesidas.  At the place where are the foundations of the house of Oenomaus stand two altars: one is of Zeus of the Courtyard, which Oenomaus appears to have had built himself, and the other of Zeus of the Thunderbolt, which I believe they built later, when the thunderbolt had struck the house of Oenomaus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>An account of the great altar I gave a little way back; it is called the altar of Olympian Zeus.  By it is an altar of Unknown Gods, and after this an altar of Zeus Purifier, one of Victory, and another of Zeus—this time surnamed Underground.  There are also altars of all gods, and of Hera surnamed Olympian, this too being made of ashes.  They say that it was dedicated by Clymenus.  After this comes an altar of Apollo and Hermes in common, because the Greeks have a story about them that Hermes invented the lyre and Apollo the lute.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next come an altar of Concord, another of Athena, and the altar of the Mother of the gods.  Quite close to the entrance to the stadium are two altars;  one they call the altar of Hermes of the Games, the other the altar of Opportunity.  I know that a hymn to Opportunity is one of the poems of Ion of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>; in the hymn Opportunity is made out to be the youngest child of Zeus.  Near the treasury of the Sicyonians is an altar of Heracles, either one of the Curetes or the son of Alcmena, for both accounts are given.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On what is called the Gaeum (sanctuary of Earth) is an altar of Earth;  it too is of ashes.  In more ancient days they say that there was an oracle also of Earth in this place.  On what is called the Stomium (Mouth) the altar to Themis has been built.  All round the altar of Zeus Descender runs a fence; this altar is near the great altar made of the ashes.  The reader must remember that the altars have not been enumerated in the order in which they stand, but the order followed by my narrative is that followed by the Eleans in their sacrifices.  By the sacred enclosure of Pelops is an altar of Dionysus and the Graces in common;  between them is an altar of the Muses, and next to these an altar of the Nymphs.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="15" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Outside the Altis there is a building called the workshop of Pheidias, where he wrought the image of Zeus piece by piece.  In the building is an altar to all the gods in common.  Now return back again to the Altis opposite the Leonidaeum.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Leonidaeum is outside the sacred enclosure, but at the processional entrance to the Altis, which is the only way open to those who take part in the processions.  It was dedicated by Leonidas, a native, but in my time the Roman governors of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> used it as their lodging.  Between the processional entrance and the Leonidaeum is a street, for the Eleans call streets what the Athenians call lanes.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Well, there is in the Altis, when you are about to pass to the left of the Leonidaeum, an altar of Aphrodite, and after it one of the Seasons.  About opposite the rear chamber a wild olive is growing on the right.  It is called the olive of the Beautiful Crown, and from its leaves are made the crowns which it is customary to give to winners of Olympic contests.  Near this wild olive stands an altar of Nymphs; these too are styled Nymphs of the Beautiful Crowns.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Outside the Altis, but on the right of the Leonidaeum, is an altar of Artemis of the Market, and one has also been built for Mistresses, and in my account of Arcadia<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 8.37.9">Paus. 8.37.9</bibl></note> I will tell you about the goddess they call Mistress.  After this is an altar of Zeus of the Market, and before what is called the Front Seats stands an altar of Apollo surnamed Pythian, and after it one of Dionysus.  The last altar is said to be not old, and to have been dedicated by private individuals.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go to the starting-point for the chariot-race there is an altar with an inscription “to the Bringer of Fate.”  This is plainly a surname of Zeus, who knows the affairs of men, all that the Fates give them, and all that is not destined for them.  Near there is also an oblong altar of Fates, after it one of Hermes, and the next two are of Zeus Most High.  At the starting-point for the chariot-race, just about opposite the middle of it, there are in the open altars of Poseidon Horse-god and Hera Horse-goddess, and near the pillar an altar of the Dioscuri.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the entrance to what is called the Wedge there is on one side an altar of Ares Horse-god, on the other one of Athena Horse-goddess.  On entering the Wedge itself you see altars of Good Luck, Pan and Aphrodite; at the innermost part of the Wedge an altar of the Nymphs called Blooming.  An altar of Artemis stands on the right as you return from the Portico that the Eleans call the Portico of Agnaptus, giving to the building the name of its architect.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After re-entering the Altis by the processional gate there are behind the Heraeum altars of the river Cladeus and of Artemis;  the one after them is Apollo's, the fourth is of Artemis surnamed Coccoca, and the fifth is of Apollo Thermius.  As to the Elean surname Thermius, the conjecture occurred to me that in the Attic dialect it would be thesmios (god of laws), but why Artemis is surnamed Coccoca I could not discover.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before what is called Theëcoleon is a building, in a corner of which has been set up an altar of Pan.  The Town Hall of the Eleans is within the Altis, and it has been built beside the exit beyond the gymnasium.  In this gymnasium are the running-tracks and the wrestling-grounds for the athletes.  In front of the door of the Town Hall is an altar of Artemis Huntress.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the Town Hall itself, on the right as you enter the room where they have the hearth, is an altar of Pan.  This hearth too is made of ashes, and on it fire burns every day and likewise every night.  The ashes from this hearth, according to the account I have already given, they bring to the altar of Olympian Zeus, and what is brought from the hearth contributes a great deal to the size of the altar.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Each month the Eleans sacrifice once on all the altars I have enumerated.  They sacrifice in an ancient manner; for they burn on the altars incense with wheat which has been kneaded with honey, placing also on the altars twigs of olive, and using wine for a libation.  Only to the Nymphs and the Mistresses are they not wont to pour wine in libation, nor do they pour it on the altar common to all the gods.  The care of the sacrifices is given to a priest, holding office for one month, to soothsayers and libation-bearers, and also to a guide, a flute-player and the woodman.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The traditional words spoken by them in the Town Hall at the libations, and the hymns which they sing, it were not right for me to introduce into my narrative.  They pour libations, not only to the Greek gods, but also to the god in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, to Hera Ammonia and to Parammon, which is a surname of Hermes.  From very early times it is plain that they used the oracle in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, and in the temple of Ammon are altars which the Eleans dedicated.  On them are engraved the questions of the Eleans, the replies of the god, and the names of the men who came to Ammon from <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>.  These are in the temple of Ammon.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Eleans also pour libations to all heroes and wives of heroes who are honored either in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> or among the Aetolians.  The songs sung in the Town Hall are in the Doric dialect, but they do not say who it was that composed them.  The Eleans also have a banqueting room.  This too is in the Town Hall, opposite the chamber where stands the hearth.  In this room they entertain the winners in the Olympic games.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="16" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It remains after this for me to describe the temple of Hera and the noteworthy objects contained in it.  The Elean account says that it was the people of Scillus, one of the cities in Triphylia, who built the temple about eight years after Oxylus came to the throne of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.  The style of the temple is Doric, and pillars stand all round it.  In the rear chamber one of the two pillars is of oak.  The length of the temple is one hundred and sixty-nine feet, the breadth sixty-three feet, the height not short of fifty feet.  Who the architect was they do not relate.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Every fourth year there is woven for Hera a robe by the Sixteen women, and the same also hold games called <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName>.  The games consist of foot-races for maidens.  These are not all of the same age.  The first to run are the youngest; after them come the next in age, and the last to run are the oldest of the maidens.  They run in the following way:</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>their hair hangs down, a tunic reaches to a little above the knee, and they bare the right shoulder as far as the breast.  These too have the Olympic stadium reserved for their games, but the course of the stadium is shortened for them by about one-sixth of its length.  To the winning maidens they give crowns of olive and a portion of the cow sacrificed to Hera.  They may also dedicate statues with their names inscribed upon them.  Those who administer to the Sixteen are, like the presidents of the games, married women.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The games of the maidens too are traced back to ancient times; they say that, out of gratitude to Hera for her marriage with Pelops, Hippodameia assembled the Sixteen Women, and with them inaugurated the <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName>.  They relate too that a victory was won by Chloris, the only surviving daughter of the house of Amphion, though with her they say survived one of her brothers.  As to the children of Niobe, what I myself chanced to learn about them I have set forth in my account of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 2.21.9">Paus. 2.21.9</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Besides the account already given they tell another story about the Sixteen Women as follows.  Damophon, it is said, when tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> did much grievous harm to the Eleans.  But when he died, since the people of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> refused to participate as a people in their tyrant's sins, and the Eleans too became quite ready to lay aside their grievances, they chose a woman from each of the sixteen cities of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> still inhabited at that time to settle their differences, this woman to be the oldest, the most noble, and the most esteemed of all the women.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The cities from which they chose the women were <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>,<gap reason="lost"></gap>The women from these cities made peace between <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.  Later on they were entrusted with the management of the Heraean games, and with the weaving of the robe for Hera.  The Sixteen Women also arrange two choral dances, one called that of Physcoa and the other that of Hippodameia.  This Physcoa they say came from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> in the Hollow, and the name of the parish where she lived was Orthia.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>She mated they say with Dionysus, and bore him a son called Narcaeus.  When he grew up he made war against the neighboring folk, and rose to great power, setting up moreover a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Narcaea.  They say too that Narcaeus and Physcoa were the first to pay worship to Dionysus.  So various honors are paid to Physcoa, especially that of the choral dance, named after her and managed by the Sixteen Women.  The Eleans still adhere to the other ancient customs, even though some of the cities have been destroyed.  For they are now divided into eight tribes, and they choose two women from each.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Whatever ritual it is the duty of either the Sixteen Women or the Elean umpires to perform, they do not perform before they have purified themselves with a pig meet for purification and with water.  Their purification takes place at the spring Piera.  You reach this spring as you go along the flat road from <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="17" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These things, then, are as I have already described.  In the temple of Hera is an image of Zeus, and the image of Hera is sitting on a throne with Zeus standing by her, bearded and with a helmet on his head.  They are crude works of art.  The figures of Seasons next to them, seated upon thrones, were made by the Aeginetan Smilis.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">circa <date from="-0580" to="-0540">580-540 B.C.</date></note> Beside them stands an image of Themis, as being mother of the Seasons.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then the Maid and Demeter sit opposite each other, while Apollo and Artemis stand opposite each other.  Here too have been dedicated Leto, Fortune, Dionysus and a winged Victory.  I cannot say who the artists were, but these figures too are in my opinion very ancient.  The figures I have enumerated are of ivory and gold, but at a later date other images were dedicated in the Heraeum, including a marble Hermes carrying the baby Dionysus, a work of Praxiteles, and a bronze Aphrodite made by Cleon of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">circa <date when="-0388">388 B.C.</date></note></p></div>

There were also brought hither from what is called the Philippeum other images of gold and ivory, Eurydice the wife of Aridaeus and Olympias the wife of Philip.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is also a chest made of cedar, with figures on it, some of ivory, some of gold, others carved out of the cedar-wood itself.  It was in this chest that Cypselus, the tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, was hidden by his mother when the Bacchidae were anxious to discover him after his birth.  In gratitude for the saving of Cypselus, his descendants, Cypselids as they are called, dedicated the chest at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.

Beginning our survey at the bottom we see in the first space of the chest the following scenes.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Oenomaus is chasing Pelops, who is holding Hippodameia.  Each of them has two horses, but those of Pelops have wings.

In front of the house stands Eriphyle with the necklace, and by her are her daughters Eurydice and Demonassa, and the boy Alcmaeon naked.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Asius in his poem makes out Alcmena also to be a daughter of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle.  Baton is driving the chariot of Amphiaraus, holding the reins in one hand and a spear in the other.  Amphiaraus already has one foot on the chariot and his sword drawn; he is turned towards Eriphyle in such a transport of anger that he can scarcely refrain from striking her.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the house of Amphiaraus come the games at the funeral of Pelias, with the spectators looking at the competitors.  Heracles is seated on a throne, and behind him is a woman.  There is no inscription saying who the woman is, but she is playing on a Phrygian, not a Greek, flute.  Driving chariots drawn by pairs of horses are Pisus, son of Perieres, and Asterion, son of Cometas (Asterion is said to have been one of the Argonauts), Polydeuces, Admetus and Euphemus.  The poets declare that<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>the last was a son of Poseidon and a companion of Jason on his voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7016642">Colchis</placeName>.  He it is who is winning the chariot-race.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those who have boldly ventured to box are Admetus and Mopsus, the son of Ampyx.  Between them stands a man playing the flute, as in our day they are accustomed to play the flute when the competitors in the pentathlum are jumping.  The wrestling-bout between Jason and Peleus is an even one.  Eurybotas is shown throwing the quoit; he must be some famous quoit-thrower.  Those engaged in a running-race are Melanion, Neotheus and Phalareus; the fourth runner is Argeius, and the fifth is Iphiclus.  Iphiclus is the winner, and Acastus is holding out the crown to him.  He is probably the father of the Protesilaus who joined in the war against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tripods too are set here, prizes of course for the winners; and there are the daughters of Pelias, though the only one with her name inscribed is Alcestis.  Iolaus, who voluntarily helped Heracles in his labours, is shown as a victor in the chariot-race.  At this point the funeral games of Pelias come to an end, and Heracles, with Athena standing beside him, is shooting at the hydra, the beast in the river Amymone.  Heracles can be easily recognized by his exploit and his attitude, so his name is not inscribed by him.  There is also Phineus the Thracian, and the sons of Boreas are chasing the harpies away from him.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I come to the second space on the chest, and in going round it I had better begin from the left.  There is a figure of a woman holding on her right arm a white child asleep, and on her left she has a black child like one who is asleep.  Each has his feet turned different ways.  The inscriptions declare, as one could infer without inscriptions, that the figures are Death and Sleep, with Night the nurse of both.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A beautiful woman is punishing an ugly one, choking her with one hand and with the other striking her with a staff.  It is Justice who thus treats Injustice.  Two other women are pounding in mortars with pestles; they are supposed to be wise in medicine-lore, though there is no inscription to them.  Who the man is who is followed by a woman is made plain by the hexameter verses, which run thus:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Idas brings back, not against her will,</l><l>Fair-ankled Marpessa, daughter of Evenus, whom Apollo carried off.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A man wearing a tunic is holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left a necklace; Alcmena is taking hold of them.

Menelaus, wearing a breastplate and carrying a sword, is advancing to kill Helen, so it is plain that <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> has been captured.

A man holding a sword is coming towards Atlas.  This everybody can see is Heracles, though he is not mentioned specially in the inscription, which reads:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Here is Atlas holding heaven, but he will let go the apples.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also Ares clad in armour and leading Aphrodite.  The inscription by him is “Enyalius.”  There is also a figure of Thetis as a maid; Peleus is taking hold of her, and from the hand of Thetis a snake is darting at Peleus.  The sisters of Medusa, with wings, are chasing Perseus, who is flying.  Only Perseus has his name inscribed on him.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the third space of the chest are military scenes.  The greater number of the figures are on foot, though there are some knights in two-horse chariots.  About the soldiers one may infer that they are advancing to battle, but that they will recognize and greet each other.  Two different accounts of them are given by the guides.  Some have said that they are the Aetolians with Oxylus and the ancient Eleans, and that they are meeting in remembrance of their original descent and as a sign of their mutual good will.  Others declare that the soldiers are meeting in battle, and that they are Pylians and Arcadians about to fight by the city <placeName key="perseus,Pheia">Pheia</placeName> and the river Iardanus.</p></div>

Cypselus and his ancestors came originally from <placeName key="perseus,Gonussa">Gonussa</placeName> above <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, and one of their ancestors was <placeName key="tgn,7002371">Melas</placeName>, the son of Antasus.</p></div>

Then comes the combat between Heracles and Geryones, who is represented as three men joined to one another.  There is Theseus holding a lyre, and by his side is Ariadne gripping a crown. Achilles and Memnon are fighting; their mothers stand by their side.</p></div>

Behind Polyneices stands a woman with teeth as cruel as those of a beast, and her fingernails are bent like talons.  An inscription by her calls her Doom, implying that Polyneices has been carried off by fate, and that Eteocles fully deserved his end.  Dionysus is lying down in a cave, a bearded figure holding a golden cup, and clad in a tunic reaching to the feet.  Around him are vines, apple-trees and pomegranate-trees.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The highest space—the spaces are five in number—shows no inscription, so that we can only conjecture what the reliefs mean.  Well, there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I  was of opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon the number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing.  For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.348">Hom.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next come two-horse chariots with women standing in them.  The horses have golden wings, and a man is giving armour to one of the women.  I conjecture that this scene refers to the death of Patroclus; the women in the chariots, I take it, are Nereids, and Thetis is receiving the armour from Hephaestus.  And moreover, he who is giving the armour is not strong upon his feet, and a slave follows him behind, holding a pair of fire-tongs.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>An account also is given of the Centaur, that he is Chiron, freed by this time from human affairs and held worthy to share the home of the gods, who has come to assuage the grief of Achilles.  Two maidens in a mule-cart, one holding the reins and the other wearing a veil upon her head, are thought to be Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, and her handmaiden, driving to the washing-pits.  The man shooting at Centaurs, some of which he has killed, is plainly Heracles, and the exploit is one of his.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As to the maker of the chest, I found it impossible to form any conjecture.

The quoit of Iphitus has inscribed upon it the truce which the Eleans proclaim at the Olympic festivals; the inscription is not written in a straight line, but the letters run in a circle round the quoit.</p></div>

He said that in his day the roof of the Heraeum had fallen into decay.  When the Eleans were repairing it, the corpse of a foot-soldier with wounds was discovered between the roof supporting the tiles and the ornamented ceiling.  This soldier took part in the battle in the Altis between the Eleans and the Lacedaemonians.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">circa <date when="-0400">400 B.C.</date></note></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Eleans in fact climbed to defend themselves on to all high places alike, including the sanctuaries of the gods.  At any rate this soldier seemed to us to have crept under here after growing faint with his wounds, and so died.  Lying in a completely sheltered spot the corpse would suffer harm neither from the heat of summer nor from the frost of winter.  Aristarchus said further that they carried the corpse outside the Altis and buried him in the earth along with his armour.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What the Eleans call the pillar of Oenomaus is in the direction of the sanctuary of Zeus as you go from the great altar.  On the left are four pillars with a roof on them, the whole constructed to protect a wooden pillar which has decayed through age, being for the most part held together by bands.  This pillar, so runs the tale, stood in the house of Oenomaus.  Struck by lightning the rest of the house was destroyed by the fire; of all the building only this pillar was left.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A Roman senator won an Olympic victory.  Wishing to leave behind, as a memorial of his victory, a bronze statue with an inscription, he proceeded to dig, so as to make a foundation.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These I saw myself as they were being dug out.  A temple of no great size in the Doric style they have called down to the present day Metroum,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">“Temple of the Mother.”</note> keeping its ancient name.  No image lies in it of the Mother of the gods, but there stand in it statues of Roman emperors.  The Metroum is within the Altis, and so is a round building called the Philippeum.

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From this point my account will proceed to a description of the statues and votive offerings; but I think that it would be wrong to mix up the accounts of them. For whereas on the Athenian Acropolis statues are votive offerings like everything else, in the Altis some things only are dedicated in honor of the gods, and statues are merely part of the prizes awarded to the victors. The statues I will mention later; I will turn first to the votive offerings, and go over the most noteworthy of them.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go to the stadium along the road from the Metroum, there is on the left at the bottom of Mount Cronius a platform of stone, right by the very mountain, with steps through it. By the platform have been set up bronze images of Zeus. These have been made from the fines inflicted on athletes who have wantonly broken the rules of the contests, and they are called Zanes (figures of Zeus) by the natives.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first, six in number, were set up in the ninety-eighth Olympiad. For Eupolus of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> bribed the boxers who entered the competition, Agenor the Arcadian and Prytanis of <placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, and with them also Phormio of Halicarnassus, who had won at the preceding Festival. This is said to have been the first time that an athlete violated the rules of the games, and the first to be fined by the Eleans were Eupolus and those who accepted bribes from Eupolus. Two of these images are the work of Cleon of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>; who made the next four I do not know.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Except the third and the fourth these images have elegiac inscriptions on them. The first of the inscriptions is intended to make plain that an Olympic victory is to be won, not by money, but by swiftness of foot and strength of body. The inscription on the second image declares that the image stands to the glory of the deity, through the piety of the Eleans, and to be a terror to law-breaking athletes. The purport of the inscription on the fifth image is praise of the Eleans, especially for their fining the boxers; that of the sixth and last is that the images are a warning to all the Greeks not to give bribes to obtain an Olympic victory.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next after Eupolus they say that Callippus of Athens, who had entered for the pentathlum, bought off his fellow-competitors by bribes, and that this offence occurred at tie hundred and twelfth Festival.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0532">532 B.C.</date></note> When the fine had been imposed by the Eleans on Callippus and his antagonists, the Athenians commissioned Hypereides to persuade the Eleans to remit them the fine. The Eleans refused this favour, and the Athenians were disdainful enough not to pay the money and to boycott the Olympic games, until finally the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> declared that he would deliver no oracle on any matter to the Athenians before they had paid the Eleans the fine.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So when it was paid, images, also six in number, were made in honor of Zeus; on them are inscribed elegiac verses not a whit more elegant than those relating the fine of Eupolus. The gist of the first inscription is that the images were dedicated because the god by an oracle expressed his approval of the Elean decision against the pentathletes; on the second image and likewise on the third are praises of the Eleans for their fining the competitors in the pentathlum.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The fourth purports to say that the contest at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> is one of merit and not of wealth; the inscription on the fifth declares the reason for dedicating the images, while that on the sixth commemorates the oracle given to the Athenians by <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The images next to those I have enumerated are two in number, and they were dedicated from a fine imposed on wrestlers. As to their names, neither I nor the guides of the Eleans knew them. On these images too are inscriptions; one says that the Rhodians paid money to Olympian Zeus for the wrongdoing of a wrestler; the other that certain men wrestled for bribes and that the image was made from the fines imposed upon them.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The rest of the information about these athletes comes from the guides of the Eleans, who say that it was at the hundred and seventy-eighth Festival that Eudelus accepted a bribe from Philostratus, and that this Philostratus was a Rhodian. This account I found was at variance with the Elean record of Olympic victories. In this record it is stated that Strato of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> at the hundred and seventy-eighth Festival won on the same day the victory in the pancratium and the victory at wrestling. <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> on the Canopic mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> was founded by Alexander the son of Philip, but it is said that previously there was on the site a small Egyptian town called Racotis.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Three Competitors before the time of this Strato, and three others after him, are known to have received the wild-olive for winning the pancratium and the wrestling: Caprus from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> itself, and of the Greeks on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName>, Aristomenes of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> and Protophanes of <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> on the Lethaeus, were earlier than Strato; after him came <placeName key="tgn,7002342">Marion</placeName> his compatriot, Aristeas of <placeName key="tgn,7002367">Stratoniceia</placeName> (anciently both land and city were called <placeName key="tgn,7002367">Chrysaoris</placeName>), and the seventh was Nicostratus, from Gilicia on the coast, though he was in no way a Gilician except in name.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Nicostratus while still a baby was stolen from Prymnessus in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> by robbers, being a child of a noble family.  Conveyed to Aegeae he was bought by somebody or other, who some time afterwards dreamed a dream. He thought that a lion's whelp lay beneath the pallet-bed on which Nicostratus was sleeping. Now Nicostratus, when he grew up, won other victories elsewhere, besides in the pancratium and wrestling at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Afterwards others were fined by the Eleans, among whom was an Alexandrian boxer at the two hundred and eighteenth Festival. The name of the man fined was Apollonius, with the surname of Rhantes—it is a sort of national characteristic for Alexandrians to have a surname. This man was the first Egyptian to be convicted by the Eleans of a misdemeanor.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was not for giving or taking a bribe that he was condemned, but for the following outrageous conduct in connection with the games. He did not arrive by the prescribed time, and the Eleans, if they followed their rule, had no option but to exclude him from the games. For his excuse, that he had been kept back among the <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName> islands by contrary winds, was proved to be an untruth by Heracleides, himself an Alexandrian by birth. He showed that Apollonius was late because he had been picking up some money at the Ionian games.</p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In these circumstances the Eleans shut out from the games Apollonius with any other boxer who came after the prescribed time, and let the crown go to Heracleides without a contest. Whereupon Apollonius put on his gloves for a fight, rushed at Heracleides, and began to pummel him, though he had already put the wild-olive on his head and had taken refuge with the umpires. For this light-headed folly he was to pay dearly.</p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are also two other images of modern workmanship. For at the two hundred and twenty-sixth Festival they detected that two boxing men, in a fight for victory only, had agreed about the issue for a sum of money. For this misconduct a fine was inflicted, and of the images of Zeus that were made, one stands on the left of the entrance to the stadium and the other on the right. Of the boxers, the one bribed was called Didas, and the briber was Sarapammon. They were from the same district, the newest in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, called Arsinoites.</p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is a wonder in any case if a man has so little respect for the god of <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> as to take or give a bribe in the contests; it is an even greater wonder that one of the Eleans themselves has fallen so low. But it is said that the Elean Damonicus did so fall at the hundred and ninety second Festival. They say that collusion occurred between Polyctor the son of Damonicus and Sosander of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, of the same name as his father; these were competitors for the wrestling prize of wild-olive. Damonicus, it is alleged, being exceedingly ambitious that his son should win, bribed the father of Sosander.</p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the transaction became known, the umpires imposed a fine, but instead of imposing it on the sons they directed their anger against the fathers, for that they were the real sinners.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The offerings of Micythus I found were numerous and not together. Next after Iphitus of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, and Echecheiria crowning Iphitus, come the following offerings of Micythus: Amphitrite, Poseidon and Hestia; the artist was Glaucus the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">circa <date when="-0460">460 B.C.</date></note> Along the left side of the great temple Micythus dedicated other offerings: the Maid, daughter of Demeter, Aphrodite, Ganymedes and Artemis, the poets Homer and Hesiod, then again deities, Asclepius and Health.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the offerings of Micythus is Struggle carrying jumping-weights, the shape of which is as follows. They are half of a circle, not an exact circle but elliptical, and made so that the fingers pass through as they do through the handle of a shield. Such are the fashion of them. By the statue of Struggle are Dionysus, Orpheus the Thracian, and an image of Zeus which I mentioned just now.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 5.24.6">Paus. 5.24.6</bibl></note> They are the works of Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">circa <date when="-0460">460 B.C.</date></note> They say that Micythus set up other offerings also in addition to these, and that they formed part of the treasures taken away by Nero.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The artists are said to have been Dionysius and Glaucus, who were Argives by birth, but the name of their teacher is not recorded. Their date is fixed by that of Micythus, who dedicated the works of art at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>. For Herodotus in his history<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hdt. 7.170">Hdt. 7.170</bibl></note> says that this Micythus, when Anaxilas was despot of <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, became his slave and steward of his property afterwards, on the death of Anaxilas, he went away to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The inscriptions on the offerings give Choerus as the father of Micythus, and as his fatherland the Greek cities of <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> on the Strait. The inscriptions say that he lived at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, and he dedicated the offerings at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> in fulfillment of a vow made for the recovery of a son, who fell ill of a wasting disease.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near to the greater offerings of Micythus, which were made by the Argive Glaucus, stands an image of Athena with a helmet on her head and clad in an aegis. Nicodamus of Maenalus was the artist, but it was dedicated by the Eleans. Beside the Athena has been set up a Victory. The Mantineans dedicated it, but they do not mention the war in the inscription. Calamis is said to have made it without wings in imitation of the wooden image at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> called Wingless Victory.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the smaller offerings of Micythus, that were made by Dionysius, are some of the exploits of Heracles, including what he did to the Nemean lion, the Hydra, the Hound of Hell, and the boar by the river Erymanthus. These were brought to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> by the people of Heracleia when they had overrun the land of the Mariandynians, their foreign neighbors.

<div n="27" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Opposite the offerings I have enumerated are others in a row; they face towards the south, and are very near to that part of the precinct which is sacred to Pelops. Among them are those dedicated by the Maenalian Phormis. He crossed to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> from Maenalus to serve Gelon the son of Deinomenes. Distinguishing himself in the campaigns of Gelon and afterwards of his brother Hieron, he reached such a pitch of prosperity that he dedicated not only these offerings at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, but also others dedicated to Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The offerings at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> are two horses and two charioteers, a charioteer standing by the side of each of the horses. The first horse and man are by Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the second are the work of Simon of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date from="-0488" to="-0460">488-460 B.C.</date></note> On the side of the first of the horses is an inscription, the first part of which is not metrical. It runs thus:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Phormis dedicated me,</l><l>An Arcadian of Maenalus, now of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This is the horse in which is, say the Eleans, the hippomanes (what maddens horses). It is plain to all that the quality of the horse is the result of magic skill. It is much inferior in size and beauty to all the horses standing within the Altis. Moreover, its tail has been cut off which makes the figure uglier still. But male horses, not only in spring but on any day, are at heat towards it.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In fact they rush into the Altis, breaking their tethers or escaping from their grooms, and they leap upon it much more madly than upon a living brood mare, even the most beautiful of them. Their hoofs slip off, but nevertheless they keep on neighing more and more, and leap with a yet more violent passion, until they are driven away by whips and sheer force. In no other way can they be separated from the bronze horse.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another marvel I know of, having seen it in <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>; it is different from the horse of Phormis, but like it not innocent of the magic art. The Lydians surnamed Persian have sanctuaries in the city named Hierocaesareia and at Hypaepa. In each sanctuary is a chamber, and in the chamber are ashes upon an altar. But the color of these ashes is not the usual color of ashes.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Entering the chamber a magician piles dry wood upon the altar; he first places a tiara upon his head and then sings to some god or other an invocation in a foreign tongue unintelligible to Greeks, reciting the invocation from a book. So it is without fire that the wood must catch, and bright flames dart from it.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So much for this subject. Among these offerings is Phormis himself opposed to an enemy, and next are figures of him fighting a second and again a third. On them it is written that the soldier fighting is Phormis of Maenalus, and that he who dedicated the offerings was Lycortas of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Clearly this Lycortas dedicated them out of friendship for Phormis. These offerings of Lycortas are also called by the Greeks offerings of Phormis.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Hermes carrying the ram under his arm, with a helmet on his head, and clad in tunic and cloak, is not one of the offerings of Phormis, but has been given to the god by the Arcadians of Pheneus. The inscription says that the artist was Onatas of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> helped by Calliteles, who I think was a pupil or son of Onatas. Not far from the offering of the Pheneatians is another image, Hermes with a herald's wand. An inscription on it says that Glaucias, a Rhegian by descent, dedicated it, and Gallon of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> made it.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the bronze oxen one was dedicated by the Corcyraeans and the other by the Eretrians. Philesius of <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> was the artist. Why the Corcyraeans dedicated the ox at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and another at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> will be explained in my account of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 10.9.3">Paus. 10.9.3</bibl></note> bout the offering at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> I heard the following story.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Sitting under this ox a little boy was playing with his head bent towards the ground. Suddenly lifting his head he broke it against the bronze, and died a few days later from the wound. So the Eleans were purposing to remove the ox from out the Altis as being guilty of bloodshed. But the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> gave an oracle that they were to let the offering stay where it was, after performing upon it the purificatory rites that are customary among the Greeks for unintentional shedding of blood.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Under the plane trees in the Altis, just about in the center of the enclosure, there is a bronze trophy, with an inscription upon the shield of the trophy, to the effect that the Eleans raised it as a sign that they had beaten the Lacedaemonians. It was in this battle that the warrior lost his life who was found lying in his armour when the roof of the Heraeum was being repaired in my time.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The offering of the Mendeans in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> came very near to beguiling me into the belief that it was a representation of a competitor in the pentathlum. It stands by the side of Anauchidas of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, and it holds ancient jumping-weights. An elegiac couplet is written on its thigh:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">To Zeus, king of the gods, as first-fruits was I placed here</l><l>By the Mendeans, who reduced Sipte by might of hand.</l></quote>Sipte seems to be a Thracian fortress and city.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These I am forced to omit by the nature of my work, which is not a list of athletes who have won Olympic victories, but an account of statues and of votive offerings generally.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the right of the temple of Hera is the statue of a wrestler, Symmachus the son of Aeschylus.

Next comes Archedamus, son of Xenius, another Elean by birth, who like Symmachus overthrew wrestlers in the contest for boys. The statues of the athletes mentioned above were made by Alypus of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, pupil of Naucydes of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The inscription on Cleogenes the son of Silenus declares that he was a native, and that he won a prize with a riding-horse from his own private stable. Hard by Cleogenes are set up Deinolochus, son of Pyrrhus, and Troilus, son of Alcinous. These also were both Eleans by birth, though their victories were not the same. Troilus, at the time that he was umpire, succeeded in winning victories in the chariot-races, one for a chariot drawn by a full-grown pair and another for a chariot drawn by foals. The date of his victories was the hundred and second Festival<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0372">372 B.C.</date></note>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After this the Eleans passed a law that in future no umpire was to compete in the chariot-races. The statue of Troilus was made by Lysippus. The mother of Deinolochus had a dream, in which she thought that the son she clasped in her bosom had a crown on his head. For this reason Deinolochus was trained to compete in the games and outran the boys. The artist was Cleon of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As for Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus, her ancestry and Olympic victories, I have given an account thereof in my history of the Lacedaemonian kings.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 3.8">Paus. 3.8</bibl>.</note> By the side of the statue of Troilus at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> has been made a basement of stone, whereon are a chariot and horses, a charioteer, and a statue of Cynisca herself, made by Apelles; there are also inscriptions relating to Cynisca.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next to her also have been erected statues of Lacedaemonians. They gained victories in chariot-races. Anaxander was the first of his family to be proclaimed victor with a chariot, but the inscription on him declares that previously his paternal grandfather received the crown for the pentathlum. Anaxander is represented in an attitude of prayer to the god, while Polycles, who gained the surname of Polychalcus, likewise won a victory with a four-horse chariot, and his statue holds a ribbon in the right hand. </p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside him are two children; one holds a wheel and the other is asking for the ribbon.

As for Arcesilaus and his son Lichas, the father won two Olympic victories; his son, because in his time the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the games, entered his chariot in the name of the Theban people, and with his own hands bound the victorious charioteer with a ribbon.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near Lichas stands an Elean diviner, Thrasybulus, son of Aeneas of the Iamid family, who divined for the Mantineans in their struggle against the Lacedaemonians under Agis, son of Eudamidas, their king.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Divination by kids, lambs or calves has, we all know, been established among men from ancient times, and the Cyprians have even discovered how to practise the art by means of pigs; but no peoples are wont to make any use of dogs in divining. So Thrasybulus apparently established a method of divination peculiar to himself, by means of the entrails of dogs. The diviners called Iamidae are descended from Iamus, who, Pindar says in an ode,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Pind. O. 6">Pind.

Men of Syracuse, who were bringing a sacrifice from Dionysius to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, tried to bribe the father of Antipater to have his son proclaimed as a Syracusan.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The inscription on the Samian boxer says that his trainer Mycon dedicated the statue and that the Samians are best among the Ionians for athletes and at naval warfare; this is what the inscription says, but it tells us nothing at all about the boxer himself.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside this is the Messenian Damiscus, who won an Olympic victory at the age of twelve. I was exceedingly surprised to learn that while the Messenians were in exile from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, their luck at the Olympic games failed.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In addition to this, Pulydamas is remembered for another wonderful performance.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This river then, according to tradition, was the father of Euthymus, who, though he won the prize for boxing at the seventy-fourth Olympic Festival<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0484">484 B.C.</date></note>, was not to be so successful at the next. For Theagenes of <placeName key="tgn,7011078">Thasos</placeName>, wishing to win the prizes for boxing and for the pancratium at the same Festival, overcame Euthymus at boxing, though he had not the strength to gain the wild olive in the pancratium, because he was already exhausted in his fight with Euthymus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thereupon the umpires fined Theagenes a talent, to be sacred to the god, and a talent for the harm done to Euthymus, holding that it was merely to spite him that he entered for the boxing competition. For this reason they condemned him to pay an extra fine privately to Euthymus. At the seventy-sixth Festival Theagenes paid in full the money owed to the god, . . . and as compensation to Euthymus did not enter for the boxing-match. At this Festival, and also at the next following, Euthymus won the crown for boxing. His statue is the handiwork of Pythagoras, and is very well worth seeing.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now Odysseus, it is said, cared nothing about his loss and sailed away. But the ghost of the stoned man never ceased killing without distinction the people of Temesa, attacking both old and young, until, when the inhabitants had resolved to flee from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> for good, the Pythian priestess forbad them to leave Temesa, and ordered them to propitiate the Hero, setting him a sanctuary apart and building a temple, and to give him every year as wife the fairest maiden in Temesa.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they performed the commands of the god and suffered no more terrors from the ghost. But Euthymus happened to come to Temesa just at the time when the ghost was being propitiated in the usual way; learning what was going on he had a strong desire to enter the temple, and not only to enter it but also to look at the maiden. When he saw her he first felt pity and afterwards love for her. The girl swore to marry him if he saved her, and so Euthymus with his armour on awaited the onslaught of the ghost.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He won the fight, and the Hero was driven out of the land and disappeared, sinking into the depth of the sea. Euthymus had a distinguished wedding, and the inhabitants were freed from the ghost for ever. I heard another story also about Euthymus, how that he reached extreme old age, and escaping again from death departed from among men in another way. Temesa is still inhabited, as I heard from a man who sailed there as a merchant.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This I heard, and I also saw by chance a picture dealing with the subject. It was a copy of an ancient picture. There were a stripling, <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris">Sybaris</placeName>, a river, Calabrus, and a spring, Lyca. Besides, there were a hero-shrine and the city of Temesa, and in the midst was the ghost that Euthymus cast out. Horribly black in color, and exceedingly dreadful in all his appearance, he had a wolf's skin thrown round him as a garment. The letters on the picture gave his name as Lycas.</p></div>

When you have looked at these also you will reach the statues of the Rhodian athletes, Diagoras and his family. These were dedicated one after the other in the following order. Acusilaus, who received a crown for boxing in the men's class; Dorieus, the youngest, who won the pancratium at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> on three successive occasions. Even before Dorieus, Damagetus beat all those who had entered for the pancratium.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These were brothers, being sons of Diagoras, and by them is set up also a statue of Diagoras himself, who won a victory for boxing in the men's class. The statue of Diagoras was made by the Megarian Callicles, the son of the Theocosmus who made the image of Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>. The sons too of the daughters of Diagoras practised boxing and won Olympic victories: in the men's class Eucles, son of Callianax and Callipateira, daughter of Diagoras; in the boys' class Peisirodus, whose mother dressed herself as a man and a trainer, and took her son herself to the Olympic games.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Peisirodus is one of the statues in the Altis, and stands by the father of his mother.

The youths on defeating their father proceeded to carry him through the crowd, while the Greeks pelted him with flowers and congratulated him on his sons.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Dorieus, son of Diagoras, besides his Olympian victories, won eight at the Isthmian and seven at the Nemean games.

Timanthes, they say, met his end through the following cause. On retiring from athletics he continued to test his strength by drawing a great bow every day. His practice with the bow was interrupted during a period when he was away from home. On his return, finding that he was no longer able to bend the bow, he lit a fire and threw himself alive on to it. In my view all such deeds, whether they have already occurred among men or will take place hereafter, ought to be regarded as acts of madness rather than of courage.</p></div>

The statue of Euthymenes for his victory over the boys was made by Alypus; the statue of Damocritus was made by Cleon, and that of Philip the Azanian by Myron.

They are memorials of Olympic victories won by Hiero the son of Deinomenes, who was tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> after his brother Gelo. But the offerings were not sent by Hiero; it was Hiero's son Deinomenes who gave them to the god, Onatas the Aeginetan who made the chariot, and Calamis who made the horses on either side and the boys on them.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By the chariot of Hiero is a man of the same name as the son of Deinomenes.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Hiero made an alliance with Pyrrhus the son of Aeacides, sealing it by the marriage of Gelo his son and Nereis the daughter of Pyrrhus. When the Romans went to war with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, the Carthaginians held more than half the island, and Hiero sided with them at the beginning of the war.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He met his end at the hands of Deinomenes, a Syracusan by birth and an inveterate enemy of tyranny, who afterwards, when Hippocrates the brother of Epicydes had just come from Erbessus to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and was beginning to harangue the multitude, rushed at him with intent to kill him. But Hippocrates withstood him, and certain of the bodyguard over-powered and slew Deinomenes. The statues of Hiero at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, one on horseback and the other on foot, were dedicated by the sons of Hiero, the artist being Micon, a Syracusan, the son of Niceratus.</p></div>

Callon the son of Harmodius and Hippomachus the son of Moschion, Elean by race, were victors in the boys' boxing-match.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here too I remember discovering the statue of Anaximenes, who wrote a universal history of ancient <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, including the exploits of Philip the son of Amyntas and the subsequent deeds of Alexander. His honor at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> was due to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>. Anaximenes bequeathed to posterity the following anecdotes about himself. Alexander, the son of Philip, no meek and mild person but a most passionate monarch, he circumvented by the following artifice.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The people of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName> favoured the cause of the Persian king, or were suspected of doing so, and Alexander, boiling over with rage against them, threatened to treat them with utmost rigor. As their wives, their children, and their country itself were in great danger, they sent Anaximenes to intercede for them, because he was known to Alexander himself and had been known to Philip before him. Anaximenes approached, and when Alexander learned for what cause he had come, they say that he swore by the gods of Greece, whom he named, that he would verily do the opposite of what Anaximenes asked.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thereupon Anaximenes said, “Grant me, O king, this favour. Enslave the women and children of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>, raze the whole city even to the ground, and burn the sanctuaries of their gods.” Such were his words; and Alexander, finding no way to counter the trick, and bound by the compulsion of his oath, unwillingly pardoned the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Anaximenes is also known to have retaliated on a personal enemy in a very clever but very ill-natured way. He had a natural aptitude for rhetoric and for imitating the style of rhetoricians. Having a quarrel with Theopompus the son of Damasistratus, he wrote a treatise abusing Athenians, Lacedaemonians and Thebans alike. He imitated the style of Theopompus with perfect accuracy, inscribed his name upon the book and sent it round to the cities. Though Anaximenes was the author of the treatise, hatred of Theopompus grew throughout the length of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The tomb of the Arcadians who were killed in the battle is on the hill across the Cladeus to the west.  Near to the sanctuary of Eileithyia are the remains of the sanctuary of Heavenly Aphrodite, and there too they sacrifice upon the altars.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is within the Altis by the processional entrance the Hippodameium, as it is called, about a quarter of an acre of ground surrounded by a wall.  Into it once every year the women may enter, who sacrifice to Hippodameia, and do her honor in other ways.  The story is that Hippodameia withdrew to <placeName key="perseus,Midea">Midea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName>, because Pelops was very angry with her over the death of Chrysippus.   The Eleans declare that subsequently, because of an oracle, they brought the bones of Hippodameia to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the end of the statues which they made from the fines levied on athletes, there is the entrance called the Hidden Entrance.  Through it umpires and competitors are wont to enter the stadium.  Now the stadium is an embankment of earth, and on it is a seat for the presidents of the games.  Opposite the umpires is an altar of white marble;</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>seated on this altar a woman looks on at the Olympic games, the priestess of Demeter Chamyne, which office the Eleans bestow from time to time on different women.  Maidens are not debarred from looking on at the games. At the end of the stadium, where is the starting-place for the runners, there is, the Eleans say, the tomb of Endymion.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When you have passed beyond the stadium, at the point where the umpires sit, is a place set apart for the horse-races, and also the starting-place for the horses.   The starting-place is in the shape of the prow of a ship, and its prow is turned towards the course. At the point where the prow adjoins the porch of Agnaptus it broadens and a bronze dolphin on a rod has been made at the very point of the ram.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Each side of the starting-place is more than four hundred feet in length, and in the sides are built stalls.  These stalls are assigned by lot to those who enter for the races.  Before the chariots or race-horses is stretched a cord as a barrier.  An altar of unburnt brick, plastered on the outside, is made at every Festival as near as possible to the center of the prow,</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and a bronze eagle stands on the altar with his wings stretched out to the fullest extent. The man appointed to start the racing sets in motion the mechanism in the altar, and then the eagle has been made to jump upwards, so as to become visible to the spectators, while the dolphin falls to the ground.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>First on either side the barriers are withdrawn by the porch of Agnaptus, and the horses standing thereby run off first.  As they run they reach those to whom the second station has been allotted, and then are withdrawn the barriers at the second station.  The same thing happens to all the horses in turn, until at the ram of the prow they are all abreast.  After this it is left to the charioteers to display their skill and the horses their speed.</p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was Cleoetas who originally devised the method of starting, and he appears to have been proud of the discovery, as on the statue at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> he wrote the inscription:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Who first invented the method of starting the horses at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>,</l><l>He made me, Cleoetas the son of Aristocles.</l></quote>It is said that after Cleoetas some further device was added to the mechanism by Aristeides.</p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The race-course has one side longer than the other, and on the longer side, which is a bank, there stands, at the passage through the bank, Taraxippus, the terror of the horses. It has the shape of a round altar, and as they run along the horses are seized, as soon as they reach this point, by a great fear without any apparent reason.  The fear leads to disorder; the chariots generally crash and the charioteers are injured.  Consequently the charioteers offer sacrifice, and pray that Taraxippus may show himself propitious to them.</p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Greeks differ in their view of Taraxippus.  Some hold that it is the tomb of an original inhabitant who was skilled in horsemanship; they call him Olenius, and say that after him was named the Olenian rock in the land of <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>.  Others say that Dameon, son of Phlius, who took part in the expedition of Heracles against Augeas and the Eleans, was killed along with his charger by Cteatus the son of Actor, and that man and horse were buried in the same tomb.</p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a story that Pelops made here an empty mound in honor of Myrtilus, and sacrificed to him in an effort to calm the anger of the murdered man, naming the mound<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, “him.”</note> Taraxippus (Frightener of horses) because the mares of Oenomaus were frightened by the trick of Myrtilus.  Some say that it is Oenomaus himself who harms the racers in the course.  I have also heard some attach the blame to Alcathus, the son of Porthaon.  Killed by Oenomaus because he wooed Hippodameia, Alcathus, they say, here got his portion of earth; having been unsuccessful on the course, he is a spiteful and hostile deity to chariot-drivers.</p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A man of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> said that Pelops received something from Amphion the Theban and buried it where is what they call Taraxippus, adding that it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of Oenomaus, as well as those of every charioteer since.  This Egyptian thought that Amphion and the Thracian Orpheus were clever magicians, and that it was through their enchantments that the beasts came to Orpheus, and the stones came to Amphion for the building of the wall.  The most probable of the stories in my opinion makes Taraxippus a surname of Horse Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another Taraxippus at the Isthmus, namely Glaucus, the son of Sisyphus. They say that he was killed by his horses, when Acastus held his contests in honor of his father. At <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName> of the Argives there was no hero who harmed the horses, but above the turning-point of the chariots rose a rock, red in color, and the flash from it terrified the horses, just as though it had been fire.  But the Taraxippus at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> is much worse for terrifying the horses.  On one turning-post is a bronze statue of Hippodameia carrying a ribbon, and about to crown Pelops with it for his victory.</p></div>

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the other side of the Cladeus is the grave of Oenomaus, a mound of earth with a stone wall built round it, and above the tomb are ruins of buildings in which Oenomaus is said to have stabled his mares.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The boundaries which now separate <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> originally separated <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> from <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>, and are thus situated.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Going on from this point you come to the water of Parthenia, and by the river is the grave of the mares of Marmax. The story has it that this Marmax was the first suitor of Hippodameia to arrive, and that he was killed by Oenomaus before the others; that the names of his mares were Parthenia and Eripha; that Oenomaus slew the mares after Marmax, but granted burial to them also, and that the river received the name Parthenia from the mare of Marmax.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another river called Harpinates, and not far from the river are, among the other ruins of a city Harpina, its altars.  The city was founded, they say, by Oenomaus, who named it after his mother Harpina.</p></div>

I think too that Pelops wanted a memorial to tell posterity the number and character of the men vanquished by Oenomaus before Pelops himself conquered him.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>According to the epic poem called the <title>Great Eoeae</title> the next after Marmax to be killed by Oenomaus was Alcathus, son of Porthaon; after Alcathus came Euryalus, Eurymachus and Crotalus.

But Artemis had a suspicion of the plot of Alpheius, and smeared with mud her own face and the faces of the nymphs with her.

In this gymnasium the athletes are wont to go through the training through which they must pass before going to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.  High plane-trees grow between the tracks inside a wall. The whole of this enclosure is called Xystus, because an exercise of Heracles, the son of Amphitryo, was to scrape up (anaxuein) each day all the thistles that grew there.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The track for the competing runners, called by the natives the Sacred Track, is separate from that on which the runners and pentathletes practise.  In the gymnasium is the place called Plethrium.  In it the umpires match the competitors according to age and skill; it is for wrestling that they match them.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are also in the gymnasium altars of the gods, of Idaean Heracles, surnamed Comrade, of Love, of the deity called by Eleans and Athenians alike Love Returned, of Demeter and of her daughter.  Achilles has no altar, only a cenotaph raised to him because of an oracle.  On an appointed day at the beginning of the festival, when the course of the sun is sinking towards the west, the Elean women do honor to Achilles, especially by bewailing him.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is another enclosed gymnasium, but smaller, adjoining the larger one and called Square because of its shape.  Here the athletes practise wrestling, and here, when they have no more wrestling to do, they are matched in contests with the softer gloves. There is also dedicated here one of the images made in honor of Zeus out of the fines imposed upon Sosander of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName> and upon Polyctor of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a third enclosed gymnasium, called Maltho from the softness of its floor, and reserved for the youths for the whole time of the festival. In a corner of the Maltho is a bust of Heracles as far as the shoulders, and in one of the wrestling-schools is a relief showing Love and Love Returned, as he is called.  Love holds a palm-branch, and Love Returned is trying to take the palm from him.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On each side of the entrance to the Maltho stands an image of a boy boxer.  He was by birth, so the Guardian of the Laws at <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> told me, from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> over against the island Pharos, and his name was Sarapion; arriving at <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> when the townsfolk were suffering from famine he supplied them with food.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The way from the gymnasium to the baths passes through the Street of Silence and beside the sanctuary of Artemis Philomeirax.  The goddess is so surnamed because she is neighbor to the gymnasium; the street received, they say, the name of Silence for the following reason.  Men of the army of Oxylus were sent to spy out what was happening in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.  On the way they exhorted each other, when they should be near the wall, themselves to keep a strict silence, but to listen attentively if perchance they might learn aught from the people in the town.  These men by this street reached the town unobserved, and after hearing all they wished they went back again to the Aetolians.

<div n="24" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>One of the two ways from the gymnasium leads to the market-place, and to what is called the Umpires' Room; it is above the grave of Achilles, and by it the umpires are wont to go to the gymnasium.  They enter before sunrise to match the runners, and at midday for the pentathlum and for such contests as are called heavy.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The market-place of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> is not after the fashion of the cities of <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> and of the Greek cities near <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>; it is built in the older manner, with porticoes separated from each other and with streets through them.  The modern name of the market-place is Hippodromus, and the natives train their horses there.  Of the porticoes the southern is in the Doric style, and it is divided by the pillars into three parts.  In it the umpires generally spend the day.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the pillars they also cause altars to be made to Zeus, and in the open market-place are the altars, in number not many; for, their construction being improvised, they are without difficulty taken to pieces.  As you enter the market-place at this portico the Umpires' Room is on your left, parallel to the end of the portico.  What separates it from the market-place is a street.  In this Umpires' Room dwell for ten consecutive months the umpires elect, who are instructed by the Guardians of the Law as to their duties at the festival.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near to the portico where the umpires pass the day is another portico, between the two being one street.  The Eleans call it the Corcyrean, because, they say, the Corcyreans landed in their country and carried off part of the booty, but they themselves took many times as much booty from the land of the Corcyreans, and built the portico from the tithe of the spoils.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The portico is in the Doric style and double, having its pillars both on the side towards the market-place and on the side away from it.  Down the center of it the roof is supported, not by pillars, but by a wall, beside which on either side have been dedicated statues.  On the side of the portico towards the market-place stands a statue of Pyrrhon, son of Pistocrates, a sophist who never brought himself to make a definite admission on any matter.  The tomb also of Pyrrhon is not far from the town of the Eleans.  The name of the place is <placeName key="perseus,Petra">Petra</placeName>, and it is said that <placeName key="perseus,Petra">Petra</placeName> was a township in ancient times.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most notable things that the Eleans have in the open part of the market-place are a temple and image of Apollo Healer.  The meaning of the name would appear to be exactly the same as that of Averter of Evil, the name current among the Athenians.  In another part are the stone images of the sun and of the moon; from the head of the moon project horns, from the head of the sun, his rays. There is also a sanctuary to the Graces; the images are of wood, with their clothes gilded, while their faces, hands and feet are of white marble.  One of them holds a rose, the middle one a die, and the third a small branch of myrtle.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The reason for their holding these things may be guessed to be this.  The rose and the myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite and connected with the story of Adonis, while the Graces are of all deities the nearest related to Aphrodite.  As for the die, it is the plaything of youths and maidens, who have nothing of the ugliness of old age.  On the right of the Graces is an image of Love, standing on the same pedestal.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here there is also a temple of Silenus, which is sacred to Silenus alone, and not to him in common with Dionysus.

The precinct of the other Aphrodite is surrounded by a wall, and within the precinct has been made a basement, upon which sits a bronze image of Aphrodite upon a bronze he-goat. It is a work of Scopas, and the Aphrodite is named Common.  The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The sacred enclosure of Hades and its temple (for the Eleans have these among their possessions) are opened once every year, but not even on this occasion is anybody permitted to enter except the priest.  The following is the reason why the Eleans worship Hades; they are the only men we know of so to do.  It is said that, when Heracles was leading an expedition against Pylus in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, Athena was one of his allies.  Now among those who came to fight on the side of the Pylians was Hades, who was the foe of Heracles but was worshipped at Pylus.</p></div>

At any rate it was in the belief that the god was their friend but the enemy of Heracles that the Eleans made the sanctuary for him.  The reason why they are wont to open it only once each year is, I suppose, because men too go down only once to Hades.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Eleans have also a sanctuary of Fortune.  In a portico of the sanctuary has been dedicated a colossal image, made of gilded wood except the face, hands and feet, which are of white marble.

The place where they hold the festival they name the Thyia is about eight stades from the city. Three pots are brought into the building by the priests and set down empty in the presence of the citizens and of any strangers who may chance to be in the country.

Asius, the son of Amphiptolemus, a Samian, says in his epic that there were born to Phoenix Astypalaea and Europa, whose mother was Perimede, the daughter of Oeneus; that Astypalaea had by Poseidon a son Ancaeus, who reigned over those called Leleges; that Ancaeus took to wife Samia, the daughter of the river <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName>, and begat Perilaus, Enudus, Samus, Alitherses and a daughter <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Parthenope</placeName>; and that <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Parthenope</placeName> had a son Lycomedes by Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thus far Asius in his poem.

The leader of the Ionians was Procles, the son of Pityreus, Epidaurian himself like the greater part of his followers, who had been expelled from Epidauria by Deiphontes and the Argives. This Procles was descended from Ion, son of Xuthus. But the Ephesians under Androclus made war on Leogorus, the son of Procles, who reigned in <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> after his father, and after conquering them in a battle drove the Samians out of their island, accusing them of conspiring with the Carians against the Ionians.</p></div>

But the Samians themselves hold that the goddess was born in the island by the side of the river Imbrasus under the withy that even in my time grew in the Heraeum. That this sanctuary is very old might be inferred especially by considering the image; for it is the work of an Aeginetan, Smilis, the son of Eucleides.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is said that Alexander was hunting on Mount Pagus, and that after the hunt was over he came to a sanctuary of the Nemeses, and found there a spring and a plane-tree in front of the sanctuary, growing over the water.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The land of the Ionians has the finest possible climate, and sanctuaries such as are to be found nowhere else. First because of its size and wealth is that of the Ephesian goddess, and then come two unfinished sanctuaries of Apollo, the one in <placeName key="tgn,7002494">Branchidae</placeName>, in Milesian territory, and the one at Clarus in the land of the Colophonians. Besides these, two temples in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> were burnt down by the Persians, the one of Hera in <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> and that of Athena at <placeName key="tgn,7018000">Phocaea</placeName>.

The image is like neither the Aeginetan, as they are called, nor yet the most ancient Attic images; it is absolutely Egyptian, if ever there was such. There was a wooden raft, on which the god set out from <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that when the raft reached the Ionian sea it came to rest at the cape called Mesate ( Middle) which is on the mainland, just midway between the harbor of the Erythraeans and the island of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>. When the raft rested off the cape the Erythraeans made great efforts, and the Chians no less, both being keen to land the image on their own shores.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At last a man of Erythrae (his name was Phormio) who gained a living by the sea and by catching fish, but had lost his sight through disease, saw a vision in a dream to the effect that the women of Erythrae must cut off their locks, and in this way the men would, with a rope woven from the hair, tow the raft to their shores. The women of the citizens absolutely refused to obey the dream;</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but the Thracian women, both the slaves and the free who lived there, offered themselves to be shorn. And so the men of Erythrae towed the raft ashore. Accordingly no women except Thracian women are allowed within the sanctuary of Heracles, and the hair rope is still kept by the natives. The same people say that the fisherman recovered his sight and retained it for the rest of his life.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also in Erythrae a temple of Athena Polias and a huge wooden image of her sitting on a throne; she holds a distaff in either hand and wears a firmament on her head. That this image is the work of Endoeus we inferred, among other signs, from the workmanship, and especially from the white marble images of Graces and Seasons that stand in the open before the entrance. A sanctuary too of Asclepius was made by the Smyrnaeans in my time between Mount Coryphe and a sea into which no other water flows.</p></div>

<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Erythraeans have a district called Calchis, from which their third tribe takes its name, and in Calchis is a cape stretching into the sea, and on it are sea baths, the most useful baths in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>.

Because of Cleomenes and his treachery the Lacedaemonians suffered the reverse at <placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>, where they<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0222">222 B.C.</date></note> were defeated by the Achaeans under Antigonus.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Philip, the son of Demetrius, reached man's estate, and Antigonus without reluctance handed over the sovereignty of the Macedonians, he struck fear into the hearts of all the Greeks. He copied Philip, the son of Amyntas, who was not his ancestor but really his master, especially by flattering those who were willing to betray their country for their private advantage. At banquets he would give the right hand of friendship offering cups filled not with wine but with deadly poison, a thing which I believe never entered the head of Philip the son of Amyntas, but poisoning sat very lightly on the conscience of Philip the son of Demetrius.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He also occupied with garrisons three towns to be used as bases against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and in his insolent contempt for the Greek people he called these cities the keys of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. To watch Peloponnesus Corinth was fortified with its citadel; to watch <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, the Boeotians and the Phocians, <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> on the Euripus; against the Thessalians themselves and the Aetolian people Philip occupied <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> at the foot of Mount Pelium. The Athenians especially and the Aetolians he harried with continual attacks and raids of bandits.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Already, in my account of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.36.5">Paus. 1.36.5</bibl>.</note> I have described the alliances of Greeks and barbarians with the Athenians against Philip, and how the weakness of their allies urged the Athenians to seek help from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. A short time before, the Romans had sent a force ostensibly to help the Aetolians against Philip, but really more to spy on the condition of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the appeal of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the Romans despatched an army under Otilius, to give him the name by which he was best known. For the Romans differ from the Greeks in their being called, not by the names of their fathers, but by three names at least, if not more, given to each man. Otilius had received orders from the Romans to protect Athenians and Aetolians from war with Philip.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Otilius carried out his orders up to a point, but displeased the Romans in certain of his acts. Hestiaea in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and Anticyra in Phocis, which had been compelled to submit to Philip, he utterly destroyed. It was, I think, for this reason that the senate, when they heard the news, sent Flamininus to succeed Otilius in his command.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On his arrival Flamininus sacked <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>, defeating the Macedonians who were defending it. He then marched against <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, which was held by Philip with a garrison, and sat down to besiege it, while at the same time he sent to the Achaeans and bade them come to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> with an army, if they desired to be called allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and at the same time to show their goodwill to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the Achaeans greatly blamed Flamininus himself, and Otilius before him, for their savage treatment of ancient Greek cities which had done the Romans no harm, and were subject to the Macedonians against their will. They foresaw too that the Romans were coming to impose their domination both on Achaeans and on the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, merely in fact to take the place of Philip and the Macedonians. At the meeting of the League many opposite views were put forward, but at last the Roman party prevailed, and the Achaeans joined Flamininus in besieging <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On being delivered from the Macedonians the Corinthians at once joined the Achaean League; they had joined it on a previous occasion, when the Sicyonians under Aratus drove all the garrison out of Acrocorinth, killing Persaeus, who had been placed in command of the garrison by Antigonus. Hereafter the Achaeans were called allies of the Romans, and in all respects right zealous allies they proved themselves to be. They followed the Romans to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> against Philip; they took part in the campaign against the Aetolians; thirdly they fought side by side with the Romans against the Syrians under Antiochus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All that the Achaeans did against the Macedonians or the host of the Syrians they did because of their friendship to the Romans; but against the Aetolians they had a long standing private quarrel to settle. When the tyranny of Nabis in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> was put down, a tyranny marked by extreme ferocity, the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> at once caught the attention of the Achaeans.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At this time the Achaeans brought the Lacedaemonians into the Achaean confederacy, exacted from them the strictest justice, and razed the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to the ground. These had been built at haphazard at the time of the invasion of Demetrius, and afterwards of the Epeirots under Pyrrhus, but under the tyranny of Nabis they had been strengthened to the greatest possible degree of safety. So the Achaeans destroyed the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and also repealed the laws of Lycurgus that dealt with the training of the youths, at the same time ordering the youths to be trained after the Achaean method.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I shall treat of this more fully in my account of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 8.51">Paus. 8.51</bibl>.</note> The Lacedaemonians, deeply offended by the ordinances of the Achaeans, fled to Metellus and the other commissioners who had come from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. They had come, not at all to bring war upon Philip and the Macedonians, as peace had already been made between Philip and the Romans, but to judge the charges brought against Philip by the Thessalians and certain Epeirots.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In actual fact Philip himself and the Macedonian ascendancy had been put down by the Romans; Philip fighting against the Romans under Flamininus was worsted at the place called Dog's Heads<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0197">197 B.C.</date></note>, where in spite of his desperate efforts Philip was so severely defeated in the encounter that he lost the greater part of his army and agreed with the Romans to evacuate all the cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> that he had captured and forced to submit.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By prayers of all sorts, however, and by vast expenditure he secured from the Romans a nominal peace. The history of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, the power she won under Philip the son of Amyntas, and her fall under the later Philip, were foretold by the inspired Sibyl.

</div>

<div n="9" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the occasion to which I referred Metellus and the other commissioners resolved not to overlook the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, and asked the officers of the League to summon the Achaeans to a meeting, so that they might receive all together instructions to be gentler in their treatment of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>. The officers replied that they would call a meeting of the Achaeans neither for them nor for anyone else who had not a decree of the Roman senate approving the proposal for which the assembly was to be held. Metellus and his colleagues, thinking that the conduct of the Achaeans was very insolent, on their arrival at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> made before the senate many accusations against the Achaeans, not all of which were true.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>More accusations still against the Achaeans were made by Areus and Alcibiadas, Lacedaemonians of great distinction at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> but ungrateful to the Achaeans. For the Achaeans gave them a welcome when exiled by Nabis, and on the tyrant's death restored them to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> against the will of the Lacedaemonian people. On this occasion, therefore, they too arose and attacked the Achaeans with great vehemence before the senate; accordingly, the Achaeans, at a meeting of their League, passed sentence of death upon them.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Roman senate sent Appius and other commissioners to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans. The mere sight of Appius and his colleagues was sure to be displeasing to the Achaeans, for they brought with them Areus and Alcibiadas, detested by the Achaeans at that time beyond all other men. The commissioners vexed the Achaeans yet more when they came to the assembly and delivered speeches more angry than conciliatory.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Lycortas of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, than whom no man was more highly esteemed among the Arcadians, and whose friendship with Philopoemen had given him something of his spirit, set forth the case for the Achaeans in a speech suggesting that the Romans were somewhat to blame. But Appius and his colleagues greeted the speech of Lycortas with jeers, acquitted Areus and Alcibiadas of any offence against the Achaeans, and permitted the Lacedaemonians to send an embassy to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Such permission was a contravention of the agreement between the Romans and the Achaeans, which allowed the Achaeans as a body to send a deputation to the Roman senate but forbade any city of the Achaean League to send a deputation privately.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A deputation of the Achaeans was sent to oppose the Lacedaemonians, and after speeches had been delivered by both sides before the senate, the Romans again despatched the same commissioners, Appius and his former colleagues in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans. This commission restored to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> those whom the Achaeans had exiled, and they remitted the penalties inflicted by the Achaeans on those who had fled before their trial and had been condemned in their absence. The Lacedaemonian connection with the Achaean League was not broken, but foreign courts were established to deal with capital charges; all other charges were to be submitted for judgment to the Achaean League. The circuit of the city walls was restored by the Spartans right from the foundations.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The restored Lacedaemonian exiles carried on various intrigues against the Achaeans, hoping to vex them most by the following plot. They persuaded to go up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the exiles of the Achaeans, along with the Messenians who had been held to be involved in the death of Philopoemen and banished on that account by the Achaeans. Going up with them to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> they intrigued for the restoration of the exiles. As Appius was a zealous supporter of the Lacedaemonians and opposed the Achaeans in everything, the plans of the Messenian and Achaean exiles were bound to enjoy an easy success. Despatches were at once sent by the senate to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, with instructions to bring back the Messenians and Achaeans to their homes.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This caused the greatest vexation to the Achaeans. They bethought themselves of the injustice they had suffered at the hands of the Romans, and how all their services had proved of no avail; to please the Romans they had made war against Philip, against the Aetolians and afterwards against Antiochus, and after all there was preferred before them a band of exiles, whose hands were stained with blood. Nevertheless, they decided to give way.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="10" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the events that took place on this occasion. The most impious of all crimes, the betrayal for private gain of fatherland and fellow-citizens, was destined to be the beginning of woes for the Achaeans as for others, for it has never been absent from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> since the birth of time. In the reign of Dareius, the son of Hystaspes, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0494">494 B.C.</date></note>, the cause of the Ionians was ruined because all the Samian captains except eleven betrayed the Ionian fleet.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After reducing <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> the Persians enslaved <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> also, the most famous citizens turning traitors, Philagrus, the son of Cyneas, and Euphorbus, the son of Alcimachua. When Xerxes invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note>, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> was betrayed by Aleuades,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Sylburg would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀλευαδῶν</foreign>, “by the Aleuads.”</note> and <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> by Attaginus and Timegenidas, who were the foremost citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. After the Peloponnesian war, Xenias of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> attempted to betray <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> to the Lacedaemonians under Agis,</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and the so-called “friends” of Lysander at no time relaxed their efforts to hand over their countries to him. In the reign of Philip, the son of Amyntas, <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> is the only Greek city to be found that was not betrayed; the other cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> were ruined more by treachery than they had been previously by the plague. Alexander, the son of Philip, was so favoured by fortune that he had little need worth mentioning of traitors.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when the Greeks suffered defeat at <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0322">322 B.C.</date></note>, Antipater, in his eagerness to cross over to the war in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, wished to patch up a peace quickly, and it mattered nothing to him if he left free <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. But Demades and the other traitors at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> persuaded Antipater to have no kindly thoughts towards the Greeks, and by frightening the Athenian people were the cause of Macedonian garrisons being brought into <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and most other cities.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>My statement is confirmed by the following fact. The Athenians after the disaster in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> did not become subjects of Philip, although they lost two thousand prisoners in the action and one thousand killed. But when about two hundred at most fell at <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName> they were enslaved by the Lacedaemonians. So the plague of treachery never failed to afflict <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and it was an Achaean, Callicrates, who at the time I speak of made the Achaeans completely subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. But the beginning of their troubles proved to be Perseus and the destruction by the Romans of the Macedonian empire.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Perseus, the son of Philip, who was at peace with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in accordance with a treaty his father Philip had made, resolved to break the oaths, and leading an army against the Sapaeans and their king Abrupolis, allies of the Romans, made their country desolate. These Sapaeans Archilochus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Fr. 49 (Bergk).</note> mentions in an iambic line.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Macedonians and Perseus were conquered because of this wrong done to the Sapaeans, and afterwards ten Roman senators were sent to arrange the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> in the best interests of the Romans. When they came to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, Callicrates curried favour with them, no form of flattery, whether in word or in deed, being too gross for him to use. One member of the commission, a most dishonorable man, Callicrates so captivated that he actually persuaded him to attend the meeting of the Achaean League.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When he entered the assembly he declared that while Perseus was at war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the most influential Achaeans, besides helping him generally, had supplied him with money. So he required the Achaeans to condemn them to death. After their condemnation, he said, he would himself disclose the names of the culprits. His words were regarded as absolutely unfair, and the members present demanded that, if certain Achaeans had sided with Perseus, their individual names should be mentioned, it being unreasonable to condemn them before this was done.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thereupon the Roman, as he was getting the worst of the argument, brazenly asserted that every Achaean who had held the office of general was included in his accusation, since one and all had favoured the cause of the Macedonians and Perseus. This he said at the bidding of Callicrates. After him rose Xenon, a man of great repute among the Achaeans, and said “The truth about this accusation is as follows. I myself have served the Achaeans as their general, but I am guilty neither of treachery to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> nor of friendship to Perseus. I am therefore ready to submit to trial either before the Achaean diet or before the Romans themselves.” This frank speech was prompted by a clear conscience,</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but the Roman at once grasped the pretext, and sent for trial before the Roman court all those whom Callicrates accused of supporting Perseus. Never before had Greeks been so treated, for not even the most powerful of the Macedonians, Philip, the son of Amyntas, and Alexander, despatched by force to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> the Greeks who were opposed to them, but allowed them to plead their case before the Amphictyons<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0167">167 B.C.</date></note>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But on this occasion it was decided to send up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> every one of the Achaean people, however innocent, whom Callicrates chose to accuse. They amounted to over a thousand men. The Romans, holding that all these had already been condemned by the Achaeans, distributed them throughout Etruria and its cities, and though the Achaeans sent embassy after embassy to plead on behalf of the men, no notice was taken of the petitions.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Sixteen years later<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0151">151 B.C.</date></note>, when the number of Achaeans in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was reduced to three hundred at most, the Romans set them free, considering that their punishment was sufficient. But those who ran away, either at once when they were being brought up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or later on from the cities to which the Romans sent them, were saved from punishment by no defence if they were recaptured.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="11" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Romans again despatched a senator to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. His name was Gallus, and his instructions were to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Argives in the case of a disputed piece of territory. This Gallus on many occasions behaved towards the Greek race with great arrogance, both in word and deed, while he made a complete mock of the Lacedaemonians and Argives.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These states had reached the highest degree of renown, and in a famous war of old had poured out their blood like water because of a dispute about boundaries, while later Philip, the son of Amyntas, had acted as arbitrator to settle their differences; yet now Gallus disdained to arbitrate in person, and entrusted the decision to Callicrates, the most abominable wretch in all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There also came to Gallus the Aetolians living at <placeName key="perseus,Pleuron">Pleuron</placeName>, who wished to detach themselves from the Achaean confederacy. Gallus allowed them to send on their own an embassy to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the Romans allowed them to secede from the Achaean League. The senate also commissioned Gallus to separate from the Achaean confederacy as many states as he could.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While he was carrying out his instructions, the Athenian populace sacked Oropus, a state subject to them. The act was one of necessity rather than of free-will, as the Athenians at the time suffered the direst poverty, because the Macedonian war had crushed them more than any other Greeks. So the Oropians appealed to the Roman senate. It decided that an injustice had been committed, and instructed the Sicyonians to inflict a fine on the Athenians commensurate with the unprovoked harm done by them to Oropus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Athenians did not appear in time for the trial, the Sicyonians inflicted on them a fine of five hundred talents, which the Roman senate on the appeal of the Athenians remitted with the exception of one hundred talents. Not even this reduced fine did the Athenians pay, but by promises and bribes they beguiled the Oropians into an agreement that an Athenian garrison should enter Oropus, and that the Athenians should take hostages from the Oropians. If in the future the Oropians should have any complaint to make against the Athenians, then the Athenians were to withdraw their garrison from Oropus and give the hostages back again.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After no long interval the Oropians were wronged by certain of the garrison. They accordingly despatched envoys to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to ask for the restoration of their hostages and to request that the garrison be withdrawn according to the agreement. The Athenians refused to do either of these things, saying that the blame lay, not with the Athenian people, but with the men of the garrison. They promised, however, that the culprits should he brought to account.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Oropians then appealed to the Achaeans for aid, but these refused to give it out of friendship and respect for the Athenians. Thereupon the Oropians promised Menalcidas, a Lacedaemonian who was then general of the Achaeans, a gift of ten talents if he would induce the Achaeans to help them. Menalcidas promised half of the money to Callicrates, who on account of his friendship with the Romans had most influence among the Achaeans.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Callicrates was persuaded to adopt the plan of Menalcidas, and it was decided to help the Oropians against the Athenians. News of this was brought to the Athenians, who, with all the speed each could, came to Oropus, again dragged away anything they had overlooked in the previous raids, and brought away the garrison. As the Achaeans were too late to render help, Menalcidas and Callicrates urged them to invade <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. But they met with opposition, especially from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, and the army withdrew.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="12" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Though the Oropians had received no help from the Achaeans, nevertheless Menalcidas extorted the money from them. But when he had the bribe in his hands, he began to think it hard luck that he had to share his gains with Callicrates. At first he had recourse to procrastination and deceit about payment, but shortly he plucked up courage and flatly refused to give anything.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It confirms the truth of the proverb that one fire burns more fiercely than another, one wolf is more savage than other wolves, one hawk swifter than another, that Menalcidas outdid in treachery Callicrates, the worst rascal of his time, one who could never resist a bribe of any kind. He fell foul of the Athenians without gaining anything, and, when Menalcidas laid down his office, accused him before the Achaeans on a capital charge. He said that Menalcidas, when on an embassy to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, had worked against the Achaeans and had done all he could to separate <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> from the Achaean League.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Thereupon, as the danger he ran was extreme, Menalcidas gave three of the talents he received from Oropus to Diaeus of Megalopolis, who had succeeded him as general of the Achaeans, and on this occasion was so active, because of the bribe, that he succeeded in saving Menalcidas in spite of the opposition of the Achaeans. The Achaeans, individually and as a body, held Diaeus responsible for the acquittal of Menalcidas, but he distracted their attention from the charges made against him by directing it towards more ambitious hopes, using to deceive them the following pretext.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians appealed to the Roman senate about a disputed territory, and the senate replied to the appeal by decreeing that all except capital cases should be under the jurisdiction of the Achaean League. Such was the senate's answer, but Diaeus did not tell the Achaeans the truth, but cajoled them by the declaration that the Roman senate had committed to them the right to condemn a Spartan to death.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the Achaeans claimed the right to try a Lacedaemonian on a capital charge, but the Lacedaemonians would not admit that Diaeus spoke the truth, and wished to refer the point to the Roman senate. But the Achaeans seized another pretext, that no state belonging to the Achaean League had the right to send an embassy on its own to the Roman senate, but only in conjunction with the rest of the League.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These disputes were the cause of a war between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, and the former, realizing that they were not a match for their opponents, sent envoys to their cities and entered into personal negotiations with Diaeus. The cities all made the same reply, that it was unlawful to turn a deaf ear to their general when he proclaimed a campaign; for Diaeus, who was in command of the Achaeans, declared that he would march to make war, not on <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> but on those that were troubling her.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Spartan senate inquired how many he considered were guilty, he reported to them the names of twenty-four citizens of the very front rank in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. Thereupon was carried a motion of Agasisthenes, whose advice on this occasion enhanced the already great reputation he enjoyed. He bade the twenty-four to go into voluntary exile from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, instead of bringing war upon <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> by remaining where they were; if they exiled themselves to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he declared, they would before long be restored to their country by the Romans.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they departed, underwent a nominal trial at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and were condemned to death. The Achaeans on their side despatched to Rome Callicrates and Diaeus to oppose the exiles from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> before the senate. Callicrates died of disease on the journey, and even if he had reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> I do not know that he would have been of any assistance to the Achaeans—perhaps he would have been the cause of greater troubles. The debate between Diaeus and Menalcidas before the senate was marked by fluency rather than by decency on either side.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The answer of the senate to their remarks was that they were sending envoys to settle the disputes between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans. The journey of the envoys from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> proved rather slow, giving Diaeus a fresh opportunity of deceiving the Achaeans and Menalcidas of deceiving the Lacedaemonians. Diaeus misled the Achaeans into the belief that the Roman senate had decreed the complete subjection to them of the Lacedaemonians; Menalcidas deceived the Lacedaemonians into thinking that the Romans had entirely freed them from the Achaean League.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="13" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the result of the debate was that the Achaeans again came near to actual war with the Lacedaemonians, and Damocritus, who had been elected general of the Achaeans at this time, proceeded to mobilize an army against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. But about this time there arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> a Roman force under Metellus, whose object was to put down the rebellion of Andriscus, the son of Perseus, the son of Philip. The war in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, it turned out, was easily decided in favour of the Romans,</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but Metellus urged the envoys, sent by the Roman senate to settle the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, to parley with the chiefs of the Achaeans before making the crossing. They were to order them not to attack <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but to await the arrival from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> of the envoys sent for the purpose of arbitrating between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They delivered their instructions to the Achaeans under Damocritus when these had already begun a campaign against <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, and so, realizing that the Achaeans were set against their advice, proceeded on their way to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. The Lacedaemonians, with a spirit greater than their strength, took up arms, and sallied forth to defend their country. But they were soon crushed; a thousand of their bravest youths fell in the battle, and the rest of the soldiery fled towards the city with all the haste they could.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>If Damocritus had made a vigorous effort, the Achaeans could have dashed into the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> along with the fugitives from the field of battle. As it was, he at once recalled the Achaeans from the pursuit, and confined his future operations to raids and plunder, instead of prosecuting the siege with energy.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Damocritus withdrew his army, and the Achaeans sentenced him to pay a fine of fifty talents for his treachery. Being unable to pay, he left the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and went into exile. Diaeus, who was elected general after Damocritus, agreed, when Metellus sent another embassy, to involve the Lacedaemonians in no war, but to await the arrival of the arbitrators from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But he invented another trick to embarrass the Lacedaemonians. He induced the towns around <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to be friendly to the Achaeans, and even introduced garrisons into them, to be Achaean bases against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Lacedaemonians elected Menalcidas to be their general against Diaeus, and although they were utterly unprepared for war, being especially ill-provided with money, while in addition their land had remained unsown, he nevertheless dared to break the truce, and took by assault and sacked Iasus, a town on the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, but at that time subject to the Achaeans.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Having again stirred up war between Lacedaemonians and Achaeans he incurred blame at the hands of his countrymen, and, failing to find a way of escape for the Lacedaemonians from the peril that threatened them, he took his own life by poison. Such was the end of Menalcidas. At the time he was in command of the Lacedaemonians, and previously he had commanded the Achaeans. In the former office he proved a most stupid general, in the latter an unparalleled villain.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There also arrived in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> the envoys despatched from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, among them being Orestes. He invited to visit him the magistrates in each of the Greek cities, along with Diaeus. When they arrived at his lodging, he proceeded to disclose to them the whole story, that the Roman senate decreed that neither the Lacedaemonians nor yet <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> itself should belong to the Achaean League, and that <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, Heracleia by Mount Oeta and the Arcadian Orchomenus should be released from the Achaean confederacy. For they were not, he said, related at all to the Achaeans, and but late-comers to the League.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The magistrates of the Achaeans did not wait for Orestes to conclude, but while he was yet speaking ran out of the house and summoned the Achaeans to an assembly. When the Achaeans heard the decision of the Romans, they at once turned against the Spartans who happened to be then residing in <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and arrested every one, not only those whom they knew for certain to be Lacedaemonians, but also all those they suspected to be such from the cut of their hair, or because of their shoes, their clothes or even their names. Some of them, who succeeded in taking refuge in the lodging of Orestes, they actually attempted even from there to drag away by force.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Orestes and his colleagues tried to check their violence, reminding them that they were committing unprovoked acts of criminal insolence against the Romans. A few days afterwards the Achaeans shut up in prison the Lacedaemonians they held under arrest, but separated from them the foreigners and let them go. They also despatched to Rome Thearidas, with certain other members of the Achaean government. These set out, but meeting on the journey the Roman envoys who had been sent after Orestes to deal with the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, they too turned back.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the time came for Diaeus to relinquish his office, Critolaus was elected general by the Achaeans. This Critolaus was seized with a keen but utterly unthinking passion to make war against the Romans. The envoys from the Romans had by this time already arrived to adjudicate on the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, and Critolaus had a conference with them at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, being most unwilling to summon the Achaeans to meet them in a general assembly. However, in the hearing of the Romans he sent messengers with instructions to summon the deputies to the assembly, but privately he sent orders to the deputies of the various cities to absent themselves from the meeting.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the deputies did not attend, Critolaus showed very clearly how he was hoodwinking the Romans. He urged them to wait for another meeting of the Achaeans, to take place five months later, declaring that he would not confer with them without the general assembly of the Achaeans. When the envoys realized that they were being deceived, they departed for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> but Critolaus summoned a meeting of the Achaeans at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and persuaded them both to take up arms against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and also to declare war openly on <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For a king or state to undertake a war and be unlucky is due to the jealousy of some divinity rather than to the fault of the combatants; but audacity combined with weakness should be called madness rather than ill-luck. But it was such a combination that overthrew Critolaus and the Achaeans. The Achaeans were also encouraged by Pytheas, who at that time was Boeotarch at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and the Thebans promised to give enthusiastic support in the war.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Thebans had been sentenced, at the first ruling given by Metellus, to pay a fine for invading the territory of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> with an armed force; at the second to compensate the Euboeans for laying waste <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>; at the third to compensate the people of <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName> for ravaging their territory when the corn was ripe for harvest.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="15" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Romans, learning the news from the envoys sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and from the despatches of Metellus, decided that the Achaeans were in the wrong, and they ordered Mummius, the consul elected for that year, to lead a fleet with a land force against them. As soon as Metellus learned that Mummius and his army were coming<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The reading of the MSS., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφίκοιτο</foreign>, should mean “had arrived,” a meaning inconsistent with the end of the sentence. It seems likely, therefore, that Kayser's emendation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφίξοιτο</foreign>, is right.</note> to fight the Achaeans, he was full of enthusiasm to bring the war to a conclusion without help before Mummius reached <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So he despatched envoys to the Achaeans, bidding them release from the League the Lacedaemonians and the other states mentioned in the order of the Romans, promising that the Romans would entirely forgive them for their disobedience on the previous occasion. While making these proposals for peace he marched from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> through <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and along the gulf of <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName>. But Critolaus and the Achaeans would listen to no suggestions for an agreement, and sat down to besiege Heracleia, which refused to join the Achaean League.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then, when Critolaus was informed by his scouts that the Romans under Metellus had crossed the Spercheius, he fled to Scarpheia in <placeName key="tgn,7010899">Locris</placeName>, without daring even to draw up the Achaeans in the pass between Heracleia and <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, and to await Metellus there. To such a depth of terror did he sink that brighter hopes were not suggested even by the spot itself, the site of the Lacedaemonian effort to save <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0480">480 B.C.</date></note>, and of the no less glorious exploit of the Athenians against the Gauls<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0279">279 B.C.</date></note>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Critolaus and the Achaeans took to flight, but at a short distance from Scarpheia they were overtaken by the men of Metellus, who killed many and took about a thousand prisoners. Critolaus was neither seen alive after the battle nor found among the dead. If he dared to plunge into the marsh of the sea at the foot of Mount Oeta he must inevitably have sunk into the depths without leaving a trace to tell the tale.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the end of Critolaus offers a wide field for conjecture. A thousand picked troops of Arcadia, who had joined Critolaus in his enterprise, took the field and advanced as far as <placeName key="perseus,Elateia">Elateia</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, into which city they were received by the inhabitants on the ground of some supposed ancient connection between them. But when the Phocians heard of the disaster to Critolaus and the Achaeans, they ordered the Arcadians to depart from <placeName key="perseus,Elateia">Elateia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As they were retreating to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> the Romans under Metellus fell upon them near Chaeroneia. It was then that the vengeance of the Greek gods overtook the Arcadians, who were slain by the Romans on the very spot on which they had deserted from the Greeks who were struggling at Chaeroneia against the Macedonians under Philip.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Diaeus once more came forward to command the Achaean army. He proceeded to set free slaves, following the example of Miltiades and the Athenians before the battle of Marathon, and enlisted from the cities of the Achaeans and Arcadians those who were of military age. The muster, including the slaves, amounted roughly to six hundred cavalry and fourteen thousand foot.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And here Diaeus sank into utter folly. Although he knew that Critolaus and the whole force of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> had put up such a poor fight against Metellus, he nevertheless detached about four thousand, put them under the command of Alcamenes, and despatched them to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> to garrison the city, and to stay the advance of Metellus and the Romans, should they march that way.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the picked Arcadian troops had been overthrown near Chaeroneia, Metellus moved his army and marched against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, for the Thebans had joined the Achaeans in investing Heracleia, and had taken part in the engagement of Scarpheia. Then the inhabitants, of both sexes and of all ages, abandoned the city and wandered about <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, or took refuge on the tops of the mountains.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Metellus would not allow either the burning of sanctuaries of the gods or the destruction of buildings, and he forbade his men to kill any Theban or take prisoner any fugitive. If, however, Pytheas should be caught, he was to be brought before him. Pytheas was discovered immediately, brought before Metellus and punished. When the army approached <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>, Alcamenes and his men did not face it, but straightway fled to the camp of the Achaeans at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Megarians surrendered their city to the Romans without a blow, and when Metellus came to the Isthmus he again made overtures to the Achaeans for an agreed peace. For he was possessed of a strong desire to settle by himself the affairs of both <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>. His efforts, however, were thwarted by the senselessness of Diaeus.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="16" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Mummius, bringing with him Orestes, the commissioner sent earlier to deal with the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, reached the Roman army at early dawn, and sending Metellus and his forces to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, himself waited at the Isthmus for his whole force to assemble. There came three thousand five hundred cavalry, while the infantry amounted to twenty-three thousand. They were joined by a company of Cretan archers and by Philopoemen, at the head of some troops sent by Attalus from <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1121615">Caicus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Certain of the Italian troops along with the auxiliaries were stationed by Mummius twelve stades away, to be an outpost for the whole army. The contempt of the Romans made them keep a careless look-out, and the Achaeans, attacking them in the first watch, killed some, drove yet more back to the camp, and took some five hundred shields. Puffed up with this success the Achaeans marched out to battle before the Romans began their attack.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when Mummius advanced to meet them, the Achaean horse at once took to flight, without waiting for even the first charge of the Roman cavalry. The infantry were depressed at the rout of their horse, but nevertheless received the onslaught of the Roman men-at-arms; overwhelmed by numbers and faint with their wounds they offered a spirited resistance, until a thousand picked Romans fell upon their flank and utterly routed them.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>If after the battle Diaeus had boldly thrown himself into <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and received the fugitives within the walls, the Achaeans might have been able to get favorable terms from Mummius, by putting him to the trouble of a protracted siege. As it was, when the Achaeans were but beginning to yield, Diaeus fled straight for <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, his conduct towards the Achaeans showing a marked contrast to that of Callistratus, the son of Empedus, towards the Athenians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This man commanded some cavalry in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and when the Athenians and their partners in the expedition were being massacred at the river Asinarus, he courageously cut a way through the enemy at the head of his horsemen. He brought most of them safe to <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName>, and then returned by the same way back to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Finding the enemy still plundering the Athenian camp, he cut down some five of them, and then both he and his horse received mortal wounds and died.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So he won glory for the Athenians and for himself, by saving the men under his command and seeking his own death. But Diaeus having ruined the Achaeans came to tell the tidings of disaster to the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, killed his wife with his own hand, just to save her from being taken prisoner, and then committed suicide by drinking poison. He may be compared to Menalcidas for his avarice, and proved equally like him in the cowardice of his death.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As soon as night fell, the Achaeans who had escaped to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> after the battle fled from the city, and there fled with them most of the Corinthians themselves. At first Mummius hesitated to enter <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, although the gates were open, as he suspected that an ambush had been laid within the walls. But on the third day after the battle he proceeded to storm <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and to set it on fire.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The majority of those found in it were put to the sword by the Romans, but the women and children Mummius sold into slavery. He also sold all the slaves who had been set free, had fought on the side of the Achaeans, and had not fallen at once on the field of battle. The most admired votive offerings and works of art were carried off by Mummius; those of less account he gave to Philopoemen, the general sent by Attalus; even in my day there were Corinthian spoils at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The walls of all the cities that had made war against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> Mummius demolished, disarming the inhabitants, even before assistant commissioners were despatched from Rome, and when these did arrive, he proceeded to put down democracies and to establish governments based on a property qualification. Tribute was imposed on <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and those with property were forbidden to acquire possessions in a foreign country. Racial confederacies, whether of Achaeans, or Phocians, or Boeotians, or of any other Greek people, were one and all put down.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A few years later the Romans took pity on <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, restored the various old racial confederacies, with the right to acquire property in a foreign country, and remitted the fines imposed by Mummius.

The Lacedaemonians suffered injury through Epaminondas of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and again through the war with the Achaeans.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A little before the city of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> there is, on the right of the road, the grave of Sostratus. He was a native youth, loved they say by Heracles, who outliving Sostratus made him his tomb and gave him some hair from his head as a primal offering. Even today there is a slab on the top of the mound, with a figure of Heracles in relief. I was told that the natives also sacrifice to Sostratus as to a hero.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The people of Dyme have a temple of Athena with an extremely ancient image; they have as well a sanctuary built for the Dindymenian mother and Attis.

The account of Hermesianax goes on to say that, on growing up, Attis migrated to <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> and celebrated for the Lydians the orgies of the Mother; that he rose to such honor with her that Zeus, being wroth at it,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοῖς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἄττῃ</foreign>: “honor with them that Zeus, being wroth with him, sent, etc.”</note> sent a boar to destroy the tillage of the Lydians.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then certain Lydians, with Attis himself, were killed by the boar, and it is consistent with this that the Gauls who inhabit <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName> abstain from pork. But the current view about Attis is different, the local legend about him being this. Zeus, it is said, let fall in his sleep seed upon the ground, which in course of time sent up a demon, with two sexual organs, male and female. They call the demon Agdistis. But the gods, fearing<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">With <foreign xml:lang="grc">δήσαντες</foreign> the meaning is: “bound Agdistis and cut off.”</note> Agdistis, cut off the male organ.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There grew up from it an almond-tree with its fruit ripe, and a daughter of the river Sangarius, they say, took of the fruit and laid it in her bosom, when it at once disappeared, but she was with child. A boy was born, and exposed, but was tended by a he-goat. As he grew up his beauty was more than human, and Agdistis fell in love with him. When he had grown up, Attis was sent by his relatives to <placeName key="tgn,6004655">Pessinus</placeName>, that he might wed the king's daughter.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The marriage-song was being sung, when Agdistis appeared, and Attis went mad and cut off his genitals, as also did he who was giving him his daughter in marriage. But Agdistis repented of what he had done to Attis, and persuaded Zeus to grant that the body of Attis should neither rot at all nor decay.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These are the most popular forms of the legend of Attis. In the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> is also the grave of Oebotas the runner. Although this Oebotas was the first Achaean to win an Olympic victory, he yet received from them no special prize. Wherefore Oebotas pronounced a curse that no Achaean in future should win an Olympic victory. There must have been some god who was careful that the curse of Oebotas should be fulfilled, but the Achaeans by sending to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> at last learned why it was that they had been failing to win the Olympic crown.</p></div>

The poets who have sung of Heracles and his labours have found a favorite subject in Dexamenus, king of <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName>, and the entertainment Heracles received at his court. That <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName> was from the beginning a small town I find confirmed in an elegiac poem composed by Hermesianax about Eurytion the Centaur. In course of time, it is said, the inhabitants, owing to their weakness, left <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName> and migrated to Peirae and Euryteiae.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About eighty stades from the river Peirus is the city of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>. Not far from <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> the river Glaucus flows into the sea. The historians of ancient <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> say that it was an aboriginal, Eumelus, who first settled in the land, and that he was king over but a few subjects. But when Triptolemus came from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, he received from him cultivated corn, and, learning how to found a city, named it Aroe from the tilling of the soil.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is said that Triptolemus once fell asleep, and that then Antheias, the son of Eumelus, yoked the dragons to the car of Triptolemus and tried to sow the seed himself.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Between Antheia and Aroe was founded a third city, called Mesatis. The stories told of Dionysus by the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, that he was reared in Mesatis and incurred there all sob of perils through the plots of the Titans, I will not contradict, but will leave it to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> to explain the name Mesatis as they choose.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When afterwards the Achaeans had driven out the Ionians, Patreus, the son of Preugenes, the son of Agenor, forbade the Achaeans to settle in Antheia and Mesatis, but built at Aroe a wall of greater circumference so as to include Aroe within it, and named the city <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> after himself. Agenor, the father of Preugenes, was the son of Areus, the son of Ampyx, and Ampyx was a son of Pelias, the son of Aeginetes, the son of Dereites, the son of Harpalus, the son of Amyclas, the son of <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such was the genealogy of Patreus.

But suffering unspeakable disasters in the fighting, and most of them being also crushed by poverty, all with the exception of a few left <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, and scattered, owing to their love of agriculture, up and down the country, dwelling in, besides <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, the following towns: Mesatis, Antheia, Bolina, <placeName key="perseus,Argyra">Argyra</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1089708">Arba</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Augustus, for some reason, perhaps because he thought that <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> was a convenient port of call, brought back again to <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> the men from the other towns, and united with them the Achaeans also from Rhypes, which town he razed to the ground. He granted freedom to the Patraeans, and to no other Achaeans; and he granted also all the other privileges that the Romans are accustomed to bestow on their colonists.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the acropolis of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> is a sanctuary of Artemis Laphria. The surname of the goddess is a foreign one, and her image too was brought in from elsewhere. For after Calydon with the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> had been laid waste by the Emperor Augustus in order that the Aetolian people might be incorporated into <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName> above <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> thus secured the image of Laphria.</p></div>

It is said that the goddess was surnamed Laphria after a man of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, because the ancient image of Artemis was set up at Calydon by Laphrius, the son of Castalius, the son of Delphus.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Others say that the wrath of Artemis against Oeneus weighed as time went on more lightly ( elaphroteron) on the Calydonians, and they believe that this was why the goddess received her surname. The image represents her in the guise of a huntress; it is made of ivory and gold, and the artists were Menaechmus and Soldas of Naupactus, who, it is inferred, lived not much later than Canachus of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> and Callon of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Every year too the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> celebrate the festival Laphria in honor of their Artemis, and at it they employ a method of sacrifice peculiar to the place.

Just before the time of the festival they construct a smooth ascent to the altar, piling earth upon the altar steps.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The festival begins with a most splendid procession in honor of Artemis, and the maiden officiating as priestess rides last in the procession upon a car yoked to deer. It is, however, not till the next day that the sacrifice is offered, and the festival is not only a state function but also quite a popular general holiday. For the people throw alive upon the altar edible birds and every kind of victim as well; there are wild boars, deer and gazelles; some bring wolf-cubs or bear-cubs, others the full-grown beasts. They also place upon the altar fruit of cultivated trees.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next they set fire to the wood. At this point I have seen some of the beasts, including a bear, forcing their way outside at the first rush of the flames, some of them actually escaping by their strength.

<div n="19" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Between the temple of Laphria and the altar stands the tomb of Eurypylus. Who he was and for what reason he came to this land I shall set forth presently; but I must first describe what the condition of affairs was at his arrival. The Ionians who lived in Aroe, Antheia and Mesatis had in common a precinct and a temple of Artemis surnamed Triclaria, and in her honor the Ionians used to celebrate every year a festival and an all-night vigil. The priesthood of the goddess was held by a maiden until the time came for her to be sent to a husband.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the story is that once upon a time it happened that the priestess of the goddess was Comaetho, a most beautiful maiden, who had a lover called Melanippus, who was far better and handsomer than his fellows. When Melanippus had won the love of the maiden, he asked the father for his daughter's hand. It is somehow a characteristic of old age to oppose the young in most things, and especially is it insensible to the desires of lovers. So Melanippus found it; although both he and Comaetho were eager to wed, he met with nothing but harshness from both his own parents and from those of his lover.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The history of Melanippus, like that of many others, proved that love is apt both to break the laws of men and to desecrate the worship of the gods, seeing that this pair had their fill of the passion of love in the sanctuary of Artemis. And hereafter also were they to use the sanctuary as a bridal-chamber. Forthwith the wrath of Artemis began to destroy the inhabitants; the earth yielded no harvest, and strange diseases occurred of an unusually fatal character.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When they appealed to the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> the Pythian priestess accused Melanippus and Comaetho. The oracle ordered that they themselves should be sacrificed to Artemis, and that every year a sacrifice should be made to the goddess of the fairest youth and the fairest maiden. Because of this sacrifice the river flowing by the sanctuary of Triclaria was called Ameilichus ( relentless). Previously the river had no name.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The innocent youths and maidens who perished because of Melanippus and Comaetho suffered a piteous fate, as did also their relatives; but the pair, I hold, were exempt from suffering, for the one thing<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">With the reading of the MSS.: “for to man only is it worth one's life to be successful in love.”</note> that is worth a man's life is to be successful in love.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sacrifice to Artemis of human beings is said to have ceased in this way. An oracle had been given from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to the Patraeans even before this, to the effect that a strange king would come to the land, bringing with him a strange divinity, and this king would put an end to the sacrifice to Triclaria. When <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was captured, and the Greeks divided the spoils, Eurypylus the son of Euaemon got a chest. In it was an image of Dionysus, the work, so they say, of Hephaestus, and given as a gift by Zeus to Dardanus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But there are two other accounts of it. One is that this chest was left by Aeneas when he fled; the other that it was thrown away by Cassandra to be a curse to the Greek who found it. Be this as it may, Eurypylus opened the chest, saw the image, and forthwith on seeing it went mad. He continued to be insane for the greater part of the time, with rare lucid intervals. Being in this condition he did not proceed on his voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, but made for the town and gulf of Cirrha. Going up to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> he inquired of the oracle about his illness.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that the oracle given him was to the effect that where he should come across a people offering a strange sacrifice, there he was to set down the chest and make his home. Now the ships of Eurypylus were carried down by the wind to the sea off Aroe. On landing he came across a youth and a maiden who had been brought to the altar of Triclaria. So Eurypylus found it easy to understand about the sacrifice, while the people of the place remembered their oracle seeing a king whom they had never seen before, they also suspected that the chest had some god inside it.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And so the malady of Eurypylus and the sacrifice of these people came to an end, and the river was given its present name Meilichus. Certain writers have said that the events I have related happened not to the Thessalian Eurypylus, but to Eurypylus the son of Dexamenus who was king in <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName>, holding that this man joined Heracles in his campaign against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and received the chest from Heracles. The rest of their story is the same as mine.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But I cannot bring myself to believe that Heracles did not know the facts about the chest, if they were as described, nor, if he were aware of them, do I think that he would ever have given it to an ally as a gift. Further, the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> have no tradition of a Eurypylus save the son of Euaemon, and to him every year they sacrifice as to a hero, when they celebrate the festival in honor of Dionysus.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="20" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The surname of the god inside the chest is Aesymnetes ( Dictator), and his chief attendants are nine men, elected by the people from all the citizens for their reputation, and women equal in number to the men. On one night of the festival the priest carries the chest outside. Now this is a privilege that this night has received, and there go down to the river Meilichus a certain number of the native children, wearing on their heads garlands of corn-ears. It was in this way that they used to array of old those whom they led to be sacrificed to Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But at the present day they lay aside the garlands of corn-ears by the goddess, and after bathing in the river and putting on fresh garlands, this time made of ivy, they go to the sanctuary of the Dictator. This then is their established ritual, and within the precincts of Laphria is a temple of Athena surnamed Panachaean. The image is of ivory and gold.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the way to the lower city there is a sanctuary of the Dindymenian Mother, and in it Attis too is worshipped. Of him they have no image to show; that of the Mother is of stone. In the marketplace is a temple of Olympian Zeus; the god himself is on a throne with Athena standing by it. Beyond the Olympian is an image of Hera and a sanctuary of Apollo. The god is of bronze, and naked. On his feet are sandals, and one foot stands upon the skull of an ox.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That Apollo takes great pleasure in oxen is shown by Alcaeus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Alcaeus Fr. 7 (Bergk).</note> in his hymn to Hermes, who writes how Hermes stole cows of Apollo, and even before Alcaeus was born Homer made Apollo tend cows of Laomedon for a wage.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next to the market-place is the Music Hall, where has been dedicated an Apollo well worth seeing. It was made from the spoils taken when alone of the Achaeans the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> helped the Aetolians against the army of the Gauls.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you leave the market-place of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, where the sanctuary of Apollo is, at this exit is a gate, upon which stand gilt statues, Patreus, Preugenes, and Atherion; the two latter are represented as boys, because Patreus is a boy in age. Opposite the marketplace by this exit is a precinct and temple of Artemis, the Lady of the Lake.</p></div>

The image from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> is usually kept at Mesoa, because it was to this place that it was originally brought by Preugenes.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near this precinct the people of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> have other sanctuaries.

Before the sanctuary of Athena is the tomb of Preugenes. Every year they sacrifice to Preugenes as to a hero, and likewise to Patreus also, when the festival of our Lady is being held. Not far from the theater is a temple of Nemesis, and another of Aphrodite. The images are colossal and of white marble.</p></div>

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this part of the city is also a sanctuary of Dionysus surnamed Calydonian, for the image of Dionysus too was brought from Calydon. When Calydon was still inhabited, among the Calydonians who became priests of the god was Coresus, who more than any other man suffered cruel wrongs because of love. He was in love with Callirhoe, a maiden. But the love of Coresus for Callirhoe was equalled by the maiden's hatred of him.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the maiden refused to change her mind, in spite of the many prayers and promises of Coresus, he then went as a suppliant to the image of Dionysus. The god listened to the prayer of his priest, and the Calydonians at once became raving as though through drink, and they were still out of their minds when death overtook them. So they appealed to the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>. For the inhabitants of this part of the mainland, the Aetolians and their Acarnanian and Epeirot neighbors, considered that the truest oracles were the doves and the responses from the oak.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On this occasion the oracles from <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> declared that it was the wrath of Dionysus that caused the plague, which would not cease until Coresus sacrificed to Dionysus either Callirhoe herself or one who had the courage to die in her stead. When the maiden could find no means of escape, she next appealed to her foster parents. These too failing her, there was no other way except for her to be put to the sword.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When everything had been prepared for the sacrifice according to the oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>, the maiden was led like a victim to the altar.

He thus proved in deed that his love was more genuine than that of any other man we know.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Callirhoe saw Goresus lying dead, the maiden repented.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near to the theater there is a precinct sacred to a native lady. Here are images of Dionysus, equal in number to the ancient cities, and named after them Mesateus, Antheus and Aroeus.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go lower down from the Dictator there is another sanctuary with an image of stone.

Besides the names given by poets to Poseidon to adorn their verses, and in addition to his local names, all men give him the following surnames—Marine, Giver of Safety, God of Horses.</p></div>
    <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Various reasons could be plausibly assigned for the last of these surnames having been given to the god, but my own conjecture is that he got this name as the inventor of horsemanship. Homer, at any rate, when describing the chariot-race, puts into the mouth of Menelaus a challenge to swear an oath by this god:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Touch the horses, and swear by the earth-holder, earth-shaker,</l><l>That thou didst not intentionally, through guile, obstruct my chariot.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

One of the two images was drawn up by fishermen in a net a generation before my time. There are also quite near to the harbor two images of bronze, one of Ares and the other of Poseidon. The image of Aphrodite, whose precinct too is by the harbor, has its face, hands and feet of stone, while the rest of the figure is made of wood.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They have also a grove by the sea, affording in summer weather very agreeable walks and a pleasant means generally of passing the time. In this grove are also two temples of divinities, one of Apollo, the other of Aphrodite. The images of these too are made of stone. Next to the grove is a sanctuary of Demeter; she and her daughter are standing, but the image of Earth is seated.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before the sanctuary of Demeter is a spring. On the side of this towards the temple stands a wall of stones, while on the outer side has been made a descent to the spring. Here there is an infallible oracle, not indeed for everything, but only in the case of sick folk. They tie a mirror to a fine cord and let it down, judging the distance so that it does not sink deep into the spring, but just far enough to touch the water with its rim.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, possibly “disk.” The round mirror might be lowered vertically or horizontally (face upwards).</note> Then they pray to the goddess and burn incense, after which they look into the mirror, which shows them the patient either alive or dead.</p></div>

By the grove in <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> are also two sanctuaries of Serapis. In one is the tomb of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, the son of Belus.

Near to Pharae runs the river Pierus, which in my opinion is the same as the one flowing past the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName>, called by the men of the coast the Peirus. Near the river is a grove of plane-trees, most of which are hollow through age, and so huge that they actually feast in the holes, and those who have a mind to do so sleep there as well.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The market-place of Pharae is of wide extent after the ancient fashion, and in the middle of it is an image of Hermes, made of stone and bearded. Standing right on the earth, it is of square shape, and of no great size. On it is an inscription, saying that it was dedicated by Simylus the Messenian. It is called Hermes of the Market, and by it is established an oracle. In front of the image is placed a hearth, which also is of stone, and to the hearth bronze lamps are fastened with lead.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Coming at eventide, the inquirer of the god, having burnt incense upon the hearth, filled the lamps with oil and lighted them, puts on the altar on the right of the image a local coin, called a “copper,” and asks in the ear of the god the particular question he wishes to put to him. After that he stops his ears and leaves the marketplace. On coming outside he takes his hands from his ears, and whatever utterance he hears he considers oracular.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a similar method of divination practised at the sanctuary of Apis in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. At Pharae there is also a water sacred to Hermes. The name of the spring is Hermes' stream, and the fish in it are not caught, being considered sacred to the god. Quite close to the image stand square stones, about thirty in number. These the people of Pharae adore, calling each by the name of some god. At a more remote period all the Greeks alike worshipped uncarved stones instead of images of the gods.</p></div>

The flocks and herds that drink of this river in spring are bound to have male young ones for the most part, and for this reason the herdsmen remove all except the cows to another part of the country. The cows they leave behind by the river, because for sacrifices and for agriculture bulls are more suitable than cows, but in the case of other cattle the females are preferred.</p></div>

The local legend about Selemnus is that he was a handsome lad who used to feed his flocks here. <placeName key="perseus,Argyra">Argyra</placeName>, they say, was a sea-nymph, who fell in love with Selemnus and used to come up out of the sea to visit him, sleeping by his side.</p></div>

As Selemnus continued to love <placeName key="perseus,Argyra">Argyra</placeName> even when he was turned into water, just as Alpheius in the legend continued to love Arethusa, Aphrodite bestowed on him a further gift, by blotting out the memory of <placeName key="perseus,Argyra">Argyra</placeName>.</p></div>

Next to it a cape juts out into the sea, and of it is told a story how Cronus threw into the sea here the sickle with which he mutilated his father Uranus.

There is also in the market-place a precinct of Zeus surnamed Saviour, with two images, both of bronze, on the left as you go in; the one without a beard seemed to me the more ancient.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In a building right in front of the entrance are images, of bronze like the others, representing Poseidon, Heracles, Zeus and Athena.

But bethinking themselves of a trick they sacrificed a vast number of animals, but the victims they ate up at public feasts, so that they were not put to any expense.

But later on the Achaeans of the place removed some suppliants from the sanctuary and killed them.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Warnings, usually the same in all cases, are wont to be sent by the god before violent and far-reaching earthquakes.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Springs of water generally dry up; blasts of wind sometimes swoop upon the land and overturn the trees; occasionally great flames dart across the sky; the shapes of stars too appear such as have never been witnessed before, producing consternation in those that witness them; furthermore there is a violent rumbling of winds beneath the earth—these and many other warnings is the god wont to send before violent earthquakes occur.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The shock itself is not of one fixed type, but the original inquirers into such matters and their pupils have been able to discover the following forms of earthquake.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In this form of' earthquake pillars may be seen righting themselves which have been almost entirely uprooted, split walls coming together to their original position; beams, dislocated by the shock, go back to their places, and likewise channels, and such-like means of furthering the flow of water, have their cracks cemented better than they could be by human craftsmen. Now the second form of earthquake brings destruction to anything liable to it, and it throws over at once, as it were by a battering-ram, whatever meets the force of its impact.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most destructive kind of earthquake the experts are wont to liken to the symptoms of a man suffering from a non-intermittent fever, the breathing of such a patient being rapid and laboured.

It is this sort of shock alone that leaves no trace on the ground that men ever dwelt there.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This was the type of earthquake, they say, that on the occasion referred to levelled Helice to the ground, and that it was accompanied by another disaster in the season of winter.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In Ceryneia is a sanctuary of the Eumenides, which they say was established by Orestes. Whosoever enters with the desire to see the sights, if he be guilty of bloodshed, defilement or impiety, is said at once to become insane with fright, and for this reason the right to enter is not given to all and sundry. The images made of wood . . . they are not very large in size, and at the entrance to the sanctuary are statues of women, made of stone and of artistic workmanship. The natives said that the women are portraits of the former priestesses of the Eumenides.</p></div>

It is said that the name was given to the city from a woman called <placeName key="perseus,Bura">Bura</placeName>, who was the daughter of Ion, son of Xuthus, and of Helice. When the god wiped off Helice from the face of the earth, <placeName key="perseus,Bura">Bura</placeName> too suffered a severe earthquake, so that not even the ancient images were left in the sanctuaries.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The only Burians to survive were those who chanced to be absent at the time, either on active service or for some other reason, and these became the second founders of Bura.

He too is surnamed Buraicus, and here one can divine by means of a tablet and dice. He who inquires of the god offers up a prayer in front of the image, and after the prayer he takes four dice, a plentiful supply of which are placed by Heracles, and throws them upon the table. For every figure made by the dice there is an explanation expressly written on the tablet.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">I am very uncertain about the meaning of this passage.  Frazer's note shows that divination by dice usually took the form of interpreting the sequences of numbers obtained by throwing several dice on to a board. This cannot be the meaning here, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα</foreign> can hardly denote a number on the face of a die, and in any case <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξήγησιν τοῦ σχήματος</foreign> must mean “explanation of the shape.” I have accordingly adopted the emendation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστραγάλων</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτηδες</foreign> seems to have no point. Frazer, reading apparently <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δὲ παντὶ ἀστραγάλῳ σχῆμά τι κ.τ.ἕ</foreign>, translates: “Each die has a certain figure marked upon it, and the meaning of each figure is explained on the tablet.”</note></p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The straight road from Helice to the Heracles is about thirty stades.

The river itself is called the Crathis, which is also the name of the mountain where the river has its source. From this Crathis the river too by <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> has been named.</p></div>

A hostile army of Sicyonians was about to invade their territory. As they thought themselves no match for the Sicyonians, they collected all the goats they had in the country, and gathering them together they tied torches to their horns, and when the night was far advanced they set the torches alight.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Sicyonians, suspecting that allies were coming to the help of the Hyperesians, and that the flames came from their fires, set off home again. The Hyperesians gave their city its present name of Aegeira from the goats ( aiges), and where the most beautiful goat, which led the others, crouched, they built a sanctuary of Artemis the Huntress, believing that the trick against the Sicyonians was an inspiration of Artemis.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The name Aegeira, however, did not supersede <placeName key="perseus,Hyperesia">Hyperesia</placeName> at once, just as even in my time there were still some who called Oreus in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> by its ancient name of Hestiaea. The sights of Aegeira worth recording include a sanctuary of Zeus with a sitting image of Pentelic marble, the work of Eucleides the Athenian. In this sanctuary there also stands an image of Athena. The face, hands and feet are of ivory, the rest is of wood, with ornamentation of gilt work and of colors.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a temple of Artemis, with an image of the modern style of workmanship. The priestess is a maiden, who holds office until she reaches the age to marry. There stands here too an ancient image, which the folk of Aegeira say is Iphigeneia, the daughter of Agamemnon. If they are correct, it is plain that the temple must have been built originally for Iphigeneia.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a sanctuary of Apollo; the sanctuary itself, with the sculptures on the pediments, are very old; the wooden image of the god also is old, the figure being nude and of colossal size. None of the inhabitants could give the name of the artist, but anyone who has already seen the Heracles at <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName> would be led to conjecture that the Apollo in Aegeira was also a work of the same artist, Laphaes the Phliasian.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are in a temple standing images of Asclepius, and elsewhere images of Serapis and of Isis, these too being of Pentelic marble.

His surviving brothers carried home the news of his death, and therefore in mourning for him his sisters are discarding their ornaments, and the natives call the father Sympathes, because even in the statue he is a piteous figure.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the way to the city, close up to it, is a temple of Athena, built of local stone, but the image is of ivory and gold.

The people of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> also say that a shrine of Athena sinks deep into the ground, that this shrine is under the pedestal of the image, and that the air from the shrine is damp, and consequently good for the ivory.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Above the temple of Athena is a grove, surrounded by a wall, of Artemis surnamed Saviour, by whom they swear their most solemn oaths. No man may enter the grove except the priests. These priests are natives, chosen chiefly because of their high birth. Opposite the grove of the Saviour is a sanctuary of Dionysus surnamed Torch. In his honor they celebrate a festival called the Feast of Torches, when they bring by night firebrands into the sanctuary, and set up bowls of wine throughout the whole city.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also at <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> a sanctuary of Apollo, the Strangers' God, and the image is made of bronze. They hold in honor of Apollo games that they call Theoxenia, with money as the prizes of victory, the competitors being the natives. Near the sanctuary of Apollo is a temple of Artemis, the goddess being represented in the attitude of shooting. In the market-place is built a tank, and for bathing they use rain-water, since for drinking there are a few springs beneath the city. The place where the springs are they name Glyceiae ( Sweet Springs).</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is an old gymnasium chiefly given up to the exercises of the youths.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Be this as it may, the people of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> hold Promachus in the highest honor.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> has also a sanctuary of Eileithyia, which is situated in the lesser portion of the city.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Arcadians say that Pelasgus was the first inhabitant of this land. It is natural to suppose that others accompanied Pelasgus, and that he was not by himself; for otherwise he would have been a king without any subjects to rule over. However, in stature and in prowess, in beauty and in wisdom, Pelasgus excelled his fellows, and for this reason, I think, he was chosen to be king by them. Asius the poet says of him:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">The godlike Pelasgus on the wooded mountains</l><l>Black earth gave up, that the race of mortals might exist.</l></quote><bibl>Asius, unknown location.</bibl></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pelasgus on becoming king invented huts that humans should not shiver, or be soaked by rain, or oppressed by heat. Moreover; he it was who first thought of coats of sheep-skins, such as poor folk still wear in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and Phocis. He too it was who checked the habit of eating green leaves, grasses, and roots always inedible and sometimes poisonous.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But he introduced as food the nuts of trees, not those of all trees but only the acorns of the edible oak. Some people have followed this diet so closely since the time of Pelasgus that even the Pythian priestess, when she forbade the Lacedaemonians to touch the land of the Arcadians, uttered the following verses:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">In <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> are many men who eat acorns,</l><l>Who will prevent you; though I do not grudge it you.</l></quote>It is said that it was in the reign of Pelasgus that the land was called Pelasgia.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="2" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lycaon the son of Pelasgus devised the following plans, which were more clever than those of his father. He founded the city Lycosura on Mount Lycaeus, gave to Zeus the surname Lycaeus and founded the Lycaean games. I hold that the Panathenian festival was not founded before the Lycaean. The early name for the former festival was the Athenian, which was changed to the Panathenian in the time of Theseus, because it was then established by the whole Athenian people gathered together in a single city.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Olympic games I leave out of the present account, because they are traced back to a time earlier than the human race, the story being that Cronus and Zeus wrestled there, and that the Curetes were the first to race at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>. My view is that Lycaon was contemporary with Cecrops, the king of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but that they were not equally wise in matters of religion.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For Cecrops was the first to name Zeus the Supreme god, and refused to sacrifice anything that had life in it, but burnt instead on the altar the national cakes which the Athenians still call pelanoi. But Lycaon brought a human baby to the altar of Lycaean Zeus, and sacrificed it, pouring out its blood upon the altar, and according to the legend immediately after the sacrifice he was changed from a man to a wolf (Lycos).</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I for my part believe this story; it has been a legend among the Arcadians from of old, and it has the additional merit of probability. For the men of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were guests of the gods, eating at the same board ;the good were openly honored by the gods, and sinners were openly visited with their wrath. Nay, in those days men were changed to gods, who down to the present day have honors paid to them—Aristaeus, Britomartis of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, Heracles the son of Alcmena, Amphiaraus the son of Oicles, and besides these Polydeuces and Castor.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So one might believe that Lycaon was turned into a beast, and Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, into a stone. But at the present time, when sin has grown to such a height and has been spreading over every land and every city, no longer do men turn into gods, except in the flattering words addressed to despots, and the wrath of the gods is reserved until the sinners have departed to the next world.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and even some that occur to-day, have been generally discredited because of the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance, that ever since the time of Lycaon a man has changed into a wolf at the sacrifice to Lycaean Zeus, but that the change is not for life; if, when he is a wolf, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes a man again, but if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Similarly too it is said that Niobe on Mount Sipylus sheds tears in the season of summer. I have also heard that the griffins have spots like the leopard, and that the Tritons speak with human voice, though others say that they blow through a shell that has been bored. Those who like to listen to the miraculous are themselves apt to add to the marvel, and so they ruin truth by mixing it with falsehood.</p></div>

Cities were founded by Trapezeus also, and by Daseatas, Macareus, Helisson, Acacus and Thocnus. The last founded Thocnia, and Acacus Acacesium.

He introduced the cultivation of crops, which he learned from Triptolemus, and taught men to make bread, to weave clothes, and other things besides, having learned the art of spinning from Adristas. After this king the land was called <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> instead of Pelasgia and its inhabitants Arcadians instead of Pelasgians.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>His wife, according to the legend, was no mortal woman but a Dryad nymph. For they used to call some nymphs Dryads, others Epimeliads, and others Naiads, and Homer in his poetry talks mostly of Naiad nymphs. This nymph they call Erato, and by her they say that Arcas had Azan, Apheidas and Elatus. Previously he had had Autolaus, an illegitimate son.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When his sons grew up, Arcas divided the land between them into three parts, and one district was named Azania after Azan; from Azania, it is said, settled the colonists who dwell about the cave in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> called Steunos and the river Pencalas. To Apheidas fell <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> and the land adjoining, and for this reason poets too call <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> “the lot of Apheidas.”</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Elatus got Mount Cyllene, which down to that time had received no name. Afterwards Elatus migrated to what is now called <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, helped the Phocians when hard pressed in war by the Phlegyans, and became the founder of the city <placeName key="perseus,Elateia">Elateia</placeName>. It is said that Azan had a son Cleitor, Apheidas a son Aleus, and that Elatus had five sons, Aepytus, Pereus, Cyllen, Ischys, and Stymphalus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the death of Axan, the son of Arcas, athletic contests were held for the first time; horse-races were certainly held, but I cannot speak positively about other contests. Now Cleitor the son of Azan dwelt in Lycosura, and was the most powerful of the kings, founding Cleitor, which he named after himself; Aleus held his father's portion.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the sons of Elatus, Cyllen gave his name to Mount Cyllene, and Stymphalus gave his to the spring and to the city Stymphalus near the spring.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cleitor, the son of Azan, had no children, and the sovereignty of the Arcadians devolved upon Aepytus, the son of Elatus. While out hunting, Aepytus was killed, not by any of the more powerful beasts, but by a seps that he failed to notice. This species of snake I have myself seen. It is like the smallest kind of adder, of the color of ash, with spots dotted here and there. It has a broad head and a narrow neck, a large belly and a short tail. This snake, like another called cerastes (“the horned snake”), walks with a sidelong motion, as do crabs.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After Aepytus Aleus came to the throne. For Agamedes and <placeName key="perseus,Gortys">Gortys</placeName>, the sons of Stymphalus, were three generations removed from Arcas, and Aleus, the son of Apheidas, two generations. Aleus built the old sanctuary in <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> of Athena Alea, and made <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> the capital of his kingdom. <placeName key="perseus,Gortys">Gortys</placeName> the son of Stymphalus founded the city <placeName key="perseus,Gortys">Gortys</placeName> on a river which is also called after him. The sons of Aleus were Lycurgus, Amphidamas and Cepheus; he also had a daughter Auge.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hecataeus says that this Auge used to have intercourse with Heracles when he came to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>. At last it was discovered that she had borne a child to Heracles, and Aleus, putting her with her infant son in a chest, sent them out to sea. She came to Teuthras, lord of the plain of the Caicus, who fell in love with her and married her. The tomb of Auge still exists at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> above the Calcus; it is a mound of earth surrounded by a basement of stone and surmounted by a figure of a naked woman in bronze.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the death of Aleus Lycurgus his son got the kingdom as being the eldest; he is notorious for killing, by treachery and riot in fair fight, a warrior called Areithous.

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Lycurgus outlived both his sons, and reached an extreme old age. On his death, Echemus, son of Aeropus, son of Cepheus, son of Aleus, became king of the Arcadians. In his time the Dorians, in their attempt to return to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> under the leadership of Hyllus, the son of Heracles, were defeated by the Achaeans at the Isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and Echemus killed Hyllus, who had challenged him to single combat. I have come to the conclusion that this is a more probable story than the one I gave before,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.41.2">Paus. 1.41.2</bibl>.</note> that on this occasion Orestes was king of the Achaeans, and that it was during his reign that Hyllus attempted to return to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. If the second account be accepted, it would appear that Timandra, the daughter of Tyndareus, married Echemus, who killed Hyllus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Agapenor, the son of Ancaeus, the son of Lycurgus, who was king after Echemus, led the Arcadians to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.

Up to that time the goddess had been worshipped by the Cyprians in the district called <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Golgi</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Afterwards Laodice, a descendant of Agapenor, sent to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> a robe as a gift for Athena Alea.

Aepytus, the son of Hippothous, succeeded his father to the throne, and Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, in obedience to an oracle of the Delphic Apollo, moved his home from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Aepytus was succeeded as king by his son Cypselus, and in his reign the Dorian expedition returned to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, not, as three generations before, across the Corinthian Isthmus, but by sea to the place called Rhium. Cypselus, learning about the expedition, married his daughter to the son of Aristomachus whom he found without a wife, and so winning over Cresphontes he himself and the Arcadians had nothing at all to fear.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Holaeas was the son of Cypselus, who, aided by the Heracleidae from <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, restored to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> his sister's son Aepytus. Holaeas had a son Bucolion, and he a son Phialus, who robbed Phigalus, the son of Lycaon, the founder of <placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phigalia</placeName>, of the honor of giving his name to the city; Phialus changed it to <placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phialia</placeName>, after his own name, but the change did not win universal acceptance.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the reign of Simus, the son of Phialus, the people of <placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phigalia</placeName> lost by fire the ancient wooden image of Black Demeter. This loss proved to be a sign that Simus himself also was soon to meet his end. Simus was succeeded as king by Pompus his son, in whose reign the Aeginetans made trading voyages as far as Cyllene, from which place they carried their cargoes up country on pack-animals to the Arcadians. In return for this Pompus honored the Arcadians greatly, and furthermore gave the name Aeginetes to his son out of friendship for the Aeginetans.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After Aeginetes his son Polymestor became king of the Arcadians, and it was then that Charillus and the Lacedaemonians for the first time invaded the land of <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> with an army.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Polymestor had no children, and Aechmis succeeded to the throne, who was the son of Briacas, and the nephew of Polymestor. For Briacas too was a son of Aeginetes, but younger than Polymestor. After Aechmis came to the throne occurred the war between the Lacedaemonians and the Messenians. The Arcadians had from the first been friendly to the Messenians, and on this occasion they openly fought against the Lacedaemonians on the side of Aristodemus, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Aristocrates, the son of Aechmis, may have been guilty of outrages against the Arcadians of his most impious acts, however, against the gods I have sure knowledge, and I will proceed to relate them.

Artemis Hymnia has been worshipped by all the Arcadians from the most remote period. At that time the office of priestess to the goddess was still always held by a girl who was a virgin.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The maiden persisted in resisting the advances of Aristocrates, but at last, when she had taken refuge in the sanctuary, she was outraged by him near the image of Artemis.

<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This man had a son Hicetas, and Hicetas had a son Aristocrates the second, named after his grandfather and also meeting with a death like his.

As members of the Achaean League the Arcadians were more enthusiastic than any other Greeks.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is a pass into <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> side in the direction of Hysiae and over Mount Parthenius into Tegean territory.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The second road is less broad than the other, and leads over Mount Artemisius.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The wrath of heaven was not late in visiting him; never in fact have we known it more speedy.

By Nestane there lies, on lower ground, about . . . itself too forming part of the Untilled Plain, and it is called the Dancing Floor of Maera. The road across the Untilled Plain is about ten stades. After crossing it you will descend, a little farther on, into another plain. On it, alongside the highway, is a well called Lamb.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following story is told by the Arcadians. When Rhea had given birth to Poseidon, she laid him in a flock for him to live there with the lambs, and the spring too received its name just because the lambs pastured around it. Rhea, it is said, declared to Cronus that she had given birth to a horse, and gave him a foal to swallow instead of the child, just as later she gave him in place of Zeus a stone wrapped up in swaddling clothes.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When I began to write my history I was inclined to count these legends as foolishness, but on getting as far as <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> I grew to hold a more thoughtful view of them, which is this. In the days of old those Greeks who were considered wise spoke their sayings not straight out but in riddles, and so the legends about Cronus I conjectured to be one sort of Greek wisdom. In matters of divinity, therefore, I shall adopt the received tradition.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The city of the Mantineans is about twelve stades farther away from this spring. Now there are plain indications that it was in another place that Mantineus the son of Lycaon founded his city, which even to-day is called Ptolis (City) by the Arcadians. From here, in obedience to an oracle, <placeName key="tgn,7001278">Antinoe</placeName>, the daughter of Cepheus, the son of Aleus, removed the inhabitants to the modern site, accepting as a guide for the pilgrimage a snake; the breed of snake is not recorded. It is for this reason that the river, which flows by the modern city, has received the name Ophis (Snake).</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>If we may base a conjecture on the verses of Homer, we are led to believe that this snake was a dragon. When in the list of ships he tells how the Greeks abandoned Philoctetes in <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> suffering from his wound, he does not style the water-serpent a snake. But the dragon that the eagle dropped among the Trojans he does call a snake. So it is likely that <placeName key="tgn,7001278">Antinoe</placeName>'s guide also was a dragon.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.723">Hom. Il. 2.723</bibl> and <bibl n="Hom.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Mantineans did not fight on the side of the other Arcadians against the Lacedaemonians at Dipaea, but in the Peloponnesian war they rose with the Eleans against the Lacedaemonians,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0418">418 B.C</date></note> and joined in battle with them after the arrival of reinforcements from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Later on a Lacedaemonian army under Agesipolis, the son of Pausanias, invaded their territory. Agesipolis was victorious in the battle and shut up the Mantineans within their walls, capturing the city shortly after. He did not take it by storm, but turned the river Ophis against its fortifications, which were made of unburnt brick.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now against the blows of engines brick brings greater security than fortifications built of stone. For stones break and are dislodged from their fittings; brick, however, does not suffer so much from engines, but it crumbles under the action of water just as wax is melted by the sun.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This method of demolishing the fortifications of the Mantineans was not discovered by Agesipolis. It was a stratagem invented at an earlier date by Cimon, the son of Miltiades, when he was besieging <placeName key="tgn,1038583">Boges</placeName> and the other Persians who were holding <placeName key="perseus,Eion">Eion</placeName> on the Strymon.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0476">476</date> or <date when="-0477">477 B.C</date></note> Agesipolis only copied an established custom, and one celebrated among the Greeks. After taking <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>, he left a small part of it inhabited, but by far the greater part he razed to the ground, settling the inhabitants in villages.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Fate decreed that the Thebans should restore the Mantineans from the villages to their own country after the engagement at Leuctra,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0371">371 B.C</date></note> but when restored they proved far from grateful. They were caught treating with the Lacedaemonians and intriguing for a peace with them privately without reference to the rest of the Arcadian people. So through their fear of the Thebans they openly changed sides and joined the Lacedaemonian confederacy, and when the battle took place at <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> between the Lacedaemonians and the Thebans under Epaminondas,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0362">362 B.C</date></note> the Mantineans joined the ranks of the Lacedaemonians.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Subsequently the Mantineans quarrelled with the Lacedaemonians, and seceded from them to the Achaean League. They defeated Agis, the son of Eudamidas, king of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, in defence of their own country, with the help of an Achaean army under the leadership of Aratus. They also joined the Achaeans in their struggle against Cleomenes and helped to destroy the Lacedaemonian power. Antigonus of Macedonia, who was guardian of Philip, the father of Perseus, before he came of age, was an ardent supporter of the Achaeans, and so the Mantineans, among other honors, changed the name of their city to <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Antigoneia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Afterwards, when Augustus was about to fight the naval engagement off the cape of Actian Apollo, the Mantineans fought on the side of the Romans, while the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> joined the ranks of Antonius, for no other reason, so it seems to me, except that the Lacedaemonians favoured the cause of Augustus. Ten generations afterwards, when Hadrian became Emperor, he took away from the Mantineans the name imported from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and gave back to their city its old name of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Mantineans possess a temple composed of two parts, being divided almost exactly at the middle by a wall. In one part of the temple is an image of Asclepius, made by Alcamenes; the other part is a sanctuary of Leto and her children, and their images were made by Praxiteles two generations after Alcamenes. On the pedestal of these are figures of Muses together with Marsyas playing the flute. Here there is a figure of Polybius, the son of Lycortas, carved in relief upon a slab, of whom I shall make fuller mention later on.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 8.30">Paus. 8.30-48</bibl></note></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Mantineans have other sanctuaries also, one of Zeus Saviour, and one of Zeus Giver of Gifts, in that he gives good things to men. There is also a sanctuary of the Dioscuri, and in another place one of Demeter and the Maid. Here they keep a fire, taking anxious care not to let it go out. Near the theater I saw a temple of Hera.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Praxiteles made the images Hera is sitting, while Athena and Hera's daughter Hebe are standing by her side. Near the altar of Hera is the grave of Arcas, the son of Callisto.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Behind the theater I found the remains, with an image, of a temple of Aphrodite surnamed Ally. The inscription on the pedestal announced that the image was dedicated by Nicippe, the daughter of Paseas. This sanctuary was made by the Mantineans to remind posterity of their fighting on the side of the Romans at the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>. They also worship Athena Alea, of whom they have a sanctuary and an image.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Antinous too was deified by them; his temple is the newest in <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>. He was a great favorite of the Emperor Hadrian. I never saw him in the flesh, but I have seen images and pictures of him. He has honors in other places also, and on the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> is an Egyptian city named after Antinous. He has won worship in <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> for the following reason. Antinous was by birth from Bithynium beyond the river Sangarius, and the Bithynians are by descent Arcadians of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For this reason the Emperor established his worship in <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> also; mystic rites are celebrated in his honor each year, and games every four years. There is a building in the gymnasium of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> containing statues of Antinous, and remarkable for the stones with which it is adorned, and especially so for its pictures. Most of them are portraits of Antinous, who is made to look just like Dionysus. There is also a copy here of the painting in the Cerameicus which represented the engagement of the Athenians at <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the market-place is a bronze portrait-statue of a woman, said by the Mantineans to be Diomeneia, the daughter of Arcas, and a hero-shrine of Podares, who was killed, they say, in the battle with the Thebaus under Epaminondas. Three generations ago they changed the inscription on the grave and made it apply to a descendant of this Podares with the same name, who was born late enough to have Roman citizenship.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In my time the elder Podares was honored by the Mantineans, who said that he who proved the bravest in the battle, of themselves and of their allies, was Grylus, the son of Xenophon; next to Grylus was Cephisodorus of Marathon, who at the time commanded the Athenian horse. The third place for valor they give to Podares.</p></div>

<div n="10" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are roads leading from <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> into the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and I will go on to describe the most noteworthy objects on each of them. On the left of the highway leading to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> there is, beside the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>, a place where horses race, and not far from it is a race-course, where they celebrate the games in honor of Antinous. Above the race-course is Mount Alesium, so called from the wandering (ale) of Rhea, on which is a grove of Demeter.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the foot of the mountain is the sanctuary of Horse Poseidon, not more than six stades distant from <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>. About this sanctuary I, like everyone else who has mentioned it, can write only what I have heard. The modern sanctuary was built by the Emperor Hadrian, who set overseers over the workmen, so that nobody might look into the old sanctuary, and none of the ruins be removed. He ordered them to build around the new temple. Originally, they say, this sanctuary was built for Poseidon by Agamedes and Trophonius,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 9.11.1">Paus. 9.11.1</bibl> and <bibl n="Paus. 9.37.4">Paus. 9.37.4</bibl>.</note> who worked oak logs and fitted them together.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They set up no barrier at the entrance to prevent men going inside; but they stretched across it a thread of wool. Perhaps they thought that even this would strike fear into the religious people of that time, and perhaps there was also some power in the thread. It is notorious that even Aepytus, the son of Hippothous, entered the sanctuary neither by jumping over the thread nor by slipping under it, but by cutting it through. For this sin he was blinded by a wave that dashed on to his eyes, and forthwith his life left him.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is an old legend that a wave of sea-water rises up in the sanctuary. A like story is told by the Athenians about the wave on the Acropolis, and by the Carians living in <placeName key="perseus,Mylasa">Mylasa</placeName> about the sanctuary of the god called in the native tongue Osogoa. But the sea at Phalerum is about twenty stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and the port of <placeName key="perseus,Mylasa">Mylasa</placeName> is eighty stades from the city. But at <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> the sea rises after a very long distance, and quite plainly through the divine will.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beyond the sanctuary of Poseidon is a trophy made of stone commemorating the victory over the Lacedaemonians under Agis. The course of the battle was, it is said, after this wise. The right wing was held by the Mantineans themselves, who put into the field all of military age under the command of Podares, the grandson of the Podares who fought against the Thebans. They had with them also the Elean seer Thrasybulus, the son of Aeneas, one of the Iamids. This man foretold a victory for the Mantineans and took a personal part in the fighting.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the left wing was stationed all the rest of the Arcadian army, each city under its own leader, the contingent of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> being led by Lydiades and Leocydes. The center was entrusted to Aratus, with the Sicyonians and the Achaeans. The Lacedaemonians under Agis, who with the royal staff officers were in the center, extended their line so as to make it equal in length to that of their enemies.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Aratus, acting on an arrangement with the Arcadians, fell back with his command, as though the pressure of the Lacedaemonians was too severe. As they gave way they gradually<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or, taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠρέμα</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc"> μηνοειδές</foreign>, “slightly crescent shaped.”</note> made their formation crescent-shaped. The Lacedaemonians under Agis, thinking that victory was theirs, pressed in close order yet harder on Aratus and his men. They were followed by those on the wings, who thought it a great achievement to put to flight Aratus and his host.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the Arcadians got in their rear unperceived, and the Lacedaemonians were surrounded, losing the greater part of their army, while King Agis himself fell, the son of Eudamidas. The Mantineans affirmed that Poseidon too manifested himself in their defence, and for this reason they erected a trophy as an offering to Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That gods were present at war and slaughter of men has been told by the poets who have treated of the sufferings of heroes at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and the Athenians relate in song how gods sided with them at Marathon and at the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>. Very plainly the host of the Gauls was destroyed at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> by the god, and manifestly by demons. So there is precedent for the story of the Mantineans that they won their victory by the aid of Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Arcesilaus, an ancestor, ninth in descent, of' Leocydes, who with Lydiades was general of the Megalopolitans, is said by the Arcadians to have seen, when dwelling in Lycosura, the sacred deer, enfeebled with age, of the goddess called Lady. This deer, they say, had a collar round its neck, with writing on the collar:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">I was a fawn when captured, at the time when Agapenor went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</l></quote><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This story proves that the deer is an animal much longer-lived even than the elephant.</p></div>

<div n="11" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the sanctuary of Poseidon you will come to a place full of oak trees, called Sea, and the road from <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> leads through the oaks. The boundary between <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> is the round altar on the highroad. If you will turn aside to the left from the sanctuary of Poseidon, you will reach, after going just about five stades, the graves of the daughters of Pelias. These, the Mantineans say, came to live with them when they were fleeing from the scandal at their father's death.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now when Medea reached Iolcus, she immediately began to plot against Pelias; she was really conspiring with Jason, while pretending to be at variance with him. She promised the daughters of Pelias that, if they wished, she would restore his youth to their father, now a very old man. Having butchered in some way a ram, she boiled his flesh with drugs in a pot, by the aid of which she took out of the pot a live lamb.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So she took Pelias and cut him up to boil him, hut what the daughters received was not enough to bury. This result forced the women to change their home to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and after their death mounds were made there for their tombs. No poet, so far as I have read, has given them names, but the painter Micon inscribed on their portraits Asteropeia and <placeName key="tgn,7001278">Antinoe</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A Place called Phoezon is about twenty stades distant from these graves. Phoezon is a tomb of stone surrounded with a basement, raised only a little above the ground. At this point the road becomes very narrow, and here, they say, is the tomb of Areithous, surnamed Corynetes (Clubman) because of his weapon.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go along the road leading from <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> to Pallantium, at a distance of about thirty stades, the highway is skirted by the grove of what is called the Ocean, and here the cavalry of the Athenians and Mantineans fought against the Boeotian horse. Epaminondas, the Mantineans say, was killed by Machaerion, a man of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>. The Lacedaemonians on their part say that a Spartan killed Epaminondas, but they too give Machaerion as the name of the man.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Athenian account, with which the Theban agrees, makes out that Epaminondas was wounded by Grylus. Similar is the story on the picture portraying the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>. All can see that the Mantineans gave Grylus a public funeral and dedicated where he fell his likeness on a slab in honor of the bravest of their allies. The Lacedaemonians also speak of Machaerion as the slayer, but actually at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> there is no Machaerion, nor is there at <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>, who has received honors for bravery.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Epaminondas was wounded, they carried him still living from the ranks. For a while he kept his hand to the wound in agony, with his gaze fixed on the combatants, the place from which he looked at them being called Scope (Look) by posterity. But when the combat came to an indecisive end, he took his hand away from the wound and died, being buried on the spot where the armies met.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the grave stands a pillar, and on it is a shield with a dragon in relief. The dragon means that Epaminondas belonged to the race of those called the <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Sparti</placeName>, while there are slabs on the tomb, one old, with a Boeotian inscription, the other dedicated by the Emperor Hadrian, who wrote the inscription on it.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Everybody must praise Epaminondas for being the most famous Greek general, or at least consider him second to none other. For the Lacedaemonian and the Athenian leaders enjoyed the ancient reputation of their cities, while their soldiers were men of a spirit, but the Thebans, whom Epaminondas raised to the highest position, were a disheartened people, accustomed to obey others.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Epaminondas had been told before by an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to beware of “ocean.” So he was afraid to step on board a man-of-war or to sail in a merchant-ship, but by “ocean” the god indicated the grove “Ocean” and not the sea. Places with the same name misled Hannibal the Carthaginian, and before him the Athenians also.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hannibal received an oracle from Ammon that when he died he would be buried in Libyan earth. So he hoped to destroy the Roman empire, to return to his home in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, and there to die of old age. But when Flamininus the Roman was anxious to take him alive, Hannibal came to Prusias as a suppliant. Repulsed by Prusias he jumped upon his horse, but was wounded in the finger by his drawn sword. when he had proceeded only a few stades his wound caused a fever, and he died on the third day. The place where lie died is called Libyssa by the Nicomedians.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Athenians received an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> ordering them to colonize <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> is a small hill not far from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Just about a stade from the grave of Epaminondas is a sanctuary of Zeus surnamed Charmon. The oaks in the groves of the Arcadians are of different sorts; some of them are called “broad-leaved,” others “edible oaks.” A third kind have a porous bark, which is so light that they actually make from it floats for anchors and nets.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This man's daughter, Phialo, had connection, say the Phigalians, with Heracles. When Alcimedon realized that she had a child, he exposed her to perish on the mountain, and with her the baby boy she had borne, whom the Arcadians call Aechmagoras. On being exposed the babe began to cry, and a jay heard him wailing and began to imitate his cries.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It happened that Heracles, passing along that road, heard the jay, and, thinking that the crying was that of a baby and not of a bird, turned straight to the voice.

Advancing a little way to the north of it you come to the spring of Alalcomeneia, and thirty stades from Ptolis are the ruins of a village called Maera, with the grave of Maera, if it be really the case that Maera was buried here and not in Tegean land. For probably the Tegeans, and not the Mantineans, are right when they say that Maera, the daughter of Atlas, was buried in their land. Perhaps, however, the Maera who came to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName> was another, a descendant of Maera, the daughter of Atlas.</p></div>

The Mantineans, too, share it . . . a priestess also and a priest. It is the custom for these to live their whole lives in purity, not only sexual but in all respects, and they neither wash nor spend their lives as do ordinary people, nor do they enter the home of a private man. I know that the “entertainers” of the Ephesian Artemis live in a similar fashion, but for a year only, the Ephesians calling them Essenes. They also hold an annual festival in honor of Artemis Hymnia.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The former city of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> was on the peak of a mountain, and there still remain ruins of a market-place and of walls. The modern, inhabited city lies under the circuit of the old wall. Worth seeing here is a spring, from which they draw water, and there are sanctuaries of Poseidon and of Aphrodite, the images being of stone. Near the city is a wooden image of Artemis. It is set in a large cedar tree, and after the tree they call the goddess the Lady of the Cedar.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beneath the city are heaps of stones at intervals, which were piled over men who fell in war. With what Peloponnesians, whether Arcadians or other, the war was fought, was set forth neither by inscriptions on the graves nor in Orchomenian tradition.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Opposite the city is Mount Trachy (Rough). The rain-water, flowing through a deep gully between the city and Mount Trachy, descends to another Orchomenian plain, which is very considerable in extent, but the greater part of it is a lake. As you go out of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>, after about three stades, the straight road leads you to the city Caphya, along the side of the gully and afterwards along the water of the lake on the left. The other road, after you have crossed the water flowing through the gully, goes under Mount Trachy.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On this road the first thing is the tomb of Aristocrates, who once outraged the virgin priestess of the goddess Hymnia, and after the grave of Aristocrates are springs called Teneiae, and about seven stades distant from the springs is a place Amilus, which once, they say, was a city. Here the road forks again, one way leading to Stymphalus, the other to Pheneus.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the road to Pheneus you will come to a mountain. On this mountain meet the boundaries of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>, Pheneus and Caphya. Over the boundaries extends a high crag, called the Caphyatic Rock. After the boundaries of the cities I have mentioned lies a ravine, and the road to Pheneus leads through it. Just about the middle of the ravine water rises up from a spring, and at the end of the ravine is a place called Caryae.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The plain of Pheneus lies below Caryae, and they say that once the water rose on it and flooded the ancient city of Pheneus, so that even to-day there remain on the mountains marks up to which, it is said, the water rose. Five stades distant from Caryae is a mountain called Oryxis, and another, Mount Sciathis. Under each mountain is a chasm that receives the water from the plain.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These chasms according to the people of Pheneus are artificial, being made by Heracles when he lived in Pheneus with Laonome, the mother of Amphitryo, who was, it is said, the son of Alcaeus by Laonome, the daughter of Guneus, a woman of Pheneus, and not by Lysidice, the daughter of Pelops. Now if Heracles really migrated to Pheneus, one might believe that when expelled by Eurystheus from <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName> he did not go at once to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, but went first to Pheneus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Heracles dug a channel through the middle of the plain of Pheneus for the river Olbius, which some Arcadians call, not Olbius but Aroanius. The length of the cutting is fifty stades, its depth, where it has not fallen in, is as much as thirty feet. The river, however, no longer flows along it, but it has gone back to its old bed, having left the work of Heracles.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About fifty stades from the chasms made in the mountains I have mentioned is the city, founded, say the Pheneatians, by Pheneus, an aboriginal. Their acropolis is precipitous on all sides, mostly so naturally, but a few parts have been artificially strengthened, to make it more secure. On the acropolis here is a temple of Athena surnamed Tritonia, but of it I found ruins only remaining.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There stands also a bronze Poseidon, surnamed Horse, whose image, it is said, was dedicated by Odysseus. The legend is that Odysseus lost his mares, traversed <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in search of them, and on the site in the land of Pheneus where he found his mares founded a sanctuary of Artemis, calling the goddess Horse-finder, and also dedicated the image of Horse Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Odysseus found his mares he was minded, it is said, to keep horses in the land of Pheneus, just as he reared his cows, they say, on the mainland opposite <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. On the base of the image the people of Pheneus pointed out to me writing, purporting to be instructions of Odysseus to those tending his mares.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The rest of the account of the people of Pheneus it will be reasonable to accept, but I cannot believe their statement that Odysseus dedicated the bronze image. For men had not yet learned how to make bronze images in one piece, after the manner of those weaving a garment. Their method of working bronze statues I have already described when speaking of the image of Zeus Most High in my history of the Spartans.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 3.17.6">Paus. 3.17.6</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first men to melt bronze and to cast images were the Samians Rhoecus the son of Philaeus and Theodorus the son of Telecles. Theodorus also made the emerald signet, which Polycrates, the tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, constantly wore, being exceedingly proud of it.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As you go down from the acropolis of Pheneus you come to a stadium, and on a hill stands a tomb of Iphicles, the brother of Heracles and the father of Iolaus. Iolaus, according to the Greek account, shared most of the labours of Heracles, but his father Iphicles, in the first battle fought by Heracles against the Eleans and Augeas, was wounded by the sons of Actor, who were called after their mother Moline. In a fainting condition he was carried by his relatives to Pheneus, where he was carefully nursed by Buphagus, a citizen of Pheneus, and by his wife Promne, who also buried him when he died of his wound.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They still sacrifice to Iphicles as to a hero, and of the gods the people of Pheneus worship most Hermes, in whose honor they celebrate the games called Hermaea; they have also a temple of Hermes, and a stone image, made by an Athenian, Eucheir the son of Eubulides. Behind the temple is the grave of Myrtilus. The Greeks say that he was the son of Hermes, and that he served as charioteer to Oenomaus. Whenever a man arrived to woo the daughter of Oenomaus, Myrtilus craftily drove on the mares, while Oenomaus on the course shot down the wooer when he came near.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Myrtilus himself, too, was in love with Hippodameia, but his courage failing him he shrank from the competition and served Oenomaus as his charioteer. At last, it is said, he proved a traitor to Oenomaus, being induced thereto by an oath sworn by Pelops that he would let him be with Hippodameia for one night. So when reminded of his oath Pelops threw him out of the ship. The people of Pheneus say that the body of Myrtilus was cast ashore by the tide, that they took it up and buried it, and that every year they sacrifice to him by night as to a hero.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is plain that Pelops did not make a long coasting voyage, but only sailed from the mouth of the Alpheius to the harbor of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. So the Sea of Myrto is obviously not named after Myrtilus, the son of Hermes, as it begins at <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and reaches the Aegaean by way of the uninhabited island of Helene. I think that a probable account is given by the antiquarians of Euboea, who say that the sea is named after a woman called Myrto.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The people of Pheneus have also a sanctuary of Demeter, surnamed Eleusinian, and they perform a ritual to the goddess, saying that the ceremonies at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> are the same as those established among themselves. For Naus, they assert, came to them because of an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, being a grandson of Eumolpus.

They take from out them writings that refer to the rites, read them in the hearing of the initiated, and return them on the same night.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the top is a sphere, with a mask inside of Demeter Cidaria. This mask is put on by the priest at the Greater Rites, who for some reason or other beats with rods the Folk Underground.

To those Pheneatians who received her with hospitality into their homes the goddess gave all sorts of pulse save the bean only.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a sacred story to explain why the bean in their eyes is an impure kind of pulse. Those who, the Pheneatians say, gave the goddess a welcome, Trisaules and Damithales, had a temple of Demeter Thesmia (Law-goddess) built under Mount Cyllene, and they established for her rites also, which they celebrate even to this day. This temple of the goddess Thesmia is just about fifteen stades away from the city.</p></div>

Here even now the Pheneatians still sacrifice to Apollo and Artemis, and they say that the sanctuary was made by Heracles after capturing <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They are Telamon, buried quite near the river Aroanius, a little farther away than is the sanctuary of Apollo, and Chalcodon, not far from the spring called Oenoe. Nobody could admit that there fell in this battle the Chalcodon who was the father of the Elephenor who led the Euboeans to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and the Telamon who was the father of Ajax and Teucer. For how could Heracles have been helped in his task by a Chalcodon who, according to trustworthy tradition, had before this been killed in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> by Amphitryon?</p></div>

This mountain is the boundary between the territories of Pheneus and Stymphalus. On the left of it, as you travel through the land of Pheneus, are mountains of the Pheneatians called Tricrena (Three Springs), and here are three springs. In them, says the legend, Hermes was washed after birth by the nymphs of the mountain, and for this reason they are considered sacred to Hermes.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from Tricrena is another mountain called Sepia, where they say that Aepytus, the son of Elatus, was killed by the snake, and they also made his grave on the spot, for they could not carry the body away. These snakes are still to be found, the Arcadians say, on the mountain, even at the present day; not many, however, for they are very scarce. The reason is that, as for the greater part of the year snow falls on the mountain, the snakes die that are cut off by the snow from their holes, while should any make good their escape to the holes, nevertheless some of them are killed by the snow, as the frost penetrates even into the very holes themselves.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The grave of Aepytus I was especially anxious to see, because Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.592">Hom.

Homer naturally was bound to admire it, as he had never seen a more noteworthy tomb, just as he compares the dance worked by Hephaestus on the shield of Achilles to a dance made by Daedalus, because he had never seen more clever workmanship.</p></div>

Then the mechanism, unaided, opens the door, which, after a short interval, shuts itself. This happens at that time, but should you at any other try to open the door you cannot do so; force will not open it, but only break it down.</p></div>

The Lycian Olen, an earlier poet, who composed for the Delians, among other hymns, one to Eileithyia, styles her “the clever spinner,” clearly identifying her with fate, and makes her older than Cronus.</p></div>

<div n="22" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>My narrative returns to Stymphalus and to Geronteium, as it is called, the boundary between Stymphalus and Pheneus. The Stymphalians are no longer included among the Arcadians, but are numbered with the Argive League, which they joined of their own accord. That they are by race Arcadians is testified by the verses of Homer,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.608">Hom. Il. 2.608</bibl>.</note> and Stymphalus their founder was a grandson of Arcas, the son of Callisto. It is said that it was originally founded on another site, and not on that of the modern city.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The story has it that in the old Stymphalus dwelt Temenus, the son of Pelasgus, and that Hera was reared by this Temenus, who himself established three sanctuaries for the goddess, and gave her three surnames when she was still a maiden, Girl; when married to Zeus he called her Grown-up; when for some cause or other she quarrelled with Zeus and came back to Stymphalus, Temenus named her Widow. This is the account which, to my own knowledge, the Stymphalians give of the goddess.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The modern city contains none of these sanctuaries, but I found the following notable things. In the Stymphalian territory is a spring, from which the emperor Hadrian brought water to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>. In winter the spring makes a small lake in Stymphalus, and the river Stymphalus issues from the lake; in summer there is no lake, but the river comes straight from the spring. This river descends into a chasm in the earth, and reappearing once more in <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> it changes its name, and is called Erasinus instead of Stymphalus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a story current about the water of the Stymphalus, that at one time man-eating birds bred on it, which Heracles is said to have shot down. Peisander of Camira, however, says that Heracles did not kill the birds, but drove them away with the noise of rattles. The Arabian desert breeds among other wild creatures birds called Stymphalian, which are quite as savage against men as lions or leopards.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These fly against those who come to hunt them, wounding and killing them with their beaks. All armour of bronze or iron that men wear is pierced by the birds; but if they weave a garment of thick cork, the beaks of the Stymphalian birds are caught in the cork garment, just as the wings of small birds stick in bird-lime. These birds are of the size of a crane, and are like the ibis, but their beaks are more powerful, and not crooked like that of the ibis.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Whether the modern Arabian birds with the same name as the old Arcadian birds are also of the same breed, I do not know. But if there have been from all time Stymphalian birds, just as there have been hawks and eagles, I should call these birds of Arabian origin, and a section of them might have flown on some occasion to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and reached Stymphalus. Originally they would be called by the Arabians, not Stymphalian, but by another name. But the fame of Heracles, and the superiority of the Greek over the foreigner, has resulted in the birds of the Arabian desert being called Stymphalian even in modern times.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In Stymphalus there is also an old sanctuary of Stymphalian Artemis, the image being of wood, for the most part gilded. Near the roof of the temple have been carved, among other things, the Stymphalian birds. Now it was difficult to discern clearly whether the carving was in wood or in gypsum, but such evidence as I had led me to conclude that it was not of gypsum but of wood. There are here also maidens of white marble, with the legs of birds, and they stand behind the temple.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Even in our own day the following miracle is said to have occurred. The festival of Stymphalian Artemis at Stymphalus was carelessly celebrated, and its established ritual in great part transgressed. Now a log fell into the mouth of the chasm into which the river descends, and so prevented the water from draining away, and (so it is said) the plain became a lake for a distance of four hundred stades.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They also say that a hunter chased a deer, which fled and plunged into the marsh, followed by the hunter, who, in the excitement of the hunt, swam after the deer. So the chasm swallowed up both the deer and her pursuer. They are said to have been followed by the water of the river, so that by the next day the whole of the water was dried up that flooded the Stymphalian plain. Hereafter they put greater zeal into the festival in honor of Artemis.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Stymphalus comes <placeName key="perseus,Alea">Alea</placeName>, which too belongs to the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> federation, and its citizens point to Aleus, the son of Apheidas, as their founder. The sanctuaries of the gods here are those of Ephesian Artemis and Athena Alea, and there is a temple of Dionysus with an image. In honor of Dionysus they celebrate every other year a festival called Sciereia, and at this festival, in obedience to a response from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, women are flogged, just as the Spartan lads are flogged at the image of the Orthian goddess.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In my account of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>, I explained how the straight road runs at first beside the gully, and afterwards to the left of the flood water. On the plain of Caphyae has been made a dyke of earth, which prevents the water from the Orchomenian territory from doing harm to the tilled land of Caphyae. Inside the dyke flows along another stream, in size big enough to be called a river, and descending into a chasm of the earth it rises again at Nasi, as it is called. The place where it reappears is called Rheunus; the stream having risen here, hereafter the water forms an ever-flowing river, the <placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The name of the city is clearly derived from Cepheus, the son of Aleus, but its form in the Arcadian dialect, Caphyae, is the one that has survived. The inhabitants say that originally they were from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but on being expelled from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Aegeus they fled to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, threw themselves on the mercy of Cepheus, and found a home in the country. The town is on the border of the plain at the foot of some inconsiderable mountains. The Caphyatans have a sanctuary of the god Poseidon, and one of the goddess Artemis, surnamed Cnacalesia.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They have also a mountain called Cnacalus, where every year they celebrate mysteries in honor of their Artemis. A little beyond the city is a spring, and by the spring grows a large and beautiful plane tree. They call it Menelais, saying that the plane was planted by the spring by Menelaus, who came to the spot when he was collecting his army against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. To-day they give the name Menelais to the spring as well as to the plane.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>If I am to base my calculations on the accounts of the Greeks in fixing the relative ages of such trees as are still preserved and flourish, the oldest of them is the withy growing in the Samian sanctuary of Hera, after which come the oak in <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>, the olive on the Acropolis and the olive in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. The third place in respect of age the Syrians would assign to the bay-tree they have in their country. Of the others this plane-tree is the oldest.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About a stade distant from Caphyae is a place called Condylea, where there are a grove and a temple of Artemis called of old Condyleatis. They say that the name of the goddess was changed for the following reason. Some children, the number of whom is not recorded, while playing about the sanctuary found a rope, and tying it round the neck of the image said that Artemis was being strangled.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Caphyans, detecting what the children had done, stoned them to death. When they had done this, a malady befell their women, whose babies were stillborn, until the Pythian priestess bade them bury the children, and sacrifice to them every year as sacrifice is made to heroes, because they had been wrongly put to death. The Caphyans still obey this oracle, and call the goddess at Condyleae, as they say the oracle also bade them, the Strangled Lady from that day to this.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Going up about seven stades from Caphyae you will go down to what is called Nasi.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The founder of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, according to some, was <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, the son of Arrhon, the son of Erymanthus, the son of Aristas, the son of Parthaon, the son of Periphetes, the son of Nyctimus. Others say that <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName> was the daughter of <placeName key="tgn,7002633">Xanthus</placeName>, the son of Erymanthus, the son of Arcas. Such are the Arcadian traditions concerning their kings,</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>but the most accurate version is that <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>, the despot of Sicania, had a daughter named <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, whom Heracles, though he had intercourse with her, refused to take to his home, but left with child in the care of his friend Lycortas, who lived at Phegia, a city called Erymanthus before the reign of Phegeus. Having been brought up here, Echephron and Promachus, the sons of Heracles and the Sicanian woman, changed the name of Phegia to <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, the name of their mother.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Psophis is also the name of the Zacynthian acropolis, because the first man to sail across to the island was <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>, the son of Dardanus, a Psophidian who became its founder.  From Seirae it is thirty stades to <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, by the side of which runs the river Aroanius, and a little farther away the river Erymanthus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Erymanthus has its source in Mount Lampeia, which is said to be sacred to Pan. One might regard Lampeia as a part of Mount Erymanthus.

The people of <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName> among the Opici say that the boar's tusks dedicated in their sanctuary of Apollo are those of the Erymanthian boar, but the saying is altogether improbable.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName> there is a sanctuary of Aphrodite surnamed Erycine; I found only ruins of it remaining, but the people said that it was established by the sons of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>. Their account is probable, for in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> too, in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>, is a sanctuary of Erycine, which from the remotest times has been very holy, and quite as rich as the sanctuary in <placeName key="tgn,7002373">Paphos</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The hero-shrines, however, of Promachus and Echephron, the sons of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>, were no longer distinguished when I saw them.

About it grow cypresses, reaching to such a height that even the mountain by <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName> was overshadowed by them. These the inhabitants will not cut down, holding them to be sacred to Alcmaeon.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They are called “maidens” by the natives.

Among the presents that he naturally gave her was the necklace. While he lived among the Arcadians his disease did not grow any better, so he had recourse to the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. The Pythian priestess informed him that the only land into which the avenging spirit of Eriphyle would not follow him was the newest land, one brought up to light by the sea after the pollution of his mother's death.</p></div>

Senseless passions shipwreck many men, and even more women.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Callirhoe conceived a passion for the necklace of Eriphyle, and for this reason sent Alcmaeon against his will to Phegia. Temenus and Axion, the sons of Phegeus, murdered him by treachery.

The people of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName> assert that the reason why they took no part in the expedition was because their princes had incurred the enmity of the leaders of the Argives, who were in most cases related by blood to Alcmaeon, and had joined him in his campaign against <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That the Echinades islands have not been made mainland as yet by the Achelous is due to the Aetolian people, who have been driven from their homes and all their land has been laid waste. Accordingly, as <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> remains untilled, the Achelous does not bring as much mud upon the Echinades as it otherwise would do. My reasoning is confirmed by the fact that the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName>, flowing through the land of the Phrygians and Carians, which is ploughed up each year, has turned to mainland in a short time the sea that once was between <placeName key="perseus,Priene">Priene</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>.</p></div>

Going on from here you will cross the Alpheius again and reach Thocnia, which is named after Thocnus, the son of Lycaon, and to-day is altogether uninhabited.

The things inside, however, can be seen —altars of the god, two tables, two eagles, and an image of Pan made of stone.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>His surname is Sinoeis, and they say that Pan was so surnamed after a nymph Sinoe, who with others of the nymphs nursed him on her own account.

Adjoining this Philippeium is another portico, smaller in size, where stand the government offices of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, six rooms in number.

The portico called Myropolis, situated in the market-place, was built from the spoils taken when the Lacedaemonians fighting under Acrotatus, the son of Cleomenes, suffered the reverse sustained at the hands of Aristodemus, then tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the marketplace of that city, behind the enclosure sacred to Lycaean Zeus, is the figure of a man carved in relief on a slab, Polybius, the son of Lycortas. Elegiac verses are inscribed upon it saying that he roamed over every land and every sea, and that he became the ally of the Itomans and stayed their wrath against the Greek nation. This Polybius wrote also a history of the Romans, including how they went to war with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, what the cause of the war was, and how at last, not before great dangers had been run, Scipio . . . whom they name Carthaginian, because he put an end to the war and razed <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to the ground.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Whenever the Romans obeyed the advice of Polybius, things went well with them, but they say that whenever they would not listen to his instructions they made mistakes.

On the left of the portrait-statue of Polybius is the Council Chamber.</p></div>

Zeus is seated on a throne, and by his side stand <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> on the right and an image of Artemis Saviour on the left. These are of Pentelic marble and were made by the Athenians Cephisodotus and Xenophon.</p></div>

<div n="31" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the other end, the western, of the portico is an enclosure sacred to the Great Goddesses.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Of the Great Goddesses, Demeter is of stone throughout, but the Saviour has drapery of wood. The height of each is about fifteen feet. The images . . . and before them he made small maids in tunics reaching to the ankles, each of whom carries on her head a basket full of flowers. They are said to be daughters of Damophon, but those inclining to a more religious interpretation hold that they are Athena and Artemis gathering the flowers with Persephone.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the side of Demeter there is also a Heracles about a cubit high. This Heracles, says Onomacritus in his poem, is one of those called Idaean Dactyls. Before it stands a table, on which are carved in relief two seasons, Pan with pipes, and Apollo playing the harp. There is also an inscription by them saying that they are among the first gods.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Nymphs too are carved on the table: Neda carrying an infant Zeus, Anthracia, another Arcadian nymph, holding a torch, and Hagno with a water-pot in one hand and a bowl in the other. Anchirhoe and Myrtoessa carry water-pots, with what is meant to be water coming down from them. Within the precinct is a temple of Zeus Friendly. Polycleitus of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> made the image; it is like Dionysus in having buskins as footwear and in holding a beaker in one hand and a thyrsus in the other, but an eagle sitting on the thyrsus does not fit in with the received accounts of Dionysus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Behind this temple is a small grove of trees surrounded by a wall; nobody may go inside, and before it are images of Demeter and the Maid some three feet high. Within the enclosure of the Great Goddesses is also a sanctuary of Aphrodite.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and in the temple are images made by Damophon, a wooden Hermes and a wooden Aphrodite with hands, face and feet of stone. The surname Deviser given to the goddess is, in my opinion, a most apt one; for very many are the devices, and most varied are the forms of speech invented by men because of Aphrodite and her works.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In a building stand statues also, those of Callignotus, Mentas, Sosigenes and Polus.

Within the enclosure of the goddesses are the following images, which all have a square shape: Hermes, surnamed Agetor, Apollo, Athena, Poseidon, Sun too, surnamed Saviour, and Heracles.

Not far from the theater are left foundations of the council house built for the Ten Thousand Arcadians, and called Thersilium after the man who dedicated it. Hard by is a house, belonging to-day to a private person, which originally was built for Alexander, the son of Philip. By the house is an image of Ammon, like the square images of Hermes, with a ram's horns on his head.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary built in common for the Muses, Apollo and Hermes had for me to record only a few foundations, but there was still one of the Muses, with an image of Apollo after the style of the square Hermae.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At no great distance is an altar of Ares, and it was said that originally a sanctuary too was built for the god. Beyond the Aphrodite is built also a race-course, extending on one side to the theater (and here they have a spring, held sacred to Dionysus), while at the other end of the race-course a temple of Dionysus was said to have been struck by lightning two generations before my time, and a few ruins of it were still there when I saw it.

A short distance farther on is a mound of earth which is the grave of Aristodemus, whom in spite of his being a tyrant they could not help calling the Good and there is also a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Contriver, because the goddess is the inventor of plans and devices of all sorts.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the right of the road there has been made a precinct to the North Wind, and the Megalopolitans offer sacrifices every year, holding none of the gods in greater honor than the North Wind, because he proved their saviour from the Lacedaemonians under Agis.

The Theban legend is different, and the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, again, have a legend at variance with the Theban.</p></div>

<div n="37" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From Acacesium it is four stades to the sanctuary of the Mistress. First in this place is a temple of Artemis Leader, with a bronze image, holding torches, which I conjecture to be about six feet high. From this place there is an entrance into the sacred enclosure of the Mistress. As you go to the temple there is a portico on the right, with reliefs of white marble on the wall. On the first relief are wrought Fates and Zeus surnamed Guide of Fate, and on the second Heracles wresting a tripod from Apollo. What I learned about the story of the two latter I will tell if I get as far as an account of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> in my history of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the portico by the Mistress there is, between the reliefs I have mentioned, a tablet with descriptions<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Either in writing or in pictures—probably the former. See Frazer's note.</note> of the mysteries. On the third relief are nymphs and Pans; on the fourth is Polybius, the son of Lycortas. On the latter is also an inscription, declaring that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> would never have fallen at all, if she had obeyed Polybius in everything, and when she met disaster her only help came from him. In front of the temple is an altar to Demeter and another to the Mistress, after which is one of the Great Mother.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The actual images of the goddesses, Mistress and Demeter, the throne on which they sit, along with the footstool under their feet, are all made out of one piece of stone. No part of the drapery, and no part of the carvings about the throne, is fastened to another stone by iron or cement, but the whole is from one block. This stone was not brought in by them, but they say that in obedience to a dream they dug up the earth within the enclosure and so found it. The size of both images just about corresponds to the image of the Mother at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These too are works of Damophon. Demeter carries a torch in her right hand; her other hand she has laid upon the Mistress. The Mistress has on her knees a staff and what is called the box, which she holds in her right hand. On both sides of the throne are images. By the side of Demeter stands Artemis wrapped in the skin of a deer, and carrying a quiver on her shoulders, while in one hand she holds a torch, in the other two serpents; by her side a bitch, of a breed suitable for hunting, is lying down.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the image of the Mistress stands Anytus, represented as a man in armour. Those about the sanctuary say that the Mistress was brought up by Anytus, who was one of the Titans, as they are called. The first to introduce Titans into poetry was Homer,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.279">Hom. Il. 14.279</bibl>.</note> representing them as gods down in what is called Tartarus; the lines are in the passage about Hera's oath. From Homer the name of the Titans was taken by Onomacritus, who in the orgies he composed for Dionysus made the Titans the authors of the god's sufferings.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This is the story of Anytus told by the Arcadians. That Artemis was the daughter, not of Leto but of Demeter, which is the Egyptian account, the Greeks learned from Aeschylus the son of Euphorion. The story of the Curetes, who are represented under the images, and that of the Corybantes (a different race from the Curetes), carved in relief upon the base, I know, but pass them by.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Arcadians bring into the sanctuary the fruit of all cultivated trees except the pomegranate. On the right as you go out of the temple there is a mirror fitted into the wall. If anyone looks into this mirror, he will see himself very dimly indeed or not at all, but the actual images of the gods and the throne can be seen quite clearly.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When you have gone up a little, beside the temple of the Mistress on the right is what is called the Hall, where the Arcadians celebrate mysteries, and sacrifice to the Mistress many victims in generous fashion. Every man of them sacrifices what he possesses. But he does not cut the throats of the victims, as is done in other sacrifices; each man chops off a limb of the sacrifice, just that which happens to come to hand.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This Mistress the Arcadians worship more than any other god, declaring that she is a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter. Mistress is her surname among the many, just as they surname Demeter's daughter by Zeus the Maid. But whereas the real name of the Maid is Persephone, as Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.491">Hom. Od. 10.491</bibl>, and <bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.457">Hom.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beyond what is called the Hall is a grove, sacred to the Mistress and surrounded by a wall of stones, and within it are trees, including an olive and an evergreen oak growing out of one root, and that not the result of a clever piece of gardening. Beyond the grove are altars of Horse Poseidon, as being the father of the Mistress, and of other gods as well. On the last of them is an inscription saying that it is common to all the gods.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thence you will ascend by stairs to a sanctuary of Pan. Within the sanctuary has been made a portico, and a small image; and this Pan too, equally with the most powerful gods, can bring men's prayers to accomplishment and repay the wicked as they deserve. Beside this Pan a fire is kept burning which is never allowed to go out. It is said that in days of old this god also gave oracles, and that the nymph Erato became his prophetess, she who wedded Arcas, the son of Callisto.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They also remember verses of Erato, which I too myself have read. Here is an altar of Ares, and there are two images of Aphrodite in a temple, one of white marble, and the other, the older, of wood. There are also wooden images of Apollo and of Athena. Of Athena a sanctuary also has been made.</p></div>

<div n="38" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A little farther up is the circuit of the wall of Lycosura, in which there are a few inhabitants. Of all the cities that earth has ever shown, whether on mainland or on islands, Lycosura is the oldest, and was the first that the sun beheld; from it the rest of mankind have learned how to make them cities.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the left of the sanctuary of the Mistress is Mount Lycaeus. Some Arcadians call it <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and others Sacred Peak. On it, they say, Zeus was reared. There is a place on Mount Lycaeus called Cretea, on the left of the grove of Apollo surnamed Parrhasian. The Arcadians claim that the <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, where the Cretan story has it that Zeus was reared, was this place and not the island.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The nymphs, by whom they say that Zeus was reared, they call Theisoa, Neda and Hagno. After Theisoa was named a city in Parrhasia; Theisoa to-day is a village in the district of <placeName key="tgn,7010920">Megalopolis</placeName>. From Neda the river Neda takes its name; from Hagno a spring on Mount Lycaeus, which like the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName> flows with an equal volume of water in winter just as in the season of summer.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Should a drought persist for a long time, and the seeds in the earth and the trees wither, then the priest of Lycaean Zeus, after praying towards the water and making the usual sacrifices, lowers an oak branch to the surface of the spring, not letting it sink deep. When the water has been stirred up there rises a vapor, like mist; after a time the mist becomes cloud, gathers to itself other clouds, and makes rain fall on the land of the Arcadians.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is on Mount Lycaeus a sanctuary of Pan, and a grove of trees around it, with a race-course in front of which is a running-track. Of old they used to hold here the Lycaean games. Here there are also bases of statues, with now no statues on them. On one of the bases an elegiac inscription declares that the statue was a portrait of Astyanax, and that Astyanax was of the race of Arceas.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Among the marvels of Mount Lycaeus the most wonderful is this. On it is a precinct of Lycaean Zeus, into which people are not allowed to enter. If anyone takes no notice of the rule and enters, he must inevitably live no longer than a year. A legend, moreover, was current that everything alike within the precinct, whether beast or man, cast no shadow. For this reason when a beast takes refuge in the precinct, the hunter will not rush in after it, but remains outside, and though he sees the beast can behold no shadow. In <placeName key="tgn,7001112">Syene</placeName> also just on this side of Aethiopia neither tree nor creature casts a shadow so long as the sun is in the constellation of the Crab, but the precinct on Mount Lycaeus affects shadows in the same way always and at every season.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the highest point of the mountain is a mound of earth, forming an altar of Zeus Lycaeus, and from it most of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> can be seen. Before the altar on the east stand two pillars, on which there were of old gilded eagles. On this altar they sacrifice in secret to Lycaean Zeus. I was reluctant to pry into the details of the sacrifice; let them be as they are and were from the beginning.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the east side of the mountain there is a sanctuary of Apollo surnamed Parrhasian. They also give him the name Pythian. They hold every year a festival in honor of the god and sacrifice in the market-place a boar to Apollo Helper, and after the sacrifice here they at once carry the victim to the sanctuary of Parrhasian Apollo in procession to the music of the flute; cutting out the thigh-bones they burn them, and also consume the meat of the victim on the spot.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This it is their custom to do. To the north of Mount Lycaeus is the Theisoan territory. The inhabitants of it worship most the nymph Theisoa. There flow through the land of Theisoa the following tributaries of the Alpheius, the Mylaon, Nus, Achelous, Celadus, and Naliphus. There are two other rivers of the same name as the Achelous in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, and more famous than it.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>One, falling into the sea by the Echinadian islands, flows through <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, and is said by Homer in the <title>Iliad</title><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The story of Phigalus, the son of Lycaon, who was the original founder of the city, how in course of time the city made a change and called itself after Phialus, the son of Bucolion, and again restored its old name, I have already set forth.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 8.3.1">Paus. 8.3.1</bibl></note> Another account, but not worthy of credit, is current, that Phigalus was not a son of Lycaon but an aboriginal.

It did not, however, occur to me to take pains to discover where in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> the source of the Lymax is.

The Phigalians accept the account of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Thelpusa">Thelpusa</placeName> about the mating of Poseidon and Demeter, but they assert that Demeter gave birth, not to a horse, but to the Mistress, as the Arcadians call her.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Afterwards, they say, angry with Poseidon and grieved at the rape of Persephone, she put on black apparel and shut herself up in this cavern for a long time. But when all the fruits of the earth were perishing, and the human race dying yet more through famine, no god, it seemed, knew where Demeter was in hiding,</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>until Pan, they say, visited <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. Roaming from mountain to mountain as he hunted, he came at last to Mount Elaius and spied Demeter, the state she was in and the clothes she wore. So Zeus learnt this from Pan, and sent the Fates to Demeter, who listened to the Fates and laid aside her wrath, moderating her grief as well. For these reasons, the Phigalians say, they concluded that this cavern was sacred to Demeter and set up in it a wooden image.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The image, they say, was made after this fashion. It was seated on a rock, like to a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a horse, and there grew out of her head images of serpents and other beasts. Her tunic reached right to her feet; on one of her hands was a dolphin, on the other a dove. Now why they had the image made after this fashion is plain to any intelligent man who is learned in traditions.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They say that they named her Black because the goddess had black apparel.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They cannot relate either who made this wooden image or how it caught fire. But the old image was destroyed, and the Phigalians gave the goddess no fresh image, while they neglected for the most part her festivals and sacrifices, until the barrenness fell on the land.

The Pergamenes have a bronze Apollo made by this Onatas, a most wonderful marvel both for its size and workmanship. This man then, about two generations after the Persian invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, made the Phigalians an image of bronze, guided partly by a picture or copy of the ancient wooden image which he discovered, but mostly (so goes the story) by a vision that he saw in dreams. As to the date, I have the following evidence to produce.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the time when Xerxes crossed over into <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, Gelon the son of Deinomenes was despot of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and of the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> besides. When Gelon died, the kingdom devolved on his brother Hieron.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>My story next requires me to describe whatever is notable at Pallantium, and the reason why the emperor Antoninus the first turned it from a village to a city, giving its inhabitants liberty and freedom from taxation.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Well, the story is that the wisest man and the best soldier among the Arcadians was one Evander, whose mother was a nymph, a daughter of the <placeName key="tgn,1033742">Ladon</placeName>, while his father was Hermes. Sent out to establish a colony at the head of a company of Arcadians from Pallantium, he founded a city on the banks of the river <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>. That part of modern <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which once was the home of Evander and the Arcadians who accompanied him, got the name of Pallantium in memory of the city in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. Afterwards the name was changed by omitting the letters L and N.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">That is, Pallantium became Palatium.</note> These are the reasons why the emperor bestowed boons upon Pallantium.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Antoninus, the benefactor of PalIantium, never willingly involved the Romans in war; but when the Moors (who form the greatest part of the independent Libyans, being nomads, and more formidable enemies than even the Scythians in that they wandered, not on wagons, but on horseback with their womenfolk), when these, I say, began an unprovoked war, he drove them from all their country, forcing them to flee to the extreme parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, right up to Mount Atlas and to the people living on it.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He also took away from the Brigantes in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> the greater part of their territory, because they too had begun an unprovoked war on the province of Genunia, a Roman dependency. The cities of <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, along with Cos and <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, were overthrown by a violent earthquake that smote them. These cities also were restored by the emperor Antoninus, who was keenly anxious to rebuild them, and devoted vast sums to this task. As to his gifts of money to Greeks, and to such non-Greeks as needed it, and his buildings in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, others have written of them most exactly.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But there is also another memorial of himself left by this emperor. There was a certain law whereby provincials who were themselves of Roman citizenship, while their children were considered of Greek nationality, were forced either to leave their property to strangers or let it increase the wealth of the emperor. Antoninus permitted all such to give to the children their heritage, choosing rather to show himself benevolent than to retain a law that swelled his riches. This emperor the Romans called Pius, because he showed himself to be a most religious man.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In my opinion he might also be justly called by the same title as the elder Cyrus, who was styled Father of Men. He left to succeed him a son of the same name. This Antoninus the second brought retribution both on the Germans, the most numerous and warlike barbarians in <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, and also on the Sarmatian nation, both of whom had been guilty of beginning a war of aggression.</p></div>

On this road is a suburb named Ladoceia after Ladocus, the son of Echemus, and after it is the site of what was in old times the city of Haemoniae. Its founder was Haemon the son of Lycaon, and the name of the place has remained Haemoniae to this day.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After Haemoniae on the right of the road are some noteworthy remains of the city of Oresthasium, especially the pillars of a sanctuary of Artemis, which still are there. The surname of Artemis is Priestess. On the straight road from Haemoniae is a place called Aphrodisium, and after it another, called Athenaeum. On the left of it is a temple of Athena with a stone image in it.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About twenty stades away from Athenaeum are ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Asea">Asea</placeName>, and the hill that once was the citadel has traces of fortifications to this day.

Near the source of the Alpheius is a temple of the Mother of the Gods without a roof, and two lions made of stone.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The waters of the Eurotas mingle with the Alpheius, and the united streams flow on for some twenty stades. Then they fall into a chasm, and the Eurotas comes again to the surface in the Lacedaemonian territory, the Alpheius at Pegae (Sources) in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>. From <placeName key="perseus,Asea">Asea</placeName> is an ascent up Mount Boreius, and on the top of the mountain are traces of a sanctuary.

The plain of Pallantium you reach by turning aside to the left from the <placeName key="tgn,1050634">Dyke</placeName>. In Pallantium is a temple with two stone images, one of Pallas, the other of Evander. There is also a sanctuary of the Maid, the daughter of Demeter, and not far away is a statue of Polybius. The hill above the city was of old used as a citadel. On the crest of the hill there still remains a sanctuary of certain gods.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Their surname is the Pure, and here it is customary to take the most solemn oaths. The names of the gods either they do not know, or knowing will not divulge; but it might be inferred that they were called Pure because Pallas did not sacrifice to them after the same fashion as his father sacrificed to Lycaean Zeus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the right of the so-called <placeName key="tgn,1050634">Dyke</placeName> lies the Manthuric plain.

On the right of the road is a small mountain called Mount Cresius, on which stands the sanctuary of Aphneius. For Ares, the Tegeans say, mated with Aerope, daughter of Cepheus, the son of Aleus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>She died in giving birth to a child, who clung to his mother even when she was dead, and sucked great abundance of milk from her breasts. Now this took place by the will of Ares, and because of it they name the god Aphneius (Abundant); but the name given to the hill was, it is said, Aeropus. There is on the way to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> a fountain called Leuconian. They say that Apheidas was the father of Leucone, and not far from <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> is her tomb.</p></div>

But in the reign of Apheidas a ninth parish was added to them, namely Apheidantes. Of the modern city Aleus was founder.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Besides the exploits shared by the Tegeans with the Arcadians, which include the Trojan war, the Persian wars and the battle at Dipaea with the Lacedaemonians, the Tegeans have, besides the deeds already mentioned, the following claims of their own to fame. Ancaeus, the son of Lycurgus, though wounded, stood up to the Calydonian boar, which Atalanta shot at, being the first to hit the beast. For this feat she received, as a prize for valor, the head and hide of the boar.</p></div>

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The ancient sanctuary of Athena Alea was made for the Tegeans by Aleus.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is clear that Augustus was not the first to carry away from the vanquished votive offerings and images of gods, but was only following an old precedent.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The origin of the custom is said to be that Theseus, on his return from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, held games in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> in honor of Apollo, and crowned the victors with palm.

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>the women, they say, came on the scene and put the Lacedaemonians to flight. Marpessa, surnamed Choera, surpassed, they say, the other women in daring, while Charillus himself was one of the Spartan prisoners. The story goes on to say that he was set free without ransom, swore to the Tegeans that the Lacedaemonians would never again attack <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, and then broke his oath; that the women offered to Ares a sacrifice of victory on their own account without the men, and gave to the men no share in the meat of the victim. For this reason Ares got his surname.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also an altar of Zeus Teleius (Full-grown), with a square image, a shape of which the Arcadians seem to me to be exceedingly fond. There are also here tombs of Tegeates, the son of Lycaon, and of Maera, the wife of Tegeates. They say that Maera was a daughter of Atlas, and Homer makes mention of her in the passage<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.326">Hom.

This story is different from another, that Auge was brought to bed without her father's knowing it, and that Telephus was exposed on Mount Parthenius, the abandoned child being suckled by a deer.

He wished to model his whole life on Epaminondas, his wisdom and his achievements, but could not rise to his height in every respect.

To some of those who made good their escape Cleomenes offered terms, saying that he was beginning to repent his crime, and would treat with the Megalopolitans if they returned home; but Philopoemen induced the citizens at a meeting to win a return home by force of arms, and to refuse to negotiate or make a truce.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> another despot arose, Nabis, and the first of the Peloponnesians to be attacked by him were the Messenians.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Romans had equipped a fleet against Nabis, and Philopoemen was too enthusiastic to keep out of the quarrel.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For this reason, and because of his courage shown against both the despots, the Lacedaemonians offered him the house<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶκος</foreign>includes more than the buildings—slaves, implements, etc.</note> of Nabis, worth more than a hundred talents. But he scorned the wealth, and bade the Lacedaemonians court with gifts, not himself, but those who could persuade the many in the meeting of the Achaeans—a suggestion, it is said, directed against Timolaus.

After being appointed commander of the Achaeans for the eighth time, he reproached a man of no little distinction for having been captured alive by the enemy. Now at this time the Achaeans had a grievance against the Messenians, and Philopoemen, despatching Lycortas with the army to lay waste the land of the Messenians, was very anxious two or three days later, in spite of his seventy years and a severe attack of fever, to take his share in the expedition of Lycortas.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Immediate punishment for the murder overtook Leimon, for he was shot by Artemis.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The artist was Cheirisophus; he was a Cretan by race, but his date and teacher we do not know. The residence of Daedalus with Minos at <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName> secured for the Cretans a reputation for the making of wooden images also, which lasted for a long period.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Tegeans also have what they call a Common Hearth of the Arcadians. Here there is an image of Heracles, and on his thigh is represented a wound received in the first fight with the sons of Hippocoon. The lofty place, on which are most of the altars of the Tegeans, is called the place of Zeus Clarius (Of Lots), and it is plain that the god got his surname from the lots cast for the sons of Arcas. Here the Tegeans celebrate a feast every year.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is said that once at the time of the feast they were invaded by the Lacedaemonians. As it was snowing, these were chilled, and thus distressed by their armour, but the Tegeans, without their enemies knowing it, lighted a fire. So untroubled by the cold they donned, they say, their armour, went out against the Lacedaemonians, and had the better of the engagement. I also saw in <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>:—the house of Aleus, the tomb of Echemus, and the fight between Echemus and Hyllus carved in relief upon a slab.</p></div>

The foundations, too, of sanctuaries are still there. These altars are two stades from the wall; and about seven stades farther on is a sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed Lady of the Lake, with an image of ebony. The fashion of the workmanship is what the Greeks call Aeginetan. Some ten stades farther on are the ruins of a temple of Artemis Cnaceatis.</p></div>

The Boeotians as a race got their name from Boeotus, who, legend says, was the son of Itonus and the nymph Melanippe, and Itonus was the son of Amphictyon. The cities are called in some cases after men, but in most after women. The Plataeans were originally, in my opinion, sprung from the soil; their name comes from Plataea, whom they consider to be a daughter of the river Asopus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is clear that the Plataeans too were of old ruled by kings; for everywhere in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in ancient times, kingship and not democracy was the established form of government. But the Plataeans know of no king except Asopus and Cithaeron before him, holding that the latter gave his name to the mountain, the former to the river. I think that <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> also, after whom the city is named, was a daughter of King Asopus, and not of the river.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before the battle that the Athenians fought at Marathon, the Plataeans had no claim to renown. But they were present at the battle of Marathon, and later, when Xerxes came down to the sea, they bravely manned the fleet with the Athenians, and defended themselves in their own country against the general of Xerxes, Mardonius, the son of Gobryas. Twice it was their fate to be driven from their homes and to be taken back to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For in the war between the Peloponnesians and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians reduced <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> by siege, but it was restored<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0387">387 B.C</date></note> during the peace made by the Spartan Antalcidas between the Persians and the Greeks, and the Plataeans returned from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. But a second disaster was destined to befall them. There was no open war between <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; in fact the Plataeans declared that the peace with them still held, because when the Lacedaemonians seized the Cadmeia they had no part either in the plan or in the performance.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the Thebans maintained that as the Lacedaemonians had themselves made the peace and then broken it, all alike, in their view, were freed from its terms. The Plataeans, therefore, looked upon the attitude of the Thebans with suspicion, and maintained strict watch over their city. They did not go either daily to the fields at some distance from the city, but, knowing that the Thebans were wont to conduct their assemblies with every voter present, and at the same time to prolong their discussions, they waited for their assemblies to be called, and then, even those whose farms lay farthest away, looked after their lands at their leisure.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Neocles, who was at the time Boeotarch at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, not being unaware of the Plataean trick, proclaimed that every Theban should attend the assembly armed, and at once proceeded to lead them, not by the direct way from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> across the plain, but along the road to Hysiae in the direction of Eleutherae and <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, where not even a scout had been placed by the Plataeans, being due to reach the walls about noon.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Plataeans, thinking that the Thebans were holding an assembly, were afield and cut off from their gates. With those caught within the city the Thebans came to terms, allowing them to depart before sundown, the men with one garment each, the women with two. What happened to the Plataeans on this occasion was the reverse of what happened to them formerly when they were taken by the Lacedaemonians under Archidamus. For the Lacedaemonians reduced them by preventing them from getting out of the city, building a double line of circumvallation; the Thebans on this occasion by preventing them from getting within their walls.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The second capture of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> occurred two years before the battle of Leuctra,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0373">373 B.C</date></note> when Asteius was Archon at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.

Once they were cities of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, and even at the present day among the ruins of Hysiae are a half-finished temple of Apollo and a sacred well. According to the Boeotian story oracles were obtained of old from the well by drinking of it.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Returning to the highway you again see on the right a tomb, said to be that of Mardonius. It is agreed that the body of Mardonius was not seen again after the battle, but there is not a similar agreement as to the person who gave it burial. It is admitted that Artontes, son of Mardonius, gave many gifts to Dionysophanes the Ephesian, but also that he gave them to others of the Ionians, in recognition that they too had spent some pains on the burial of Mardonius.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This road leads to <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> from Eleutherae. On the road from <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> there is a spring on the right, and a little farther on a rock. It is called the bed of Actaeon, for it is said that he slept thereon when weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while Artemis was bathing in it. Stesichorus of Himera says that the goddess cast a deer-skin round Actaeon to make sure that his hounds would kill him, so as to prevent his taking Semele to wife.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>My own view is that without divine interference the hounds of Actaeon were smitten with madness, and so they were sure to tear to pieces without distinction everybody they chanced to meet. Whereabouts on Cithaeron the disaster befell Pentheus, the son of Echion, or where Oedipus was exposed at birth, nobody knows with the assurance with which we know the Cleft Road to <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, where Oedipus killed his father (Mount Cithaeron is sacred to Cithaeronian Zeus), as I shall tell of<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 10.5.3">Paus. 10.5.3</bibl>.</note> at greater length when this place in my story has been reached.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Roughly at the entrance into <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> are the graves of those who fought against the Persians. Of the Greeks generally there is a common tomb, but the Lacedaemonians and Athenians who fell have separate graves, on which are written elegiac verses by Simonides. Not far from the common tomb of the Greeks is an altar of Zeus, God of Freedom.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This then is of bronze, but the altar and the image he made of white marble.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Even at the present day they hold every four years games called Eleutheria (Of Freedom), in which great prizes are offered for running.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Advancing in the city itself from the altar and the image which have been made to Zeus of Freedom, you come to a hero-shrine of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. The legends about her, and my own conjectures, I have already<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="paus. 9.1">paus. 9.1</bibl>.</note> stated. There is at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> a temple of Hera, worth seeing for its size and for the beauty of its images. On entering you see Rhea carrying to Cronus the stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, as though it were the babe to which she had given birth. The Hera they call Full-grown; it is an upright image of huge size. Both figures are of Pentelic marble, and the artist was Praxiteles.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here too is another image of Hera; it is seated, and was made by Callimachus. The goddess they call the Bride for the following reason.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="3" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hera, they say, was for some reason or other angry with Zeus, and had retreated to <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>. Zeus, failing to make her change her mind, visited Cithaeron, at that time despot in <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, who surpassed all men for his cleverness. So he ordered Zeus to make an image of wood, and to carry it, wrapped up, in a bullock wagon, and to say that he was celebrating his marriage with <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, the daughter of Asopus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Zeus followed the advice of Cithaeron. Hera heard the news at once, and at once appeared on the scene. But when she came near the wagon and tore away the dress from the image, she was pleased at the deceit, on finding it a wooden image and not a bride, and was reconciled to Zeus. To commemorate this reconciliation they celebrate a festival called Daedala, because the men of old time gave the name of daedala to wooden images. My own view is that this name was given to wooden images before Daedalus, the son of Palamaon, was born at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and that he did not receive this name at birth, but that it was a surname afterwards given him from the daedala.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So the Plataeans hold the festival of the Daedala every six years, according to the local guide, but really at a shorter interval. I wanted very much to calculate exactly the interval between one Daedala and the next, but I was unable to do so. In this way they celebrate the feast.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Not far from Alalcomenae is a grove of oaks. Here the trunks of the oaks are the largest in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>. To this grove come the Plataeans, and lay out portions of boiled flesh. They keep a strict watch on the crows which flock to them, but they are not troubled at all about the other birds. They mark carefully the tree on which a crow settles with the meat he has seized. They cut down the trunk of the tree on which the crow has settled, and make of it the daedalum; for this is the name that they give to the wooden image also.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This feast the Plataeans celebrate by themselves, calling it the Little Daedala, but the Great Daedala, which is shared with them by the Boeotians, is a festival held at intervals of fifty-nine years, for that is the period during which, they say, the festival could not be held, as the Plataeans were in exile. There are fourteen wooden images ready, having been provided each year at the Little Daedala.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lots are cast for them by the Plataeans, Coronaeans, Thespians, Tanagraeans, Chaeroneans, Orchomenians, Lebadeans, and Thebans; for at the time when Cassander, the son of Antipater, rebuilt <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the Thebans wished to be reconciled with the Plataeans, to share in the common assembly, and to send a sacrifice to the Daedala. The towns of less account pool their funds for images.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Bringing the image to the Asopus, and setting it upon a wagon, they place a bridesmaid also on the wagon. They again cast lots for the position they are to hold in the procession. After this they drive the wagons from the river to the summit of Cithaeron. On the peak of the mountain an altar has been prepared, which they make after the following way. They fit together quadrangular pieces of wood, putting them together just as if they were making a stone building, and having raised it to a height they place brushwood upon the altar.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The cities with their magistrates sacrifice severally a cow to Hera and a bull to Zeus, burning on the altar the victims, full of wine and incense, along with the daedala. Rich people, as individuals, sacrifice what they wish; but the less wealthy sacrifice the smaller cattle; all the victims alike are burned. The fire seizes the altar and the victims as well, and consumes them all together. I know of no blaze that is so high, or seen so far as this.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About fifteen stades below the peak, on which they make the altar, is a cave of the Cithaeronian nymphs. It is named Sphragidium, and the story is that of old the nymphs gave oracles in this place.</p></div>

The Ectenes perished, they say, by pestilence, and after them there settled in the land the Hyantes and the Aones, who I think were Boeotian tribes and not foreigners.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Phoenician army under Cadmus invaded the land these tribes were defeated; the Hyantes fled from the land when night came, but the Aones begged for mercy, and were allowed by Cadmus to remain and unite with the Phoenicians.

Afterwards the city grew, and so the Cadmeia became the citadel of the lower city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Cadmus made a brilliant marriage, if, as the Greek legend says, he indeed took to wife a daughter of Aphrodite and Ares.

As I was unable to discover anything new about these men, I adopt the story that makes their name result from the way in which they came into being. When Cadnius migrated to the Illyrian tribe of the Encheleans, Polydorus his son got the kingdom.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now Pentheus the son of Echion was also powerful by reason of his noble birth and friendship with the king. Being a man of insolent character who had shown impiety to Dionysus, he was punished by the god. Polydorus had a son, Labdacus.

<div n="6" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of the successes and failures of the Thebans in battle I found the most famous to be the following. They were overcome in battle by the Athenians, who had come to the aid of the Plataeans, when a war had arisen about the boundaries of their territory. They met with a second disaster when arrayed against the Athenians at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0479">479 B.C</date></note> at the time when they are considered to have chosen the cause of King Xerxes rather than that of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Theban people are in no way responsible for this choice, as at that time an oligarchy was in power at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and not their ancestral form of government. In the same way, if it had been while Peisistratus or his sons still held <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> under a despotism that the foreigner had invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, the Athenians too would certainly have been accused of favouring <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Afterwards, however, the Thebans won a victory over the Athenians at <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName> in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0424">424 B.C</date></note> where the Athenian general Hippocrates, son of Ariphron, perished with the greater part of the army. During the period that began with the departure of the Persians and ended with the war between <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, the relations between <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and the Lacedaemonians were friendly.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Overcome in battle at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and Coroncia, they won on the other hand at Leuctra the most famous victory we know of gained by Greeks over Greeks. They put down the boards of ten, which the Lacedaemonians had set up in the cities, and drove out the Spartan governors. Afterwards they also waged for ten years consecutively the Phocian war, called by the Greeks the Sacred war.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have already said in my history of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.25.3">Paus. 1.25.3</bibl>.</note> that the defeat at Chaeroneia was a disaster for all the Greeks; but it was even more so for the Thebans, as a garrison was brought into their city. When Philip died, and the kingship of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> devolved on Alexander, the Thebans succeeded in destroying the garrison. But as soon as they had done so, heaven warned them of the destruction that was coming on them, and the signs that occurred in the sanctuary of Demeter Lawgiver were the opposite of those that occurred before the action at Leuctra.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For then spiders spun a white web over the door of the sanctuary, but on the approach of Alexander with his Macedonians the web was black. It is also said that there was a shower of ashes at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the year before the war waged against them by Sulla, which brought on them such great sufferings.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="7" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On this occasion the Thebans were removed from their homes by Alexander, and straggled to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; afterwards they were restored by Cassander, son of Antipater. Heartiest in their support of the restoration of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> were the Athenians, and they were helped by Messenians and the Arcadians of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>My own view is that in building Thebes Cassander was mainly influenced by hatred of Alexander. He destroyed the whole house of Alexander to the bitter end. Olympias he threw to the exasperated Macedonians to be stoned to death; and the sons of Alexander, Heracles by Barsina and Alexander by Roxana, he killed by poison. But he himself was not to come to a good end. He was filled with dropsy, and from the dropsy came worms while he was yet alive.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Philip, the eldest of his sons, shortly after coming to the throne was seized by a wasting disease which proved fatal. Antipater, the next son, murdered his mother Thessalonice, the daughter of Philip, son of Amyntas, and of Nicasipolis, charging her with being too fond of Alexander, who was the youngest of Cassander's sons. Getting the support of Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, he deposed with his help and punished his brother Antipater. However, it appeared that in Demetrius he found a murderer and not an ally.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So some god was to exact from Cassander a just requital. In the time of Cassander all the ancient circuit of the Theban walls was rebuilt, but fate after all willed that afterwards the Thebans were again to taste the cup of great misfortune. For when Mithridates had begun the war with the Romans, he was joined by the Thebans, for no other reason, in my opinion, except their friendship for the Athenian people. But when Sulla invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, terror seized the Thebans; they at once changed sides, and sought the friendship of the Romans.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Sulla nevertheless was angry with them, and among his plans to humble them was to cut away one half of their territory. His pretext was as follows. When he began the war against Mithridates, he was short of funds. So he collected offerings from <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, those at <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, and all those at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> that had been left by the Phocians.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These he divided among his soldiery, and repaid the gods with half of the Theban territory. Although by favour of the Romans the Thebans afterwards recovered the land of which they had been deprived, yet from this point they sank into the greatest depths of weakness. The lower city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is all deserted to-day, except the sanctuaries, and the people live on the citadel, which they call <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and not Cadmeia.</p></div>

This story others can believe if they wish.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here there is also a temple of Dionysus Goat-shooter. For once, when they were sacrificing to the god, they grew so violent with wine that they actually killed the priest of Dionysus. Immediately after the murder they were visited by a pestilence, and the Delphic oracle said that to cure it they must sacrifice a boy in the bloom of youth. A few years afterwards, so they say, the god substituted a goat as a victim in place of their boy. In <placeName key="perseus,Potniae">Potniae</placeName> is also shown a well.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the circuit of the ancient wall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> were gates seven in number, and these remain to-day. One got its name, I learned, from Electra, the sister of Cadmus, and another, the Proetidian, from a native of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. He was Proetus, but I found it difficult to discover his date and lineage. The Neistan gate, they say, got its name for the following reason. The last of the harp's strings they call nete, and Amphion invented it, they say, at this gate. I have also heard that the son of Zethus, the brother of Amphion, was named Neis, and that after him was this gate called.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Crenaean gate and the Hypsistan they so name for the following reason. . . and by the Hypsistan is a sanctuary of Zeus surnamed Hypsistus (Most High). Next after these gates is the one called Ogygian, and lastly the Homoloid gate. It appeared to me too that the name of the last was the most recent, and that of the Ogygian the most ancient.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The name Homoloid is derived, they say, from the following circumstance. When the Thebans were beaten in battle by the Argives near <placeName key="perseus,Glisas">Glisas</placeName>, most of them withdrew along with Laodamas, the son of Eteocles. A portion of them shrank from the journey to <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>, and turning aside to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> they seized Homole, the most fertile and best-watered of the Thessalian mountains.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When they were recalled to their homes by Thersander, the son of Polyneices, they called the gate, through which they passed on their return, the Homoloid gate after Homole.

In the case of the war between the Eleusinians and the rest of the Athenians, and likewise in that between the Thebans and the Minyans, the attackers had but a short distance through which to pass to the fight, and one battle decided the war, immediately after which hostilities ceased and peace was made.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army marched from mid-<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> to mid-<placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, while Adrastus collected his allied forces out of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and from the Messenians, and likewise mercenaries came to the help of the Thebans from <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, and the Phlegyans from the Minyan country. When the battle took place at the Ismenian sanctuary, the Thebans were worsted in the encounter, and after the rout took refuge within their fortifications.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As the Peloponnesians did not know how to assail the walls, and attacked with greater spirit than knowledge, many of them were killed by missiles hurled from the walls by the Thebans, who afterwards sallied forth and overcame the rest while they were in disorder, so that the whole army was destroyed with the exception of Adrastus. But the action was attended by severe losses to the Thebans, and from that time they term a Cadmean victory one that brings destruction to the victors.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A few years afterwards <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was attacked by Thersander and those whom the Greeks call Epigoni (Born later).

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Some of the Thebans escaped with Laodamas immediately after their defeat; those who remained behind were besieged and taken. About this war an epic poem also was written called the <title><placeName key="tgn,4011135">Thebaid</placeName></title>. This poem is mentioned by Callinus, who says that the author was Homer, and many good authorities agree with his judgment.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the right of the gate is a hill sacred to Apollo. Both the hill and the god are called Ismenian, as the river Ismenus Rows by the place. First at the entrance are Athena and Hermes, stone figures and named Pronai (Of the fore-temple). The Hermes is said to have been made by Pheidias, the Athena by Scopas. The temple is built behind. The image is in size equal to that at <placeName key="tgn,7002494">Branchidae</placeName>; and does not differ from it at all in shape. Whoever has seen one of these two images, and learnt who was the artist, does not need much skill to discern, when he looks at the other, that it is a work of Canachus.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following custom is, to my knowledge, still carried out in <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>. A boy of noble family, who is himself both handsome and strong, is chosen priest of Ismenian Apollo for a year. He is called Laurel-bearer, for the boys wear wreaths of laurel leaves. I cannot say for certain whether all alike who have worn the laurel dedicate by custom a bronze tripod to the god; but I do not think that it is the rule for all, because I did not see many votive tripods there. But the wealthier of the boys do certainly dedicate them. Most remarkable both for its age and for the fame of him who dedicated it is a tripod dedicated by Amphitryon for Heracles after he had worn the laurel.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Higher up than the Ismenian sanctuary you may see the fountain which they say is sacred to Ares, and they add that a dragon was posted by Ares as a sentry over the spring. By this fountain is the grave of Caanthus. They say that he was brother to Melia and son to Ocean, and that he was commissioned by his father to seek his sister, who had been carried away. Finding that Apollo had Melia, and being unable to get her from him, he dared to set fire to the precinct of Apollo that is now called the Ismenian sanctuary. The god, according to the Thebans, shot him.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here then is the tomb of Caanthus. They say that Apollo had sons by Melia, to wit, Tenerus and Ismenus.

The image, of white marble, is called Champion, and the Thebans Xenocritus and Eubius were the artists. But the ancient wooden image is thought by the Thebans to be by Daedalus, and the same opinion occurred to me. It was dedicated, they say, by Daedalus himself, as a thank-offering for a benefit. For when he was fleeing from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> in small vessels which he had made for himself and his son Icarus, he devised for the ships sails, an invention as yet unknown to the men of those times, so as to take advantage of a favorable wind and outsail the oared fleet of Minos.

For at <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName> also there is a sanctuary of Voices outside the wall and beyond the city.</p></div>

<div n="12" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Thebans in ancient days used to sacrifice bulls to Apollo of the Ashes. Once when the festival was being held, the hour of the sacrifice was near but those sent to fetch the bull had not arrived. And so, as a wagon happened to be near by, they sacrificed to the god one of the oxen, and ever since it has been the custom to sacrifice working oxen. The following story also is current among the Thebans. As Cadmus was leaving <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> by the road to <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, a cow, it is said, guided him on his way. This cow was one bought from the herdsmen of Pelagon, and on each of her sides was a white mark like the orb of a full moon.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the oracle of the god had said that Cadmus and the host with him were to make their dwelling where the cow was going to sink down in weariness. So this is one of the places that they point out. Here there is in the open an altar and an image of Athena, said to have been dedicated by Cadmus. Those who think that the Cadmus who came to the Theban land was an Egyptian, and not a Phoenician, have their opinion contradicted by the name of this Athena, because she is called by the Phoenician name of Onga, and not by the Egyptian name of Sais.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Thebans assert that on the part of their citadel, where to-day stands their market-place, was in ancient times the house of Cadmus. They point out the ruins of the bridal-chamber of Harmonia, and of one which they say was Semele's into the latter they allow no man to step even now. Those Greeks who allow that the Muses sang at the wedding of Harmonia, can point to the spot in the market-place where it is said that the goddesses sang.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a story that along with the thunderbolt hurled at the bridalchamber of Semele there fell a log from heaven. They say that Polydorus adorned this log with bronze and called it Dionysus Cadmus. Near is an image of Dionysus; Onasimedes made it of solid bronze. The altar was built by the sons of Praxiteles.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is a statue of Pronomus, a very great favorite with the people for his playing on the flute. For a time flute-players had three forms of the flute. On one they played Dorian music; for Phrygian melodies flutes of a different pattern were made; what is called the Lydian mode was played on flutes of a third kind. It was Pronomus who first devised a flute equally suited for every kind of melody, and was the first to play on the same instrument music so vastly different in form.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is also said that he gave his audience untold delight by the expression of his face and by the movement of his whole body. He also composed for the Chalcidians on the Euripus a processional tune for their use in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. So the Thebans set up here a statue of this man, and like-wise one of Epaminondas, son of Polymnis.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Epaminondas had famous ancestors, but his father had less wealth than a Theban of ordinary means. He was most thoroughly taught all the subjects of the national education, and when a young man went to receive instruction from Lysis, a Tarentine by descent, learned in the philosophy of Pythagoras the Samian. When <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> was at war with <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>, Epaminondas is said to have been sent with certain others from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to help the Lacedaemonians. In the battle Pelopidas received wounds, but his life was saved by Epaminondas at the greatest risk to his own.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Later on, when Epaminondas had come to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> as an envoy, what time the Lacedaemonians said they were concluding with the Greeks the peace called the Peace of Antalcidas,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0378">378 B.C</date></note> Agesilaus asked him whether they would allow each Boeotian city to swear to the peace separately. He replied: “No, Spartans, not before we see your vassals<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">“Neighbors,” Perioeci, <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>'s free neighbors with no political rights.</note> taking the oath city by city.”</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the war between <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> had already broken out, and the Lacedaemonians were advancing to attack the Thebans with a force of their own men and of their allies, Epaminondas with a part of the army occupied to meet them a position above the Cephisian lake, under the impression that at this point the Peloponnesians would make their invasion. But Cleombrotus, the king of the Lacedaemonians, turned towards Ambrossus in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>. He massacred a Theban force under Chaereas, who was under orders to guard the passes, crossed the high ground and reached Leuctra in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here heaven sent signs to the Lacedaemonian people and to Cleombrotus personally.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0371">371 B.C</date></note> The Lacedaemonian kings were accompanied on their expeditions by sheep, to serve as sacrifices to the gods and to give fair omens before battles. The flocks were led on the march by she-goats, called katoiades by the herdsmen. On this occasion, then, the wolves dashed on the flock, did no harm at all to the sheep, but killed the goats called katoiades.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was also said that the wrath of the daughters of Scedasus fell upon the Lacedaemonians. Scedasus, who lived near Leuctra, had two daughters, Molpia and Hippo. These in the bloom of their youth were wickedly outraged by two Lacedaemonians, Phrurarchidas and Parthenius. The maidens, unable to bear the shame of their violation, immediately hanged themselves. Scedasus repaired to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, but meeting with no justice returned to Leuctra and committed suicide.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Well, on this occasion Epaminondas sacrificed with prayers to Scedasus and his girls, implying that the battle would be to avenge them no less than to secure the salvation of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. The Boeotarchs were not agreed, but differed widely in their opinions. For Epaminondas, Malgis and Xenocrates were minded to do battle with the Lacedaemonians at once, but Damocleidas, Damophilus and Simangelus were against joining in battle, and urged that they should put wives and children safely out of the way in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and prepare to undergo a siege themselves.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So divergent were the views of the six. The seventh Boeotarch, whose name was Brachyllides, was guarding the pass by Cithaeron, and on his return to the army added his vote to the side of Epaminondas, and then there was a unanimous decision to try the ordeal of battle.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But Epaminondas had his suspicions of some of the Boeotians especially of the Thespians. Fearing, therefore, lest they should desert during the engagement, he permitted all who would to leave the camp and go home. The Thespians left with all their forces, as did any other Boeotians who felt annoyed with the Thebans.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the battle joined, the allies of the Lacedaemonians, who had hitherto been not the best of friends, now showed most clearly their hostility, by their reluctance to stand their ground, and by giving way wherever the enemy attacked them. The Lacedaemonians themselves and the Thebans were not badly matched adversaries. The former had their previous experience, and their shame of lessening the reputation of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; the Thebans realized that what was at stake was their country, their wives and their children.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when king Cleombrotus with several Lacedaemonian magistrates had fallen, the Spartans were bound by necessity not to give way, in spite of their distress. For among the Lacedaemonians it was considered the greatest disgrace to allow the body of a king to come into the hands of enemies.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The victory of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was the most famous ever won by Greeks over Greeks. The Lacedaemonians on the following day were minded to bury their dead, and sent a herald to the Thebans. But Epaminondas, knowing that the Lacedaemonians were always inclined to cover up their disasters, said that he permitted their allies first to take up their dead, and only when these had done so did he approve of the Lacedaemonians' burying their own dead.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Some of the allies took up no dead at all, as not a man of them had fallen; others had but slight loss to report. So when the Lacedaemonians proceeded to bury their own, it was at once proved that the fallen were Spartans. The loss of the Thebans and of such Boeotians as remained loyal amounted to forty-seven, but of the Lacedaemonians themselves there fell more than a thousand men.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="14" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the battle Epaminondas for a while, having proclaimed that the other Peloponnesians should depart home, kept the Lacedaemonians cooped up in Leuctra. But when reports came that the Spartans in the city were marching to a man to the help of their countrymen at Leuctra, Epaminondas allowed his enemy to depart under a truce, saying that it would be better for the Boeotians to shift the war from <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Thespians, apprehensive because of the ancient hostility of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and its present good fortune, resolved to abandon their city and to seek a refuge in Ceressus. It is a stronghold in the land of the Thespians, in which once in days of old they had established themselves to meet the invasion of the Thessalians. On that occasion the Thessalians tried to take Ceressus, but success seemed hopeless. So they consulted the god at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>,</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>and received the following response:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">A care to me is shady Leuctra, and so is the Alesian soil;</l><l>A care to me are the two sorrowful girls of Scedasus.</l><l>There a tearful battle is nigh, and no one will foretell it,</l><l>Until the Dorians have lost their glorious youth,</l><l>When the day of fate has come.</l><l>Then may Ceressus be captured, but at no other time.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the latter occasion Epaminondas captured the Thespians who had taken refuge in Ceressus, and immediately afterwards devoted his attention to the situation in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, to which also the Arcadians were eagerly inviting him. On his arrival he won the willing support of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, while he collected again into their ancient city the Mantineans, who had been scattered into village communities by Agesipolis. He persuaded the Arcadians to destroy all their weak towns, and built them a home where they could live together, which even at the present day is called <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> (Great City).</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The period of his office as Boeotarch had now expired, and death was the penalty fixed if a man exceeded it. So Epaminondas, disregarding the law as out of date, remained in office, marched to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> with his army, and when Agesilaus did not come out to meet him, turned to the founding of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. Epaminondas, was the founder of the modern <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and the history of its foundation I have included in my account of the Messenians themselves.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Meanwhile the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> scattered and overran the Laconian territory, pillaging what it contained. This persuaded Epaminondas to lead the Thebans back to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>. In his advance with the army he came over against Lechaeum, and was about to cross the narrow and difficult parts of the road, when Iphicrates, the son of Timotheus, attacked the Thebans with a force of targeteers and other Athenians.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Epaminondas put his assailants to flight and came right up to the very city of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but as Iphicrates dissuaded the Athenians from coming out to fight, he proceeded to march back to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.

<div n="15" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After these things when Alexander held sway in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, Pelopidas came to him, under the impression that he was well-disposed to him personally as well as a friend to the Theban commonwealth, but on his arrival was treacherously and insolently thrown into prison and kept there by Alexander. The Thebans at once set out to attack Alexander, and made leaders of the expedition Cleomenes and Hypatus, who were Boeotarchs at that time; Epaminondas was serving in the ranks.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the force had reached the other side of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, Alexander surprised and attacked it on difficult ground.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the absence of Epaminondas the Thebans removed the Orchomenians from their land. Epaminondas regarded their removal as a disaster, and declared that had he been present never would the Thebans have been guilty of such an outrage.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Elected again to be Boeotarch, and again invading the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> with an army of Boeotians, he overcame the Lacedaemonians in a battle at Lechaeum, and with them Achaeans of <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> and Athenians led from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Chabrias.

<div n="16" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the claims to fame of Epaminondas. Not far away is a temple of Ammon; the image, a work of Calamis, was dedicated by Pindar, who also sent to the Ammonians of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> a hymn to Ammon. This hymn I found still carved on a triangular slab by the side of the altar dedicated to Ammon by Ptolemy the son of Lagus. After the sanctuary of Ammon at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> comes what is called the bird-observatory of Teiresias, and near it is a sanctuary of Fortune, who carries the child Wealth.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>According to the Thebans, the hands and face of the image were made by Xenophon the Athenian, the rest of it by Callistonicus, a native. It was a clever idea of these artists to place Wealth in the arms of Fortune, and so to suggest that she is his mother or nurse. Equally clever was the conception of Cephisodotus, who made the image of Peace for the Athenians with Wealth in her arms.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> are three wooden images of Aphrodite, so very ancient that they are actually said to be votive offerings of Harmonia, and the story is that they were made out of the wooden figure-heads on the ships of <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName>. They call the first Heavenly, the second Common, and the third Rejecter. Harmoina gave to Aphrodite the surname of Heavenly</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>to signify a love pure and free from bodily lust; that of Common, to denote sexual intercourse; the third, that of Rejecter, that mankind might reject unlawful passion and sinful acts. For Harmonia knew of many crimes already perpetrated not only among foreigners but even by Greeks, similar to those attributed later by legend to the mother of Adonis, to Phaedra, the daughter of Minos, and to the Thracian Tereus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The sanctuary of Demeter Lawgiver is said to have been at one time the house of Cadmus and his descendants. The image of Demeter is visible down to the chest. Here have been dedicated bronze shields, said to be those of Lacedaemonian officers who fell at Leuctra.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near the Proetidian gate is built a theater, and quite close to the theater is a temple of Dionysus surnamed Deliverer. For when some Theban prisoners in the hands of Thracians had reached Haliartia on their march, they were delivered by the god, who gave up the sleeping Thracians to be put to death. One of the two images here the Thebans say is Semele. Once in each year, they say, they open the sanctuary on stated days.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are also ruins of the house of Lycus, and the tomb of Semele, but Alcmena has no tomb. It is said that on her death she was turned from human form to a stone, but the Theban account does not agree with the Megarian. The Greek legends generally have for the most part different versions. Here too at <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName> are the tombs of the children of Amphion. The boys lie apart; the girls are buried by themselves.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="17" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Near is the temple of Artemis of Fair Fame. The image was made by Scopas. They say that within the sanctuary were buried Androcleia and Aleis, daughters of Antipoenus. For when Heracles and the Thebans were about to engage in battle with the Orchomenians, an oracle was delivered to them that success in the war would be theirs if their citizen of the most noble descent would consent to die by his own hand. Now Antipoenus, who had the most famous ancestors, was loath to die for the people, but his daughters were quite ready to do so. So they took their own lives and are honored therefor.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Before the temple of Artemis of Fair Fame is a lion made of stone, said to have been dedicated by Heracles after he had conquered in the battle the Orchomenians and their king, Erginus son of Clymenus. Near it is Apollo surnamed Rescuer, and Hermes called of the Market-place, another of the votive offerings of Pindar. The pyre of the children of Amphion is about half a stade from the graves. The ashes from the pyre are still there.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near this are two stone images of Athena, surnamed Girder, said to have been dedicated by Amphitryon.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The second reading mentioned in the critical note would give the translation:— “two images, dedicated by Amphitryon, . . . said to be of Athena, etc.”</note> For here, they say, he put on his armour when he was about to give battle to Chalcodon and the Euboeans. It seems that the ancients used the verb “to gird oneself” in the sense of “to put on one's armour,” and so they say that when Homer compares Agamemnon to Ares “in respect of his girdle,” he is really saying that they were alike in the fashion of their armour.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The tomb shared by Zethus and Amphion is a small mound of earth. The inhabitants of <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> like to steal earth from it when the sun is passing through the constellation Taurus. For if at that time they take earth from the mound and set it on Antiope's tomb, the land of <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> will yield a harvest, but that of <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName> be less fertile. For this reason the Thebans at that time keep watch over the tomb.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Both these cities hold this belief, and they do so because of the oracles of Bacis, in which are the lines:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">But when a man of Tithorea to Amphion and to Zethus</l><l>Pours on the earth peace-offerings of libation and prayer,</l><l>When Taurus is warmed by the might of the glorious sun,</l><l>Beware then of no slight disaster threatening the city;</l><l>For the harvest wastes away in it,</l><l>When they take of the earth, and bring it to the tomb of Phocus.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Bacis calls it the tomb of Phocus for the following reason. The wife of Lycus worshipped Dionysus more than any other deity. When she had suffered what the story says she suffered, Dionysus was angry with Antiope. For some reason extravagant punishments always arouse the resentment of the gods. They say that Antiope went mad, and when out of her wits roamed all over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; but Phocus, son of Ornytion, son of Sisyphus, chanced to meet her, cured her madness, and then married her.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So Antiope and Phocus share the same grave. The roughly quarried stones, laid along the tomb of Amphion at its base, are said to be the very rocks that followed the singing of Amphion. A similar story is told of Orpheus, how wild creatures followed him as he played the harp.</p></div>

There is also another legend, which tells of a fox called the Teumessian fox, how owing to the wrath of Dionysus the beast was reared to destroy the Thebans, and how, when about to be caught by the hound given by Artemis to Procris the daughter of Erechtheus, the fox was turned into a stone, as was likewise this hound. In Teumessus there is also a sanctuary of Telchinian Athena, which contains no image. As to her surname, we may hazard the conjecture that a division of the Telchinians who once dwelt in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> came to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and established a sanctuary of Telchinian Athena.</p></div>

This snake, whatever it was, popped its head, they say, out of its hole here, and Teiresias, chancing to meet it, cut off the head with his sword. This then is how the place got its name. Above <placeName key="perseus,Glisas">Glisas</placeName> is a mountain called Supreme, and on it a temple and image of Supreme Zeus. The river, a torrent, they call the Thermodon.

The former got its name, according to the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, because the chariot of Amphiaraus disappeared here, and not where the Thebans say it did. Both peoples agree that Mycalessus was so named because the cow lowed (emykesato) here that was guiding Cadmus and his host to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.

They say that each night it is shut up and opened again by Heracles, and that Heracles is one of what are called the Idaean Dactyls. Here is shown the following marvel. Before the feet of the image they place all the fruits of autumn, and these remain fresh throughout all the year.</p></div>

Here there is a temple of Artemis with two images of white marble; one carries torches, and the other is like to one shooting an arrow. The story is that when, in obedience to the soothsaying of Calchas, the Greeks were about to sacrifice Iphigeneia on the altar, the goddess substituted a deer to be the victim instead of her.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Within the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> is what is called <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName> on Sea. In it are images of Artemis and Leto. The people of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> say that their founder was Poemander, the son of Chaeresilaus, the son of Iasius, the son of Eleuther, who, they say, was the son of Apollo by Aethusa, the daughter of Poseidon. It is said that Poemander married <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, a daughter of Aeolus. But in a poem of Corinna she is said to be a daughter of Asopus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is a story that, as she reached extreme old age, her neighbors ceased to call her by this name, and gave the name of Graea (old woman), first to the woman herself, and in course of time to the city. The name, they say, persisted so long that even Homer says in the Catalogue:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Thespeia, Graea, and wide Mycalessus.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.498">Hom.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is in <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> the tomb of Orion, and Mount Cerycius, the reputed birthplace of Hermes, and also a place called Polus. Here they say that Atlas sat and meditated deeply upon hell and heaven, as Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.52">Hom.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the temple of Dionysus the image too is worth seeing, being of Parian marble and a work of Calamis. But a greater marvel still is the Triton. The grander of the two versions of the Triton legend relates that the women of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> before the orgies of Dionysus went down to the sea to be purified, were attacked by the Triton as they were swimming, and prayed that Dionysus would come to their aid. The god, it is said, heard their cry and overcame the Triton in the fight. </p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The other version is less grand but more credible. It says that the Triton would waylay and lift all the cattle that were driven to the sea. He used even to attack small vessels, until the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> set out for him a bowl of wine. They say that, attracted by the smell, he came at once, drank the wine, flung himself on the shore and slept, and that a man of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> struck him on the neck with an axe and chopped off his head. for this reason the image has no head. And because they caught him drunk, it is supposed that it was Dionysus who killed him.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I saw another Triton among the curiosities at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, less in size than the one at <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>. The Tritons have the following appearance. On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs not only in color, but also in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under their ears they have gills and a man's nose; but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue, and they have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the breast and belly is a tail like a dolphin's instead of feet.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I saw also the Ethiopian bulls, called rhinoceroses owing to the fact that each has one horn (ceras) at the end of the nose (rhis), over which is another but smaller one, but there is no trace of horns on their heads. I saw too the Paeonian bulls, which are shaggy all over, but especially about the chest and lower jaw. I saw also Indian camels with the color of leopards.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a beast called the elk, in form between a deer and a camel, which breeds in the land of the Celts. Of all the beasts we know it alone cannot be tracked or seen at a distance by man; sometimes, however, when men are out hunting other game they fall in with an elk by luck. Now they say that it smells man even at a great distance, and dashes down into ravines or the deepest caverns. So the hunters surround the plain or mountain in a circuit of at least a thousand stades, and, taking care not to break the circle, they keep on narrowing the area enclosed, and so catch all the beasts inside, the elks included. But if there chance to be no lair within, there is no other way of catching the elk.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The beast described by Ctesias in his Indian history, which he says is called martichoras by the Indians and man-eater by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the tiger. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters, while it hurls them like an archer's arrows at more distant enemies; all this is, I think, a false story that the Indians pass on from one to another owing to their excessive dread of the beast.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They were also deceived about its color, and whenever the tiger showed itself in the light of the sun it appeared to be a homogeneous red, either because of its speed, or, if it were not running, because of its continual twists and turns, especially when it was not seen at close quarters. And I think that if one were to traverse the most remote parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, in search of such beasts as are found in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, some he would not discover at all, and others would have a different appearance.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For man is not the only creature that has a different appearance in different climates and in different countries; the others too obey the same rule. For instance, the Libyan asps have a different colors compared with the Egyptian, while in <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName> are bred asps quite as black as the men. So everyone should be neither over-hasty in one's judgments, nor incredulous when considering rarities. For instance, though I have never seen winged snakes I believe that they exist, as I believe that a Phrygian brought to <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> a scorpion with wings exactly like those of locusts.</p></div>

<div n="22" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beside the sanctuary of Dionysus at <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> are three temples, one of Themis, another of Aphrodite, and the third of Apollo; with Apollo are joined Artemis and Leto. There are sanctuaries of Hermes Ram-bearer and of Hermes called Champion. They account for the former surname by a story that Hermes averted a pestilence from the city by carrying a ram round the walls; to commemorate this Calamis made an image of Hermes carrying a ram upon his shoulders. Whichever of the youths is judged to be the most handsome goes round the walls at the feast of Hermes, carrying a lamb on his shoulders.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Hermes Champion is said, on the occasion when an Eretrian fleet put into <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, to have led out the youths to the battle; he himself, armed with a scraper like a youth, was chiefly responsible for the rout of the Euboeans. In the sanctuary of the Champion is kept all that is left of the wild strawberry-tree under which they believe that Hermes was nourished. Near by is a theater and by it a portico. I consider that the people of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> have better arrangements for the worship of the gods than any other Greeks. For their houses are in one place, while the sanctuaries are apart beyond the houses in a clear space where no men live.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Corinna, the only lyric poetess of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, has her tomb in a, conspicuous part of the city, and in the gymnasium is a painting of Corinna binding her head with a fillet for the victory she won over Pindar at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with a lyric poem. I believe that her victory was partly due to the dialect she used, for she composed, not in Doric speech like Pindar, but in one Aeolians would understand, and partly to her being, if one may judge from the likeness, the most beautiful woman of her time.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here there are two breeds of cocks, the fighters and the blackbirds, as they are called. The size of these blackbirds is the same as that of the Lydian birds, but in color they are like crows, while wattles and comb are very like the anemone. They have small, white markings on the end of the beak and at the end of the tail.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such is the appearance of the blackbirds. Within <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> to the left of the Euripus is Mount Messapius, at the foot of which on the coast is the Boeotian city of <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName>. Some say that the city received its name from a nymph called <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName>, while others say that one Anthas was despot here, a son of Poseidon by Alcyone, the daughter of Atlas. Just about the center of <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName> is a sanctuary of the Cabeiri, with a grove around it, near which is a temple of Demeter and her daughter, with images of white marble.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are a sanctuary and an image of Dionysus in front of the city on the side towards the mainland.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>That Glaucus was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a deity of the sea and ever since has foretold to men the future, is a belief generally accepted; in particular, seafaring men tell every year many a tale about the soothsaying of Glaucus. Pindar and Aeschylus got a story about Glaucus from the people of <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName>. Pindar has not thought fit to say much about him in his odes, but the story actually supplied Aeschylus with material for a play.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In front of the Proetidian gate at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is the gymnasium called the Gymnasium of Iolaus and also a race-course, a bank of earth like those at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>. Here there is also shown a hero-shrine of Iolaus. That Iolaus himself died at <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> along with the Athenians and Thespians who made the crossing with him is admitted even by the Thebans themselves.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Crossing over the right side of the course you come to a race-course for horses, in which is the tomb of Pindar. When Pindar was a young man he was once on his way to <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> in the hot season. At about noon he was seized with fatigue and the drowsiness that follows it, so just as he was, he lay down a little way above the road. As he slept bees alighted on him and plastered his lips with their wax.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such was the beginning of Pindar's career as a lyric poet. When his reputation had already spread throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> he was raised to a greater height of fame by an order of the Pythian priestess, who bade the Delphians give to Pindar one half of all the first-fruits they offered to Apollo. It is also said that on reaching old age a vision came to him in a dream. As he slept Persephone stood by him and declared that she alone of the deities had not been honored by Pindar with a hymn, but that Pindar would compose an ode to her also when he had come to her.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pindar died at once, before ten days had passed since the dream. But there was in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> an old woman related by birth to Pindar who had practised singing most of his odes. By her side in a dream stood Pindar, and sang a hymn to Persephone. Immediately on waking out of her sleep she wrote down all she had heard him singing in her dream. In this song, among the epithets he applies to Hades is “golden-reined”—a clear reference to the rape of Persephone.</p></div>

Weak and old, they could not even get safely away to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but made their homes here.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>About fifteen stades away from the city on the right is the sanctuary of Ptoan Apollo. We are told by Asius in his epic that Ptous, who gave a surname to Apollo and the name to the mountain, was a son of Athamas by Themisto. Before the expedition of the Macedonians under Alexander, in which <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was destroyed, there was here an oracle that never lied. Once too a mail of <placeName key="tgn,7002270">Europus</placeName>, of the name of Mys, who was sent by Mardonius, inquired of the god in his own language, and the god too gave a response, not in Greek but in the Carian speech.</p></div>

There is a sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Fates, while the third is of Zeus of the Market. Zeus is made of stone; the Fates have no images. A little farther off in the open stands Heracles, surnamed Nose-docker; the reason for the name is, as the Thebans say, that Heracles cut off the noses, as an insult, of the heralds who came from <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> to demand the tribute.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Advancing from here twenty-five stades you come to a grove of Cabeirean Demeter and the Maid. The initiated are permitted to enter it. The sanctuary of the Cabeiri is some seven stades distant from this grove. I must ask the curious to forgive me if I keep silence as to who the Cabeiri are, and what is the nature of the ritual performed in honor of them and of the Mother.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But there is nothing to prevent my declaring to all what the Thebans say was the origin of the ritual. They say that once there was in this place a city, with inhabitants called Cabeiri; and that Demeter came to know Prometheus, one of the Cabeiri, and Aetnaelis his son, and entrusted something to their keeping. What was entrusted to them, and what happened to it, seemed to me a sin to put into writing, but at any rate the rites are a gift of Demeter to the Cabeiri.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the time of the invasion of the Epigoni and the taking of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, the Cabeiri were expelled from their homes by the Argives and the rites for a while ceased to be performed. But they go on to say that afterwards Pelarge, the daughter of Potnieus, and Isthmiades her husband established the mysteries here to begin with, but transferred them to the place called Alexiarus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But because Pelarge conducted the initiation outside the ancient borders, Telondes and those who were left of the clan of the Cabeiri returned again to Cabeiraea. Various honors were to be established for Pelarge by Telondes in accordance with an oracle from <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>, one being the sacrifice of a pregnant victim. The wrath of the Cabeiri no man may placate, as has been proved on many occasions.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For certain private people dared to perform in <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> the ritual just as it was done in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and soon afterwards justice overtook them. Then, again, certain men of the army of Xerxes left behind with Mardonius in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> entered the sanctuary of the Cabeiri, perhaps in the hope of great wealth, but rather, I suspect, to show their contempt of its gods; all these immediately were struck with madness, and flung themselves to their deaths into the sea or from the tops of precipices.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Again, when Alexander after his victory wasted with fire all the <placeName key="tgn,4011135">Thebaid</placeName>, including <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> itself, some men from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> entered the sanctuary of the Cabeiri, as it was in enemy territory, and were destroyed by thunder and lightning from heaven.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of the gods the Thespians have from the beginning honored Love most, and they have a very ancient image of him, an unwrought stone. Who established among the Thespians the custom of worshipping Love more than any other god I do not know. He is worshipped equally by the people of Parium on the Hellespont, who were originally colonists from Erythrae in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, but to-day are subject to the Romans.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Most men consider Love to be the youngest of the gods and the son of Aphrodite. But <placeName key="tgn,1115310">Olen</placeName> the Lycian, who composed the oldest Greek hymns, says in a hymn to Eileithyia that she was the mother of Love. Later than <placeName key="tgn,1115310">Olen</placeName>, both Pamphos and Orpheus wrote hexameter verse, and composed poems on Love, in order that they might be among those sung by the Lycomidae to accompany the ritual. I read them after conversation with a Torchbearer. Of these things I will make no further mention. Hesiod,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hes. Th. 116">Hes.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Sappho of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> wrote many poems about Love, but they are not consistent. Later on Lysippus made a bronze Love for the Thespians, and previously Praxiteles one of Pentelic marble. The story of Phryne and the trick she played on Praxiteles I have related in another place.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 1.20.1">Paus. 1.20.1</bibl>.</note> The first to remove the image of Love, it is said, was Gaius the Roman Emperor; Claudius, they say, sent it back to <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName>, but Nero carried it away a second time.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the image perished by fire.

The other, Nero, in addition to his violence to his mother, committed accursed and hateful crimes against his wedded wives. The modern Love at <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> was made by the Athenian Menodorus, who copied the work of Praxiteles.</p></div>

Not far from the market-place is a Victory of bronze and a small temple of the Muses. In it are small images made of stone.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> is also a sanctuary of Heracles. The priestess there is a virgin, who acts as such until she dies. The reason of this is said to be as follows. Heracles, they say, had intercourse with the fifty daughters of Thestius, except one, in a single night. She was the only one who refused to have connection with him. Heracles,thinking that he had been insulted, condemned her to remain a virgin all her life, serving him as his priest.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have heard another story, how Heracles had connection with all the virgin daughters of Thestius in one and the same night, and how they all bore him sons, the youngest and the eldest bearing twins. But I cannot think it credible that Heracles would rise to such a pitch of wrath against a daughter of a friend. Moreover, while he was still among men, punishing them for insolence, and especially such as were impious towards the gods, he would not himself have set up a temple and appointed a priestess to himself, just as though he were a god.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As a matter of fact this sanctuary seemed to me too old to be of the time of Heracles the son of Amphitryon, and to belong to Heracles called one of the Idaean Dactyls, to whom I found the people of Erythrae in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName> possessed sanctuaries.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Helicon is one of the mountains of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with the most fertile soil and the greatest number of cultivated trees. The wild-strawberry bushes supply to the goats sweeter fruit than that growing anywhere else. The dwellers around Helicon say that all the grasses too and roots growing on the mountain are not at all poisonous to men. Moreover, the food makes the poison of the snakes too less deadly, so that most of those bitten escape with their lives, should they fall in with a Libyan of the race of the Psyllians, or with any suitable remedies.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now the poison of the most venomous snakes is of itself deadly to men and all animals alike, but what they feed on contributes very much to the strength of their poison; for instance, I learnt from a Phoenician that the roots they eat make more venomous the vipers in the highland of <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>. He said that he had himself seen a man trying to escape from the rush of a viper; the man, he said, ran up a tree, but the viper, coming up too late, puffed some of its poison towards the tree, and the man died instantaneously.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such was the story I heard from him. Those vipers in <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName> that nest around the balsam trees have, I know, the following peculiarities. The balsams are about as big as a myrtle bush, and their leaves are like those of the herb marjoram. The vipers of <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName> lodge in certain numbers, larger or smaller, under each tree. For the balsam-juice is the food they like most, and moreover they are fond of the shade of the bushes.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So when the time has come for the Arabians to collect the juice of the balsam, each man takes two sticks to the vipers, and by striking them together they drive the vipers away. Kill them they will not, considering them sacred to the balsam. And even if a man should have the misfortune to be bitten by the vipers, though the wound is like the cut of a knife, nevertheless there is no fear from the poison. For as the vipers feed on the most fragrant of perfumes, their poison is mitigated and less deadly.</p></div>

<div n="29" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such is the truth about these things. The first to sacrifice on Helicon to the Muses and to call the mountain sacred to the Muses were, they say, Ephialtes and Otus, who also founded Ascra. To this also Hegesinus alludes in his poem <title>Atthis</title>:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">And again with Ascra lay Poseidon Earth-shaker,</l><l>Who when the year revolved bore him a son</l><l>Oeoclus, who first with the children of Aloeus founded</l><l>Ascra, which lies at the foot of Helicon, rich in springs.</l></quote><bibl>Hegesinus, Atthis, unknown location.</bibl></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This poem of Hegesinus I have not read, for it was no longer extant when I was born. But Callippus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> in his history of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> uses the verses of Hegesinus as evidence in support of his own views, and I too have done likewise, using the quotation of Callippus himself. Of Ascra in my day nothing memorable was left except one tower. The sons of Aloeus held that the Muses were three in number, and gave them the names of Melete (Practice), Mneme (Memory) and Aoede (Song).</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But they say that afterwards Pierus, a Macedonian, after whom the mountain in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> was named, came to <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and established nine Muses, changing their names to the present ones. Pierus was of this opinion either because it seemed to him wiser, or because an oracle so ordered, or having so learned from one of the Thracians. For the Thracians had the reputation of old of being more clever than the Macedonians, and in particular of being not so careless in religious matters.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There are some who say that Pierus himself had nine daughters, that their names were the same as those of the goddesses, and that those whom the Greeks called the children of the Muses were sons of the daughters of Pierus. Mimnermus, who composed elegiac verses about the battle between the Smyrnaeans and the Lydians under Gyges, says in the preface that the elder Muses are daughters of Uranus, and that there are other and younger Muses, children of Zeus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On Helicon, on the left as you go to the grove of the Muses, is the spring Aganippe; they say that Aganippe was a daughter of the Termessus, which flows round Helicon. As you go along the straight road to the grove is a portrait of Eupheme carved in relief on a stone. She was, they say, the nurse of the Muses.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So her portrait is here, and after it is Linus on a small rock worked into the shape of a cave. To Linus every year they sacrifice as to a hero before they sacrifice to the Muses. It is said that this Linus was a son of Urania and Amphimarus, a son of Poseidon, that he won a reputation for music greater than that of any contemporary or predecessor, and that Apollo killed him for being his rival in singing.</p></div>
    <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the death of Linus, mourning for him spread, it seems, to all the foreign world, so that even among the Egyptians there came to be a Linus song, in the Egyptian language called Maneros. Of the Greek poets, Homer shows that he knew that the sufferings of Linus were the theme of a Greek song when he says that Hephaestus, among the other scenes he worked upon the shield of Achilles, represented a boy harpist singing the Linus song:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">In the midst of them a boy on a clear-toned lyre</l><l>Played with great charm, and to his playing sang of beautiful Linus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Pausanias misquotes.</note></l></quote><bibl n="Hom.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Pamphos, who composed the oldest Athenian hymns, called him Oetolinus (Linus doomed) at the time when the mourning for Linus was at its height. Sappho of Lesbos, who learnt the name of Oetolinus from the epic poetry of Pamphos, sang of both Adonis and Oetolinus together. The Thebans assert that Linus was buried among them, and that after the Greek defeat at Chaeroneia, Philip the son of Amyntas, in obedience to a vision in a dream, took up the bones of Linus and conveyed them to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>;</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>other visions induced him to send the bones of Linus back to <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>. But all that was over the grave, and whatever marks were on it, vanished, they say, with the lapse of time. Other tales are told by the Thebans, how that later than this Linus there was born another, called the son of Ismenius, a teacher of music, and how Heracles, while still a child, killed him. But hexameter poetry was written neither by Linus the son of Amphimarus nor by the later Linus; or if it was, it has not survived for posterity.</p></div>

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the side of Orpheus the Thracian stands a statue of Telete, and around him are beasts of stone and bronze listening to his singing. There are many untruths believed by the Greeks, one of which is that Orpheus was a son of the Muse Calliope, and not of the daughter of Pierus, that the beasts followed him fascinated by his songs, and that he went down alive to Hades to ask for his wife from the gods below. In my opinion Orpheus excelled his predecessors in the beauty of his verse, and reached a high degree of power because he was believed to have discovered mysteries, purification from sins, cures of diseases and means of averting divine wrath.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But they say that the women of the Thracians plotted his death, because he had persuaded their husbands to accompany him in his wanderings, but dared not carry out their intention through fear of their husbands.

Some say that Orpheus came to his end by being struck by a thunderbolt, hurled at him by the god because he revealed sayings in the mysteries to men who had not heard them before.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also a river called Helicon. After a course of seventy-five stades the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a gap of about twenty-two stades the water rises again, and under the name of Baphyra instead of Helicon flows into the sea as a navigable river. The people of Dium say that at first this river flowed on land throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed Orpheus wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to cleanse manslaughter.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> I heard another story, how that on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> is a city Libethra, where the mountain faces, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, not far from which city is the tomb of Orpheus. The Libethrians, it is said, received out of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> an oracle from Dionysus, stating that when the sun should see the bones of Orpheus, then the city of Libethra would be destroyed by a boar. The citizens paid little regard to the oracle, thinking that no other beast was big or mighty enough to take their city, while a boar was bold rather than powerful.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when it seemed good to the god the following events befell the citizens. About midday a shepherd was asleep leaning against the grave of Orpheus, and even as he slept he began to sing poetry of Orpheus in a loud and sweet voice. Those who were pasturing or tilling nearest to him left their several tasks and gathered together to hear the shepherd sing in his sleep. And jostling one another and striving who could get nearest the shepherd they overturned the pillar, the urn fell from it and broke, and the sun saw whatever was left of the bones of Orpheus.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys (Boar), one of the torrents about <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, on this occasion threw down the walls of Libethra, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When Libethra was now a city of ruin, the Macedonians in Dium, according to my friend of <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName>, carried the bones of Orpheus to their own country.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another tradition, very different from the first, that Hesiod wrote a great number of poems; the one on women, the one called the <title>Great Eoeae</title>, the <title>Theogony</title>, the poem on the seer Melampus, the one on the descent to Hades of Theseus and Perithous, the <title>Precepts of Chiron</title>, professing to be for the instruction of Achilles, and other poems besides the <title>Works and Days</title>. These same Boeotians say that Hesiod learnt seercraft from the Acarnanians, and there are extant a poem called <title>Mantica</title> (Seercraft), which I myself have read, and interpretations of portents.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Opposite stories are also told of Hesiod's death. All agree that Ctimenus and Antiphus, the sons of Ganyctor, fled from <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> to Molycria because of the murder of Hesiod, that here they sinned against Poseidon, and that in Molycria their punishment was inflicted. The sister of the young men had been ravished; some say the deed was Hesiod's, and others that Hesiod was wrongly thought guilty of another's crime.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So widely different are the traditions of Hesiod himself and his poems.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the summit of Helicon is a small river called the Lamus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">According to some interpreters we should read “Olmius.”</note> In the territory of the Thespians is a place called Donacon (Reed-bed). Here is the spring of Narcissus. They say that Narcissus looked into this water, and not understanding that he saw his own reflection, unconsciously fell in love with himself, and died of love at the spring. But it is utter stupidity to imagine that a man old enough to fall in love was incapable of distinguishing a man from a man's reflection.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is another story about Narcissus, less popular indeed than the other, but not without some support. It is said that Narcissus had a twin sister; they were exactly alike in appearance, their hair was the same, they wore similar clothes, and went hunting together. The story goes on that Narcissus fell in love with his sister, and when the girl died, would go to the spring, knowing that it was his reflection that he saw, but in spite of this knowledge finding some relief for his love in imagining that he saw, not his own reflection, but the likeness of his sister.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The flower narcissus grew, in my opinion, before this, if we are to judge by the verses of Pamphos. This poet was born many years before Narcissus the Thespian, and he says that the Maid, the daughter of Demeter, was carried off when she was playing and gathering flowers, and that the flowers by which she was deceived into being carried off were not violets, but the narcissus.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As you go inland from <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> you come to Haliartus.

In Haliartus is the tomb of Lysander the Lacedaemonian. For having attacked the walls of Haliartus, in which were troops from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he fell in the fighting that followed a sortie of the enemy.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lysander in some ways is worthy of the greatest praise, in others of the sharpest blame. He certainly showed cleverness in the following ways. When in command of the Peloponnesian triremes he waited till Alcibiades was away from the fleet, and then led on Antiochus, the pilot of Alcibiades, to believe that he was a match for the Lacedaemonians at sea, and when in the rashness of vainglory he put out to sea, Lysander overcame him not far from the city of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>And when for the second time he arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to take charge of the triremes, he so tamed Cyrus that, whenever he asked for money to pay the fleet, he received it in good time and without stint. When the Athenian fleet of one hundred ships anchored at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>, waiting until the sailors were scattered to get water and provisions, he thus captured their vessels. He showed the following example of justice.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Autolycus the pancratiast, whose statue I saw in the Prytaneium of the Athenians, had a dispute about some piece of property with Eteonicus of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. When Eteonicus was convicted of making unjust statements, as the rule of the Thirty was then supreme at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and Lysander had not yet departed, Eteonicus was encouraged to make an unprovoked assault, and when Autolycus resisted, summoned him before Lysander, confidently expecting that judgment would be given in his favour. But Lysander gave judgment against Eteonicus and dismissed him with a reprimand.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All this redounds to the credit of Lysander, but the following incidents are a reproach. Philocles, the Athenian commander-in-chief at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>, along with four thousand other Athenian prisoners, were put to death by Lysander, who even refused them burial afterwards, a thing which even the Persians who landed at Marathon received from the Athenians, and the Lacedaemonians themselves who fell at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> received from King Xerxes. Lysander brought a yet deeper disgrace upon the Lacedaemonians by the Commissions of Ten he set over the cities and by the Laconian governors.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Again, an oracle had warned the Lacedaemonians that only love of money could destroy <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and so they were not used to acquiring wealth, yet Lysander aroused in the Spartans a strong desire for riches.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the land of Haliartus there is a river Lophis. It is said that the land was originally arid and without water, so that one of the rulers came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and asked in what way they would find water in the land. The Pythian priestess, they say, commanded him to kill the man who should first meet him on his return to Haliartus. On his arrival he was met by his son Lophis, and at once smote the youth with his sword. Still living, the lad ran about, and where the blood ran water rose up from the earth. Wherefore the river is called Lophis.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Alalcomenae is a small village, and it lies at the very foot of a mountain of no great height. Its name, some say, is derived from Alalcomeneus, an aboriginal, by whom Athena was brought up; others declare that Alalcomenia was one of the daughters of Ogygus. At some distance from the village on the level ground has been made a temple of Athena with an ancient image of ivory.</p></div>

But in Alalcomenae he added yet another to his crimes by stealing the image of Athena itself. After these mad outrages against the Greek cities and the gods of the Greeks he was attacked by the most foul of diseases. He broke out into lice, and what was formerly accounted his good fortune came to such an end. The sanctuary at Alalcomenae, deprived of the goddess, was hereafter neglected.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The following tale, too, is told. Iodama, who served the goddess as priestess, entered the precinct by night, where there appeared to her Athena, upon whose tunic was worked the head of Medusa the Gorgon. When Iodama saw it, she was turned to stone. For this reason a woman puts fire every day on the altar of Iodama, and as she does this she thrice repeats in the Boeotian dialect that Iodama is living and asking for fire.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the market-place of Coroneia I found two remarkable things, an altar of Hermes Epimelius (Keeper of flocks) and an altar of the winds.

For the story goes that the daughters of Achelous were persuaded by Hera to compete with the Muses in singing.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Some forty stades from Coroneia is Mount Libethrius, on which are images of the Muses and Nymphs surnamed Libethrian.

Higher up is a Heracles surnamed Charops (With bright eyes).  Here, say the Boeotians, Heracles ascended with the hound of Hades. On the way down from Mount Laphystius to the sanctuary of Itonian Athena is the river Phalarus, which runs into the Cephisian lake.</p></div>

Its ancient history is confined to the following traditions. They say that Andreus, son of the river Peneius, was the first to settle here, and after him the land Andreis was named.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Athamas joined him, he assigned to him, of his own land, the territory round Mount Laphystius with what are now the territories of Coroneia and Haliartus. Athamas, thinking that none of his male children were left, adopted Haliartus and Coronus, the sons of Thersander, the son of Sisyphus, his brother. For he himself had put to death Learchus and Melicertes; Leucon had fallen sick and died; while as for Phrixus, Athamas did not know if he survived or had descendants surviving.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When later Phrixus himself, according to some, or Presbon, according to others, returned from Colchis—Presbon was a son of Phrixus by the daughter of Aeetes—the sons of Thersander agreed that the house of Athamas belonged to Athamas and his descendants, while they themselves became founders of Haliartus and Coroneia, for Athamas gave them a part of his land.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Even before this Andreus took to wife from Athamas Euippe, daughter of Leucon, and had a son, Eteocles.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When this Eteocles became king, he let the country be still called after Andreus, but he established two tribes, naming one Cephisias, and the other after himself.

Clymenus was murdered at the feast of Onchestian Poseidon by men of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, whom a trivial cause had thrown into a violent passion. So Erginus, the eldest of the sons of Glymenus, received the kingdom.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Immediately he and his brothers gathered a force and attacked <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. Victorious in the battle, they then came to an agreement that the Thebans should pay tribute each year for the murder of Clymenus. But when Heracles had grown to manhood in Thebes, the Thebans were thus relieved of the tribute, and the Minyans suffered a grievous defeat in the war.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Erginus, as his citizens had been utterly crushed, made peace with Heracles, but in his efforts to restore his former wealth and prosperity neglected everything else, so that unconsciously he came to a wifeless and childless old age. But when he had gathered riches, the desire seized him to have children.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So going to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> he inquired of the oracle about children, and the Pythian priestess gave this reply:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">Erginus, son of Clymenus Presboniades,</l><l>Late thou camest seeking offspring, but even now</l><l>To the old plough-tree put a new tip.</l></quote>Obeying the oracle he took to himself a young wife, and had children, Trophonius and Agamedes.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Trophonius is said to have been a son of Apollo, not of Erginus. This I am inclined to believe, as does everyone who has gone to Trophonius to inquire of his oracle. They say that these, when they grew up, proved clever at building sanctuaries for the gods and palaces for men. For they built the temple for Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and the treasury for Hyrieus. One of the stones in it they made so that they could take it away from the outside. So they kept on removing something from the store. Hyrieus was dumbfounded when he saw keys and seals untampered with, while the treasure kept on getting less.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So he set over the vessels, in which were his silver and gold, snares or other contrivance, to arrest any who should enter and lay hands on the treasure. Agamedes entered and was kept fast in the trap, but Trophonius cut off his head, lest when day came his brother should be tortured, and he himself be informed of as being concerned in the crime.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The earth opened and swallowed up Trophonius at the point in the grove at <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> where is what is called the pit of Agamedes, with a slab beside it. The kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> was taken by Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, said to be sons of Ares, while their mother was Astyoche, daughter of Actor, son of Azeus, son of Clymenus. Under the leadership of these the Minyans marched against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Orchomenians also joined with the sons of Codrus in the expedition to <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Thebans declare that the river Cephisus was diverted into the Orchomenian plain by Heracles, and that for a time it passed under the mountain and entered the sea, until Heracles blocked up the chasm through the mountain.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the side towards the mountains the boundary of Orchomenus is <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, but on the plain it is <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName>.

But when Lebadus came to it from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the inhabitants went down to the low ground, and the city was named <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> after him. Who was the father of Lebadus, and why he came, they do not know; they know only that the wife of Lebadus was Laonice.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The city is no less adorned than the most prosperous of the Greek cities, and it is separated from the grove of Trophonius by the river Hercyna. They say that here Hercyna, when playing with the Maid, the daughter of Demeter, held a goose which against her will she let loose. The bird flew into a hollow cave and hid under a stone; the Maid entered and took the bird as it lay under the stone. The water flowed, they say, from the place where the Maid took up the stone, and hence the river received the name of Hercyna.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the bank of the river there is a temple of Hercyna, in which is a maiden holding a goose in her arms. In the cave are the sources of the river and images standing, and serpents are coiled around their scepters. One might conjecture the images to be of Asclepius and Health, but they might be Trophonius and Hercyna, because they think that serpents are just as much sacred to Trophonius as to Asclepius. By the side of the river is the tomb of Arcesilaus, whose bones, they say, were carried back from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> by Leitus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The most famous things in the grove are a temple and image of Trophonius; the image, made by Praxiteles, is after the likeness of Asclepius. There is also a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Europa, and a Zeus Rain-god in the open. If you go up to the oracle, and thence onwards up the mountain, you come to what is called the Maid's Hunting and a temple of King Zeus. This temple they have left half finished, either because of its size or because of the long succession of the wars. In a second temple are images of Cronus, Hera and Zeus. There is also a sanctuary of Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What happens at the oracle is as follows. When a man has made up his mind to descend to the oracle of Trophonius, he first lodges in a certain building for an appointed number of days, this being sacred to the good Spirit and to good Fortune. While he lodges there, among other regulations for purity he abstains from hot baths, bathing only in the river Hercyna. Meat he has in plenty from the sacrifices, for he who descends sacrifices to Trophonius himself and to the children of Trophonius, to Apollo also and Cronus, to Zeus surnamed King, to Hera Charioteer, and to Demeter whom they surname Europa and say was the nurse of Trophonius.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At each sacrifice a diviner is present, who looks into the entrails of the victim, and after an inspection prophesies to the person descending whether Trophonius will give him a kind and gracious reception. The entrails of the other victims do not declare the mind of Trophonius so much as a ram, which each inquirer sacrifices over a pit on the night he descends, calling upon Agamedes. Even though the previous sacrifices have appeared propitious, no account is taken of them unless the entrails of this ram indicate the same; but if they agree, then the inquirer descends in good hope. The procedure of the descent is this.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>First, during the night he is taken to the river Hercyna by two boys of the citizens about thirteen years old, named Hermae, who after taking him there anoint him with oil and wash him. It is these who wash the descender, and do all the other necessary services as his attendant boys. After this he is taken by the priests, not at once to the oracle, but to fountains of water very near to each other.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here he must drink water called the water of Forgetfulness, that he may forget all that he has been thinking of hitherto, and afterwards he drinks of another water, the water of Memory, which causes him to remember what he sees after his descent. After looking at the image which they say was made by Daedalus (it is not shown by the priests save to such as are going to visit Trophonius), having seen it, worshipped it and prayed, he proceeds to the oracle, dressed in a linen tunic, with ribbons girding it, and wearing the boots of the country.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The oracle is on the mountain, beyond the grove. Round it is a circular basement of white marble, the circumference of which is about that of the smallest threshing floor, while its height is just short of two cubits. On the basement stand spikes, which, like the cross-bars holding them together, are of bronze, while through them has been made a double door. Within the enclosure is a chasm in the earth, not natural, but artificially constructed after the most accurate masonry.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The shape of this structure is like that of a bread-oven. Its breadth across the middle one might conjecture to be about four cubits, and its depth also could not be estimated to extend to more than eight cubits. They have made no way of descent to the bottom, but when a man comes to Trophonius, they bring him a narrow, light ladder. After going down he finds a hole between the floor and the structure. Its breadth appeared to be two spans, and its height one span.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The descender lies with his back on the ground, holding barley-cakes kneaded with honey, thrusts his feet into the hole and himself follows, trying hard to get his knees into the hole. After his knees the rest of his body is at once swiftly drawn in, just as the largest and most rapid river will catch a man in its eddy and carry him under. After this those who have entered the shrine learn the future, not in one and the same way in all cases, but by sight sometimes and at other times by hearing. The return upwards is by the same mouth, the feet darting out first.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that no one who has made the descent has been killed, save only one of the bodyguard of Demetrius. But they declare that he performed none of the usual rites in the sanctuary, and that he descended, not to consult the god but in the hope of stealing gold and silver from the shrine. It is said that the body of this man appeared in a different place, and was not cast out at the sacred mouth. Other tales are told about the fellow, but I have given the one most worthy of consideration.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After his ascent from Trophonius the inquirer is again taken in hand by the priests, who set him upon a chair called the chair of Memory, which stands not far from the shrine, and they ask of him, when seated there, all he has seen or learned. After gaining this information they then entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, paralyzed with terror and unconscious both of himself and of his surroundings, and carry him to the building where he lodged before with Good Fortune and the Good Spirit. Afterwards, however, he will recover all his faculties, and the power to laugh will return to him.</p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>What I write is not hearsay; I have myself inquired of Trophonius and seen other inquirers. Those who have descended into the shrine of Trophonius are obliged to dedicate a tablet on which is written all that each has heard or seen. The shield also of Aristomenes is still preserved here. Its story I have already given in a former part of my work.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 4.16.7">Paus. 4.16.7</bibl> to <bibl n="Paus. 4.32.6">Paus. 4.32.6</bibl>.</note></p></div>

<div n="40" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This oracle was once unknown to the Boeotians, but they learned of it in the following way. As there had been no rain for a year and more, they sent to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> envoys from each city. These asked for a cure for the drought, and were bidden by the Pythian priestess to go to Trophonius at <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> and to discover the remedy from him.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Coming to <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName> they could not find the oracle. Thereupon Saon, one of the envoys from the city Acraephnium and the oldest of all the envoys, saw a swarm of bees. It occurred to him to follow himself wheresoever the bees turned. At once he saw the bees flying into the ground here, and he went with them into the oracle. It is said that Trophonius taught this Saon the customary ritual, and all the observances kept at the oracle.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of the works of Daedalus there are these two in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, a Heracles in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and the Trophonius at <placeName key="perseus,Lebadeia">Lebadeia</placeName>.

<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I am of opinion that Ariadne got this image from Daedalus, and when she followed Theseus, took it with her from home. Bereft of Ariadne, say the Delians, Theseus dedicated the wooden image of the goddess to the Delian Apollo, lest by taking it home he should be dragged into remembering Ariadne, and so find the grief for his love ever renewed. I know of no other works of Daedalus still in existence. For the images dedicated by the Argives in the Heraeum and those brought from Omphace to <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> have disappeared in course of time.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, overcame in battle Cisseus, a chieftain in a bordering country.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Caranus, they assert, realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so, they say, the rule was adopted that no king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors.

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is plain that such part of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> as is around <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> was so named in very ancient days after a Corinthian, Phocus, a son of Ornytion. Not many years afterwards, the name established itself as the received title of what is today called <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, when the Aeginetans had disembarked on the land with Phocus the son of Aeacus.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Opposite the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, and in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> stretches to the sea, and touches it on one side at <placeName key="tgn,6001466">Cirrha</placeName>, the port of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and on the other at the city of Anticyra. In the direction of the Lamian Gulf there are between <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> and the sea only the Hypocnemidian Locrians.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The most renowned exploits of the Phocian people were undertaken by the whole nation. They took part in the Trojan war, and fought against the Thessalians before the Persian invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, when they accomplished some noteworthy deeds. Expecting that the Thessalians would invade their land at <placeName key="perseus,Hyampolis">Hyampolis</placeName>, they buried there earthen water-pots, covered these with earth, and so waited for the Thessalian cavalry. Ignorant of the Phocian stratagem, the Thessalians without knowing it drove their horses on to the water-pots, where stumbling into them the horses were lamed, and threw or killed their riders.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Thessalians, more enraged than ever against the Phocians, gathered levies from all their cities and marched out against them. Whereupon the Phocians, greatly terrified at the army of the Thessalians, especially at the number of their cavalry and the practised discipline of both mounts and riders, despatched a mission to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, praying the god that they might escape the danger that threatened them. The oracle given them was this:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">I will match in fight mortal and immortal,</l><l>And to both will I give victory, but more to the mortal.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On receiving this oracle, the Phocians sent three hundred picked men with Gelon in command to make an attack on the enemy. The night was just falling, and the orders given were to reconnoiter without being observed, to return to the main body by the least known route, and to remain strictly on the defensive. These picked men along with their leader Gelon, trampled on by horses and butchered by their enemies, perished to a man at the hands of the Thessalians.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Their disaster created such panic among the Phocians in the camp that they actually gathered together in one spot their women, children, movable property, and also their clothes, gold, silver and images of the gods, and making a vast pyre they left in charge a force of thirty men.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These were under orders that, should the Phocians chance to be worsted in the battle, they were first to put to death the women and the children, then to lay them like victims with the valuables on the pyre, and finally to set it alight and perish themselves, either by each other's hands or by charging the cavalry of the Thessalians. Hence all forlorn hopes are called by the Greeks “Phocian despair.” On this occasion the Phocians forthwith proceeded to attack the Thessalians.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The commander of their cavalry was Daiphantes of <placeName key="perseus,Hyampolis">Hyampolis</placeName>, of their infantry Rhoeus of Ambrossus. But the office of commander-in-chief was held by Tellias, a seer of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, upon whom rested all the Phocians' hopes of salvation.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the battle joined, the Phocians had before their eyes what they had resolved to do to their women and children, and seeing that their own salvation trembled in the balance, they dared the most desperate deeds, and, with the favour of heaven, achieved the most famous victory of that time.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Then did all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> understand the oracle given to the Phocians by Apollo. For the watchword given in battle on every occasion by the Thessalian generals was Itonian Athena, and by the Phocian generals Phocus, from whom the Phocians were named. Because of this engagement the Phocians sent as offerings to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> statues of Apollo, of Tellias the seer, and of all their other generals in the battle, together with images of their local heroes. The figures were the work of the Argive Aristomedon.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Afterwards the Phocians discovered a stratagem quite as clever as their former ones. For when the armies were lying opposite each other at the pass into <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, five hundred picked men of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, waiting until the moon was full, attacked the Thessalians on that night, first smearing themselves with chalk and, in addition to the chalk, putting on white armour. It is said that there then occurred a wholesale slaughter of the Thessalians, who thought this apparition of the night to be too unearthly to be an attack of their enemies. It was Tellias of Elis who devised this stratagem also for the Phocians to use against the Thessalians.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="2" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Persian army crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, it is said that the Phocians were forced to join the Great King, but deserted the Persian cause and ranged themselves with the Greeks at the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. Subsequently it happened that a fine was inflicted on them by the Amphictyons. I cannot find out the truth of the story, whether the fine was inflicted because of the misdeeds of the Phocians, or whether the Thessalians exacted the fine from the Phocians because of their ancient hatred.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>As they were disheartened at the greatness of the fine, Philomelus, son of Theotimus, than whom no Phocian stood higher in rank, his country being Ledon, a city of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, took charge and tried to persuade them to seize the sanctuary at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, pointing out that the amount of the sum to be paid was beyond their resources. He stated, among other plausible arguments, that <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> had always been favorable to them, and that if <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> or any other state made war against them, they would have the better owing to their courage and resources.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Philomelus put all this before them, the Phocians were nothing loath, either because their judgment was blinded by heaven, or because their nature was to put gain before religion. The seizure of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> by the Phocians occurred when Heracleides was president at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and Agathocles archon at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in the fourth year of the hundred and fifth Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0357">357 B.C</date></note> when Prorus of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> was victorious in the foot-race.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had seized the sanctuary, the best mercenaries in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at once mustered to join them, while the Thebans, at variance before, declared open war against them. The war lasted ten successive years, and during this long time victory often fell to the Phocians and their mercenaries, and often the Thebans proved the better. An engagement took place at the town of Neon, in which the Phocians were worsted, and in the rout Philomelus threw himself down a high precipice, and so lost his life. This was the very punishment fixed by the Amphictyons for spoilers of the sanctuary.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After the death of Philomelus the Phocians gave the command to Onomarchus, while Philip, son of Amyntas, made an alliance with the Thebans. Philip had the better of the encounter, and Onomarchus fleeing to the coast was there shot down by his own troops, who considered their defeat due to his lack of enterprise and inexperience as a general.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such was the end which fate brought upon Onomarchus, and his brother Phaylus was chosen as commander-in-chief. It is said that no sooner had this Phaylus come to rule over the Phocians when he saw the following vision in a dream. Among the votive offerings to Apollo was a representation in bronze of a man's body in an advanced stage of decay, with the flesh already fallen off, and nothing left but the bones. The Delphians said that it was an offering of Hippocrates the physician. Now the thought came to Phaylus that he resembled this offering. Forthwith he was attacked by a wasting disease, which so fulfilled the omen of the dream.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the death of Phaylus the sovereignty of the Phocians devolved on Phalaecus his son. Phalaecus, accused of appropriating to his own use the sacred treasures, was deposed, and crossing with a fleet to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, accompanied by such Phocians as sided with him and by a part of his mercenaries, he sat down to besiege <placeName key="tgn,7010843">Cydonia</placeName>, which refused to accede to his demand for money, and perished along with the greater part of his army.</p></div>

<div n="3" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the tenth year after the seizure of the sanctuary, Philip put an end to the war, which was called both the Phocian War and the Sacred War, in the year when Theophilus was archon at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which was the first of the hundred and eighth Olympiad<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0348">348 B.C</date></note> at which Polycles of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> was victorious in the foot-race.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The army of Xerxes, burning down certain of these, made them better known in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, namely Erochus, <placeName key="perseus,Charadra">Charadra</placeName>, Amphicleia, Neon, Tithronium and Drymaea.

On the occasion to which I have referred all the cities enumerated were razed to the ground and their people scattered in villages. The one exception to this treatment was Abae, whose citizens were free from impiety, and had had no share in the seizure of the sanctuary or in the war.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Phocians were deprived of their share in the Delphic sanctuary and in the Greek assembly, and their votes were given by the Amphictyons to the Macedonians. Subsequently, however, the Phocian cities were rebuilt, and their inhabitants restored from the villages to their native cities, save such as were prevented from being rebuilt by their original weakness and by their want of funds at the period of restoration. It was the Athenians and Thebans who brought back the inhabitants before the disaster of Chaeroneia befell the Greeks.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Phocians took part in the battle of Chaeroneia, and afterwards fought at <placeName key="perseus,Lamia">Lamia</placeName> and Crannon against the Macedonians under Antipater. No Greeks were keener defenders against the Gauls and the Celtic invaders than were the Phocians, who considered that they were helping the god of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and at the same time, I take it, that they were making amends for the old crimes they had committed.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="4" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were the memorable exploits of the Phocians. From Chaeroneia it is twenty stades to Panopeus, a city of the Phocians, if one can give the name of city to those who possess no government offices, no gymnasium, no theater, no market-place, no water descending to a fountain, but live in bare shelters just like mountain cabins, right on a ravine. Nevertheless, they have boundaries with their neighbors, and even send delegates to the Phocian assembly. The name of the city is derived, they say, from the father of Epeius, and they maintain that they are not Phocians, but were originally Phlegyans who fled to <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> from the land of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A survey of the ancient circuit of Panopeus led me to guess it to be about seven stades. I was reminded of Homer's verses about Tityos,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.581">Hom. Od. 11.581</bibl></note> where he mentions the city of Panopeus with its beautiful dancing-floors, and how in the fight over the body of Patroclus he says that Schedius, son of Iphitus and king of the Phocians, who was killed by Hector, lived in Panopeus.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 17.307">Hom. Il. 17.307</bibl> foll.</note> It seemed to me that the reason why the king lived here was fear of the Boeotians; at this point is the easiest pass from <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, so the king used Panopeus as a fortified post.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The former passage, in which Homer speaks of the beautiful dancing-floors of Panopeus, I could not understand until I was taught by the women whom the Athenians call Thyiads. The Thyiads are Attic women, who with the Delphian women go to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> every other year and celebrate orgies in honor of Dionysus. It is the custom for these Thyiads to hold dances at places, including Panopeus, along the road from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. The epithet Homer applies to Panopeus is thought to refer to the dance of the Thyiads.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At Panopeus there is by the roadside a small building of unburnt brick, in which is an image of Pentelic marble, said by some to be Asclepius, by others Prometheus. The latter produce evidence of their contention. At the ravine there lie two stones, each of which is big enough to fill a cart. They have the color of clay, not earthy clay, but such as would be found in a ravine or sandy torrent, and they smell very like the skin of a man. They say that these are remains of the clay out of which the whole race of mankind was fashioned by Prometheus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here at the ravine is the tomb of Tityos. The circumference of the mound is just about one-third of a stade, and they say that the verse in the <title>Odyssey</title>:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Lying on the ground, and lie lay over nine roods,</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.577">Hom. Od. 11.577</bibl>refers, not to the size of Tityos, but to the place where he lay, the name of which was Nine Roods.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Cleon of <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> on the Hermus used to say that those men were incredulous of wonders who in the course of their own lives had not met yet greater marvels. He declared that Tityos and other monsters had been as tradition says they were. He happened, he said, to be at <placeName key="tgn,7002813">Cadiz</placeName>, and he, with the rest of the crowd, sailed forth from the island in accordance with the command of Heracles;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Probably referring to a custom that all foreigners should leave <placeName key="tgn,7002813">Cadiz</placeName> at certain times, probably at the festival of Heracles.  The monster may have been a wooden effigy burnt on these occasions (Frazer).</note> on their return to <placeName key="tgn,7002813">Cadiz</placeName> they found cast ashore a man of the sea, who was about five roods in size, and burning away, because heaven had blasted him with a thunderbolt.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So said Cleon. About twenty-seven stades distant from Panopeus is <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName>. The men there are few in number, but for size and strength no Phocians are more renowned even to this day. They say that the name of the city is derived from <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName>, a nymph, the daughter of the Cephisus. Others say that the place, on which the city was built, was wooded, and that such shaggy places (<term>dasea</term>) were called <term>daula</term> by the ancients. For this reason, they say, Aeschylus called the beard of Glaucus of <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName> <term>hypene daulos</term>.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Here in <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName> the women are said to have served up to Tereus his own son, which act was the first pollution of the dining-table among men. The hoopoe, into which the legend says Tereus was changed, is a bird a little larger than the quail, while the feathers on its head rise into the shape of a crest.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is noteworthy that in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> swallows neither hatch nor lay eggs; in fact no swallow would even make a nest in the roof of a house. The Phocians say that even when Philomela was a bird she had a terror of Tereus, and so kept away from his country. At <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName> is a sanctuary of Athena with an ancient image. The wooden image, of an even earlier date, the Daulians say was brought from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Procne.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName> is a place called Tronis. Here has been built a shrine of the Founder hero. This founder is said by some to have been Xanthippus, a distinguished soldier; others say that he was Phocus, son of Ornytion, son of Sisyphus. At any rate, he is worshipped every day, and the Phocians bring victims and pour the blood into the grave through a hole, but the flesh they are wont to consume on the spot.</p></div>

<div n="5" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">

Turning back from <placeName key="perseus,Daulis">Daulis</placeName> to the straight road to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and going forwards, you see on the left of the road a building called the Phocian Building, where assemble the Phocian delegates from each city.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The building is large, and within are pillars standing throughout its length. From the pillars rise steps to each wall, on which steps the Phocian delegates take their seats.  At the end are neither pillars nor steps, but images of Zeus, Athena and Hera.  That of Zeus is on a throne; on his right stands Hera, on his left Athena.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Going forward from here you will come to a road called the Cleft Road, the very road on which<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">With the proposed emendation: “on this road.”</note> Oedipus slew his father.  Fate would have it that memorials of the sufferings of Oedipus should be left throughout the length and breadth of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.  At his birth they pieced his ankles with goads and exposed him on Mount Cithaeron in Plataean territory.  <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and the land at the Isthmus were the scene of his upbringing.  <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> and the Cleft Road received the pollution of his murdered father's blood.  <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is even more notorious for the marriage of Oedipus and for the sin of Eteocles.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Cleft Road and the rash deed committed on it by Oedipus were the beginning of his troubles, and the tombs of Laius and the servant who followed him are still just as they were in the very middle of the place where the three roads meet, and over them have been piled unhewn stones.  According to the story, it was Damasistratus, king of Plataea, who found the bodies lying and buried them.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From here the high road to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> becomes both steeper and more difficult for the walker.  Many and different are the stories told about <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and even more so about the oracle of Apollo.  For they say that in the earliest times the oracular seat belonged to Earth, who appointed as prophetess at it Daphnis, one of the nymphs of the mountain.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is extant among the Greeks an hexameter poem, the name of which is Eumolpia, and it is assigned to Musaeus, son of Antiophemus.  In it the poet states that the oracle belonged to Poseidon and Earth in common; that Earth gave her oracles herself, but Poseidon used Pyrcon as his mouthpiece in giving responses. The verses are these:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Forthwith the voice of the Earth-goddess uttered a wise word,</l><l>And with her Pyrcon, servant of the renowned Earth-shaker.</l></quote><bibl>[Musaeus], Eumolpia</bibl>They say that afterwards Earth gave her share to Themis, who gave it to Apollo as a gift.  It is said that he gave to Poseidon Calaureia, that lies off <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, in exchange for his oracle.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have heard too that shepherds feeding their flocks came upon the oracle, were inspired by the vapor, and prophesied as the mouthpiece of Apollo.  The most prevalent view, however, is that Phemonoe was the first prophetess of the god, and first sang in hexameter verse.  Boeo, a native woman who composed a hymn for the Delphians, said that the oracle was established for the god by comers from the Hyperboreans, <placeName key="tgn,1048432">Olen</placeName> and others, and that he was the first to prophesy and the first to chant the hexameter oracles.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The verses of Boeo are:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Here in truth a mindful oracle was built</l><l>By the sons of the Hyperboreans, Pagasus and divine Agyieus.</l></quote><bibl>Boeo, work unknown</bibl>After enumerating others also of the Hyperboreans, at the end of the hymn she names <placeName key="tgn,1048432">Olen</placeName>:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">And Olen, who became the first prophet of Phoebus,</l><l>And first fashioned a song of ancient verses.</l></quote><bibl>Boeo, work unknown</bibl><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Tradition, however, reports no other man as prophet, but makes mention of prophetesses only.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that the most ancient temple of Apollo was made of laurel, the branches of which were brought from the laurel in <placeName key="tgn,7014367">Tempe</placeName>.  This temple must have had the form of a hut.  The Delphians say that the second temple was made by bees from bees-wax and feathers, and that it was sent to the Hyperboreans by Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Another story is current, that the temple was set up by a Delphian, whose name was Pteras, and so the temple received its name from the builder.  After this Pteras, so they say, the city in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> was named, with the addition of a letter, Apterei.  The story that the temple was built of the fern (<term>pteris</term>) that grows on the mountains, by interweaving fresh stalks of it, I do not accept at all.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It is no wonder that the third temple was made of bronze, seeing that Acrisius made a bedchamber of bronze for his daughter, the Lacedaemonians still possess a sanctuary of Athena of the Bronze House, and the Roman forum, a marvel for its size and style, possesses a roof of bronze.  So it would not be unlikely that a temple of bronze was made for Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The rest of the story I cannot believe, either that the temple was the work of Hephaestus, or the legend about the golden singers, referred to by Pindar in his verses about this bronze temple:—<quote type="verse"><l met="lyric">Above the pediment sang</l><l>Golden Charmers.</l></quote><bibl>Pindar, work unknown</bibl>These words, it seems to me, are but an imitation of Homer's<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom.

<div n="6" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They say that the oldest city was founded here by <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, a son of Cleodora, a nymph.  Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god Poseidon, the human father being Cleopompus.  After this <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> were named, they say, both the mountain and also the Parnassian glen.  Augury from flying birds was, it is said, a discovery of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Now this city, so the story goes on, was flooded by the rains that fell in the time of Deucalion.  Such of the inhabitants as were able to escape the storm were led by the howls of wolves to safety on the top of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, being led on their way by these beasts, and on this account they called the city that they founded Lycoreia (Mountainwolf-city).</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Another and different legend is current that Apollo had a son Lycorus by a nymph, Corycia, and that after Lycorus was named the city Lycoreia, and after the nymph the Corycian cave.  It is also said that Celaeno was daughter to Hyamus, son of Lycorus, and that Delphus, from whom comes the present name of the city, was a son of Celaeno, daughter of Hyamus, by Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Others maintain that Castalius, an aboriginal, had a daughter Thyia, who was the first to be priestess of Dionysus and celebrate orgies in honor of the god.  It is said that later on men called after her Thyiads all women who rave in honor of Dionysus.  At any rate they hold that Delphus was a son of Apollo and Thyia.  Others say that his mother was Melaena, daughter of Cephisus.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Afterwards the dwellers around called the city <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, as well as <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, just as Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.519">Hom. Il. 2.519</bibl></note> so calls it in the list of the Phocians.  Those who would find pedigrees for everything think that Pythes was a son of Delphus, and that because he was king the city was called <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>.  But the most widespread tradition has it that the victim of Apollo's arrows rotted here, and that this was the reason why the city received the name <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>.  For the men of those days used <term>pythesthai</term> for the verb “to rot,” and hence Homer in his poem says that the island of the Sirens was full of bones, because the men who heard their singing rotted (epythonto).</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The poets say that the victim of Apollo was a dragon posted by Earth to be a guard for the oracle.

He pillaged the sanctuary of the god, and he also pillaged the houses of rich men.  But when he was making a second expedition, the Delphians besought Apollo to keep from them the danger that threatened them.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Phemonoe, the prophetess of that day, gave them an oracle in hexameter verse:—<quote type="oracle"><l met="dact">At close quarters a grievous arrow shall Apollo shoot</l><l>At the spoiler of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>; and of his blood-guilt</l><l>The Cretans shall cleanse his hands; but the renown shall never die.</l></quote></p></div>

<div n="7" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It seems that from the beginning the sanctuary at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> has been plotted against by a vast number of men.  Attacks were made against it by this Euboean pirate, and years afterwards by the Phlegyan nation; furthermore by Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, by a portion of the army of Xerxes, by the Phocian chieftains, whose attacks on the wealth of the god were the longest and fiercest, and by the Gallic invaders.  It was fated too that <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> was to suffer from the universal irreverence of Nero, who robbed Apollo of five hundred bronze statues, some of gods, some of men.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The oldest contest and the one for which they first offered prizes was, according to tradition, the singing of a hymn to the god.  The man who sang and won the prize was Chrysothemis of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, whose father Carmanor is said to have cleansed Apollo. After Chrysothemis, says tradition, Philammon won with a song, and after him his son Thamyris.  But they say that Orpheus, a proud man and conceited about his mysteries, and Musaeus, who copied Orpheus in everything, refused to submit to the competition in musical skill.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say too that Eleuther won a Pythian victory for his loud and sweet voice, for the song that he sang was not of his own composition.  The story is that Hesiod too was debarred from competing because he had not learned to accompany his own singing on the harp.  Homer too came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to inquire about his needs, but even though he had learned to play the harp, he would have found the skill useless owing to the loss of his eye-sight.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the third year of the forty-eighth Olympiad,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0586">586 B.C</date></note> at which Glaucias of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName> was victorious, the Amphictyons held contests for harping as from the beginning, but added competitions for flute-playing and for singing to the flute.  The conquerors proclaimed were Melampus, a Cephallenian, for harping, and Echembrotus, an Arcadian, for singing to the flute, with Sacadas of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> for flute-playing.  This same Sacadas won victories at the next two Pythian festivals.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On that occasion they also offered for the first time prizes for athletes, the competitions being the same as those at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, except the four-horse chariot, and the Delphians themselves added to the contests running-races for boys, the long course and the double course.  At the second Pythian Festival they no longer offered prizes for events, and hereafter gave a crown for victory.  On this occasion they no longer included singing to the flute, thinking that the music was ill-omened to listen to.  For the tunes of the flute were most dismal, and the words sung to the tunes were lamentations.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>What I say is confirmed by the votive offering of Echembrotus, a bronze tripod dedicated to the Heracles at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.  The tripod has as its inscription:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Echembrotus of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> dedicated this pleasant gift to Heracles</l><l>When he won a victory at the games of the Amphictyons,</l><l>Singing for the Greeks tunes and lamentations.</l></quote>In this way the competition in singing to the flute was dropped.  But they added a chariot-race, and Cleisthenes, the tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, was proclaimed victor in the chariot-race.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the eighth Pythian Festival they added a contest for harpists playing without singing; Agelaus of <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> was crowned.  At the twenty-third Pythian Festival they added a race in armour.  For this Timaenetus of Phlius won the laurel, five Olympiads after Damaretus of <placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName> was victorious.  At the forty-eighth Pythian Festival they established a race for two-horse chariots, and the chariot won of Execestides the Phocian.  At the fifth Festival after this they yoked foals to a chariot, and the chariot of Orphondas of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> came in first.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The pancratium for boys, a race for a chariot drawn by two foals, and a race for ridden foals, were many years afterwards introduced from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.  The first was brought in at the sixty-first Pythian Festival, and Iolaidas of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> was victorious.  At the next Festival but one<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><date when="-0310">310 B.C</date></note> they held a race for a ridden foal, and at the sixty-ninth Festival a race for a chariot drawn by two foals; the victor proclaimed for the former was Lycormas of <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName>, for the latter Ptolemy the Macedonian.  For the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> liked to be called Macedonians, as in fact they were.  The reason why a crown of laurel is the prize for a Pythian victory is in my opinion simply and solely because the prevailing tradition has it that Apollo fell in love with the daughter of <placeName key="tgn,1033742">Ladon</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="8" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Some are of opinion that the assembly of the Greeks that meets at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> was established by Amphictyon, the son of Deucalion, and that the delegates were styled Amphictyons after him.  But Androtion, in his history of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, says that originally the councillors came to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> from the neighboring states, that the deputies were styled Amphictions (neighbors), but that as time went on their modern name prevailed.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that Amphictyon himself summoned to the common assembly the following tribes of the Greek people:—Ionians, Dolopes, Thessalians, Aenianians, Magnesians, Malians, Phthiotians, Dorians, Phocians, Locrians who border on <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, living at the bottom of Mount Cnemis. But when the Phocians seized the sanctuary, and the war came to an end nine years afterwards, there came a change in the Amphictyonic League. The Macedonians managed to enter it, while the Phocian nation and a section of the Dorians, namely the Lacedaemonians, lost their membership, the Phocians because of their rash crime, the Lacedaemonians as a penalty for allying themselves with the Phocians.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When Brennus led the Gallic army against <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, no Greeks showed greater zeal for the war than the Phocians, and for this conduct of theirs recovered their membership of the League, as well as their old reputation.  The emperor Augustus willed that the Nicopolitans, whose city is near <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, should be members of the Amphictyonic League, that the Magnesians moreover and the Malians, together with the Aenianians and Phthiotians, should be numbered with the Thessalians, and that all their votes, together with those of the Dolopes, who were no longer a separate people, should be assigned to the Nicopolitans.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Amphictyons to-day number thirty.  <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> each send six deputies; the Boeotians, who in more ancient days inhabited <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and were then called Aeolians, the Phocians and the Delphians, each send two; ancient Doris sends one.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Ozolian Locrians, and the Locrians opposite <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, send one each; there is also one from <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>.  Of the Peloponnesians, the Argives, Sicyonians, Corinthians and Megarians send one, as <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName> send deputies to every meeting of the Amphictyonic League; but each city of the nations mentioned has the privilege of sending members in turn after the lapse of periodic intervals.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When you enter the city you see temples in a row. The first of them was in ruins, and the one next to it had neither images nor statues.  The third had statues of a few Roman emperors; the fourth is called the temple of Athena Forethought.  Of its two images the one in the fore-temple is a votive offering of the Massiliots, and is larger than the one inside the temple.  The Massiliots are a colony of <placeName key="tgn,7018000">Phocaea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, and their city was founded by some of those who ran away from <placeName key="tgn,7018000">Phocaea</placeName> when attacked by Harpagus the Persian.  They proved superior to the Carthaginians in a sea war, acquired the territory they now hold, and reached great prosperity.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The votive offering of the Massiliots is of bronze. The gold shield given to Athena Forethought by Croesus the Lydian was said by the Delphians to have been stolen by Philomelus.  Near the sanctuary of Forethought is a precinct of the hero Phylacus. This Phylacus is reported by the Delphians to have defended them at the time of the Persian invasion.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They say that in the open part of the gymnasium there once grew a wild wood, and that Odysseus, when as the guest of Autolycus he was hunting with the sons of Autolycus, received here from the wild boar the wound above the knee.  Turning to the left from the gymnasium and going down not more, I think, than three stades, you come to a river named Pleistus.  This Pleistus descends to <placeName key="tgn,6001466">Cirrha</placeName>, the port of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and flows into the sea there.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Ascending from the gymnasium along the way to the sanctuary you reach, on the right of the way, the water of Castalia, which is sweet to drink and pleasant to bathe in. Some say that the spring was named after a native woman, others after a man called Castalius.  But Panyassis, son of Polyarchus, who composed an epic poem on Heracles, says that Castalia was a daughter of Achelous.  For about Heracles he says:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Crossing with swift feet snowy <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName></l><l>He reached the immortal water of Castalia, daughter of Achelous.</l></quote><bibl>Panyassis, work unknown</bibl></p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have heard another account, that the water was a gift to Castalia from the river Cephisus.  So Alcaeus has it in his prelude to Apollo.  The strongest confirmation of this view is a custom of the Lilaeans, who on certain specified days throw into the spring of the Cephisus cakes of the district and other things ordained by use, and it is said that these reappear in Castalia.</p></div>

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The athletes and competitors in music that the majority of mankind have neglected, are, I think, scarcely worthy of serious attention; and the athletes who have left a reputation behind them I have set forth in my account of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 6.1">Paus. 6.1-18</bibl></note> There is a statue at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> of Phaylus of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName>.

<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such is the story of the athlete of <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName>.

The story is that in <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> a bull, leaving the cows, would go down from the pasture and bellow on the shore.  As the same thing happened every day, the herdsman went down to the sea and saw a countless number of tunny-fish.</p></div>

For never could rain fall from a clear and cloudless sky.  When he was in despair, his wife, who had accompanied him from home, among other endearments placed her husband's head between her knees and began to pick out the lice.

They add that the surname Idaean was given to the nymph simply because the men of those days called <term>idai</term> places that were thickly wooded.

In size and prosperity <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> is the equal of the most celebrated islands.  What the ancient name was that the natives give it I do not know, but those of the Greeks who sailed there to trade called it Ichnussa, because the shape of the island is very like a man's footprint (ichnos).  Its length is one thousand one hundred and twenty stades, and its breadth extends to four hundred and twenty.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The first sailors to cross to the island are said to have been Libyans.  Their leader was Sardus, son of Maceris, the Maceris surnamed Heracles by the Egyptians and Libyans. Maceris himself was celebrated chiefly for his journey to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, but Sardus it was who led the Libyans to Ichnussa, and after him the island was renamed. However, the Libyan army did not expel the aboriginals, who received the invaders as settlers through compulsion rather than in goodwill. Neither the Libyans nor the native population knew how to build cities. They dwelt in scattered groups, where chance found them a home in cabins or caves.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Years after the Libyans, there came to the island from Greece Aristaeus and his followers. Aristaeus is said to have been a son of Apollo and <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, and they say that, deeply grieved by the fate of Actaeon, and vexed alike with <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> and the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, he migrated to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Others think that Daedalus too ran away from Camicus on this occasion, because of the invasion of the Cretans, and took a part in the colony that Aristaeus led to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>. But it is nonsense to think that Daedalus, a contemporary of Oedipus, king of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, had a part in a colony or anything else along with Aristaeus, who married Autonoe, the daughter of Cadmus. At any rate, these colonists too founded no city, the reason being, I think, that neither in numbers nor in strength were they capable of the task.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After Aristaeus the Iberians crossed to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, under Norax as leader of the expedition, and they founded the city of <placeName key="perseus,Nora">Nora</placeName>. The tradition is that this was the first city in the island, and they say that Norax was a son of Erytheia, the daughter of Geryones, with Hermes for his father. A fourth component part of the population was the army of Iolaus, consisting of Thespians and men from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, which put in at <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and founded <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName>; by themselves the Athenians founded Ogryle, either in commemoration of one of their parishes in the home-land, or else because one Ogrylus himself took part in the expedition. Be this as it may, there are still today places in <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> called Iolaia, and Iolaus is worshipped by the inhabitants.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was taken, among those Trojans who fled were those who escaped with Aeneas.

But the non-Greek element were prevented from coming to blows with the Greeks and Trojans, for the two enemies were evenly matched in all warlike equipment, while the river Thorsus, flowing between their territories, made both equally afraid to cross it.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>However, many years afterwards the Libyans crossed again to the island with a stronger army, and began a war against the Greeks. The Greeks were utterly destroyed, or only a few of them survived. The Trojans made their escape to the high parts of the island, and occupied mountains difficult to climb, being precipitous and protected by stakes. Even at the present day they are called Ilians, but in figure, in the fashion of their arms, and in their mode of living generally, they are like the Libyans.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not far distant from <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> is an island, called Cyrnus by the Greeks, but <placeName key="tgn,7001093">Corsica</placeName> by the Libyans who inhabit it. A large part of the population, oppressed by civil strife, left it and came to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>; there they took up their abode, confining themselves to the highlands.

These Carthaginians, like those who preceded them, founded cities in the island, namely, <placeName key="perseus,Caralis">Caralis</placeName> and Sulci. Some of the Carthaginian mercenaries, either Libyans or Iberians, quarrelled about the booty, mutinied in a passion, and added to the number of the highland settlers.

<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Across the middle of the island runs another chain of mountains, but lower in height. The atmosphere here is on the whole heavy and unwholesome. The reason is partly the salt that crystallizes here, partly the oppressive, violent south wind, and partly the fact that, because of the height of the mountains on the side towards <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the north winds are prevented, when they blow in summer, from cooling the atmosphere and the ground here. Others say that the cause is Cyrnus, which is separated from <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> by no more than eight stades of sea, and is hilly and high all over.

They say that the siege was not a short one, and being unable to take the city, they sent envoys to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, to whom was given the following response:—</p></div>

Some of the besiegers ran up and took the woman prisoner, who informed the Achaeans that the scanty water from the spring, that was fetched each night, was rationed among the besieged, who had nothing else to quench their thirst.

It chanced that an ass, being driven back from the fields, was chasing a she-ass with harsh braying and wanton gait, while the driver of the ass increased the din by his horrible, inarticulate yells.

So the rest of the ornament in the pediments was carved by Androsthenes, like Praxias an Athenian by birth, but a pupil of Eucadmus. There are arms of gold on the architraves; the Athenians dedicated the shields from spoils taken at the battle of Marathon, and the Aetolians the arms, supposed to be Gallic, behind and on the left.

The Celts conducted their first foreign expedition under the leadership of Cambaules. Advancing as far as <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> they lost heart and broke off their march, realizing that they were too few in number to be a match for the Greeks.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But when they decided to invade foreign territory a second time, so great was the influence of Cambaules' veterans, who had tasted the joy of plunder and acquired a passion for robbery and plunder, that a large force of infantry and no small number of mounted men attended the muster. So the army was split up into three divisions by the chieftains, to each of whom was assigned a separate land to invade.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Cerethrius was to be leader against the Thracians and the nation of the Triballi. The invaders of Paeonia were under the command of Brennus and Acichorius. Bolgius attacked the Macedonians and Illyrians, and engaged in a struggle with Ptolemy, king of the Macedonians at that time. It was this Ptolemy who, though he had taken refuge as a suppliant with Seleucus, the son of Antiochus, treacherously murdered him, and was surnamed Thunderbolt because of his recklessness. Ptolemy himself perished in the fighting, and the Macedonian losses were heavy. But once more the Celts lacked courage to advance against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and so the second expedition returned home.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It was then that Brennus, both in public meetings and also in personal talks with individual Gallic officers, strongly urged a campaign against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, enlarging on the weakness of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at the time, on the wealth of the Greek states, and on the even greater wealth in sanctuaries, including votive offerings and coined silver and gold. So he induced the Gauls to march against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Among the officers he chose to be his colleagues was Acichorius.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The muster of foot amounted to one hundred and fifty-two thousand, with twenty thousand four hundred horse. This was the number of horsemen in action at any one time, but the real number was sixty-one thousand two hundred.

<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the Gallic horsemen were engaged, the servants remained behind the ranks and proved useful in the following way. Should a horseman or his horse fall, the slave brought him a horse to mount; if the rider was killed, the slave mounted the horse in his master's place; if both rider and horse were killed, there was a mounted man ready. When a rider was wounded, one slave brought back to camp the wounded man, while the other took his vacant place in the ranks.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I believe that the Gauls in adopting these methods copied the Persian regiment of the Ten Thousand, who were called the Immortals. There was, however, this difference. The Persians used to wait until the battle was over before replacing casualties, while the Gauls kept reinforcing the horsemen to their full number during the height of the action. This organization is called in their native speech <term>trimarcisia</term>, for I would have you know that <term>marca</term> is the Celtic name for a horse.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This was the size of the army, and such was the intention of Brennus, when he attacked <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.

They still remembered the fate of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and Paeonia during the former incursion of the Gauls, and reports were coming in of enormities committed at that very time on the Thessalians.

Lacedaemonians with Leonidas not more than three hundred; Tegeans five hundred, and five hundred from <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantineia</placeName>; from <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> a hundred and twenty; from the other cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> one thousand; from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> eighty; from Phlius two hundred, and from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> twice this number; of the Boeotians there mustered seven hundred from <placeName key="tgn,5004258">Thespiae</placeName> and four hundred from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. A thousand Phocians guarded the path on Mount Oeta, and the number of these should be added to the Greek total.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Herodotus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hdt. 7.203">Hdt. 7.203</bibl></note> does not give the number of the Locrians under Mount Cnemis, but he does say that each of their cities sent a contingent. It is possible, however, to make an estimate of these also that comes very near to the truth. For not more than nine thousand Athenians marched to Marathon, even if we include those who were too old for active service and slaves; so the number of Locrian fighting men who marched to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> cannot have exceeded six thousand. So the whole army would amount to eleven thousand two hundred. But it is well known that not even these remained all the time guarding the pass; for if we except the Lacedaemonians, Thespians and Mycenaeans, the rest left the field before the conclusion of the fighting.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>To meet the barbarians who came from the Ocean the following Greek forces came to <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. Of the Boeotians ten thousand hoplites and five hundred cavalry, the Boeotarchs being Cephisodotus, Thearidas, Diogenes and Lysander. From <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> came five hundred cavalry with footmen three thousand in number. The generals of the Phocians were Critobulus and Antiochus.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Locrians over against the island of Atalanta were under the command of Meidias; they numbered seven hundred, and no cavalry was with them. Of the Megarians came four hundred hoplites commanded by Hipponicus of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>. The Aetolians sent a large contingent, including every class of fighting men; the number of cavalry is not given, but the light-armed were seven hundred and ninety, and their hoplites numbered more than seven thousand. Their leaders were Polyarchus, Polyphron and Lacrates.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Athenian general was Callippus, the son of Moerocles, as I have said in an earlier part of my work,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 1.3.9">Paus. 1.3.9</bibl> and <bibl n="Paus. 1.4.2">Paus. 1.4.2</bibl>.</note> and their forces consisted of all their seaworthy triremes, five hundred horse and one thousand foot. Because of their ancient reputation the Athenians held the chief command. The king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> sent five hundred mercenaries, and the king of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> a like number; the leader of those sent by Antigonus was Aristodemus, a Macedonian, and Telesarchus, one of the Syrians on the Orontes, commanded the forces that Antiochus sent from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.</p></div>

On their arrival these forces broke down the bridges and by themselves encamped along the bank. But Brennus himself was not utterly stupid, nor inexperienced, for a barbarian, in devising tricks of strategy.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So on that very night he despatched some troops to the Spercheius, not to the places where the old bridges had stood, but lower down, where the Greeks would not notice the crossing, and just where the river spread over the plain and made a marsh and lake instead of a narrow, violent stream. Hither Brennus sent some ten thousand Gauls, picking out the swimmers and the tallest men; and the Celts as a race are far taller than any other people.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So these crossed in the night, swimming over the river where it expands into a lake; each man used his shield, his national buckler, as a raft, and the tallest of them were able to cross the water by wading. The Greeks on the Spercheius, as soon as they learned that a detachment of the barbarians had crossed by the marsh, forthwith retreated to the main army. Brennus ordered the dwellers round the Malian gulf to build bridges across the Spercheius, and they proceeded to accomplish their task with a will, for they were frightened of Brennus, and anxious for the barbarians to go away out of their country instead of staying to devastate it further.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Brennus brought his army across over the bridges and proceeded to Heracleia. The Gauls plundered the country, and massacred those whom they caught in the fields, but did not capture the city. For a year previous to this the Aetolians had forced Heracleia to join the Aetolian League; so now they defended a city which they considered to belong to them just as much as to the Heracleots.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Brennus did not trouble himself much about Heracleia, but directed his efforts to driving away those opposed to him at the pass, in order to invade <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> south of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>.</p></div>

<div n="21" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Deserters kept Brennus informed about the forces from each city mustered at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. So despising the Greek army he advanced from Heracleia, and began the battle at sun-rise on the next day. He had no Greek soothsayer, and made no use of his own country's sacrifices, if indeed the Celts have any art of divination. Whereupon the Greeks attacked silently and in good order. When they came to close quarters, the infantry did not rush out of their line far enough to disturb their proper formation, while the light-armed troops remained in position, throwing javelins, shooting arrows or slinging bullets.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams. The Gauls were worse armed than the Greeks, having no other defensive armour than their national shields, while they were still more inferior in war experience.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On they marched against their enemies with the unreasoning fury and passion of brutes. Slashed with axe or sword they kept their desperation while they still breathed; pierced by arrow or javelin, they did not abate of their passion so long as life remained. Some drew out from their wounds the spears, by which they had been hit, and threw them at the Greeks or used them in close fighting.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Meanwhile the Athenians on the triremes, with difficulty and with danger, nevertheless coasted along through the mud that extends far out to sea, brought their ships as close to the barbarians as possible, and raked them with arrows and every other kind of missile. The Celts were in unspeakable distress, and as in the confined space they inflicted few losses but suffered twice or four times as many, their captains gave the signal to retire to their camp. Retreating in confusion and without any order, many were crushed beneath the feet of their friends, and many others fell into the swamp and disappeared under the mud. Their loss in the retreat was no less than the loss that occurred while the battle raged.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On this day the Attic contingent surpassed the other Greeks in courage.  Of the Athenians themselves the bravest was Cydias, a young man who had never before been in battle.  He was killed by the Gauls, but his relatives dedicated his shield to Zeus God of Freedom, and the inscription ran:—<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Here hang I, yearning for the still youthful bloom of Cydias,</l><l>The shield of a glorious man, an offering to Zeus.</l><l>I was the very first through which at this battle he thrust his left arm,</l><l>When the battle raged furiously against the <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>.</l></quote></p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This inscription remained until Sulla and his army took away, among other Athenian treasures, the shields in the porch of Zeus, God of Freedom.  After this battle at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> the Greeks buried their own dead and spoiled the barbarians, but the Gauls sent no herald to ask leave to take up the bodies, and were indifferent whether the earth received them or whether they were devoured by wild beasts or carrion birds.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There were in my opinion two reasons that made them careless about the burial of their dead: they wished to strike terror into their enemies, and through habit they have no tender feeling for those who have gone.  In the battle there fell forty of the Greeks; the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="22" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the seventh day after the battle a regiment of Gauls attempted to go up to Oeta by way of Heracleia.  Here too a narrow path rises just past the ruins of <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>.  There was also at that time a sanctuary of Athena above the Trachinian territory, and in it were votive offerings.  So they hoped to ascend Oeta by this path and at the same time to get possession of the offerings in the temple in passing.  [This path was defended by the Phocians under Telesarchus.] They overcame the barbarians in the engagement, but Telesarchus himself fell, a man devoted, if ever a man was, to the Greek cause.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All the leaders of the barbarians except Brennus were terrified of the Greeks, and at the same time were despondent of the future, seeing that their present condition showed no signs of improvement. But Brennus reasoned that if he could compel the Aetolians to return home to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, he would find the war against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> prove easier hereafter.  So he detached from his army forty thousand foot and about eight hundred horse.  Over these he set in command Orestorius and Combutis,</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>who, making their way back by way of the bridges over the Spercheius and across <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> again, invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>.  The fate of the Callians at the hands of Combutis and Orestorius is the most wicked ever heard of, and is without a parallel in the crimes of men.  Every male they put to the sword, and there were butchered old men equally with children at their mothers' breasts.  The more plump of these sucking babes the Gauls killed, drinking their blood and eating their flesh.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Women and adult maidens, if they had any spirit at all in them, anticipated their end when the city was captured.  Those who survived suffered under imperious violence every form of outrage at the hands of men equally void of pity or of love.  Every woman who chanced to find a Gallic sword committed suicide.  The others were soon to die of hunger and want of sleep, the incontinent barbarians outraging them by turns, and sating their lust even on the dying and the dead.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Aetolians had been informed by messengers what disasters had befallen them, and at once with all speed removed their forces from <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> and hastened to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, being exasperated at the sufferings of the Callians, and still more fired with determination to save the cities not yet captured. From all the cities at home were mobilized the men of military age; and even those too old for service, their fighting spirit roused by the crisis, were in the ranks, and their very women gladly served with them, being even more enraged against the Gauls than were the men.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>When the barbarians, having pillaged houses and sanctuaries, and having fired Callium, were returning by the same way, they were met by the Patraeans, who alone of the Achaeans were helping the Aetolians.  Being trained as hoplites they made a frontal attack on the barbarians, but suffered severely owing to the number and desperation of the Gauls.  But the Aetolians, men and women, drawn up all along the road, kept shooting at the barbarians, and few shots failed to find a mark among enemies protected by nothing but their national shields.  Pursued by the Gauls they easily escaped, renewing their attack with vigor when their enemies returned from the pursuit.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Although the Callians suffered so terribly that even Homer's account of the Laestrygones and the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.166">Hom. Od. 9.166-542</bibl></note> does not seem outside the truth, yet they were duly and fully avenged.  For out of their number of forty thousand eight hundred, there escaped of the barbarians to the camp at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> less than one half.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meantime the Greeks at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> were faring as follows.  There are two paths across Mount Oeta: the one above <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName> is very steep, and for the most part precipitous; the other, through the territory of the Aenianians, is easier for an army to cross.  It was through this that on a former occasion Hydarnes the Persian passed to attack in the rear the Greeks under Leonidas.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hdt. 7.213">Hdt. 7.213-218</bibl></note></p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By this road the Heracleots and the Aenianians promised to lead Brennus, not that they were ill-disposed to the Greek cause, but because they were anxious for the Celts to go away from their country, and not to establish themselves in it to its ruin.  I think that Pindar<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Pind. N. 1">Pind. N. 1.53</bibl></note> spoke the truth again when he said that every one is crushed by his own misfortunes but is untouched by the woes of others.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Brennus was encouraged by the promise made by the Aenianians and Heracleots.  Leaving Acichorius behind in charge of the main army, with instructions that it was to attack only when the enveloping movement was complete, Brennus himself, with a detachment of forty thousand, began his march along the pass.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It so happened on that day that the mist rolled thick down the mountain, darkening the sun, so that the Phocians who were guarding the path found the barbarians upon them before they were aware of their approach.  Thereupon the Gauls attacked.  The Phocians resisted manfully, but at last were forced to retreat from the path. However, they succeeded in running down to their friends with a report of what was happening before the envelopment of the Greek army was quite complete on all sides.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Whereupon the Athenians with the fleet succeeded in withdrawing in time the Greek forces from <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, which disbanded and returned to their several homes.  Brennus, without delaying any longer, began his march against <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> without waiting for the army with Acichorius to join up.  In terror the Delphians took refuge in the oracle.  The god bade them not to be afraid, and promised that he would himself defend his own.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The Greeks who came in defence of the god were as follow: the Phocians, who came from all their cities; from <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName> four hundred hoplites; from the Aetolians a few came at once on hearing of the advance of the barbarians, and later on Philomelus brought one thousand two hundred.  The flower of the Aetolians turned against the army of Acichorius, and without offering battle attacked continuously the rear of their line of march, plundering the baggage and putting the carriers to the sword.  It was chiefly for this reason that their march proved slow.  Futhermore, at Heracleia Acichorius had left a part of his army, who were to guard the baggage of the camp.</p></div>

<div n="23" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Brennus and his army were now faced by the Greeks who had mustered at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and soon portents boding no good to the barbarians were sent by the god, the clearest recorded in history.  For the whole ground occupied by the Gallic army was shaken violently most of the day, with continuous thunder and lightning.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The thunder both terrified the Gauls and prevented them hearing their orders, while the bolts from heaven set on fire not only those whom they struck but also their neighbors, themselves and their armour alike.  Then there were seen by them ghosts of the heroes Hyperochus, Laodocus and Pyrrhus; according to some a fourth appeared, Phylacus, a local hero of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Among the many Phocians who were killed in the action was Aleximachus, who in this battle excelled all the other Greeks in devoting youth, physical strength, and a stout heart, to slaying the barbarians.  The Phocians made a statue of Aleximachus and sent it to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> as an offering to Apollo.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All the day the barbarians were beset by calamities and terrors of this kind.  But the night was to bring upon them experiences far more painful.  For there came on a severe frost, and snow with it; and great rocks slipping from <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, and crags breaking away, made the barbarians their target, the crash of which brought destruction, not on one or two at a time, but on thirty or even more, as they chanced to be gathered in groups, keeping guard or taking rest.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At sunrise the Greeks came on from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, making a frontal attack with the exception of the Phocians, who, being more familiar with the district, descended through the snow down the precipitous parts of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, and surprised the Celts in their rear, shooting them down with arrows and javelins without anything to fear from the barbarians.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>At the beginning of the fight the Gauls offered a spirited resistance, especially the company attached to Brennus, which was composed of the tallest and bravest of the Gauls, and that though they were shot at from all sides, and no less distressed by the frost, especially the wounded men.  But when Brennus himself was wounded, he was carried fainting from the battle, and the barbarians, harassed on all sides by the Greeks, fell back reluctantly, putting to the sword those who, disabled by wounds or sickness, could not go with them.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They encamped where night overtook them in their retreat, and during the night there fell on them a “panic.” For causeless terrors are said to come from the god Pan.  It was when evening was turning to night that the confusion fell on the army, and at first only a few became mad, and these imagined that they heard the trampling of horses at a gallop, and the attack of advancing enemies; but after a little time the delusion spread to all.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So rushing to arms they divided into two parties, killing and being killed, neither understanding their mother tongue nor recognizing one another's forms or the shape of their shields.  Both parties alike under the present delusion thought that their opponents were Greek, men and armour, and that the language they spoke was Greek, so that a great mutual slaughter was wrought among the Gauls by the madness sent by the god.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those Phocians who had been left behind in the fields to guard the flocks were the first to perceive and report to the Greeks the panic that had seized the barbarians in the night.  The Phocians were thus encouraged to attack the Celts with yet greater spirit, keeping a more careful watch on their encampments, and not letting them take from the country the necessities of life without a struggle, so that the whole Gallic army suffered at once from a pressing shortage of corn and other food.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Their losses in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> were these: in the battles were killed close on six thousand; those who perished in the wintry storm at night and afterwards in the panic terror amounted to over ten thousand, as likewise did those who were starved to death.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Athenian scouts arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to gather information, after which they returned and reported what had happened to the barbarians, and all that the god had inflicted upon them.

Thus the combined armies followed the barbarians, lying in wait and killing those who happened to be the last.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those who fled with Brennus had been joined by the army under Acichorius only on the previous night.  For the Aetolians had delayed their march, hurling at them a merciless shower of javelins and anything else they could lay hands on, so that only a small part of them escaped to the camp at Heracleia.  There was still a hope of saving the life of Brennus, so far as his wounds were concerned; but, they say, partly because he feared his fellow-countrymen, and still more because he was conscience-stricken at the calamities he had brought on <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, he took his own life by drinking neat wine.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After this the barbarians proceeded with difficulty as far as the Spercheius, pressed hotly by the Aetolians. But after their arrival at the Spercheius, during the rest of the retreat the Thessalians and Malians kept lying in wait for them, and so took their fill of slaughter that not a <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> returned home in safety.</p></div>

Every year the Delphians sacrifice to him as to a hero. Ascending from the tomb you come to a stone of no large size. Over it every day they pour olive oil, and at each feast they place on it unworked wool. There is also an opinion about this stone, that it was given to Cronus instead of his child, and that Cronus vomited it up again.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Coming back to the temple after seeing the stone, you come to the spring called Cassotis. By it is a wall of no great size, and the ascent to the spring is through the wall. It is said that the water of this Cassotis sinks under the ground, and inspires the women in the shrine of the god. She who gave her name to the spring is said to have been a nymph of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="25" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beyond the Cassotis stands a building with paintings of Polygnotus. It was dedicated by the Cnidians, and is called by the Delphians Lesche (Place of Talk, Club Room), because here in days of old they used to meet and chat about the more serious matters and legendary history. That there used to be many such places all over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> is shown by Homer's words in the passage where Melantho abuses Odysseus:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">And you will not go to the smith's house to sleep,</l><l>Nor yet to the place of talk, but you make long speeches here.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 18.328">Hom. Od. 18.328</bibl></p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Inside this building the whole of the painting on the right depicts <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> taken and the Greeks sailing away. On the ship of Menelaus they are preparing to put to sea. The ship is painted with children among the grown-up sailors; amidships is Phrontis the steersman holding two boat-hooks. Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 3.278">Hom. Od. 3.278</bibl> foll.</note> represents Nestor as speaking about Phrontis in his conversation with Telemachus, saying that he was the son of Onetor and the steersman of Menelaus, of very high repute in his craft, and how he came to his end when he was already rounding Sunium in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. Up to this point Menelaus had been sailing along with Nestor, but now he was left behind to build Phrontis a tomb, and to pay him the due rites of burial.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Phrontis then is in the painting of Polygnotus, and beneath him is one Ithaemenes carrying clothes, and Echoeax is going down the gangway, carrying a bronze urn. Polites, Strophius and Alphius are pulling down the hut of Menelaus, which is not far from the ship. Another hut is being pulled down by Amphialus, at whose feet is seated a boy. There is no inscription on the boy, and Phrontis is the only one with a beard. His too is the only name that Polygnotus took from the Odyssey; the names of the others he invented, I think, himself.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Briseis is standing with Diomeda above her and Iphis in front of both; they appear to be examining the form of Helen. Helen herself is sitting, and so is Eurybates near her. We inferred that he was the herald of Odysseus, although he had yet no beard. One handmaid, Panthalis, is standing beside Helen; another, Electra, is fastening her mistress' sandals. These names too are different from those given by Homer in the <title>Iliad</title>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.144">Hom. Il. 3.144</bibl></note> where he tells of Helen going to the wall with her slave women.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beyond Helen, a man wrapped in a purple cloak is sitting in an attitude of the deepest dejection; one might conjecture that he was Helenus, the son of Priam, even before reading the inscription. Near Helenus is Meges, who is wounded in the arm, as Lescheos of <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName>, son of Aeschylinus, describes in the <title>Sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></title>. For he says that he was wounded by Admetus, son of Augeias, in the battle that the Trojans fought in the night.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside Meges is also painted Lycomedes the son of Creon, who has a wound in the wrist; Lescheos says he was so wounded by Agenor. So it is plain that Polygnotus would not have represented them so wounded, if he had not read the poem of Lescheos. However, he has painted Lycomedes as wounded also in the ankle, and yet again in the head. Euryalus the son of Mecisteus has also received a wound in the head and another in the wrist.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>These are painted higher up than Helen in the picture. Next to Helen comes the mother of Theseus with her head shaved, and Demophon, one of the sons of Theseus, is considering, to judge from his attitude, whether it will be possible for him to rescue Aethra. The Argives say that Theseus had also a son Melanippus by the daughter of Sinis, and that Melanippus won a running-race when the Epigoni, as they are called, held the second celebration of the Nemean games, that of Adrastus being the first.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lescheos says of Aethra that, when <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> was taken, she came stealthily to the Greek camp. She was recognized by the sons of Theseus, and Demophon asked for her from Agamemnon. He was ready to grant Demophon the favour, but said that Helen must first give her consent. He sent a herald, and Helen granted him the favour. So in the painting Eurybates appears to have come to Helen to ask about Aethra, and to be saying what he had been told to say by Agamemnon.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Trojan women are represented as already captives and lamenting. Andromache is in the painting, and near stands her boy grasping her breast; this child Lescheos says was put to death by being flung from the tower, not that the Greeks had so decreed, but Neoptolemus, of his own accord, was minded to murder him. In the painting is also Medesicaste, another of Priam's illegitimate daughters, who according to Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.171">Hom. Il. 13.171</bibl></note> left her home and went to the city of Pedaeum to be the wife of Imbrius, the son of Mentor.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Andromache and Medesicaste are wearing hoods, but the hair of Polyxena is braided after the custom of maidens. Poets sing of her death at the tomb of Achilles, and both at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> on the Calcus I have seen the tragedy of Polyxena depicted in paintings.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The artist has painted Nestor with a cap on his head and a spear in his hand. There is also a horse, in the attitude of one about to roll in the dust. Right up to the horse there is a beach with what appear to be pebbles, but beyond the horse the sea-scene breaks off.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="26" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Above the women between Aethra and Nestor are other captive women, Clymene, Creusa, Aristomache and Xenodice. Now Stesichorus, in the <title>Sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></title>, includes Clymene in the number of the captives; and similarly, in the <title>Returns</title>, he speaks of Aristomache as the daughter of Priam and the wife of Critolaus, son of Hicetaon. But I know of no poet, and of no prose-writer, who makes mention of Xenodice. About Creusa the story is told that the mother of the gods and Aphrodite rescued her from slavery among the Greeks, as she was, of course, the wife of Aeneas. But Lescheos and the writer of the epic poem <title>Cypria</title> make Eurydice the wife of Aeneas.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beyond these are painted on a couch Deinome, Metioche, Peisis and Cleodice.  Deinome is the only one of these names to occur in what is called the <title>Little Iliad</title>; Polygnotus, I think, invented the names of the others.  Epeius is painted naked; he is razing to the ground the Trojan wall.  Above the wall rises the head only of the Wooden Horse.  There is Polypoetes, the son of Peirithous, his head bound with a fillet; by his side is Acamas, the son of Theseus, wearing on his head a helmet with a crest on it.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also Odysseus...and Odysseus has put on his corselet.  Ajax, the son of Oileus, holding a shield, stands by an altar, taking an oath about the outrage on Cassandra.  Cassandra is sitting on the ground, and holds the image of Athena, for she had knocked over the wooden image from its stand when Ajax was dragging her away from sanctuary.  In the painting are also the sons of Atreus, wearing helmets like the others; Menelaus carries a shield, on which is wrought a serpent as a memorial of the prodigy that appeared on the victims at <placeName key="tgn,5004252">Aulis</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Under those who are administering the oath to Ajax, and in a line with the horse by Nestor, is Neoptolemus, who has killed Elasus, whoever Elasus may be.  Elasus is represented as a man only just alive.  Astynous, who is also mentioned by Lescheos, has fallen to his knees, and Neoptolemus is striking him with a sword.  Neoptolemus is the only one of the Greek army represented by Polygnotus as still killing the Trojans, the reason being that he intended the whole painting to be placed over the grave of Neoptolemus. The son of Achilles is named Neoptolemus by Homer in all his poetry. The epic poem, however, called <title>Cypria</title> says that Lycomedes named him Pyrrhus, but Phoenix gave him the name of Neoptolemus (young soldier) because Achilles was but young when he first went to war.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the picture is an altar, to which a small boy clings in terror. On the altar lies a bronze corselet. At the present day corselets of this form are rare, but they used to be worn in days of old. They were made of two bronze pieces, one fitting the chest and the parts about the belly, the other intended to protect the back. They were called gyala. One was put on in front, and the other behind; then they were fastened together by buckles.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>They were thought to afford sufficient safety even without a shield. Wherefore Homer<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 17.312">Hom. Il. 17.312</bibl></note> speaks of Phorcys the Phrygian as without a shield, because he wore a two-piece corselet. Not only have I seen this armour depicted by Polygnotus, but in the temple of Ephesian Artemis Calliphon of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> has painted women fitting on the gyala of the corselet of Patroclus.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beyond the altar he has painted Laodice standing, whom I do not find among the Trojan captive women enumerated by any poet, so I think that the only probable conclusion is that she was set free by the Greeks. Homer in the <title>Iliad</title> speaks of the hospitality given to Menelaus and Odysseus by Antenor, and how Laodice was wife to Helicaon, Antenor's son.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.205">Hom. Il. 3.205</bibl> and <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.123">Hom. 3.123</bibl>.</note></p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lescheos says that Helicaon, wounded in the night battle, was recognized by Odysseus and carried alive out of the fighting. So the tie binding Menelaus and Odysseus to the house of Antenor makes it unlikely that Agamemnon and Menelaus committed any spiteful act against the wife of Helicaon. The account of Laodice given by the Chalcidian poet Euphorion is entirely unlikely.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next to Laodice is a stone stand with a bronze washing-basin upon it. Medusa is sitting on the ground, holding the stand in both hands. If we are to believe the ode of the poet of Himera, Medusa should be reckoned as one of the daughters of Priam. Beside Medusa is a shaved old woman or eunuch, holding on the knees a naked child. It is represented as holding its hand before its eyes in terror.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="27" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are also corpses: the naked man, Pelis by name, lies thrown on his back, and under Pelis lie Eioneus and Admetus, still clad in their corselets. Of these Lescheos says that Eioneus was killed by Neoptolemus, and Admetus by Philoctetes. Above these are others: under the washing-basin is Leocritus, the son of Pulydamas, killed by Odysseus; beyond Eioneus and Admetus is Coroebus, the son of Mygdon. Of Mygdon there is a notable tomb on the borders of the Phrygians of Stectorium, and after him poets are wont to call Phrygians by the name of Mygdones. Coroebus came to marry Cassandra, and was killed, according to the more popular account, by Neoptolemus, but according to the poet Lescheos, by Diomedes.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Higher up than Coroebus are Priam, Axion and Agenor. Lescheos says that Priam was not killed at the hearth of the Courtyard God, but that he was dragged away from the altar and fell an easy prey to Neoptolemus at the gate of his own palace. As to Hecuba, Stesichorus says in the <title>Sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></title> that she was brought by Apollo to <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName>. Lescheos says that Axion was a son of Priam, killed by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon. According to the same poet Agenor was slain by Neoptolemus. So it would appear that Echeclus the son of Agenor was slaughtered by Achilles, and Agenor himself by Neoptolemus.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The body of Laomedon is being carried off by Sinon, a comrade of Odysseus, and Anchialus. There is also in the painting another corpse, that of Eresus. The tale of Eresus and Laomedon, so far as we know, no poet has sung. There is the house of Antenor, with a leopard's skin hanging over the entrance, as a sign to the Greeks to keep their hands off the home of Antenor. There are painted Theano and her sons, Glaucus sitting on a corselet fitted with the two pieces, and Eurymachus upon a rock.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>By the latter stands Antenor, and next to him Crino, a daughter of Antenor. Crino is carrying a baby. The look upon their faces is that of those on whom a calamity has fallen. Servants are lading an ass with a chest and other furniture. There is also sitting on the ass a small child. At this part of the painting there is also an elegiac couplet of Simonides<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Polygnotus, a Thasian by birth, son of Aglaophon,</l><l>Painted a picture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s citadel being sacked.</l></quote><bibl>Simonides, unknown location.</bibl></p></div>

</div>

<div n="28" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The other part of the picture, the one on the left, shows Odysseus, who has descended into what is called Hades to inquire of the soul of Teiresias about his safe return home. The objects depicted are as follow. There is water like a river, clearly intended for <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, with reeds growing in it; the forms of the fishes appear so dim that you will take them to be shadows rather than fish. On the river is a boat, with the ferryman at the oars.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Polygnotus followed, I think, the poem called the <title>Minyad</title>. For in this poem occur lines referring to Theseus and Peirithous:—<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">Then the boat on which embark the dead, that the old</l><l>Ferryman, Charon, used to steer, they found not within its moorings.</l></quote><bibl>The Minyad, an unknown work.</bibl>For this reason then Polygnotus too painted Charon as a man well stricken in years.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Those on board the boat are not altogether distinguished. Tellis appears as a youth in years, and Cleoboea as still a maiden, holding on her knees a chest such as they are wont to make for Demeter. All I heard about Tellis was that Archilochus the poet was his grandson, while as for Cleoboea, they say that she was the first to bring the orgies of Demeter to <placeName key="tgn,7011078">Thasos</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the bank of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> there is a notable group under the boat of Charon, consisting of a man who had been undutiful to his father and is now being throttled by him. For the men of old held their parents in the greatest respect, as we may infer, among other instances, from those in <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> called the Pious, who, when the fire flowed down on <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>, held of no account gold or silver, but when they fled took up, one his mother and another his father. As they struggled on, the fire rushed up and caught them in the flames. Not even so would they put down their parents, and it is said that the stream of lava divided itself in two, and the fire passed on, doing no hurt to either young men or their parents. These Catanians even at the present day receive honors from their fellow countrymen.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Near to the man in Polygnotus' picture who maltreated his father and for this drinks his cup of woe in Hades, is a man who paid the penalty for sacrilege. The woman who is punishing him is skilled in poisonous and other drugs.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So it appears that in those days men laid the greatest stress on piety to the gods, as the Athenians showed when they took the sanctuary of Olympian Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; they moved none of the offerings, but left the Syracusan priest as their keeper. Datis the Persian too showed his piety in his address to the Delians, and in this act as well, when having found an image of Apollo in a Phoenician ship he restored it to the Tanagraeans at <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName>. So at that time all men held the divine in reverence, and this is why Polygnotus has depicted the punishment of him who committed sacrilege.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Higher up than the figures I have enumerated comes Eurynomus, said by the Delphian guides to be one of the demons in Hades, who eats off all the flesh of the corpses, leaving only their bones. But Homer's <title>Odyssey</title>, the poem called the <title>Minyad</title>, and the <title>Returns</title>, although they tell of Hades, and its horrors, know of no demon called Eurynomus. However, I will describe what he is like and his attitude in the painting. He is of a color between blue and black, like that of meat flies; he is showing his teeth and is seated, and under him is spread a vulture's skin.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Next after Eurynomus are Auge of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and Iphimedeia. Auge visited the house of Teuthras in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, and of all the women with whom Heracles is said to have mated, none gave birth to a son more like his father than she did. Great honors are paid to Iphimedeia by the Carians in <placeName key="perseus,Mylasa">Mylasa</placeName>.</p></div>

</div>

<div n="29" subtype="chapter" type="textpart">
<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Higher up than the figures I have already enumerated are Perimedes and Eurylochus, the companions of Odysseus, carrying victims for sacrifice; these are black -rams. After them is a man seated, said by the inscription to be Ocnus (Sloth). He is depicted as plaiting a cord, and by him stands a she-ass, eating up the cord as quickly as it is plaited. They say that this Ocnus was a diligent man with an extravagant wife. Everything he earned by working was quickly spent by his wife.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So they will have it that Polygnotus has painted a parable about the wife of Ocnus. I know also that the Ionians, whenever they see a man labouring at nothing profitable, say that such an one is plaiting the cord of Ocnus. Ocnus too is the name given to a bird by the seers who observe birds that are ominous. This Ocnus is the largest and most beautiful of the herons, a rare bird if ever there was one.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Tityos too is in the picture; he is no longer being punished, but has been reduced to nothing by continuous torture, an indistinct and mutilated phantom.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Going on to the next part of the picture, you see very near to the man who is twisting the rope a painting of Ariadne. Seated on a rock she is looking at her sister Phaedra, who is on a swing grasping in either hand the rope on each side. The attitude, though quite gracefully drawn, makes us infer the manner of Phaedra's death.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Ariadne was taken away from Theseus by Dionysus, who sailed against him with superior forces, and either fell in with Ariadne by chance or else set an ambush to catch her. This Dionysus was, in my opinion, none other than he who was the first to invade <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, and the first to bridge the river <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,7017540">Zeugma</placeName> (Bridge) was the name given to that part of the country where the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName> was bridged, and at the present day the cable is still preserved with which he spanned the river; it is plaited with branches of the vine and ivy.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Both the Greeks and the Egyptians have many legends about Dionysus. Underneath Phaedra is Chloris leaning against the knees of Thyia. He will not be mistaken who says that all during the lives of these women they remained friends. For Chloris came from <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, and the other was a daughter of Castalius from <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. Other authorities have told their history, how that Thyia had connection with Poseidon, and how Chloris wedded Neleus, son of Poseidon.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beside Thyia stands Procris, the daughter of Erechtheus, and after her Clymene, who is turning her back to Chloris. The poem the <title>Returns</title> says that Clymene was a daughter of Minyas, that she married Cephalus the son of Deion, and that a son Iphiclus was born to them. The story of Procris is told by all men, how she had married Cephalus before Clymene, and in what way she was put to death by her husband.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Farther within from Clymene you will see <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Beyond Eriphyle have been painted Elpenor and Odysseus. The latter is squatting on his feet, and holding his sword over the trench, towards which the seer Teiresias is advancing. After Teiresias is Anticleia, the mother of Odysseus, upon a rock. Elpenor has on instead of clothes a mat, such as is usual for sailors to wear.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Lower down than Odysseus are Theseus and Peirithous sitting upon chairs. The former is holding in his hands the sword of Peirithous and his own. Peirithous is looking at the swords, and you might conjecture that he is angry with them for having been useless and of no help in their daring adventures. Panyassis the poet says that Theseus and Peirithous did not sit chained to their chairs, but that the rock grew to their flesh and so served as chains.</p></div>
    <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The proverbial friendship of Theseus and Peirithous has been mentioned by Homer in both his poems.

Homer makes Penelope say in a speech<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 20.66">Hom.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>He goes on to say that Aphrodite ascended into heaven, wishing to secure for the girls a happy marriage, and in her absence they were carried off by the Harpies and given by them to the Furies. This is the story as given by Homer. Polygnotus has painted them as girls crowned with flowers and playing with dice, and gives them the names of Cameiro and Clytie. I must tell you that Pandareos was a Milesian from <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and implicated in the theft of Tantalus and in the trick of the oath.</p></div>

With the exception of Agamemnon these figures have no beard.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beyond them has been painted Phocus as a stripling, and Iaseus, well bearded, is taking off a ring from the left hand of Phocus. The story about this is as follows. When Phocus, the son of Aeacus, had crossed from <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> into what is now called <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, and wished to gain the rule over the men living on that part of the mainland, and to settle there himself, Iaseus conceived a great friendship for him. Among the gifts that Iaseus gave (as friends will) was a seal-ring, a stone set in gold. But when Phocus returned, not long afterwards, to <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, Peleus at once plotted to kill him. This is the reason why in the painting, as a reminder of their great friendship, Iaseus is anxious to look at the ring and Phocus has let him take it.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Beyond these is Maera sitting on a rock. About her the poem <title>Returns</title> says that she was still a maid when she departed this life, being the daughter of Proetus, son of Thersander, who was a son of Sisyphus. Next to Maera is Actaeon, son of Aristaeus, together with the mother of Actaeon; they hold in their hands a young deer, and are sitting on a deer's skin. A hunting dog lies stretched out beside them, an allusion to Actaeon's mode of life, and to the manner of his death.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Turning our gaze again to the lower part of the picture we see, next after Patroclus, Orpheus sitting on what seems to be a sort of hill; he grasps with his left hand a harp, and with his right he touches a willow.

<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the other side of the willow-tree Promedon is leaning against it. Some there are who think that the name Promedon is as it were a poetic invention of Polygnotus; others have said that Promedon was a Greek who was fond of listening to all kinds of music, especially to the singing of Orpheus.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In this part of the painting is Schedius, who led the Phocians to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and after him is Pelias, sitting on a chair, with grey hair and grey beard, and looking at Orpheus. Schedius holds a dagger and is crowned with grass. Thamyris is sitting near Pelias. He has lost the sight of his eyes; his attitude is one of utter dejection; his hair and beard are long; at his feet lies thrown a lyre with its horns and strings broken.</p></div>

The Phrygians in Celaenae hold that the river passing through the city was once this great flute-player, and they also hold that the Song of the Mother, an air for the flute, was composed by Marsyas. They say too that they repelled the army of the Gauls by the aid of Marsyas, who defended them against the barbarians by the water from the river and by the music of his flute.</p></div>

<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Adjoining the sacred enclosure is a theater worth seeing, and on coming up from the enclosure...and here is an image of Dionysus, dedicated by the Cnidians. The Delphian race-course is on the highest part of their city. It was made of the stone that is most common about <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, until Herodes the Athenian rebuilt it of Pentelic marble. Such in my day the objects remaining in <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> that are worth recording.</p></div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>On the way from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> to the summit of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, about sixty stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, there is a bronze image. The ascent to the Corycian cave is easier for an active walker than it is for mules or horses. I mentioned a little earlier in my narrative<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 10.6.3">Paus. 10.6.3</bibl>.</note> that this cave was named after a nymph called Corycia, and of all the caves I have ever seen this seemed to me the best worth seeing.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>It would be impossible to discover even the mere number of caves whose entrances face the beach or the deep sea, but the most famous ones in Greek or in foreign lands are the following. The Phrygians on the river Pencelas, and those who came to this land originally from the Azanians in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, show visitors a cave called Steunos, which is round, and handsome in its loftiness. It is sacred to the Mother, and there is an image of her.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Themisonium above <placeName key="tgn,7002492">Laodiceia</placeName> is also inhabited by Phrygians. When the army of the Gauls was laying waste <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> and the borders of <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, the Themisonians say that they were helped by Heracles, Apollo and Hermes, who revealed to their magistrates in dreams a cave, and commanded that in it should be hidden the Themisonians with their wives and children.</p></div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>This is the reason why in front of the cave they have set up small images, called Gods of the Cave, of Heracles, Hermes and Apollo. The cave is some thirty stades distant from the city, and in it are springs of water. There is no entrance to it, the sunlight does not reach very far, and the greater part of the roof lies quite close to the floor.</p></div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>There is also near <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> on the river Lethaeus a place called Aulae (Halls), where there is a cave sacred to Apollo, not very remarkable for its size, but the image of Apollo is very old indeed, and bestows strength equal to any task. The men sacred to the god leap down from sheer precipices and high rocks, and uprooting trees of exceeding height walk with their burdens down the narrowest of paths.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>But the Corycian cave exceeds in size those I have mentioned, and it is possible to make one's way through the greater part of it even without lights. The roof stands at a sufficient height from the floor, and water, rising in part from springs but still more dripping from the roof, has made clearly visible the marks of drops on the floor throughout the cave. The dwellers around <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> believe it to be sacred to the Corycian nymphs, and especially to Pan. From the Corycian cave it is difficult even for an active walker to reach the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. The heights are above the clouds, and the Thyiad women rave there in honor of Dionysus and Apollo.</p></div>

This road is not mountainous throughout, being fit even for vehicles, but was said to be several stades longer. I am aware that Herodotus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hdt. 8.32">Hdt. 8.32</bibl></note> in his account of the Persian invasion gives the town a different name from that given to it in the oracles of Bacis.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For Bacis called the inhabitants Tithoreans, but the account of them in Herodotus states that during the advance of the barbarian the people dwelling here fled up to the summit, and that the city's name was Neon, <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> being the name of the peak of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. It appears, then, that at first <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> was the name applied to the whole district; but in course of time, when the people migrated from the villages, the city too came to be called <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName>, and not Neon any longer. The natives say that <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> was so called after a nymph of the same name, one of those who in days of old, according to the story of the poets, grew out of trees and especially out of oaks.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>One generation before I was born heaven made the fortunes of <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> decay. There are the buildings of a theater, and the enclosure of a rather ancient market-place. The most noteworthy objects in the city are the grove, temple and image of Athena. There is also the tomb of Antiope and Phocus. I have already in my account of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> mentioned<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See <bibl n="Paus. 9.17.6">Paus. 9.17.6</bibl>.</note> how Antiope went mad because of the wrath of Dionysus, and the reason why she brought on herself the anger of the god;</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have also told how Phocus, the son of Ornytion, fell in love with her, how she married him and is buried with him, and what Bacis the soothsayer says about this grave in common with that of Zethus and Amphion at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. I found nothing else remarkable in the town except what I have already mentioned. Running past the city of <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> is a river that gives the inhabitants drinking-water. They go down to the bank and draw the water up. The name of the river is Cachales.</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Seventy stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> is a temple of Asclepius, called Archagetas (Founder). He receives divine honors from the Tithoreans, and no less from the other Phocians. Within the precincts are dwellings for both the suppliants of the god and his servants. In the middle is the temple of the god and an image made of stone, having a beard more than two feet long. A couch is set on the right of the image. It is usual to sacrifice to the god any animal except the goat.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>About forty stades distant from Asclepius is a precinct and shrine sacred to Isis, the holiest of all those made by the Greeks for the Egyptian goddess. For the Tithoreans think it wrong to dwell round about it, and no one may enter the shrine except those whom Isis herself has honored by inviting them in dreams. The same rule is observed in the cities above the <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName> by the gods of the lower world; for to all whom they wish to enter their shrines they send visions seen in dreams.</p></div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the country of the Tithoreans a festival in honor of Isis is held twice each year, one in spring and the other in autumn. On the third day before each of the feasts those who have permission to enter cleanse the shrine in a certain secret way, and also take and bury, always in the same spot, whatever remnants they may find of the victims thrown in at the previous festival. We estimated that the distance from the shrine to this place was two stades.</p></div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>So on this day they perform these acts about the sanctuary, and on the next day the small traders make themselves booths of reeds or other improvised material. On the last of the three days they hold a fair, selling slaves, cattle of all kinds, clothes, silver and gold.</p></div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>After mid-day they turn to sacrificing. The more wealthy sacrifice oxen and deer, the poorer people geese and guinea fowl. But it is not the custom to use for the sacrifice sheep, pigs or goats. Those whose business it is to burn the victims<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">This scarcely makes sense, and the emendation of Kayser is ingenious: “Those whom Isis has invited to send the victims.”</note> and send them into the shrine...having made a beginning must wrap the victims in bandages of coarse or fine linen; the mode of preparing is the Egyptian.</p></div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>All that they have devoted to sacrifice are led in procession; some send the victims into the shrine,while others burn the booths before the shrine and themselves go away in haste. They say that once a profane man, who was not one of those descending into the shrine, when the pyre began to burn, entered the shrine to satisfy his rash inquisitiveness. It is said that everywhere he saw ghosts, and on returning to <placeName key="perseus,Tithorea">Tithorea</placeName> and telling what he had seen he departed this life.</p></div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I have heard a similar story from a man of <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, that the Egyptians hold the feast for Isis at a time when they say she is mourning for Osiris. At this time the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> begins to rise, and it is a saying among many of the natives that what makes the river rise and water their fields is the tears of Isis. At that time then, so said my Phoenician, the Roman governor of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> bribed a man to go down into the shrine of Isis in <placeName key="tgn,7001262">Coptus</placeName>. The man despatched into the shrine returned indeed out of it, but after relating what he had seen, he too, so I was told, died immediately. So it appears that Homer's verse<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 20.131">Hom.

Still the name of Ledon is given to their dwellings, and the citizens, like the Panopeans, have the right to be represented at the general assembly of the Phocians.

Even after their city had been restored, its inhabitants were fated to suffer a second disaster at the hands of the Macedonians. Besieged by Philip, the son of Demetrius, they made terms and surrendered, and a garrison was brought into the city, until a native of the city, whose name was Patron, united against the garrison those of the citizens who were of military age, conquered the Macedonians in battle, and forced them to withdraw under a truce.

If then you go along the road from <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> to Opus, and turn off a little to the left, you reach the road to Abae. The people of Abae say that they came to <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and that the city got its name from Abas, the founder, who was a son of Lynceus and of Hypermnestra, the daughter of Danails.

<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The treatment that the god at Abae received at the hands of the Persians was very different from the honor paid him by the Romans. For while the Romans have given freedom of government to Abae because of their reverence for Apollo, the army of Xerxes burned down, as it did others, the sanctuary at Abae. The Greeks who opposed the barbarians resolved not to rebuild the sanctuaries burnt down by them, but to leave them for all time as memorials of their hatred. This too is the reason why the temples in the territory of Haliartus, as well as the Athenian temples of Hera on the road to Phalerum and of Demeter at Phalerum, still remain half-burnt even at the present day.</p></div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Such, I suppose, was the appearance of the sanctuary at Abae also, after the Persian invasion, until in the Phocian war some Phocians, overcome in battle, took refuge in Abae.

However, it still stood even in my time, the frailest of buildings ever damaged by fire, seeing that the ruin begun by the Persian incendiaries was completed by the incendiaries of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.</p></div>

This is their sole supply, both for drinking and for washing; from no other source can they get water, save only from the winter rains.</p></div>

There is another road, rough and for the most part mountainous, that leads from Chaeroneia to the Phocian city of Stiris. The length of the road is one hundred and twenty stades. The inhabitants assert that by descent they are not Phocian, but Athenian, and that they came from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> with Peteus, the son of Orneus, when he was pursued from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Aegeus.

The spring is in a hole dug into the rocks, and they go down to it to fetch water.</p></div>

Each ring of wall is a little less than a fathom broad, and two and a half fathoms in height except where it has broken down.</p></div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The interval between the first ring and the second is a fathom.

About two stades up the slope is a level place, and on the right of the road is a sanctuary of Artemis surnamed Dictynnaean, a goddess worshipped with great reverence by citizens. The image is of Aeginetan workmanship, and made of a black stone. From the sanctuary of the Dictynnaean goddess the road is downhill all the way to Anticyra.

<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>In the market-place at Anticyra are bronze statues, and at the harbor is a small sanctuary of Poseidon, built of unhewn stones.

<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>Opposite the gymnasium, in which the baths have been made, is another gymnasium, an old one, in which stands a bronze statue.

<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>For I have stated in an earlier part of my work<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 8.14.8">Paus. 8.14.8</bibl></note> that two Samians, Rhoecus, son of Philaeus, and Theodorus, son of Telecles, discovered how to found bronze most perfectly, and were the first casters of that metal. I have found extant no work of Theodorus, at least no work of bronze. But in the sanctuary of Ephesian Artemis, as you enter the building containing the pictures, there is a stone wall above the altar of Artemis called Goddess of the First Seat. Among the images that stand upon the wall is a statue of a woman at the end, a work of Rhoecus, called by the Ephesians Night.</p></div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>A mere glance shows that this image is older, and of rougher workmanship, than the Athena in <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>. The Amphissians also celebrate mysteries in honor of the Boy Kings, as they are called. Their accounts as to who of the gods the Boy Kings are do not agree; some say they are the Dioscuri, others the Curetes, and others, who pretend to have fuller knowledge, hold them to be the Cabeiri.</p></div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These Locrians also possess the following cities. Farther inland from <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>, and above it, is <placeName key="perseus,Myonia">Myonia</placeName>, thirty stades distant from it. Its people are those who dedicated the shield to Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>. The town lies upon a height, and it has a grove and an altar of the Gracious Gods. The sacrifices to the Gracious Gods are offered at night, and their rule is to consume the meat on the spot before sunrise. Beyond the city is a precinct of Poseidon, called Poseidonium, and a temple of Poseidon is in it. But the image had disappeared before my time.</p></div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These, then, live above <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>. On the coast is Oeantheia, neighbor to which is <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>. The others, but not <placeName key="perseus,Amphissa">Amphissa</placeName>, are under the government of the Achaeans of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, the emperor Augustus having granted them this privilege. In Oeantheia is a sanctuary of Aphrodite, and a little beyond the city there is a grove of cypress-trees mixed with pines; in the grove is a temple of Artemis with an image. The paintings on the walls I found had lost their color with time, and nothing of them was still left worth seeing.</p></div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>I gather that the city got its name from a woman or a nymph, while as for <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, I have heard it said that the Dorians under the sons of Aristomachus built here the vessels in which they crossed to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, thus, it is said, giving to the place its name.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> means “the city of ship-building.”</note> My account of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, how the Athenians took it from the Locrians and gave it as a home to those who seceded to <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> at the time of the earthquake at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, and how, after the Athenian disaster at <placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians expelled the Messenians from <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, all this I have fully related in my history of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"><bibl n="Paus. 4.23">Paus. 4.23</bibl> foll.</note> When the Messenians were forced to leave, the Locrians gathered again at <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>.</p></div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The epic poem called the <title>Naupactia</title> by the Greeks is by most people assigned to a poet of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, while Charon, the son of Pythes, says that it is a composition of Carcinus of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>. I am one of those who agree with the Lampsacenian writer. For what reason could there be in giving the name of <title>Naupactia</title> to a poem about women composed by an author of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>?</p></div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here there is on the coast a temple of Poseidon with a standing image made of bronze; there is also a sanctuary of Artemis with an image of white marble. She is in the attitude of one hurling a javelin, and is surnamed Aetolian. In a cave Aphrodite is worshipped, to whom prayers are offered for various reasons, and especially by widows who ask the goddess to grant them marriage.</p></div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart"><p>The sanctuary of Asclepius I found in ruins, but it was originally built by a private person called Phalysius. For he had a complaint of the eyes, and when he was almost blind the god at <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> sent to him the poetess Anyte, who brought with her a sealed tablet. The woman thought that the god's appearance was a dream, but it proved at once to be a waking vision. For she found in her own hands a sealed tablet; so sailing to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> she bade Phalysius take away the seal and read what was written. He did not think it possible to read the writing with his eyes in such a condition, but hoping to get some benefit from Asclepius he took away the seal. When he had looked at the wax he recovered his sight, and gave to Anyte what was written on the tablet, two thousand staters of gold.</p></div>
