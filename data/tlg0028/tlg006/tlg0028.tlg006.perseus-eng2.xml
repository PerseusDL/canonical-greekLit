        <p>True happiness for one who is but human, gentlemen, would mean a life in which his person is threatened by no peril: and well might that be the burden of our prayers. But well too might we pray that if we must perforce face danger, we may have at least the one consolation which is to my mind the greatest of blessings at such an hour, a clear conscience; so that if disaster should after all befall us, it will be due to no iniquity of ours and bring no shame; it will be the result of chance rather than of wrongdoing. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="2"><p>It would be unanimously agreed, I think, that the laws which deal with cases such as the present are the most admirable and righteous of laws. Not only have they the distinction of being the oldest in this country, but they have changed no more than the crime with which they are concerned; and that is the surest token of good laws, as time and experience show mankind what is imperfect. Hence you must not use the speech for the prosecution to discover whether your laws are good or bad: you must use laws to discover whether or not the speech for the prosecution is giving you a correct and lawful interpretation of the case.<note resp="editor">Cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 5.14" >Antiph. 5.14</bibl>.</note> </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="3"><p>The person whom today’s proceedings concern most of all is myself, because I am the defendant and in danger. Nevertheless, it is also, I think, of great importance to you who are my judges that you should reach a correct verdict in trials for murder, first and foremost because of the gods and your duty towards them, and secondly for your own sakes. A case of this kind can be tried only once<note resp="editor">Cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 5.87">Antiph. 5.87-89</bibl>.</note>; and if it is wrongly decided against the defendant, justice and the facts cannot prevail against that decision. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="4">
        <p>Once you condemn him, a defendant must perforce accept your verdict, even if he was not the murderer or concerned in the crime. The law banishes him from his city, its temples, its games, and its sacrifices, the greatest and the most ancient of human institutions; and he must acquiesce. So powerful is the compulsion of the law, that even if a man slays one who is his own chattel and who has none to avenge him, his fear of the ordinances of god and of man causes him to purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by so doing he will best avoid disaster. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="5">
        <p>Most of the life of man rests upon hope; and by defying the gods and committing transgressions against them, he would rob himself even of hope, the greatest of human blessings. No one would venture either to disregard the sentence passed upon him because he was sure that he had had no part in the crime, or to disobey the law if he knew in his heart that he was guilty of such a deed. He has to submit to the verdict in defiance of the facts, or submit to the facts themselves, as the case may be, even if his victim has none to avenge him. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="6">
        <p>The laws, the oaths, the sacrifices, the proclamations, in fact the whole of the proceedings in connection with trials for murder differ as profoundly as they do from the proceedings elsewhere simply because it is of supreme importance that the facts at issue, upon which so much turns, should themselves be rightly interpreted. Such a right interpretation means vengeance for him who has been wronged; whereas to find an innocent man guilty of murder is a mistake, and a sinful mistake, which offends both gods and laws. Nor is it as serious for the prosecutor to accuse the wrong person as it is for you judges to reach a wrong verdict. The charge brought by the prosecutor is not in itself effective; whether it becomes so, depends upon you, sitting in judgement. On the other hand, if you yourselves arrive at a wrong verdict, you cannot rid yourselves of the responsibility for so doing by blaming someone else for that verdict. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="7"><p>My own attitude to my defence, gentlemen, is very different from that of my accusers to their prosecution. They, on their side, allege that their object in bringing this action is to discharge a sacred duty and to satisfy justice; whereas they have in fact treated their speech for the prosecution as nothing but an opportunity for malicious falsehood, and such behavior is the worst travesty of justice humanly possible. Their aim is not to expose any crime I may have committed in order to exact the penalty which it deserves, but to blacken me, even though I am entirely innocent, in order to have me punished with exile from this country. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="8">
        <p>I, on the other hand, consider that my first duty is to reply to the charge before the court by giving you a complete account of the facts. Afterwards, if you so desire, I shall be pleased to answer the remaining accusations made,<note resp="editor">This promise is never directly fulfilled, but <bibl n="Antiph. 6.33">Antiph. 6.33</bibl> ff. deal with the general conduct of the prosecution.</note> as they will, I feel, turn to my own credit and advantage, and to the discomfiture of my opponents to whose impudence they are due. For it is indeed a strange fact, gentlemen: </p>

        <p>when they had the opportunity of avenging themselves on an enemy and doing the state a service by exposing and bringing home to me any public offence of which I had been guilty, as Choregus or otherwise, not one of them was able to prove that I had done your people any wrong, great or small.<note resp="editor">This is presumably a reference to the speaker’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</foreign> when elected a member of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> in the preceding June. All magistrates had to submit to an inquiry into their general fitness to assume public office before they were installed.</note> Yet at today’s trial, when they are prosecuting for prosecution to the charge before the court,<note resp="editor">Cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 5.11">Antiph. 5.11</bibl>. There it is stated more explicitly that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωμοσία</foreign> ensured against irrelevant charges.</note> they are seeking to achieve my downfall with a tissue of lies calculated to bring my public life into disrepute. If the state has in fact been wronged, they are compensating it not with redress, but with a mere accusation; while they are themselves demanding that reparation for a wrong which has been suffered by the state should be made to them in person. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="10">
        <p>Indeed, they deserve to win neither gratitude nor credence with these charges of theirs. The circumstances in which they are prosecuting are not such as to allow the state to obtain satisfaction if really wronged, and only so would they be entitled to its gratitude; while the prosecutor who refuses to confine himself to the charge before the court in an action such as the present does not so much deserve to be believed as to be disbelieved. I myself know well enough what your own feelings are; nothing save the facts immediately at issue would lead you either to condemn or to acquit, because only thus can the claims of heaven and of justice be satisfied. So with those facts I will begin. </p>
      </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="11"><p>When I was appointed Choregus for the Thargelia,<note resp="editor">The <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορηγία</foreign> was one of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λητουργίαι</foreign>, or public duties, imposed upon the richer citizens by the state. A Choregus had to equip and train a chorus for one of the annual festivals, in this case the Thargelia, held in honor of Apollo and celebrated on the 7th of Thargelion (May 1st) by a competition between choirs of boys selected from the ten tribes, which were grouped in pairs for the purpose.</note> Pantacles<note anchored="true" resp="ed" >Probably this is the Pantacles who appears as a lyric poet in a choregic inscription of the period ( I.G. i(2). 771). Aristophanes also refers jokingly to a Pantacles who got into difficulties with his helmet at the Panatheniac procession on one occasion (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1036">Aristoph. Frogs 1036</bibl>: first staged in 405); but it is not certain that he was the poet.</note> falling to me as poet and the Cecropid as the tribe that went with mine [;that is to say the Erechtheid];,<note resp="editor">See critical note 6.</note> I discharged my office as efficiently and as scrupulously as I was able. I began by fitting out a training-room in the most suitable part of my house, the same that I had used when Choregus at the Dionysia.<note resp="editor">i.e. the Great Dionysia (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐν ἄστει Διονύσια</foreign>), celebrated every March with a procession, choruses of boys, and tragic and comic performances. The speaker had undertaken the training of a chorus for the festival in some previous year.</note> Next, I recruited the best chorus that I could, without indicting a single fine, without extorting a single pledge,<note resp="editor">The Choregus was empowered to inflict fines upon parents who refused to allow their sons to perform without good reason. The <q rend="double" type="mentioned">pledges</q> mentioned would presumably be exacted from parents who did proffer some excuse. If the excuse proved unsatisfactory, they would forfeit their money.</note> and without making a single enemy. Just as though nothing could have been more satisfactory or better suited to both parties, I on my side would make my demand or request, while the parents on theirs would send their sons along without demur, nay, readily. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="12"><p>For a while after the arrival of the boys I had no time to look after them in person, as I happened to be engaged in suits against Aristion and Philinus,<note resp="editor">For embezzelment of public monies. See <bibl n="Antiph. 6.35">Antiph. 6.35</bibl>.</note> and was anxious to lose no time after the impeachment in sustaining my charges in a just and proper manner before the Council and the general public. Being thus occupied myself, I arranged that the needs of the chorus should be attended to by Phanostratus, a member of the same deme as my accusers here and a relative of my own (he is my son-in-law); and I told him to perform the task with all possible care. </p>
      </div>
      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="13">
        <p>Besides Phanostratus I appointed two others. The first, Ameinias, whom I thought a trustworthy man, belonged to the Erechtheid tribe and had been officially chosen by it to recruit and supervise its choruses at the various festivals; while the second, . . ., regularly recruited the choruses of the Cecropid tribe, to which he belonged, in the same way. There was yet a fourth, Philippus, whose duty it was to purchase or spend whatever the poet or any of the other three told him. Thus I ensured that the boys should receive every attention and lack nothing owing to my own preoccupation. </p>

      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="14">
        <p>Such were my arrangements as Choregus. If I am lying as regards any of them in order to exonerate myself, my accuser is at liberty to refute me on any point he likes in his second speech. For this is how it is, gentlemen: many of the spectators here present are perfectly familiar with every one of these facts, the voice of the officer who administered the oath is in their ears, and they are giving my defence their close attention; I would like them to feel that I am respecting that oath, and that if I persuade you to acquit me, it was by telling the truth that I did so. </p>

And I am not insisting on these facts in order to incriminate someone else once I have cleared myself; no indeed—unless that someone else be Fortune; and this is not the first time, I imagine, that she has caused a man’s death. Fortune neither I nor any other could prevent from fulfilling her destined part in the life of each of us. . . .<note resp="editor">Some such phrase as <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ μοι μάρτυρας τούτων κάλει</foreign> seems to have been lost.

        <p>The facts have been confirmed by evidence as I promised, gentlemen; and you must let that evidence help you to decide which of the two sworn statements made,<note resp="editor">For the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωμοσία</foreign> cf.<bibl n="Antiph. 5.11">Antiph. 5.11</bibl>.</note> the prosecution’s or my own, reveals more respect for truth and for the oath by which it was preceded. The prosecution swore that I was responsible for the death of Diodotus as having instigated the act which led to it<note resp="editor">That <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλεύσαντα τὸν θάνατον</foreign> is not to be taken in the sense of <q rend="double" type="emph">wilfully caused his death</q> is clear from <bibl n="Antiph. 6.19">Antiph. 6.19</bibl>.</note>; whereas I swore that I did not cause his death, whether by my own act or by instigation. </p>

      <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006.perseus-eng2" n="17"><p>Further, in making their charge, the prosecution invoke the principle that the responsibility rests with whoever told the boy to drink the poison, forced him to drink it, or gave it to him to drink. By that very principle, however, I will myself prove that I am innocent: for I neither told the boy to drink the poison, nor forced him to drink it, nor gave it to him to drink. I will even go a step further than they and add that I did not witness him drink it. If the prosecution say that it was a criminal act to tell him to drink it, I am no criminal: I did not tell him to drink it. If they say that it was a criminal act to force him to drink it, I am no criminal: I did not force him to drink it. And if they say that the responsibility rests with the person who gave him the poison, I am not responsible: I did not give it to him. </p>

But that what never happened should be transformed into fact, that an innocent man should be transformed into a criminal is not, I feel, a matter which depends upon the eloquence of the prosecution; it is a question of what is right and what is true. Admittedly, with a deliberately planned murder, carried out in secret and with none to witness it, the truth can only be determined from the accounts given by the prosecutor and the defendant, and from them alone; their statements must be followed up with care and suspected on the slightest grounds and the final verdict must necessarily be the result of conjecture rather than certain knowledge. </p>

        <p>But in the present instance, the prosecution themselves admit to begin with that the boy’s death was not due to premeditation or design: and secondly, everything which happened happened publicly and before numerous witnesses, men and boys, free men and slaves, who would have ensured the complete exposure of the criminal, had there been one, and the instant refutation of anyone who accused an innocent person.<note resp="editor"><bibl n="Antiph. 6.19">Antiph. 6.19</bibl> in the Greek consists of an intricate dependent clause without a main verb to complete the grammatical construction.

At that, I presented myself before the court in my turn. I told the same jury that Philocrates had no right to place legal impediments in my way by coming to court with his outrageous charge, when I was bringing suits against Aristion and Philinus on the following day and the day after: for that was his only reason for making such allegations. </p>

Let him question the free men as befitted free men; for their own sakes and in the interests of justice, they would give a faithful account of what had occurred. As to the slaves, if he considered that they were answering his questions truthfully, well and good; if he did not, I was ready to place all my own at his disposal for examination under torture, and should he demand any that did not belong to me, I agreed to obtain the consent of their owner and hand them over to him to examine as he liked. </p>
