         <p> When a crime is planned by an ordinary person, it is not hard to expose; but to detect and expose criminals who are naturally able, who are men of experience, and who have reached an age when their faculties are at their best, is no easy matter. </p>
        </div>

          <p>The enormous risk makes them devote a great deal of thought to the problem of executing the crime in safety, and they take no steps until they have completely secured themselves against suspicion. With these facts in mind, you must place implicit confidence in any and every indication from probability<note anchored="true" resp="ed" ><foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκός, εἰκότως</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ εἰκότα</foreign> cannot properly be rendered by any single English equivalent. I have made use of <q rend="double" type="gloss">natural,</q> <q rend="double" type="gloss">logical,</q> <q rend="double" type="gloss">probable,</q> <q rend="double" type="gloss">to be expected,</q> etc., according to the requirements of the context.</note> presented to you. </p>

          <p>We, on the other hand, who are seeking satisfaction for the murder, are not letting the guilty escape and bringing the innocent into court; we know very well that as the whole city is defiled by the criminal until he is brought to justice, the sin becomes ours and the punishment for your error falls upon us, if our prosecution is misdirected. Thus, as the entire defilement falls upon us, we shall try to show you as conclusively as our knowledge allows that the defendant killed the dead man. </p>

          <p><add>Malefactors are not likely to have murdered him,</add><note anchored="true" resp="ed" >Inserted in the Aldine edition to fill a probable lacuna in the manuscript text; some reference to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοῦργοι</foreign> is clearly wanted. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοῦργος</foreign>(cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 2.4.5" >Antiph. 2.4.5-6</bibl>) is a generic one comprising various species of criminal; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέπται, τοιχωρύχοι, βαλλοντιοτόμοι</foreign>, etc. The <q rend="double" type="mentioned">malefactors</q> her referred to are doubtless <foreign xml:lang="grc">λωποδύται</foreign><q rend="double" type="gloss">footpads</q>. For a further discussion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοῦργοι</foreign> see <title>Herodes</title>, Introd.</note> as nobody who was exposing his life to a very grave risk would forgo the prize when it was securely within his grasp; and the victims were found still wearing their cloaks. Nor again did anyone in liquor kill him: the murderer’s identity would be known to his boon companions. Nor again was his death the result of a quarrel; they would not have been quarrelling at the dead of night or in a deserted spot. Nor did the criminal strike the dead man when intending to strike someone else; he would not in that case have killed master and slave together. </p>

          <p>As all grounds for suspecting that the crime was unpremeditated are removed, it is clear from the circumstances of death themselves that the victim was deliberately murdered.<note resp="editor">Here, as elsewhere in the <title>Tetralogies</title>, the Greek has to be expanded in translating in order to make the connection of thought clear. For an explanation of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς ὁ θάνατος</foreign>, <q rend="double" type="translation">circumstances of death</q> see <bibl n="Antiph. 2.2.4">Antiph. 2.2.4</bibl> note 1.</note> Now who is more likely to have attacked him than a man who had already suffered cruelly at his hands and who was expecting to suffer more cruelly still? That man is the defendant. He was an old enemy of the other, and indicted him on several serious charges without success. </p>

          <p>On the other hand, he has himself been indicted on charges still more numerous and still more grave, and not once has he been acquitted, with the result that he has lost a good deal of his property. Further, he had recently been indicted by the dead man for embezzling sacred monies,<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερῶν κλοπή</foreign> (embezzelment of sacred monies of which the person concerned was in charge) is to be distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱεροσυλία</foreign>(temple-robbery), for which see <bibl n="Antiph. 5.10">Antiph. 5.10</bibl>. The penalty for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερῶν κλοπή</foreign> was the repayment of ten times the sum embezzled (<bibl n="Dem. 24.111">Dem. 24.111-112</bibl>).</note> the sum to be recovered being assessed at two talents; he knew himself to be guilty, experience had taught him how powerful his opponent was, and he bore him a grudge for the past; so he naturally plotted his death: he naturally sought protection against his enemy by murdering him. </p>

          <p>Thirst for revenge made him forget the risk, and the overpowering fear of the ruin which threatened him spurred him to all the more reckless an attack. In taking this step he hoped not only that his guilt would remain undiscovered, but that he would also escape the indictment;<note resp="editor">Or possibly: <q rend="double" type="translation">be acquitted on the indictment.</q></note> </p>
        </div>

          <p>nobody, he thought, would proceed with the suit, and judgement would go by default; while in the event of his losing his case after all, he considered it better to have revenged himself for his defeat than, like a coward, to be ruined by the indictment without retaliating. And he knew very well that he would lose it, or he would not have thought the present trial the safer alternative. </p>
        </div>

          <p>Such are the motives which drove him to sin as he did. Had there been eyewitnesses in large numbers, we should have produced them in large numbers; but as the dead man’s attendant was alone present, those who heard his statement will give evidence; for he was still alive when picked up, and in reply to our questions stated that the only assailant whom he had recognized was the defendant. </p>
          <p>Inferences from probability and eyewitnesses have alike proved the defendant’s guilt: so both justice and expediency absolutely forbid you to acquit him. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:1" n="10">
          <p>Not only would it be impossible to convict deliberate criminals if they are not to be convicted by eyewitnesses and by such inferences; but it is against all your interests that this polluted wretch should profane the sanctity of the divine precincts by setting foot within them, or pass on his defilement to the innocent by sitting at the same tables as they.<note resp="editor">Cf. the disabilities involved in <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ εἴργεσθαι τῶν νομίμων</foreign>, <bibl n="Antiph. 6.34" >Antiph. 6.34</bibl> sqq.</note> It is this that causes dearth and public calamity. </p>

          <p>And so you must hold the avenging of the dead a personal duty; you must visit the defendant with retribution for the sin which was his alone; you must see that none but he suffers, and that the stain of guilt is removed from the city.</p>

          <p> I am not far wrong, I think, in regarding myself as the most unlucky man alive. Others meet with misfortune. They may be buffeted by a tempest; but calm weather returns and they are buffeted no longer. They may fall ill; but they recover their health and are saved. Or some other mishap may overtake them; but it is followed by its opposite which brings relief. </p>

          <p>With me this is not so. Not only did this man make havoc of my house during his lifetime; but he has caused me distress and anxiety in plenty since his death, even if I escape sentence; for so luckless is my lot that a godfearing and an honest life is not enough to save me. Unless I also find and convict the murderer, whom the dead man’s avengers cannot find, I shall myself be deemed guilty of murder and suffer an outrageous sentence of death. </p>
        </div>

          <p>Now the prosecution allege that it is very difficult to prove my guilt because of my astuteness. Yet in maintaining that my actions themselves prove me to be the criminal, they are assuming me to be a simpleton. For if the bitterness of my feud is a natural ground for your deeming me guilty today, it was still more natural for me to foresee before committing the crime that suspicion would settle upon me as it has done. I was more likely to go to the length of stopping anyone else whom I knew to be plotting the murder than deliberately to incur certain suspicion by committing it myself; for if, on the one hand, the crime in itself showed that I was the murderer,<note resp="editor">Or possibly: <q rend="double" type="translation">If on the one hand I was detected in the act of committing the crime. . . </q> The speaker is endeavoring to prove that he did not commit the murder by showing that his knowledge of the consequences to himself, even in the event of his escaping detection, must necessarily have deterred him. The sentence must therefore be regarded as explaining not the whole of that preceding, but only <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν . . . ἐμπεσεῖν</foreign>.</note> I was doomed; while if, on the other hand, I escaped detection, I knew very well that suspicion would fall on me as it has done. </p>

        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="4">
          <p>My plight is indeed hapless; I am forced not only to defend myself, but to reveal the criminals as well. Still, I must attempt this further task; nothing, it seems, is more relentless than necessity. I can expose the criminals, I may say, only by following the principle used by my accuser, who establishes the innocence of every one else and then asserts that the circumstances of death in themselves show the murderer to be me.<note resp="editor">An exceedingly difficult sentence to render clearly in English. The speaker means that he too is obliged from the nature of the case to resort to proof by elimination. The prosecution had argued (<bibl n="Antiph. 2.1.4" >Antiph. 2.1.4-5</bibl>) that death could not have been due to footpads, a drunken quarrel, or a mistaken assault, i.e. it cannot have been unpremeditated; therefore, since the circumstances showed it to have been violent, not natural (this is the point of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς ὁ θάνατος </foreign> in <bibl n="Antiph. 2.1.5" >Antiph. 2.1.5</bibl>), it was premeditated; and the defendant was alone likely to have planned such a crime. Here the defendant recapitulates this, actually quoting the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς ὁ θάνατος </foreign>, which had formed part of the argument of the prosecution.</note> If the apparent innocence of every one else is to fasten the crime upon me, it is only logical for me to be held guiltless, should others be brought under suspicion. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="5">
          <p>It is not, as the prosecution maintain, unlikely that a man wandering about at the dead of night should be murdered for his clothing; nothing is more likely. The fact that he was not stripped indicates nothing. If the approach of passers-by startled his assailants into quitting him before they had had time to strip him, they showed sense, not madness, in preferring their lives to their spoils. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="6">
          <p>Further, he may not in fact have been murdered for his clothing; he may have seen others engaged in some quite different outrage and have been killed by them to prevent his giving information of the crime; who knows? Again, were not those who hated him almost as much as I did—and there were a great many—more likely to have murdered him than I? It was plain to them that suspicion would fall on me; while I knew very well that I should bear the blame for them. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="7">
          <p>Why, moreover, should the evidence of the attendant be allowed any weight? In his terror at the peril in which he stood, there was no likelihood of his recognizing the murderers. On the other hand, it was likely enough that he would obediently confirm any suggestions made by his masters.<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγιγνώσκειν</foreign> in the sense of <q rend="double"  type="gloss">persuade,</q> which it must bear here, is found elsewhere only in Herodotus. <q rend="double" type="mentioned">Masters</q> implies that the passers-by who found the slave were members of the dead man’s own family, although this fact is nowhere explicitly mentioned by the prosecution.</note> We distrust the evidence of slaves in general, or we should not torture them; so what justification have you for putting me to death on the evidence of this one? </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="8">
          <p>Further, whoever allows probability the force of fact when it testifies to my guilt must on the same principle bear the following in mind as evidence of my innocence; it was more likely that, with an eye to carrying out my plot in safety, I should take the precaution of not being present at the scene of the crime than that the slave should recognize me distinctly just as his throat was being cut. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg002.perseus-eng2:2" n="9">
          <p>I will now show that, unless I was mad, I must have thought the danger in which I now stand far greater, instead of less, than the danger to be expected from the indictment. If I was convicted on the indictment, I knew that I should be stripped of my property; but I did not lose my life or civic rights. I should still have been alive, still left to enjoy those rights and even though I should have had to obtain a loan of money from my friends,<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανον συλλέγειν</foreign>. Cf. infra 12, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρανίζειν</foreign>. The reference in both cases is to a sum of money advanced without interest by friends who each contributed a portion. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανος</foreign> later came to have the more specialized sense of a club formed for the purpose of lending money without interest to any of its members. Each member paid a subscription (also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανος</foreign>); and such clubs often acquired landed property. They grew political in character as time went on.</note> my fate would not have been the worst possible. On the other hand, if I am found guilty today and put to death, my children will inherit from me an insufferable disgrace; if instead I go into exile, I shall become a beggar in a strange land, an old man without a country. </p>

          <p>Thus not one of the charges brought against me has any foundation. But even if the probabilities, as distinct from the facts, point to me as the murderer, it is acquittal that I deserve from you far more than anything else; since first, it is clear that if I struck back, it was only because I was being deeply wronged; had that not been so, it would never have been thought likely that I was the murderer; and secondly, it is the murderers, not those accused of the murder, whom it is your duty to convict.<note resp="editor">i.e. (1) Even if he can be proved guilty, there are extenuating circumstances which will make it impossible to condemn him. (2) But he cannot be proved guilty in any case.</note> </p>

          <p>Assume that the murderers hurried off, leaving their victims before they had stripped them, because they noticed the approach of passers-by. Then even if the persons who came upon them found the master dead, they would have found the slave still conscious, as he was picked up alive and gave evidence. They would have questioned him closely and have informed us who the criminals were; so that the defendant would not have been accused. Or assume, on the other hand, that others, who had been seen by the two committing some similar outrage, had murdered them to keep the matter dark. Then news of that outrage would have been published at the same time as the news of the present murder, and suspicion would have fallen on those concerned in it. </p>

          <p>Again, how persons whose position was not so serious should have plotted against the dead man sooner than persons who had more to fear, I fail to understand. The fears and sense of injury of the second were enough to put an end to caution; whereas with the first the risk and disgrace involved, to which their resentment could not blind them, were sufficient to sober the anger in their hearts, even if they had intended to do the deed. </p>

          <p>The defense are wrong when they say that the evidence of the slave is not to be trusted; where evidence of this sort is concerned, slaves are not tortured; they are given their freedom. It is when they deny a theft or conspire with their masters to keep silence that we believe them to tell the truth only under torture.<note resp="editor">The evidence of slaves was accepted only under torture. But the torture could not be inflicted without the consent of the owner. Hence there are instances of the purchase of slaves solely for the purpose of extorting evidence from them (see <bibl n="Antiph. 5.47">Antiph. 5.47</bibl>, <title>On the Murder of Herodes</title>, for a case in point). The last half of the present paragraph envisages a similar purchase in order to obtain evidence against the slave’s former owner. On the other hand, a slave who defended his master’s life at the risk of his own would more often than not be rewarded with his freedom; and once he was free, he could not be tortured; he gave his evidence in a court of law in the ordinary way. Thus the argument in the present passage is; the dying slave was virtually a free man, as he had given his life for his master; hence there is no ground whatever for maintaining, as the defendant is doing, that his evidence cannot be accepted in court because it was not given under torture.</note> </p>

          <p>Again, the probabilities are not in favor of his having been absent from the scene of the crime rather than present at it. In remaining absent he was going to run the same risks as he would run if present, as any of his confederates if caught would have shown that it was he who had originated the plot. And not only that; he was going to dispatch the business on hand less satisfactorily, as not one of the criminals taking part would have felt the same enthusiasm for the deed. </p>

          <p>Further, he did not believe the danger threatened by the indictment to be less serious than that in which he now stands, but much more so, as I will prove to you. Let us assume that his expectations of conviction or acquittal were the same in the one suit as in the other.<note resp="editor">i.e. that his position in both suits was completely hopeless.</note> Now he had no hope of the indictment being dropped as long as his enemy was alive; his entreaties would never have been listened to.

          <p>Again, in claiming an acquittal on the ground that he could foresee that he would be suspected, he is arguing falsely. If the defendant, whose position was desperate could be deterred from violence by the knowledge that suspicion would fall on himself, nobody at all would have planned the crime. Every one who stood in less danger than he would have been more frightened by the certainty of being suspected than by that danger, and would therefore have been less ready than he to use violence. </p>

          <p>His contributions to the Treasury and his provision of choruses may be satisfactory evidence of his wealth; but they are anything but evidence of his innocence. It was precisely his fear of losing his wealth which drove him to commit the murder; though an unscrupulous crime, it was to be expected of him. He objects that murderers are not those who were to be expected to commit murder, but those who actually did so. Now he would be quite right, provided that those who did commit it were known to us; but as they are not, proof must be based on what was to be expected; and that shows that the defendant, and the defendant alone, is the murderer. Crimes of this kind are committed in secret, not in front of witnesses. </p>
