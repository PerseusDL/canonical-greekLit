          <p> When a crime is planned by an ordinary person, it is not hard to expose; but to detect
            and expose criminals who are naturally able, who are men of experience, and who have
            reached an age when their faculties are at their best, is no easy matter. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="2" type="section">
          <p>The enormous risk makes them devote a great deal of thought to the problem of executing
            the crime in safety, and they take no steps until they have completely secured
            themselves against suspicion. With these facts in mind, you must place implicit
            confidence in any and every indication from probability<note anchored="true" resp="ed"

              English equivalent. I have made use of “natural,” “logical,” “probable,” “to be
              expected,” etc., according to the requirements of the context.</note> presented to
            you. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="3" type="section">
          <p>We, on the other hand, who are seeking satisfaction for the murder, are not letting the
            guilty escape and bringing the innocent into court; we know very well that as the whole
            city is defiled by the criminal until he is brought to justice, the sin becomes ours and
            the punishment for your error falls upon us, if our prosecution is misdirected. Thus, as
            the entire defilement falls upon us, we shall try to show you as conclusively as our
            knowledge allows that the defendant killed the dead man. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="4" type="section">
          <p><add>Malefactors are not likely to have murdered him,</add><note anchored="true" resp="ed"
              >Inserted in the Aldine edition to fill a probable lacuna in the manuscript text; some
              reference to <foreign xml:lang="greek">KAKOU=RGOI</foreign> is clearly wanted. The
              term <foreign xml:lang="greek">KAKOU=RGOS</foreign>(cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 2.4.5"
                >Antiph. 2.4.5-6</bibl>) is a generic one comprising various species of criminal;

              “ malefactors” her referred to are doubtless <foreign xml:lang="greek"

                xml:lang="greek">KAKOU=RGOI</foreign> see <title>Herodes</title>, Introd.</note> as
            nobody who was exposing his life to a very grave risk would forgo the prize when it was
            securely within his grasp; and the victims were found still wearing their cloaks. Nor
            again did anyone in liquor kill him: the murderer's identity would be known to his boon
            companions. Nor again was his death the result of a quarrel; they would not have been
            quarrelling at the dead of night or in a deserted spot. Nor did the criminal strike the
            dead man when intending to strike someone else; he would not in that case have killed
            master and slave together. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="5" type="section">
          <p>As all grounds for suspecting that the crime was unpremeditated are removed, it is
            clear from the circumstances of death themselves that the victim was deliberately
              murdered.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Here, as elsewhere in the
                <title>Tetralogies</title>, the Greek has to be expanded in translating in order to
              make the connection of thought clear. For an explanation of the words <foreign
                xml:lang="greek">AU)TO\S O( QA/NATOS</foreign>, “circumstances of death” see <bibl
                n="Antiph. 2.2.4">Antiph. 2.2.4</bibl> note 1.</note> Now who is more likely to have
            attacked him than a man who had already suffered cruelly at his hands and who was
            expecting to suffer more cruelly still? That man is the defendant. He was an old enemy
            of the other, and indicted him on several serious charges without success. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="6" type="section">
          <p>On the other hand, he has himself been indicted on charges still more numerous and
            still more grave, and not once has he been acquitted, with the result that he has lost a
            good deal of his property. Further, he had recently been indicted by the dead man for
            embezzling sacred monies,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><foreign xml:lang="greek"
                >I(ERW=N KLOPH/</foreign> (embezzelment of sacred monies of which the person
              concerned was in charge) is to be distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                >I(EROSULI/A</foreign>(temple-robbery), for which see <bibl n="Antiph. 5.10">Antiph.
                5.10</bibl>. The penalty for <foreign xml:lang="greek">I(ERW=N KLOPH/</foreign> was
              the repayment of ten times the sum embezzled (<bibl n="Dem. 24.111">Dem.
                24.111-112</bibl>).</note> the sum to be recovered being assessed at two talents; he
            knew himself to be guilty, experience had taught him how powerful his opponent was, and
            he bore him a grudge for the past; so he naturally plotted his death: he naturally
            sought protection against his enemy by murdering him. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="7" type="section">
          <p>Thirst for revenge made him forget the risk, and the overpowering fear of the ruin
            which threatened him spurred him to all the more reckless an attack. In taking this step
            he hoped not only that his guilt would remain undiscovered, but that he would also
            escape the indictment;<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Or possibly: “be acquitted on the
              indictment.”</note>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div n="8" type="section">
          <p>nobody, he thought, would proceed with the suit, and judgement would go by default;
            while in the event of his losing his case after all, he considered it better to have
            revenged himself for his defeat than, like a coward, to be ruined by the indictment
            without retaliating. And he knew very well that he would lose it, or he would not have
            thought the present trial the safer alternative. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="9" type="section">
          <p>Such are the motives which drove him to sin as he did. Had there been eyewitnesses in
            large numbers, we should have produced them in large numbers; but as the dead man's
            attendant was alone present, those who heard his statement will give evidence; for he
            was still alive when picked up, and in reply to our questions stated that the only
            assailant whom he had recognized was the defendant. </p>
          <p>Inferences from probability and eyewitnesses have alike proved the defendant's guilt:
            so both justice and expediency absolutely forbid you to acquit him. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="10" type="section">
          <p>Not only would it be impossible to convict deliberate criminals if they are not to be
            convicted by eyewitnesses and by such inferences; but it is against all your interests
            that this polluted wretch should profane the sanctity of the divine precincts by setting
            foot within them, or pass on his defilement to the innocent by sitting at the same
            tables as they.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Cf. the disabilities involved in <foreign
                xml:lang="greek">TO\ EI)/RGESQAI TW=N NOMI/MWN</foreign>, <bibl n="Antiph. 6.34"
                >Antiph. 6.34</bibl> sqq.</note> It is this that causes dearth and public calamity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div n="11" type="section">
          <p>And so you must hold the avenging of the dead a personal duty; you must visit the
            defendant with retribution for the sin which was his alone; you must see that none but
            he suffers, and that the stain of guilt is removed from the city.</p>
        </div>

      <div type="tetralogy" n="2">
        <head>Reply to the Same Charge</head>
        <div n="1" type="section">
          <p> I am not far wrong, I think, in regarding myself as the most unlucky man alive. Others
            meet with misfortune. They may be buffeted by a tempest; but calm weather returns and
            they are buffeted no longer. They may fall ill; but they recover their health and are
            saved. Or some other mishap may overtake them; but it is followed by its opposite which
            brings relief. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="2" type="section">
          <p>With me this is not so. Not only did this man make havoc of my house during his
            lifetime; but he has caused me distress and anxiety in plenty since his death, even if I
            escape sentence; for so luckless is my lot that a godfearing and an honest life is not
            enough to save me. Unless I also find and convict the murderer, whom the dead man's
            avengers cannot find, I shall myself be deemed guilty of murder and suffer an outrageous
            sentence of death. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="3" type="section">
          <p>Now the prosecution allege that it is very difficult to prove my guilt because of my
            astuteness. Yet in maintaining that my actions themselves prove me to be the criminal,
            they are assuming me to be a simpleton. For if the bitterness of my feud is a natural
            ground for your deeming me guilty today, it was still more natural for me to foresee
            before committing the crime that suspicion would settle upon me as it has done. I was
            more likely to go to the length of stopping anyone else whom I knew to be plotting the
            murder than deliberately to incur certain suspicion by committing it myself; for if, on
            the one hand, the crime in itself showed that I was the murderer,<note anchored="true"
              resp="ed">Or possibly: “If on the one hand I was detected in the act of committing the
              crime. . . ” The speaker is endeavoring to prove that he did not commit the murder by
              showing that his knowledge of the consequences to himself, even in the event of his
              escaping detection, must necessarily have deterred him. The sentence must therefore be
              regarded as explaining not the whole of that preceding, but only <foreign
                xml:lang="greek">AU)TO\N . . . E)MPESEI=N</foreign>.</note> I was doomed; while if,
            on the other hand, I escaped detection, I knew very well that suspicion would fall on me
            as it has done. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="4" type="section">
          <p>My plight is indeed hapless; I am forced not only to defend myself, but to reveal the
            criminals as well. Still, I must attempt this further task; nothing, it seems, is more
            relentless than necessity. I can expose the criminals, I may say, only by following the
            principle used by my accuser, who establishes the innocence of every one else and then
            asserts that the circumstances of death in themselves show the murderer to be me.<note
              anchored="true" resp="ed">An exceedingly difficult sentence to render clearly in
              English. The speaker means that he too is obliged from the nature of the case to
              resort to proof by elimination. The prosecution had argued (<bibl n="Antiph. 2.1.4"
                >Antiph. 2.1.4-5</bibl>) that death could not have been due to footpads, a drunken
              quarrel, or a mistaken assault, i.e. it cannot have been unpremeditated; therefore,
              since the circumstances showed it to have been violent, not natural (this is the point
              of <foreign xml:lang="greek">AU)TO\S O( QA/NATOS</foreign> in <bibl n="Antiph. 2.1.5"
                >Antiph. 2.1.5</bibl>), it was premeditated; and the defendant was alone likely to
              have planned such a crime. Here the defendant recapitulates this, actually quoting the
              words <foreign xml:lang="greek">AU)TO\S O( QA/NATOS</foreign>, which had formed part
              of the argument of the prosecution.</note> If the apparent innocence of every one else
            is to fasten the crime upon me, it is only logical for me to be held guiltless, should
            others be brought under suspicion. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="5" type="section">
          <p>It is not, as the prosecution maintain, unlikely that a man wandering about at the dead
            of night should be murdered for his clothing; nothing is more likely. The fact that he
            was not stripped indicates nothing. If the approach of passers-by startled his
            assailants into quitting him before they had had time to strip him, they showed sense,
            not madness, in preferring their lives to their spoils. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="6" type="section">
          <p>Further, he may not in fact have been murdered for his clothing; he may have seen
            others engaged in some quite different outrage and have been killed by them to prevent
            his giving information of the crime; who knows? Again, were not those who hated him
            almost as much as I did—and there were a great many—more likely to have murdered him
            than I? It was plain to them that suspicion would fall on me; while I knew very well
            that I should bear the blame for them. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="7" type="section">
          <p>Why, moreover, should the evidence of the attendant be allowed any weight? In his
            terror at the peril in which he stood, there was no likelihood of his recognizing the
            murderers. On the other hand, it was likely enough that he would obediently confirm any
            suggestions made by his masters.<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><foreign
                xml:lang="greek">A)NAGIGNW/SKEIN</foreign> in the sense of “persuade,” which it must
              bear here, is found elsewhere only in Herodotus. “Masters” implies that the passers-by
              who found the slave were members of the dead man's own family, although this fact is
              nowhere explicitly mentioned by the prosecution.</note> We distrust the evidence of
            slaves in general, or we should not torture them; so what justification have you for
            putting me to death on the evidence of this one? </p>
        </div>
        <div n="8" type="section">
          <p>Further, whoever allows probability the force of fact when it testifies to my guilt
            must on the same principle bear the following in mind as evidence of my innocence; it
            was more likely that, with an eye to carrying out my plot in safety, I should take the
            precaution of not being present at the scene of the crime than that the slave should
            recognize me distinctly just as his throat was being cut. </p>

            exposing himself to danger. We proved in our first speech that he is the murderer; we

        </div>
        <div n="2" type="section">
          <p>Assume that the murderers hurried off, leaving their victims before they had stripped
            them, because they noticed the approach of passers-by. Then even if the persons who came
            upon them found the master dead, they would have found the slave still conscious, as he
            was picked up alive and gave evidence. They would have questioned him closely and have
            informed us who the criminals were; so that the defendant would not have been accused.
            Or assume, on the other hand, that others, who had been seen by the two committing some
            similar outrage, had murdered them to keep the matter dark. Then news of that outrage
            would have been published at the same time as the news of the present murder, and
            suspicion would have fallen on those concerned in it. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="3" type="section">
          <p>Again, how persons whose position was not so serious should have plotted against the
            dead man sooner than persons who had more to fear, I fail to understand. The fears and
            sense of injury of the second were enough to put an end to caution; whereas with the
            first the risk and disgrace involved, to which their resentment could not blind them,
            were sufficient to sober the anger in their hearts, even if they had intended to do the
            deed. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="4" type="section">
          <p>The defense are wrong when they say that the evidence of the slave is not to be
            trusted; where evidence of this sort is concerned, slaves are not tortured; they are
            given their freedom. It is when they deny a theft or conspire with their masters to keep
            silence that we believe them to tell the truth only under torture.<note anchored="true"
              resp="ed">The evidence of slaves was accepted only under torture. But the torture
              could not be inflicted without the consent of the owner. Hence there are instances of
              the purchase of slaves solely for the purpose of extorting evidence from them (see
                <bibl n="Antiph. 5.47">Antiph. 5.47</bibl>, <title>On the Murder of Herodes</title>,
              for a case in point). The last half of the present paragraph envisages a similar
              purchase in order to obtain evidence against the slave's former owner. On the other
              hand, a slave who defended his master's life at the risk of his own would more often
              than not be rewarded with his freedom; and once he was free, he could not be tortured;
              he gave his evidence in a court of law in the ordinary way. Thus the argument in the
              present passage is; the dying slave was virtually a free man, as he had given his life
              for his master; hence there is no ground whatever for maintaining, as the defendant is
              doing, that his evidence cannot be accepted in court because it was not given under
              torture.</note>

        <div n="5" type="section">
          <p>Again, the probabilities are not in favor of his having been absent from the scene of
            the crime rather than present at it. In remaining absent he was going to run the same
            risks as he would run if present, as any of his confederates if caught would have shown
            that it was he who had originated the plot. And not only that; he was going to dispatch
            the business on hand less satisfactorily, as not one of the criminals taking part would
            have felt the same enthusiasm for the deed. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="6" type="section">
          <p>Further, he did not believe the danger threatened by the indictment to be less serious
            than that in which he now stands, but much more so, as I will prove to you. Let us
            assume that his expectations of conviction or acquittal were the same in the one suit as
            in the other.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">i.e. that his position in both suits was
              completely hopeless.</note> Now he had no hope of the indictment being dropped as long
            as his enemy was alive; his entreaties would never have been listened to. But he did
            not, on the other hand, expect to be involved in the present trial, as he thought that
            he could commit the murder without being found out. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="7" type="section">
          <p>Again, in claiming an acquittal on the ground that he could foresee that he would be
            suspected, he is arguing falsely. If the defendant, whose position was desperate could
            be deterred from violence by the knowledge that suspicion would fall on himself, nobody
            at all would have planned the crime. Every one who stood in less danger than he would
            have been more frightened by the certainty of being suspected than by that danger, and
            would therefore have been less ready than he to use violence. </p>

          <p>His contributions to the Treasury and his provision of choruses may be satisfactory
            evidence of his wealth; but they are anything but evidence of his innocence. It was
            precisely his fear of losing his wealth which drove him to commit the murder; though an
            unscrupulous crime, it was to be expected of him. He objects that murderers are not
            those who were to be expected to commit murder, but those who actually did so. Now he
            would be quite right, provided that those who did commit it were known to us; but as
            they are not, proof must be based on what was to be expected; and that shows that the
            defendant, and the defendant alone, is the murderer. Crimes of this kind are committed

          <p>As regards my wealth, my fears for which are said to have furnished a natural motive

            arbitrary methods, as they expect changes to cause a change in their own sorry plight.
            It pays the fortunate to safeguard their prosperity by living peaceably, as change turns

          <p>Again, although the prosecution pretend to base their proof of my guilt on inferences
            from probability, they assert not that I am the probable, but that I am the actual
            murderer. Moreover, those inferences<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The <foreign

                GA\R</foreign>, which explains away the one fact which might have been unfavorable
              to the defense. The connection of thought is; “The inferences are all in my favor;
              and, after all, it is only inferences that we have to consider in this case. There can
              be no question of evidence of fact, as the one possible witness has been proved

            be in my favor rather than theirs—for not only has the witness for the prosecution been
            proved untrustworthy, but he cannot be cross-examined. Similarly, I have shown that the
              presumptions<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><foreign xml:lang="greek"
                >TEKMH/RIA</foreign> are here distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            guilt has been proved to lead not to me, but to those whom the prosecution are treating
            as innocent. Thus the charges made against me have been shown without exception to be
            unfounded. But it does not follow that there is no way of convicting criminals, if I am
            acquitted; it does follow that there is no way of effectively defending persons accused,
            if I am sentenced. </p>

          <p>You see how unjustifiably my accusers are attacking me. Yet notwithstanding the fact
            that it is they who are endeavoring to have me put to death in so impious a fashion,
            they maintain that they themselves are guiltless; according to them, it is I who am
            acting impiously—I, who am urging you to show yourselves godfearing men. But as I am
            innocent of all their charges, I adjure you on my own behalf to respect the
            righteousness of the guiltless, just as on the dead man's behalf I remind you of his
            right to vengeance and urge you not to let the guilty escape by punishing the innocent;
            once I am put to death, no one will continue the search for the criminal. </p>
