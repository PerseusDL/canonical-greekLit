<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="1"> 
  <p> I could have wished, gentlemen, that my powers of speech and my experience of the world<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πραγμάτων</foreign> refers especially to the workings of the law, and is picked up by <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗ μὲν γάρ με ἔδει . . . ἐμπειρία</foreign>. The speaker means that had he been less ignorant in such matters, he might have effectively protested against the employment of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδειξις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγωγή</foreign> which involved the close confinement of the defendant before his trial, instead of the more regular <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη φόνου</foreign> before the Areopagus. See Introduction.</note> were as great as the misfortune and the severities with which I have been visited. Instead, I know more of the last two than I should, and am more wanting in the first than is good for me. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="2"> 
<p>When I had to submit to the bodily suffering which this unwarranted charge brought with it, experience afforded me no help; while now that my life depends upon my giving a truthful account of the facts, my case is being prejudiced by my inability to speak. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="3"> 
<p>Poor speakers have often before now been disbelieved because they spoke the truth, and the truth itself has been their undoing because they could not make it convincing: just as clever speakers have often gained credit with lies, and have owed their lives to the very fact that they lied. Thus the fate of one who is not a practised pleader inevitably depends less upon the true facts and his actual conduct than upon the version of them given by his accusers. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="4"> 
<p>I shall therefore ask you, gentlemen, not indeed for a hearing, as do the majority of those on trial, who lack confidence in themselves and presume you to be biassed; for with an honest jury the defence is naturally assured of a hearing even without appealing for it, seeing that that same jury accorded the prosecution a hearing unasked— </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="5"> 
<p>no, my request of you is this. If, on the one hand, I make any mistake in speaking, pardon me and treat it as due to inexperience rather than dishonesty; and if, on the other hand, I express a point well, treat it as due to truthfulness rather than skill. For it is no more right that mere words should be the undoing of a man who is in fact innocent than that they should be the salvation of a man who is in fact guilty; the tongue is to blame for a word whereas the will is to blame for an act. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="6"> 
<p>Moreover, a man in personal danger is sure to make some mistake; he cannot help thinking of his fate as well as of his argument, as the decision of an issue which is still in doubt always depends more upon chance than upon human effort. Hence a man in danger is bound to be not a little distraught. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="7"> 
<p>Even speakers with a long experience of the courts are far from being at their best, I notice, when in any danger; they are more successful when conducting a case in safety. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="8"> 
<p>So much for my request, gentlemen; it breaks no law, human or divine: and it takes into account what you have a right to expect from me as much as what I have a right to expect from you. And now for the charges made, which I will answer one at a time. To begin with, I shall prove to you that the methods used to involve me in today’s proceedings were entirely illegal and arbitrary. Not that I wish to evade trial before a popular court; as far as my belief in my innocence of the present charge and in the justice of your verdict is concerned, I would place my life in your hands even if you were not on oath and I were being tried under no particular law. No, my object is to let the arbitrary and illegal behavior of the prosecution furnish you with a presumption as to the character of the rest of their case against me.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="9"> 
  <p>First,<note resp="editor">For the meaning of this and the following paragraph see Introduction.</note> whereas an information has been lodged against me as a malefactor, I am being tried for murder: a thing which has never before happened to anyone in this country.<note resp="editor">A deliberate ambiguity. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ</foreign> can mean (a) Athenian citizens, (b) persons who happen to be in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. Taken in sense (a) the statement is true. Taken in sense (b) it is probably false.</note> Indeed, the prosecution have themselves borne witness to the fact that I am not a malefactor and cannot be charged under the law directed against malefactors, as that law is concerned with thieves and footpads, and they have omitted to prove my claim to either title. Thus, as far as this arrest of mine goes, they have given you every right and justification to acquit me. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="10"> 
  <p>They object, however, that murder is a malefaction, and a grave one. I agree, a very grave one; so is sacrilege; so is treason; but the laws which apply to each of them differ. In my case the prosecution have first of all caused the trial to be held in the one place from which those charged with murder are always debarred by proclamation, the Agora: and secondly, although it is laid down by law that a murderer shall pay with his life, they have entered a claim for damages<note resp="editor">For an explanation of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίμησιν ποιεῖν</foreign> see Introduction pp. 155-156.</note>—not as a kindness to me, but for their own benefit—and by so doing they have grudged the dead man his lawful due. Their motives you will learn in the course of my speech.<note resp="editor">A promise which is never adequately fulfilled. The only further reference to the subject is in <bibl n="Antiph. 5.79">Antiph. 5.79</bibl> ad fin.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="11"> 
  <p>Secondly, as of course you all know, every court judges cases of murder in the open air, and for good reasons: first, that the jurors may avoid entering the same building as those whose hands are unclean: and secondly, that he who is conducting the prosecution for murder may avoid being under the same roof as the murderer. No one but yourself has ever dreamed of evading this law. And not only that you should, as a preliminary, have taken the most solemn and binding oath known,<note resp="editor">The <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωμοσία</foreign>, or preliminary oath, taken by the prosecutor, the defendant, and the witnesses of each, was peculiar to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη φόνου</foreign>; the equivalent elsewhere was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντωμοσία</foreign> taken by both plaintiff and defendant at the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</foreign> before the Archon. From this witnesses were exempt.</note> swearing, under pain of causing yourself, your kin, and your house to perish from the earth, that you would accuse me only in connection with the murder itself, to the effect that I committed it; whereby, however numerous my crimes, I could have been condemned only on the charge before the court, and however numerous my good deeds, none of those good deeds could have gained me an acquittal. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="12"> 
<p>This requirement you have evaded. You have invented laws to suit yourself. You, the prosecutor, are not on oath; nor are the witnesses, who are giving evidence against me which they should have given only after taking the same preliminary oath as yourself, their hands on the sacrifice as they did so. You bid the court, moreover, believe your witnesses, in spite of their not being on oath, and pass sentence for murder—when your own evasion of the laws of the land has destroyed the trustworthiness of those witnesses. Yes, you imagine that, in the eyes of the court, the laws themselves should have less authority than your own actions in defiance of them. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="13"> 
  <p>You reply that if I had been allowed my freedom, I should have made off without awaiting my trial—as though you had forced me to enter this country against my will. Yet if I attached no importance to being debarred from <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> for the future, it was equally open to me either to disregard the summons to appear in court and so lose the case by default, or to avail myself of the right given to every one of leaving the country after making the first speech for the defense.<note resp="editor">i.e., the prosecution justify their choice of an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγωγή</foreign> rather than a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη φόνου</foreign> by claiming that only thus could the defendant be prevented from slipping through their fingers. The defendant objects to this on two grounds: (a) The prosecution have no reason to assume that they would not have faced a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη φόνου</foreign> if left at liberty. In fact, he cut himself off from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by so defaulting, and that was a strong deterrent. (b) In any case, it was recognized that the defendant in a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη φόνου</foreign> had the right of withdrawing into exile either before or during the trial. The speaker is of course careful not to remind the court that he is an alien, whose position is not necessarily the same as that of an Athenian citizen charged with murder.</note> You, however, for purely personal reasons, are trying to rob me, and me alone, of a privilege accorded to every Greek, by framing a law to suit yourself. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="14"> 
<p>Yet it would be unanimously agreed, I think, that the laws which deal with cases such as the present are the most admirable and righteous of all laws. Not only have they the distinction of being the oldest in this country, but they have changed no more than the crime with which they are concerned; and that is the surest token of good laws, as time and experience show mankind what is imperfect. Hence you must not use the speech for the prosecution to discover whether your laws are good or bad: you must use the laws to discover whether or not the speech for the prosecution is giving you a correct and lawful interpretation of the case.<note resp="editor">This paragraph reappears in <bibl n="Antiph. 6.2">Antiph. 6.2</bibl> (cf. 87-89 and <bibl n="Antiph. 6.3">Antiph. 6.3-4</bibl>). The employment of such loci communes was frequent, and there is no reason to suspect the genuineness of the present passage.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="15"> 
<p>The laws concerned with the taking of life are thus excellent, and no one has ever before ventured to interfere with them. You alone have had the audacity to turn legislator and substitute worse for better; and the object of this arbitrary behavior of yours is to have me put to death without just cause. In fact, your infringement of the law is itself decisive evidence in my favor, because you well knew that you would find no one to testify to my guilt once he had taken that preliminary oath. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="16"> 
<p>Furthermore, instead of acting like a man confident of his case and arranging that it should be tried once and indisputably, you have left yourself grounds for dispute and argument, as though you proposed to show your distrust of even the present court. The result is that even if I am acquitted today, I am no better off; you can say that it was as a malefactor that I was acquitted, not on a charge of murder. On the other hand, if you win your case, you will claim my life, on the ground that it is on a charge of murder that I have been tried and found guilty. Could any thing more unfair be devised? You and your associates have only to convince this court once, and your object is gained; whereas I, if I am acquitted once, am left in the same peril as before. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="17"> 
  <p>Then again, gentlemen, my imprisonment was an act of illegality quite without parallel. I was ready to furnish the three sureties required by law; yet the prosecution took steps to ensure that I should be prevented from doing so. Hitherto no alien willing to furnish sureties has ever been imprisoned; and, moreover, the law concerned applies to the custodians of malefactors<note resp="editor">i.e., the Eleven, who were the magistrates concerned in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδειξις</foreign> of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοῦργος</foreign> and who were responsible for his safe custody pending trial.</note> as it does to others. Here again, then, we have a law by which every one benefits: and it has failed to release me, and me alone, from confinement. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="18"> 
<p>The reason was that it was to the prosecution’s advantage, first, that I should be prevented from looking after my interests in person, and so be quite unable to prepare for my trial: and secondly, that I should undergo bodily suffering, and by reason of that bodily suffering find my friends readier to tell lies as witnesses for the prosecution than the truth as witnesses for the defence.<note resp="editor">Apparently on the assumption that the rats will leave a sinking ship.</note> In addition to which, lifelong disgrace has been brought upon me and mine. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="19"> 
  <p>Such are the manifold respects in which I have had to submit to a loss<note resp="editor">From the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλος σωθεὶς</foreign> of the inferior Mss. the writer of a (late) Argument, which is found prefixed to the speech in A and N, made the curious deduction that the speaker’s name was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἕλος</foreign>.</note> of the rights accorded me by your laws and by justice before appearing in court. However, in spite of that disadvantage, I will try to prove my innocence: although it is hard to refute at a moment’s notice false charges so carefully framed, as one cannot prepare oneself against the unexpected. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="20"> 
<p>I sailed from <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName>, gentlemen, as a passenger on the same boat as this Herodes whom, we are told, I murdered. We were bound for <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName>, I to visit my father, who happened to be there just then, and Herodes to release some slaves<note anchored="true" resp="ed" >Probably prisoners of war who were being ransomed by their relatives. It is surprising that no attempt is made to throw suspicion on one of these Thracians, as a motive would have been easy to find.</note> to certain Thracians. The slaves whom he was to release were also passengers, as were the Thracians who were to purchase their freedom. I will produce witnesses to satisfy you of this.  </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="21"> 
  <p rend="align(center)"> <label>Witnesses</label></p>
<p>Such were our respective reasons for making the voyage. In the course of it, we happened to meet with a storm which forced us to put in at a place within the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Methymna">Methymna</placeName>, where the boat on to which Herodes transhipped, and on which the prosecution maintain that he met his end, lay at anchor. Now consider these circumstances in themselves to begin with; they were due to chance, not to any design on my part. It has nowhere been shown that I persuaded Herodes to accompany me; on the contrary, it has been shown that I made the voyage independently on business of my own. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="22"> 
<p>Nor again, as is clear, was I making my voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7007528" >Aenus</placeName> without good reason. Nor did we put in at this particular spot by prearrangement of any sort; we were forced to do so. And the transhipment after coming to anchor was similarly forced upon us, and not part of any plot or ruse. The boat on which we were passengers had no deck, whereas that on to which we transhipped had one and the rain was the reason for the exchange. I will produce witnesses to satisfy you of this.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="23"> 
<p rend="align(center)"><label>Witnesses</label></p>
<p>After crossing into the other boat, we fell to drinking. Now whereas it is established that Herodes quitted the boat and did not board it again, I did not leave the boat at all that night. Next day, when Herodes was missing, I joined in the search as anxiously as any; if anyone considered the matter serious, I did. Not only was I responsible for the dispatch of a messenger to <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName>, that is to say, it was upon my suggestion that it was decided to send one, </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="24"> 
<p>but when none of the passengers or the personal companions of Herodes volunteered to go, I offered to send my own attendant; and I hardly imagine that I was deliberately proposing to send someone who would inform against me. Finally, when the search had failed to reveal any trace of Herodes either at <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> or anywhere else and, with the return of fair sailing-weather, the rest of the boats began standing out to sea, I likewise took my departure. I will produce witnesses to prove these statements to you.</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="25"> 
  <p rend="align(center)"><label>Witnesses</label></p> 
 <p>Those are the facts; now draw the logical conclusions. First, in the interval before I put to sea for <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName>, when Herodes was missing, not a soul accused me, although the prosecution had already heard the news; otherwise I should never have taken my departure. For the moment the true facts of the matter were too much for any charge which they could bring; and, moreover, I was still on the island. It was not until I had resumed my voyage, and the prosecution had conspired to form this plot of theirs upon my life, that they made their accusation. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="26"> 
<p>Their story is that it was on the shore that Herodes was killed, and that I, who did not leave the boat at all, struck him upon the head with a stone. Yet while they have detailed information of this, they cannot give any plausible account of how the man came to disappear. Clearly, the probabilities suggest that the crime was committed somewhere in the neighborhood of the harbor. On the one hand, Herodes was drunk; and on the other hand, it was at night that he left the boat. He probably would not have been in a condition to control his own movements, nor could anyone who wished to take him a long way off by night have found any plausible excuse for doing so. </p> </div>

<p>Yet in spite of a two days’ search both in the harbor and at a distance from it, no eyewitness, no bloodstain, and no clue of any other description was found. But I will go further.

For that matter, we should also have expected to find some traces in the boat, seeing that a dead man had been placed in it and thrown overboard in the dark. The prosecution claim, indeed, to have found traces—but only in the boat on board of which he was drinking and which he quitted, the one boat on which they themselves agree that he was not murdered. The boat from which he was thrown into the sea they have not discovered; they have found neither it itself nor any trace of it.

Similarly with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἀνθρώπους</foreign>(infr); they had been referred to in the speech for the presecution.</note> they claimed that this was where Herodes had met his end. But the suggestion proved an unfortunate one, as the blood turned out to be that of the animals sacrificed. So they abandoned that line, and instead seized the two men and examined them under torture.<note resp="editor">The references in the course of the speech to the two witnesses for the prosecution are confusing. The relevant passages are 29, 42, 49, and 52. From 49 it is clear that one was a slave and the other a free man, although he cannot have been a Greek, as he was subjected to torture by the prosecution (ibid). 29 suggests that the two were members of the crew of the homeward bound vessel on which Euxitheus and Herodes sheltered form the rain, and that after the storm they continued their voyage to <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName>, where the relatives of Herodes immediately came aboard and took them into custody. This is supported by 52, which implies that Euxitheus parted from the men after the storm, he proceeding the <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName>, and they to <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene" >Mytilene</placeName>. 42, however, offers a difficulty. Euxitheus there says with reference to the free man: <q rend="double" type="spoken">he sailed in the same boat as myself, and was present and in my company throughout,</q> a statement which on the face of it should mean that he travelled with Euxitheus from <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName>. There seems to be only one explanation of the inconsistency. Euxitheus must have been intentionally misrepresenting the facts in 42, as it was important to show that the favorable evidence of this witness was based upon a personal acquaintance with his movements and general behavior. If so, it seems not unlikely that the man was actually in the pay of Euxitheus. Can he have been the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκόλουθος</foreign> of 24, sent back to <placeName key="perseus,Mytilene">Mytilene</placeName> by E. and there detained by the family of Herodes?</note> </p> </div>

  <p>You have listened to evidence for the length of the delay before the man’s examination under torture; now notice the actual character of that examination. The slave was doubtless promised his freedom: it was certainly to the prosecution alone that he could look for release from his sufferings. Probably both of these considerations induced him to make the false charges against me which he did; he hoped to gain his freedom, and his one immediate wish was to end the torture. </p> </div>

It is their one chance of salvation, especially when the victims of their lies happen not to be present. Had I myself proceeded to give orders that the slave should be racked for not telling the truth, that step in itself would doubtless have been enough to make him stop incriminating me falsely.

  <p>In my opinion, they should have produced the informer himself in court, if they wished to prove me guilty. That was the issue to which they should have brought the case. Instead of putting the man to death, they ought to have produced him in the flesh and challenged me to examine him under torture. As it is, which of his statements will they use, may I ask: his first or his second? And which is true: the statement that I committed the murder or the statement that I did not? </p> </div>

<p>If we are to judge from probability, it is obviously the second which is the truer; he was lying to benefit himself, but on finding that those lies were proving fatal, he thought that he would be saved by telling the truth. However, he had no one to stand up for the truth, as I, who was vindicated by his second, true statement, was unfortunately not present; while there were those who were ready to put his first, his false one, beyond all reach of future correction.

    <p>So we are to understand that Lycinus left Herodes in peace as far as an action at law was concerned, and instead chose the one course which was bound to endanger both himself and me, that of plotting his death, notwithstanding the fact that, if discovered, he would have deprived me of my country and himself of his rights before heaven and mankind, and of all that men hold most sacred and most precious. I will go further: I will adopt the standpoint of the prosecution: I will admit as readily as you like that Lycinus did desire the death of Herodes. Does it follow that I should ever have been induced to perform in his stead a deed which he refused to commit with his own hand? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg005.perseus-eng2" n="63"> 
<p>Was I, for instance, in a position to risk my life, and he in a position to hire me to do so? No, I had money, and he had none. On the contrary, the probabilities show that he would have been induced to commit the crime by me sooner than I by him; for even after suffering an execution for a debt of seven minae, he could not release himself from prison: his friends had to purchase his release. In fact, this affords the clearest indication of the relations between Lycinus and myself; it shows that my friendship with him was hardly close enough to make me willing to satisfy his every wish. I cannot suppose that I braved the enormous risk which murder involved to oblige him, after refusing to pay off seven minae for him when he was suffering the hardships of imprisonment. </p> </div>

<p>I have proved, then, to the best of my ability that both Lycinus and I are innocent. However, the prosecution make endless play with the argument that Herodes has disappeared; and doubtless it is a fact which you want explained. Now if it is conjecture which is expected of me, you are just as capable of it as I am—we are both alike innocent of the crime; on the other hand, if it is the truth, the prosecution must ask one of the criminals: he would best be able to satisfy them. </p> </div>

<p>The utmost that I who am not guilty can reply is that I am not guilty; whereas the criminal can easily reveal the facts, or at least make a good guess. Criminals no sooner commit a crime than they invent an explanation to suit it<note anchored="true" resp="ed" >i.e., a culprit is the first to suggest that someone else is to blame.</note>; on the other hand, an innocent man can scarcely guess the answer to what is a mystery to him. Each of you yourselves, I am sure, if asked something which he did not happen to know, would simply reply to that effect; and if told to say more, you would find yourselves, I think, in a serious difficulty. </p> </div>

<p>So do not present me with a difficulty which you yourselves would not find easy of solution. Furthermore, do not make my acquittal depend on my making plausible conjectures.

<p>For instance, the murderers of one of your own citizens, Ephialtes,<note resp="editor">The murder had been committed some forty-five years before (first half of 461). Ephialtes was an extreme radical, and in conjunction with Pericles was responsible for the violent attack made upon the prerogatives of the Areopagus in 462. His assassination was the result. Aristotle states that the crime was committed by Aristodicus of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, employed for the purpose by Ephialtes’ enemies. This may well be true, as it suited Antiphon’s requirements here to assume that the mystery had never been satisfactorily solved. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Ath.

Per. 10</bibl>.</note> have remained undiscovered to this day; it would have been unfair to his companions to require them to conjecture who his assassins were under pain of being held guilty of the murder themselves. Moreover, the murderers of Ephialtes made no attempt to get rid of the body, for fear of the accompanying risk of publicity—unlike myself, who, we are told, took no one into my confidence when planning the crime, but then sought help for the removal of the corpse. </p> </div>

A. Fraenkel and Wilamowitz suppose a considerable lacuna which contained the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς δ’ ἐς πόλιν συμμαχίδα διοκιζομένους</foreign>, or the like.

<p>Indeed, supposing that you were bound to make some mistake, it would be less of an outrage to acquit me unfairly than to put me to death without just cause; for the one thing is a mistake and nothing more: the other is a sin in addition. You must exercise the greatest caution in what you do, because you will not be able to reconsider your action. In a matter which admits of reconsideration a mistake, whether made through giving rein to the feelings or through accepting a distorted account of the facts, is not so serious; it is still possible to change one’s mind and come to a right decision. But when reconsideration is impossible, the wrong done is only increased by altering one’s mind and acknowledging one’s mistake. Some of you yourselves have in fact repented before now of having sent men to their death; but when you, who had been misled, felt repentance, most assuredly did those who had misled you deserve death. </p> </div>

<p>Moreover, whereas involuntary mistakes are excusable, voluntary mistakes are not; for an involuntary mistake is due to chance, gentlemen, a voluntary one to the will. And what could be more voluntary than the immediate putting into effect of a carefully considered course of action? Furthermore, the wrongful taking of life by one’s vote is just as criminal as the wrongful taking of life by one’s hand. </p> </div>

<p>Rest assured that I should never have come to <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>, had such a crime been on my conscience. I am here, as it is, because I have faith in justice, the most precious ally of the man who has no deed of sin upon his conscience and who has committed no transgression against the gods. Often at such an hour as this, when the body has given up the struggle, its salvation is the spirit, which is ready to fight on in the conscience that it is innocent. On the other hand, he whose conscience is guilty has no worse enemy than that conscience; for his spirit fails him which his body is still unwearied, because it feels that what is approaching him is the punishment of his iniquities. But it is with no such guilty conscience that I come before you. </p> </div>

  <p>There is nothing remarkable in the fact that the prosecution are misrepresenting me. It is expected of them just as it is expected of you not to consent to do what is wrong. I say this because if you follow my advice, it is still open to you to regret your action, and that regret can be remedied by punishing me at the second trial: whereas if you obediently carry out the prosecution’s wishes, the situation cannot be righted again. Nor is there a question of a long interval before the law will allow you to take the step to which the prosecution are today urging you to consent in defiance of it. It is not haste, but discretion which triumphs; so take cognizance of the case today: pass judgement on it later<note resp="editor"><foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν μαρτύρων</foreign> is clearly an unintelligent gloss, added by a reader who felt that a genitive was needed to correspond to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς δίκης</foreign>.</note>; form an opinion as to the truth today: decide upon it later. </p> </div>

<p>It is very easy, remember, to give false evidence against a man on a capital charge. If you are persuaded only for an instant to put him to death, he has lost his chance of redress with his life. A man’s very friends will refuse to seek redress for him once he is dead; and even if they are prepared to do so, what good is it to one who has lost his life? </p> </div>

<p>Acquit me, then, today and at the trial for murder the prosecution shall take the traditional oath before accusing me: you shall decide my case by the laws of the land: and I, if I am unlucky, shall have no grounds left for complaining that I was sentenced to death illegally. That is my request; and in making it I am not forgetting your duty as godfearing men or depriving myself of my rights, as my life is bound up with your oath. Respect which you will, and acquit me.</p> </div></div>
