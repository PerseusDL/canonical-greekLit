<p> Cases in which the facts are agreed upon are settled in advance either by the law or by the statutes of the Assembly, which between them control every branch of civic life. But should matter for dispute occur, it is your task, gentlemen, to give a decision. However, I do not imagine that any dispute will in fact arise between the defendant and myself. My son was struck in the side by a javelin thrown by yonder lad in the gymnasium, and died instantly. </p> </div>

  <p>I accuse him not of killing my son deliberately, but of killing him by accident—though the loss which I have suffered is not thereby lessened. But if he has not caused the dead boy himself disquiet, he has caused disquiet to the living<note resp="editor">For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθύμιος</foreign> see General Introduction.</note>; and I ask you to pity that dead boy’s childless parents: to show your sorrow for his own untimely end: to forbid his slayer to set foot where he is forbidden to set foot by the law<note resp="editor">See <bibl n="Antiph. 6.34">Antiph. 6.34</bibl> ff., <title>On the Choreutes</title>, for the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴργεσθαι τῶν νομίμων</foreign>.</note>: and to refuse to allow him to defile the whole city.</p> </div> </div>

  <p> I now see that sheer misfortune and necessity can force those who hate litigation to appear in court and those who love peace to show boldness<note anchored="true" resp="ed" >For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τολμᾶν</foreign> used absolutely in this sense cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.2">Antiph. 3.3.2</bibl>.</note> and generally belie their nature in word and deed; for I myself, who, unless I am sorely mistaken, am very far from finding or wanting to find such a task congenial, have today been forced by sheer misfortune to depart from my habits and appear as defendant in a case in which I found it hard enough to arrive at the exact truth, but which leaves me still more perplexed when I consider how I should present it to you. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="2"> 
<p>I am driven by pitiless necessity: and I, like my opponents, gentlemen of the jury, seek refuge in your sympathy. I beg of you: if my arguments appear more subtle than those generally presented to you, do not allow the circumstances already mentioned<note resp="editor">i.e. the fact that he was not accustomed to appearing in courts of law, which should make it a priori probable that he is a simple and straightforward man who would not resort to subtleties of argument if his case were a sound one.</note> so to prejudice you against my defence as to make you base your verdict upon apparent fact instead of upon the truth; apparent fact puts the advantage with the clever speaker, but truth with the man who lives in justice and righteousness. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="3"> 
  <p>In training my son in those pursuits from which the state derives most benefit I imagined that both of us would be rewarded; but the result has sadly belied my hopes. For the lad—not from insolence or wantonness, but while at javelin-practice in the gymnasium with his fellows—made a hit, it is true, but killed no one, if one considers his true part in the matter<note resp="editor">Two interpretations of the text as it stands in the manuscripts are possible: (1) <q rend="double" type="translation">He threw (his spear), it is true, but killed no one</q>; (2) <q rend="double" type="translation">He struck (someone), it is true, but did not kill him.</q> (1) gives good sense; but elsewhere in the tetralogy <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάλλειν</foreign> means <q rend="double" type="gloss">to hit,</q> not <q rend="double" type="gloss">to throw.</q> (2) avoids this difficulty; but it has been urged (e.g. by Blass, who favors emendation) that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν μὲν βαλόντα καὶ ἀποκτείναντα οὔτε τρῶσαι οὔτε ἀποκτείναί φησι</foreign> in <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.5">Antiph. 3.3.5</bibl> (cf. also <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.6">Antiph. 3.3.6</bibl> sub fin.) prove that the speaker in the present passage had not admitted that X struck Y. The contradiction, however, is only apparent. The speaker here is saying in effect that the responsibility for the blow must rest with Y, although X dealt it; in <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.5">Antiph. 3.3.5-6</bibl> his opponents argue that the responsibility must rest with X, because X dealt it.</note>: he accidentally<note resp="editor">For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκουσίως</foreign> cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 2.3.1">Antiph. 2.3.1</bibl>, note 2.</note> incurred the blame for the error of another which affected that other’s own person. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="4"> 
<p>Had the boy been wounded because the javelin had traveled in his direction outside the area appointed for its flight, we should be left unable to show that we had not caused his death. But he ran into the path of the javelin and placed his person in its way. Hence my son was prevented from hitting the target: while the boy, who moved into the javelin’s path, was struck, thereby causing us to be blamed for what we did not do. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="5"> 
<p>It was because he ran in front of the javelin that the boy was struck. The lad is therefore accused without just cause, as he did not strike anyone standing clear of the target. At the same time, since it is plain to you that the boy was not struck while standing still, but was struck only after deliberately moving into the path of the javelin, you have still clearer proof that his death was due to an error on his own part. Had he stood still and not run across, he would not have been struck. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="6"> 
  <p>Both sides are agreed, as you see, that the boy’s death was accidental; so by discovering which of the two was guilty of error, we should prove still more conclusively who killed him. For it is those guilty of error in carrying out an intended act who are responsible for accidents<note resp="editor">The argument is: (1) It is agreed that death was accidental. (2) But accidents are always due to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτία</foreign> on the part of someone. (3) Therefore if the person guilty of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτία</foreign> is discovered, we have eo ipso discovered the person responsible for the boy’s death.</note>: just as it is those who voluntarily do a thing or allow it to be done to them who are responsible for the effects suffered. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="7"> 
<p>Now the lad, on his side, was not guilty of error in respect of anyone: in practising he was not doing what he was forbidden but what he had been told to do, and he was not standing among those engaged in gymnastics when he threw the javelin, but in his place among the other throwers: nor did he hit the boy because he missed the target and sent his javelin instead at those standing clear. He did everything correctly, as he intended; and thus he was not the cause of any accident, but the victim of one, in that he was prevented from hitting the target. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="8"> 
<p>The boy, on the other hand, who wished to run forward, missed the moment at which he could have crossed without being hit, with results which he by no means desired. He was accidentally guilty of an error which affected his own person, and has thus met with a disaster for which he had himself alone to thank. He has punished himself for his error, and is therefore duly requited; not that we rejoice at or approve of it—far from it: we feel both sympathy and sorrow.</p> 
<p>It is thus the dead boy who proves to have been guilty of error; so the act which caused his death is to be attributed not to us, but to him, the party guilty of error: just as the recoiling of its effects upon the agent not only absolves us from blame, but has caused the agent to be punished as he deserved directly his error was committed. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="9"> 
<p>Furthermore, our innocence is attested by the law upon which my accuser relies in charging me with the boy’s death, the law which forbids the taking of life whether wrongfully or otherwise. For the fact that the victim himself was guilty of error clears the defendant here of having killed him by accident: while his accuser does not even suggest that he killed him deliberately. Thus he is cleared of both charges, of killing the boy by accident and of killing him deliberately. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="10"> 
<p>Not only do the true facts of the case and the law under which he is being prosecuted attest my son’s innocence; but our manner of life is equally far from justifying such harsh treatment of us. Not only will it be an outrage, if my son is to bear the blame for errors which he did not commit; but I myself, who am equally innocent, though assuredly not more so, will be visited with woes many times more bitter. Once my son is lost, I shall pass the rest of my days longing for death: once I am left childless, mine will be a life within the tomb. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="11"> 
<p>Have pity, then, on this child, the victim of calamity, though guilty of no error: and have pity on me, an old man in distress, stricken thus suddenly with sorrow. Do not bring a miserable fate upon us by condemning us: but show that you fear God by acquitting us. The dead boy is not unavenged for the calamity which befell him: nor ought we ourselves to share the responsibility for errors due to our accusers. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:2" n="12"> 
<p>So respect the righteousness which the facts before you have revealed: respect justice: and acquit us as godly and just men should. Do not bring upon a father and a son, two of the most wretched of beings, sorrows which the years of neither can well bear.</p> </div> </div>

        <head>Second Speech for the Prosecution</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="1"> 
<p> That sheer necessity can force all men to belie their nature in both word and deed is a fact of which the defendant seems to me to be giving very real proof. Whereas in the past he was the last to show impudence or audacity, his very misfortune has today forced him to say things which I for one would never have expected of him. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="2"> 
  <p>I, in my great folly, imagined that he would not reply; otherwise I would not have deprived myself of half of my opportunities as prosecutor by making only one speech instead of two; and he, but for his audacity, would not have had the twofold advantage over me of using one speech to answer the one speech for the prosecution and making his accusations when they could not be answered.<note resp="editor">I take the speaker to mean: <q rend="double" type="emph">The case seemed so simple that instead of developing any argument in my first speech for the prosecution, I merely stated the bare facts. The defendant, however, has made an elaborate reply, and will doubtless do the same again in his second speech; this is equivalent to his making two speeches to my one. Further, he will be able to use his second speech to answer my one serious speech for the prosecution (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕνα πρὸς ἕνα λόγον ἀπολογηθείς</foreign>); while I cannot effectively answer the attack which he made upon me in his first speech (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃ κατηγόρησεν ἀναποκρίτως εἰπών</foreign>), because, as prosecutor, I must now devote myself to attacking him.</q></note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="3"> 
<p>With his great advantage over us in the matter of the speeches, and with the far greater one which his methods have given him in addition,<note anchored="true" resp="ed" >Referring apparently to the artifices employed by the defence for working upon the feelings of the court (cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 3.2.1">Antiph. 3.2.1</bibl> ff.).</note> it is outrageous that the accused should entreat you to listen kindly to his defence. I myself, on the other hand, far from causing any harm, have been the victim of cruel affliction, and am today being treated still more cruelly. It is as one who seeks more than a pretended refuge in your sympathy that I make my own request of you. You who take vengeance for unrighteous deeds and determine wherein is righteousness, do not, I beg of you, let worthless subtleties of speech induce you to disregard plain facts and treat the truth as false; </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="4"> 
<p>for such subtleties result in a tale more plausible than true, whereas the truth, when told, will be less guileful and therefore less convincing.</p> 
<p>My faith in justice, then, enables me to despise his defence. Yet my distrust of the pitiless will of fate makes me fear that I may not only lose the benefit of my child, but that I may see him convicted by you of taking his own life in addition. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="5"> 
<p>For the defendant has had the audacity and shamelessness to say that he who struck and killed neither wounded nor killed, whereas he who neither touched the javelin nor had any intention of throwing it missed every other point on earth and every other person, and pierced his own side with the javelin. Why, I should myself sound more convincing, I think, were I accusing the lad of willful murder, than does the defendant in claiming that the lad neither struck nor killed. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="6"> 
<p>My son was bidden at that moment by the master in charge, who was taking the javelins of the throwers into his keeping, to pick them up; but thanks to the wantonness of him who cast it, he was greeted by yonder lad’s cruel weapon; though guilty of error in respect of no single person, he died a piteous death. The lad, on the other hand, who mistook the moment at which the javelins were being picked up, was not prevented from making a hit. To my bitter sorrow, he struck a target; and although he did not kill my son deliberately, there are better grounds for maintaining that he did than for asserting that he neither struck nor killed. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="7"> 
<p>Although it was by accident that they killed my son, the effects were the same as those of willful murder. Yet they deny that they killed him at all, and even maintain that they are not amenable to the law which forbids the taking of life whether wrongfully or otherwise. Then who did throw the javelin? To whom is the boy’s death in fact to be attributed? To the spectators or the masters in charge—whom no one accuses at all? The circumstances of my son’s death are no mystery: to me, for one, they are only too clear; and I maintain that the law is right when it orders the punishment of those who have taken life; not only is it just that he who killed without meaning to kill should suffer punishment which he did not mean to incur; but it would also be an injustice to the victim, whose injury is not lessened by being accidental, were he deprived of vengeance. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="8"> 
  <p>Nor does he deserve acquittal because of his misfortune in committing the error which he did. If, on the one hand, the misfortune is not due to any dispensation of heaven, then, as an error pure and simple, it is right that it should prove disastrous to him who was guilty of it; and if, on the other hand, a defilement from heaven has fallen upon the slayer by reason of some act of sin, then it is wrong for us to impede the visitation of God.<note resp="editor">i.e. it might be argued that the lad was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτυχής</foreign> in committing the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτία</foreign> which he did, and therefore deserves acquittal. But the prosecution produces a dilemma: (a) If the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτυχία</foreign> was a piece of divine retribution for some past offence, he deserves punishment all the more, as it is God’s will that he should be punished. (b) If it is not due to God, then to say that the lad was the victim of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτυχία</foreign> is only a more polite way of saying that he was guilty of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτία</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμάρτημα οὖσα</foreign>), and we are back where we started.</note> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:3" n="9"> 
<p>They also maintained that it is wrong for those who have lived as honorably as they to be treated with severity. But what of us? Should we be treated aright, if we are punished with death when our life has been as praiseworthy as theirs?</p> 
<p>When he argues that he is not guilty of error and claims that the consequences must be borne by those who are, instead of being diverted to the innocent, he is pleading our case for us. Not only would it be an injustice to my son, who was killed by yonder lad, though guilty of error in respect of no one, were he deprived of vengeance; but it will be an outrage, if I myself, who am even more guiltless than he, fail to obtain from you the recompense which the law assigns me. </p> </div>

Then the lad is not free from blame either; he is only innocent if he was standing still and not throwing his javelin when the boy was killed. The boy’s death was therefore due to both of them. Now the boy, whose error affected his own person, has punished himself even more harshly than that error warranted: for he has lost his life. So what right has his accomplice, who joined him in committing his unfortunate error, to escape unpunished? </p> </div>

  <p>While it is only to be expected that the preoccupation of my opponent with his speech for the prosecution should prevent his understanding my defence, the same is not true of yourselves. You should bear in mind that while we, the interested parties, take a biassed view of the case, each naturally thinking that his own version of it is fair, your duty is to consider the facts conscientiously; and so you must give your attention to me as much as you did to him<note resp="editor">The addition of this sentence is necessary for a proper understanding of the connection of thought.

For my part, if I have told any falsehoods, I am content that you should treat the truth which I have spoken as itself a piece of equally dishonest pleading.

<p>I would have you understand to begin with that it requires not mere assertion, but proof, to show that someone has killed someone else.

  <p>He complains bitterly, because, according to him, it is a slur upon his son’s memory that he should have been proved a slayer when he neither threw the javelin nor had any intention of doing so. That complaint is not an answer to my arguments. I am not maintaining that his son threw the javelin or struck himself. I am maintaining that since he moved within range of the javelin, his death was due not to the lad, but to himself; for he was not killed standing in his place. As this running across was his undoing, it follows that if it was at his master’s summons that he ran across, the master would be the person responsible for his death<note resp="editor">It is at first sight odd that so little is made of the part played by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδοτρίβης</foreign>, who would be a vitally important witness, were the case being tried in a modern court of law.

  <p>Before proceeding to any further argument, I wish to show still more clearly which of the two was responsible for the accident. The lad no more missed the target than any of those practising with him<note resp="editor">A highly artificial piece of sophistry. (1) The lad did exactly the same as the other throwers: so, as they did not miss the target, neither can he have done. (2) On the other hand, the boy did not do the same as the other spectators; and so he is not blameless, as they are.</note>: nor has he rendered himself guilty of any of the acts with which he is charged owing to error on his own part. On the other hand, the boy did not do the same as the other onlookers; he moved into the javelin’s path. And this is clear proof that it was through his own error that he met with a disaster which those who stood still did not. The thrower would not have been guilty of an error in any respect,<note resp="editor">A curious admission that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μειράκιον</foreign> was guilty of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτία</foreign> to at least some extent.</note> had no one moved into the path of his spear: while the boy would not have been hit, had he remained in his place among the onlookers. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:4" n="6"> 
<p>Further, my son was not more concerned in the boy’s death than any one of those throwing javelins with him, as I will show. If it was owing to the fact that my son was throwing a javelin that the boy was killed, then all those practising with him must share in the guilt of the deed, as it was not owing to their failure to throw that they did not strike him, but owing to the fact that he did not move into the path of the javelin of any one of them. Similarly the young man, who was no more guilty of error than they, would not have hit the boy any more than they did, had the boy stood still with the onlookers. </p> </div>

<p>Again, not only was the boy guilty of the error committed; he was also to blame for the failure to take due precautions. My son saw no one running across, so how could he have taken precautions against striking anyone? The boy, on the other hand, upon seeing the throwers, might easily have guarded against running across, as he was quite at liberty to remain standing still. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:4" n="8"> 
<p>The law which they quote is a praiseworthy one; it is right and fair that it should visit those who have killed without meaning to do so with chastisement which they did not mean to incur. But the lad is not guilty of error; and it would therefore be unjust that he should suffer for him who is. It is enough that he should bear the consequences of his own errors. On the other hand, the boy, who perished through his own error, punished himself as soon as he had committed that error. And as the slayer has been punished, the slaying has not gone unavenged. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg003.perseus-eng2:4" n="9"> 
<p>The slayer has paid the penalty; so it is not by acquitting us, but by condemning us that you will leave a burden upon your consciences. The boy, who is bearing the consequence of his own error, will leave behind him nothing that calls for atonement from anyone; but if my son, who is innocent, is put to death, the conscience of those who have condemned him will be more heavily burdened than ever.</p> 
<p>If the arguments put forward prove the dead boy his own slayer, it is not we who have stated them whom he has to thank, but the fact that the accident happened as it did. </p> </div>

<p>Since examination proves beyond doubt that the boy was his own slayer, the law absolves us from blame, and condemns him who was guilty. See, then, that we are not plunged into woes which we do not deserve, and that you yourselves do not defy the powers above by a verdict succoring my opponents in their misfortunes. Remember, as righteousness and justice require you to do, that the accident was caused by him who moved into the javelin’s path. Remember, and acquit us; for we are not guilty of his death.</p> </div> </div></div> </body>
