       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given finite straight line.</p>

       <p>With centre <emph>A</emph> and distance <emph>AB</emph> let the circle <emph>BCD</emph> be described; [<ref target="elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</ref>] <lb n="10"/>again, with centre <emph>B</emph> and distance <emph>BA</emph> let the circle <emph>ACE</emph> be described; [<ref target="elem.1.post.3">Post. 3</ref>] and from the point <emph>C</emph>, in which the circles cut one another, to the points <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph> let the straight lines <emph>CA</emph>, <emph>CB</emph> be joined. [<ref target="elem.1.post.1">Post. 1</ref>] <lb n="15"/></p>
       <p>Now, since the point <emph>A</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>CDB</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>AC</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.def.15">Def. 15</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>Again, since the point <emph>B</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>CAE</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>BA</emph>. [<ref target="elem.1.def.15">Def. 15</ref>]</hi></p>
       <p>But <emph>CA</emph> was also proved equal to <emph>AB</emph>; <lb n="20"/>therefore each of the straight lines <emph>CA</emph>, <emph>CB</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>.</p>
       <p>And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [<ref target="elem.1.c.n.1">C.N. 1</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>CA</emph> is also equal to <emph>CB</emph>.</hi></p>

       <p>The Greek usage differs from ours in that the definite article is employed in such a phrase as this where we have the indefinite. <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ th=s doqei/shs eu)qei/as peperasme/nhs</foreign>, <quote>on <emph>the</emph> given finite straight line,</quote>

      <note n="3. Let AB be the given finite straight line." type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       <p>To be strictly literal we should have to translate in the reverse order <quote>let the given finite straight line be the (straight line) <emph>AB</emph></quote>
; but this order is inconvenient in other cases where there is more than one datum, e.g. in the <emph>setting-out</emph> of <ref target="elem.1.2">I. 2</ref>, <quote>let the given point be <emph>A</emph>, and the given straight line <emph>BC</emph>,</quote>
 the awkwardness arising from the omission of the verb in the second clause. Hence I have, for clearness' sake, adopted the other order throughout the book.</p>

      <note n="8. let the circle BCD be described." type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
       <p>Two things are here to be noted, (1) the elegant and practically universal use of the perfect passive imperative in constructions, <foreign lang="greek">gegra/fqw</foreign> meaning of course <quote>let it <emph>have been</emph> described</quote>
 or <quote>suppose it described,</quote>
 (2) the impossibility of expressing shortly in a translation the force of the words in their original order. <foreign lang="greek">ku/klos gegra/fqw o\ *b*g*d</foreign> means literally <quote>let a circle have been described, the (circle, namely, which I denote by) <emph>BCD</emph>.</quote>
 Similarly we have lower down <quote>let straight lines, (namely) the (straight lines) <emph>CA</emph>, <emph>CB</emph>, be joined,</quote>
 <foreign lang="greek">e)pezeu/xqwsan eu)qei=ai ai/ *g*a, *g*b</foreign>. There seems to be no practicable alternative, in English, but to translate as I have done in the text.</p>

Proclus thus avoids the mistake made by some modern editors who explain the term exclusively with reference to the case where two sides have been mentioned before. That this is an error is proved (1) by the occurrence of the term in the enunciations of <ref target="elem.1.37">I. 37</ref> etc. about triangles on the same base and equal bases, (2) by the application of the same term to the bases of parallelograms in <ref target="elem.1.35">I. 35</ref> etc. The truth is that the use of the term must have been suggested by the practice of drawing the particular side horizontally, as it were, and the rest of the figure above it. The <emph>base</emph> of a figure was therefore spoken of, primarily, in the same sense as the base of anything <pb n="V1_249"/>else, e.g. of a pedestal or column; but when, as in <ref target="elem.1.5">I. 5</ref>, two triangles were compared occupying other than the normal positions which gave rise to the name, and when two sides had been previously mentioned, the base was, as Proclus says, necessarily the third side.</p>

       <p>In an English translation of the enunciation of this proposition it is absolutely necessary, in order to make it intelligible, to insert some words which are not in the Greek. The reason is partly that the Greek enunciation is itself very elliptical, and partly that some words used in it conveyed more meaning than the corresponding words in English do. Particularly is this the case with <foreign lang="greek">ou) sustaqh/sontai e)pi/</foreign> <quote>there shall not be constructed upon,</quote>
 since <foreign lang="greek">suni/stasqai</foreign> is the regular word for constructing a <emph>triangle</emph> in particular. Thus a Greek would easily understahd <foreign lang="greek">sustaqh/sontai e)pi/</foreign> as meaning the construction of two lines <emph>forming a triangle on</emph> a given straight line as base; whereas to <quote>construct two straight lines on a straight line</quote>
 is not in English sufficiently definite unless we explain that they are drawn from the <emph>ends</emph> of the straight line to <emph>meet</emph> at a point. I have had the less hesitation in putting in the words <quote>from its extremities</quote>
 because they are actually used by Euclid in the somewhat similar enunciation of <ref target="elem.1.21">I. 21</ref>.</p>
       <p>How impossible a literal translation into English is, if it is to convey the meaning of the enunciation intelligibly, will be clear from the following attempt to render literally: <quote>On the same straight line there shall not be constructed two other straight lines equal, each to each, to the same two straight lines, (terminating) at different points on the same side, having the same extremities as the original straight lines</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ th=s au)th=s eu)qei/as du/o tai=s au)tai=s eu)qei/ais a)/llai du/o eu)qei=ai i)/sai e(kate\ra e(kate/ra ou) sustaqh/sontai pro\s a)/llw| kai) a)/llw| shmei/w| e)pi) ta\ au)ta\ me/rh ta\ au)ta\ pe/rata e)/xousai tai=s e)c a)rxh=s eu)qei/ais</foreign>).</p>
       <p>The reason why Euclid allowed himself to use, in this enunciation, language apparently so obscure is no doubt that the phraseology was traditional and therefore, vague as it was, had a conventional meaning which the contemporary geometer well understood. This is proved, I think, by the occurrence in Aristotle (<xref n="Aristot. Meteo. 376a.2" from="ROOT" to="DITTO"><title>Meteorologica</title> III. 5, 376 a 2 sqq.</xref>) of the very same, evidently technical, expressions. Aristotle is there alluding to the theorem given by Eutocius from Apollonius' <title>Plane Loci</title> to the effect that, if <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> be two fixed points and <emph>M</emph> such a variable point that the ratio of <emph>MH</emph> to <emph>MK</emph> is a given ratio (not one of equality), the locus of <emph>M</emph> is a circle. (For an account of this theorem see note on <ref target="elem.6.3">VI. 3</ref> below.) Now Aristotle says <quote>The lines drawn up from <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> in this ratio cannot be constructed to two different points of the semicircle <emph>A</emph></quote>

       <p>If a paraphrase is allowed instead of a translation adhering as closely as possible to the original, Simson's is the best that could be found, since the fact that the straight lines form <emph>triangles</emph> on the same base is really conveyed in the Greek. Simson's enunciation is, <title>Upon the same base</title>, <emph>and on the same side of it</emph>, <emph>there cannot be two triangles that have their sides which are terminated in one extremity of the base equal to one another</emph>, <emph>and likewise those which are terminated at the other extremity</emph>. Th. Taylor (the translator of Proclus) attacks Simson's alteration as <quote>indiscreet</quote>
 and as detracting from the beauty and accuracy of Euclid's enunciation which are enlarged upon by Proclus in his commentary. Yet, when Taylor says <quote>Whatever difficulty learners may find in conceiving this proposition abstractedly is easily removed by its exposition in the figure,</quote>
 he really gives his case away. The fact is that Taylor, always enthusiastic over his author, was nettled by Simson's slighting remarks on Proclus' comments on the proposition. Simson had said, with reference to Proclus' explanation of the bearing of the second part of <ref target="elem.1.5">I. 5</ref> on <ref target="elem.1.7">I. 7</ref>, that it was not <quote>worth while <pb n="V1_260"/>to relate his trifles at full length,</quote>
 to which Taylor retorts <quote>But Mr Simson was no philosopher; and therefore the greatest part of these Commentaries must be considered by him as trifles, from the want of a philosophic genius to comprehend their meaning, and a taste superior to that of a <emph>mere mathematician</emph>, to discover their beauty and elegance.</quote>

On the contrary, he evidently prefers the alphabetical order, and seems to disdain to alter it for the sake of beginners or others who might be confused by it. In the case of angles alteration is perhaps unnecessary; but in the case of triangles and pairs of corresponding sides I have ventured to alter the order to that which the mathematician of to-day expects.</p>

       <p>It is to be observed that, when parallelograms have to be mentioned for the first time, Euclid calls them <quote>parallelogrammic areas</quote>
 or, more exactly, <quote>parallelogram</quote>
 areas (<foreign lang="greek">parallhlo/gramma xwri/a</foreign>). The meaning is simply areas bounded by parallel straight lines with the further limitation placed upon the term by Euclid that only <emph>four-sided</emph> figures are so called, although of course there are certain regular polygons which have opposite sides parallel, and which therefore might be said to be areas bounded by parallel straight lines. We gather from Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 393" from="ROOT" to="DITTO">p. 393</xref>) that the word <quote>parallelogram</quote>
 was first introduced by Euclid, that its use was suggested by <ref target="elem.1.33">I. 33</ref>, and that the formation of the word <foreign lang="greek">parallhlo/grammos</foreign> (parallel-lined) was analogous to that of <foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/grammos</foreign> (straight-lined or rectilineal).</p>

      <p>Let <emph>ABCDE</emph> be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the pentagon <emph>ABCDE</emph>. </p>
      <p>For let the angles <emph>BCD</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> be bisected by the straight lines <emph>CF</emph>, <emph>DF</emph> respectively; and from the point <emph>F</emph>, at <pb n="V2_105"/>which the straight lines <emph>CF</emph>, <emph>DF</emph> meet one another, let the straight lines <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FE</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <emph>BC</emph> is equal to <emph>CD</emph>, and <emph>CF</emph> common, the two sides <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CF</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>DC</emph>, <emph>CF</emph>; <figure/> and the angle <emph>BCF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DCF</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the base <emph>BF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>DF</emph>,</hi> and the triangle <emph>BCF</emph> is equal to the triangle <emph>DCF</emph>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <emph>CBF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>CDF</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, since the angle <emph>CDE</emph> is double of the angle <emph>CDF</emph>, and the angle <emph>CDE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ABC</emph>, while the angle <emph>CDF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>CBF</emph>; therefore the angle <emph>CBA</emph> is also double of the angle <emph>CBF</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>ABF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FBC</emph>;</hi> therefore the angle <emph>ABC</emph> has been bisected by the straight line <emph>BF</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that the angles <emph>BAE</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> have also been bisected by the straight lines <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FE</emph> respectively. </p>
      <p>Now let <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> be drawn from the point <emph>F</emph> perpendicular to the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph>. </p>
      <p>Then, since the angle <emph>HCF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>KCF</emph>, and the right angle <emph>FHC</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>FKC</emph>, <emph>FHC</emph>, <emph>FKC</emph> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <emph>FC</emph> which is common to them and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [<ref target="elem.1.26">I. 26</ref>] therefore the perpendicular <emph>FH</emph> is equal to the perpendicular <emph>FK</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph>, <emph>FG</emph> is also equal to each of the straight lines <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>; <pb n="V2_106"/>therefore the five straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> are equal to one another. </p>

      <p>For, if it does not touch them. but cuts them, it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls within the circle: which was proved absurd. [<ref target="elem.3.16">III. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <emph>F</emph> and distance one of the straight lines <emph>FG</emph>, <emph>FH</emph>, <emph>FK</emph>, <emph>FL</emph>, <emph>FM</emph> will not cut the straight lines <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EA</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore it will touch them.</hi>

      <p>Let the angles <emph>BCD</emph>, <emph>CDE</emph> be bisected by the straight lines <emph>CF</emph>, <emph>DF</emph> respectively, and from the point <emph>F</emph>, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FE</emph> be joined to the points <emph>B</emph>, <emph>A</emph>, <emph>E</emph>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles <emph>CBA</emph>, <emph>BAE</emph>, <emph>AED</emph> have also been bisected by the straight lines <emph>FB</emph>, <emph>FA</emph>, <emph>FE</emph> respectively. <pb n="V2_107"/></p>

      <p>Let the diameter <emph>AD</emph> of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph> be drawn; let the centre <emph>G</emph> of the circle be taken, and with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance <emph>DG</emph> let the circle <emph>EGCH</emph> be described; <figure/> let <emph>EG</emph>, <emph>CG</emph> be joined and carried through to the points <emph>B</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>I say that the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral and equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the point <emph>G</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>GE</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>.</hi>

      </p>
      <p>But <emph>GE</emph> was proved equal to <emph>GD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GE</emph> is also equal to <emph>ED</emph>; therefore the triangle <emph>EGD</emph> is equilateral;</hi> and therefore its three angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>GDE</emph>, <emph>DEG</emph> are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another.

      <p>And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [<ref target="elem.1.32">I. 32</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>EGD</emph> is one-third of two right angles.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, the angle <emph>DGC</emph> can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles. </p>
      <p>And, since the straight line <emph>CG</emph> standing on <emph>EB</emph> makes the adjacent angles <emph>EGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle <emph>CGB</emph> is also one-third of two right angles. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>DGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles <emph>BGA</emph>, <emph>AGF</emph>, <emph>FGE</emph> are equal. [<ref target="elem.1.15">I. 15</ref>] </p>

      <p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<ref target="elem.3.26">III. 26</ref>] therefore the six circumferences <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<ref target="elem.3.29">III. 29</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the circumference <emph>FA</emph> is equal to the circumference <emph>ED</emph>, <hi rend="center">let the circumference <emph>ABCD</emph> be added to each; therefore the whole <emph>FABCD</emph> is equal to the whole <emph>EDCBA</emph>;</hi>

 The same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, <ref target="elem.5.17 elem.5.18">V. 17, 18</ref>, and to other forms of expression in <ref target="elem.5.20 elem.5.21 elem.5.22 elem.5.23">V. 20-23</ref> and later propositions: e.g. in <ref target="elem.5.20">V. 20</ref> we have a phrase meaning literally <quote>Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, as <emph>A</emph> to <emph>B</emph>, so <emph>D</emph> to <emph>E</emph>,</quote>
 etc.: in <ref target="elem.5.21">V. 21</ref> <quote>(magnitudes)...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, as <emph>A</emph> to <emph>B</emph>, so <emph>E</emph> to <emph>F</emph>,</quote>
 etc. In all such cases (where the Greek is so terse as to be almost ungrammatical) I shall insert the words necessary in English, without further remark.</p>

      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <emph>HC</emph> is of the base <emph>BC</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, <lb n="20"/>whatever multiple the base <emph>LC</emph> is of the base <emph>CD</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>ALC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>; and, if the base <emph>HC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> is also equal to the triangle <emph>ACL</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.38">I. 38</ref>] <pb n="V2_192"/>if the base <emph>HC</emph> is in excess of the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>

      <p>For an unit will not be left; otherwise <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> will be prime to one another [<ref target="elem.7.1">VII. 1</ref>], which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>
      <p>Therefore some number will be left which will measure the one before it. </p>
      <p>Now let <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, measuring <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, leave <hi rend="ital">EA</hi> less than itself, let <hi rend="ital">EA</hi>, measuring <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, leave <hi rend="ital">FC</hi> less than itself, and let <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> measure <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then, <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> will also measure <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. </p>

      <p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>
      <p>For, if <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> is not the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, some number which is greater than <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> will measure the numbers <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be <hi rend="ital">G</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> also measures <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it also measures the whole <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>; therefore it will also measure the remainder <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">G</hi> will also measure <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it also measures the whole <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>; therefore it will also measure the remainder <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, that is, the greater will measure the less: which is impossible. </p>

      <p>For let two mean proportional numbers <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> fall between the two numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are similar solid numbers. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For let three numbers <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, be taken; [<ref target="elem.7.33">VII. 33</ref> or <ref target="elem.8.2">VIII. 2</ref>] therefore the extremes of them <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are prime to one another. [<ref target="elem.8.3">VIII. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now, since one mean proportional number <hi rend="ital">F</hi> has fallen between <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are similar plane numbers. [<ref target="elem.8.20">VIII. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let, then, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi> be the sides of <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> of <hi rend="ital">G</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore it is manifest from the theorem before this that <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi> and that of <hi rend="ital">K</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and the multitude of the numbers <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.14">VII. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are prime, primes are also least, [<ref target="elem.7.21">VII. 21</ref>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio with <pb n="V2_378"/>them the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<ref target="elem.7.20">VII. 20</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, as many times as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">N</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">N</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is the product of <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">N</hi> by multiplying the product of <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is solid, and <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi> are its sides. </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio as <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, as many times as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi> according to the units in <hi rend="ital">O</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">O</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">G</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is the product of <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">O</hi> by multiplying the product of <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is solid, and <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi> are its sides; therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are solid. </p>
      <p>I say that they are also similar. </p>

      <p>I say next that it will not be measured by any other prime except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is measured by another, and <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, that other will also measure <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; so that it will also measure <hi rend="ital">A</hi> [<ref target="elem.9.12">IX. 12</ref>], which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. </p>

      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">F</hi> is not the same as any one of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">F</hi> is measured by <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, by proving again that <hi rend="ital">F</hi> is not prime. </p>

[<ref target="elem.8.2">VIII. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are least, they are prime to one another. [<ref target="elem.7.22">VII. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [<ref target="elem.7.28">VII. 28</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is also prime to each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>

      <p>But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [<ref target="elem.7.24">VII. 24</ref>] so that the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is prime to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; hence the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is also prime to the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.25">VII. 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> together with the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.2.3">II. 3</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> together with the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is prime to the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, and the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> added together are prime to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. <pb n="V2_405"/></p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> added together are prime to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> added together are also prime to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is prime to each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is also prime to the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.24 elem.7.25">VII. 24, 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the squares on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> together with twice the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.2.4">II. 4</ref>] therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> together with twice the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are prime to the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>

      <p>And <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is a dyad; therefore <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> are continuously double of each other; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> are continuously proportional in double proportion. </p>
      <p>Now let there be subtracted from the second <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> and the last <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> the numbers <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FO</hi>, each equal to the first <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is the excess of the last to all those before it. [<ref target="elem.9.35">IX. 35</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <hi rend="ital">NK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">OG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">NK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">OG</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">FO</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> and the unit. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> and the unit; and it is measured by them. </p>
      <p>I say also that <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> will not be measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and the unit. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let some number <hi rend="ital">P</hi> measure <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">P</hi> not be the same with any of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as many times as <hi rend="ital">P</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">P</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>. <pb n="V2_423"/></p>
      <p>But, further, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has also by multiplying <hi rend="ital">D</hi> made <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">P</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.19">VII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are continuously proportional beginning from an unit, therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> will not be measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. [<ref target="elem.9.13">IX. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, by hypothesis, <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is not the same with any of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">P</hi> will not measure <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>; therefore neither does <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measure <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is prime; and any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure. [<ref target="elem.7.29">VII. 29</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p>But primes are also least, [<ref target="elem.7.21">VII. 21</ref>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<ref target="elem.7.20">VII. 20</ref>] and, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">P</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">P</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is not measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> is the same with one of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let it be the same with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, however many <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are in multitude, let so many <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> be taken beginning from <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> are in the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.14">VII. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> is equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.19">VII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the product of <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">P</hi>; therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is also equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>. </p>

      <p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>

      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">F</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, it will also measure <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, and will measure the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>.

      <p>But the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">F</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi> also; therefore <hi rend="ital">F</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">F</hi> will also measure the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>.

      <p>But that is <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">F</hi> will measure <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude <hi rend="ital">E</hi> will measure <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> if <hi rend="ital">D</hi> do not measure <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, and, if it measure it, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is itself the greatest common measure. </p>

       <p>But when they are not similar plane numbers, two square numbers, the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> and the square on <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>, have been found such that their difference, the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, is not square. Q. E. D.</p>

       <p><hi rend="ital">To find two square numbers such that their sum is not square</hi>. </p>
       <p>For let the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, as we said, be square, and <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> even, and let <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> be bisected by <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. <figure/>
       </p>
       <p>It is then manifest that the square product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. [See <ref target="elem.10.28.l.1">Lemma 1</ref>] </p>
       <p>Let the unit <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> be subtracted; therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is less than the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
       <p>I say then that the square product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> will not be square. </p>
       <p>For, if it is square, it is either equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, or less than the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, but cannot any more be greater, lest the unit be divided. </p>
       <p>First, if possible, let the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> be equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">GA</hi> be double of the unit <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>. </p>
       <p>Since then the whole <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is double of the whole <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, and in them <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, therefore the remainder <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> is also double of the remainder <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> is bisected by <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
       <p>Therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">GB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.2.6">II. 6</ref>] </p>
       <p>But the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is also, by hypothesis, equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>; <pb n="V3_65"/>therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">GB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi>. </p>
       <p>And, if the common square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> be subtracted, it follows that <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">GB</hi>: which is absurd. </p>
       <p>Therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is not equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
       <p>I say next that neither is it less than the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
       <p>For, if possible, let it be equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">HA</hi> be double of <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>. </p>
       <p>Now it will again follow that <hi rend="ital">HC</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>; so that <hi rend="ital">CH</hi> has also been bisected at <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, and for this reason the product of <hi rend="ital">HB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">FC</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.2.6">II. 6</ref>] </p>
       <p>But, by hypothesis, the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is also equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>. </p>
       <p>Thus the product of <hi rend="ital">HB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> will also be equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi>: which is absurd. </p>
       <p>Therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> together with the square on <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is not less than the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
       <p>And it was proved that neither is it equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>

      <p>I say next that they also contain a rational rectangle. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is, by hypothesis, commensurable with each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is also commensurable with <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.12">X. 12</ref>] </p>

      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> be the side of the sum of two medial areas, and <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> commensurable with <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; it is to be proved that <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the side of the sum of two medial areas, <figure/> let it be divided into its straight lines at <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and furthermore the sum of the squares on <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi> incommensurable with the rectangle <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>.

      <p>The square, then, on <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> either by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
      <p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with itself. </p>
      <p>Now the greater straight line <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> set out; therefore <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> is a first binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.54">X. 54</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>

      <p>Now the greater straight line <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> set out; therefore <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> is a fourth binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.4">X. Deff. II. 4</ref>] </p>

      <p>Now the lesser straight line <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> set out; therefore <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> is a second binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.2">X. Deff. II. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is rational, and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the side of the square equal to it is a first bimedial; [<ref target="elem.10.55">X. 55</ref>] therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <hi rend="ital">EI</hi> is a first bimedial, so that the <quote>side</quote>

      <p>Next, let the square on <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> be greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now the lesser straight line <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is commensurable with the rational straight line <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> set out; therefore <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> is a fifth binomial. [<ref target="elem.10.def.2.5">X. Deff. II. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is a side of a rational plus a medial area. [<ref target="elem.10.58">X. 58</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area <hi rend="ital">EI</hi> is a side of a rational plus a medial area, so that the <quote>side</quote>

      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is again an apotome and <hi rend="ital">HN</hi> an annex to it. </p>

      <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ED</hi> are equal to the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">CE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, and contain equal angles, [<ref target="elem.1.15">I. 15</ref>] therefore the base <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">AED</hi> will be equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">CEB</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] so that the angle <hi rend="ital">DAE</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the angle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">BEH</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.15">I. 15</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">AGE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BEH</hi> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjacent to the equal angles, that is to say, <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<ref target="elem.1.26">I. 26</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">BH</hi>. </p>

      <p>Now since, again, <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> was proved equal to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is common, the two sides <hi rend="ital">GE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; and the base <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>; therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">GEF</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi>.

      <p>Therefore each of the angles <hi rend="ital">GEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi> is right. </p>

      <p>But a straight line is at right angles to a plane when it makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in that same plane; [<ref target="elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">FE</hi> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>

      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, [<ref target="elem.6.2">VI. 2</ref>] and <hi rend="ital">LMO</hi> is equiangular with <hi rend="ital">PQO</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.29">I. 29</ref>] therefore, as <hi rend="ital">OL</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">OP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.4">VI. 4</ref>] and alternately, as <hi rend="ital">LO</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">OP</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">LO</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">OP</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> is also greater than <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> was made equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is also greater than <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since, then, the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">PO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OQ</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is greater than the base <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">POQ</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.25">I. 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is also greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> greater than the angle <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the three angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are greater than the three angles <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> are less than four right angles; therefore the angles <hi rend="ital">LOM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NOL</hi> are much less than four right angles. <pb n="V3_317"/></p>
      <p>But they are also equal to four right angles: which is absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is not less than <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it was proved that neither is it equal; therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let then <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> be set up from the point <hi rend="ital">O</hi> at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi>, [<ref target="elem.11.12">XI. 12</ref>] and let the square on <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> be equal to that area by which the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>; [Lemma] let <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RN</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">RO</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">LMN</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">RO</hi> is also at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NO</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">LO</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">OM</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">RL</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">RN</hi> is also equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>; therefore the three straight lines <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RN</hi> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Next, since by hypothesis the square on <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> is equal to that area by which the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">LR</hi> is equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">LO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, for the angle <hi rend="ital">LOR</hi> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, while each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RN</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>; therefore each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">RL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RN</hi>. <pb n="V3_318"/></p>
      <p>And, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">LR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> is by hypothesis equal to the base <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">LRM</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.8">I. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason the angle <hi rend="ital">MRN</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">LRN</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, out of the three plane angles <hi rend="ital">LRM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MRN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LRN</hi>, which are equal to the three given angles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, the solid angle at <hi rend="ital">R</hi> has been constructed, which is contained by the angles <hi rend="ital">LRM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MRN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LRN</hi>.

      </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> be produced in each direction, let any number of straight lines whatever, <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, and any number whatever, <hi rend="ital">HM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>, equal to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>; and let the parallelograms <hi rend="ital">LP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MS</hi> and the solids <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MT</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Then, since the straight lines <hi rend="ital">LK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> are equal to one another, the parallelograms <hi rend="ital">LP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> are also equal to one another, <hi rend="ital">KO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> are equal to one another, and further <hi rend="ital">LX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AR</hi> are equal to one another, for they are opposite.

      <p>For the same reason the parallelograms <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MS</hi> are also equal to one another, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HI</hi>, <hi rend="ital">IN</hi> are equal to one another, and further <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MY</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NT</hi> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the solids <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AU</hi> three planes are equal to three planes. <pb n="V3_326"/></p>
      <p>But the three planes are equal to the three opposite; therefore the three solids <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AU</hi> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the three solids <hi rend="ital">ED</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MT</hi> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> is of the base <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>, the same multiple also is the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> of the solid <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, whatever multiple the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> is of the base <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, the same multiple also is the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi> of the solid <hi rend="ital">HU</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>; if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> exceeds the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> also exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>; and, if one falls short, the other falls short. </p>
      <p>Therefore, there being four magnitudes, the two bases <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, and the two solids <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UH</hi>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">AU</hi>, namely the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi>, and equimultiples of the base <hi rend="ital">HF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">HU</hi>, namely the base <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>, and it has been proved that, if the base <hi rend="ital">LF</hi> exceeds the base <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>, the solid <hi rend="ital">LU</hi> also exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">NU</hi>, if the bases are equal, the solids are equal, and if the base falls short, the solid falls short. </p>

      <p>For on the straight line <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> and at the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> on it let the solid angle, contained by the angles <hi rend="ital">BAH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HAK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KAB</hi>, be constructed equal to the solid angle at <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so that the angle <hi rend="ital">BAH</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ECF</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">BAK</hi> equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ECG</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">KAH</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">GCF</hi>; and let it be contrived that, as <hi rend="ital">EC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AH</hi>.

      <p>Therefore also, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">EC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AH</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">HB</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Now since, as <hi rend="ital">EC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, and the sides about the equal angles <hi rend="ital">ECG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BAK</hi> are thus proportional, <pb n="V3_330"/>therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> is similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is also similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">GF</hi>, and further <hi rend="ital">FE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">HB</hi>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> are similar to three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the former three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms, and the latter three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms; therefore the whole solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is similar to the whole solid <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>.

       <hi rend="ital">Parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another.</hi>

      <p>Let the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, of the same height, be on equal bases <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say that the solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>First, let the sides which stand up, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, be at right angles to the bases <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; let the straight line <hi rend="ital">RT</hi> be produced in a straight line with <hi rend="ital">CR</hi>; on the straight line <hi rend="ital">RT</hi>, and at the point <hi rend="ital">R</hi> on it, let the angle <hi rend="ital">TRU</hi> be constructed equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">ALB</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.23">I. 23</ref>] let <hi rend="ital">RT</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">RU</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, and let the base <hi rend="ital">RW</hi> and the solid <hi rend="ital">XU</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Now, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">TR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RU</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, and they contain equal angles, therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RW</hi> is equal and similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">HL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since again <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">RT</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, and they contain right angles, <pb n="V3_338"/>therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RX</hi> is equal and similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AM</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">LE</hi> is also equal and similar to <hi rend="ital">SU</hi>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> are equal and similar to three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">XU</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the former three are equal and similar to the three opposite, and the latter three to the three opposite; [<ref target="elem.11.24">XI. 24</ref>] therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is equal to the whole parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">XU</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">DR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WU</hi> be drawn through and meet one another at <hi rend="ital">Y</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">aTb</hi> be drawn through <hi rend="ital">T</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">DY</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">PD</hi> be produced to <hi rend="ital">a</hi>, and let the solids <hi rend="ital">YX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RI</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Then the solid <hi rend="ital">XY</hi>, of which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RX</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">Yc</hi> its opposite, is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">XU</hi> of which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RX</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">UV</hi> its opposite, for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">RX</hi> and of the same height, and the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely <hi rend="ital">RY</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Tb</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Se</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Sd</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Xc</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XV</hi>, are on the same straight lines <hi rend="ital">YW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">eV</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.29">XI. 29</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the solid <hi rend="ital">XU</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>: therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">XY</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">RUWT</hi> is equal to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">RT</hi> and in the same parallels <hi rend="ital">RT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">YW</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.35">I. 35</ref>] while <hi rend="ital">RUWT</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, since it is also equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">DT</hi> is another parallelogram; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> to <hi rend="ital">DT</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.7">V. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since the parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">CI</hi> has been cut by the plane <hi rend="ital">RF</hi> which is parallel to opposite planes, as the base <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DT</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">RI</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.25">XI. 25</ref>] <pb n="V3_339"/></p>
      <p>For the same reason, since the parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">YI</hi> has been cut by the plane <hi rend="ital">RX</hi> which is parallel to opposite planes, as the base <hi rend="ital">YT</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">TD</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">YX</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">RI</hi>.

[<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the solids <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">YX</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">RI</hi> the same ratio; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">YX</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.9">V. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">YX</hi> was proved equal to <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, let the sides standing up, <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, not be at right angles to the bases <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; I say again that the solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For from the points <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> let <hi rend="ital">KO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ET</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NY</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SI</hi> be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, and let them meet the plane at the points <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, <hi rend="ital">T</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi>, <hi rend="ital">V</hi>, <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, <hi rend="ital">X</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Y</hi>, <hi rend="ital">I</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">OT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WY</hi>, <hi rend="ital">YI</hi>, <hi rend="ital">IX</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then the solid <hi rend="ital">KV</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">QI</hi>, for they are on the equal bases <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QS</hi> and of the same height, and their sides which stand up are at right angles to their bases. [First part of this Prop.] </p>
      <p>But the solid <hi rend="ital">KV</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">QI</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>; for they are on the same base and of the same height, while the extremities of their sides which stand up are not on the same straight lines.

      <p>Now, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">KE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EL</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>, while the angle <hi rend="ital">KEL</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">CFN</hi>, inasmuch as the angle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">CFN</hi> because of the similarity of the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <pb n="V3_343"/>therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is equal &lt;and similar&gt; to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">CN</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KM</hi> is also equal and similar to <hi rend="ital">CR</hi>, and further <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>; therefore three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">KP</hi> are equal and similar to three parallelograms of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the former three parallelograms are equal and similar to their opposites, and the latter three to their opposites; [<ref target="elem.11.24">XI. 24</ref>] therefore the whole solid <hi rend="ital">KP</hi> is equal and similar to the whole solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> be completed, and on the parallelograms <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> as bases, and with the same height as that of <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, let the solids <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LQ</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Then since; owing to the similarity of the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FR</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">CF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FN</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EL</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">FR</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EM</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EL</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EM</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EL</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EM</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">QE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.1">VI. 1</ref>] therefore also, as the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">QE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">OE</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">QL</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">QE</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">QL</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">KP</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] therefore also, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EO</hi> to <hi rend="ital">QL</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">QL</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, if four magnitudes be continuously proportional, the first has to the fourth the ratio triplicate of that which it has to the second; [<ref target="elem.5.def.10">V. Def. 10</ref>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">KP</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, so is the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">GK</hi>, and the straight line <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> [<ref target="elem.6.1">VI. 1</ref>]; <pb n="V3_344"/>hence the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has also to <hi rend="ital">KP</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">AE</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the solid <hi rend="ital">KP</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, and the straight line <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> has also to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side of it, <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, has to the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>. </p>

       <p>From this it is manifest that, if four straight lines be &lt;continuously&gt; proportional, as the first is to the fourth, so will a parallelepipedal solid on the first be to the similar and similarly described parallelepipedal solid on the second, inasmuch as the first has to the fourth the ratio triplicate of that which it has to the second.</p>

       <hi rend="ital">In equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those parallelepipedal solids in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be equal parallelepipedal solids; I say that in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>First, let the sides which stand up, namely <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, be at right angles to their bases; I say that, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>If now the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, while the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> will also be equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. <pb n="V3_346"/></p>
      <p>For parallelepipedal solids of the same height are to one another as the bases; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] and, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so will <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> be to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and it is manifest that in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p>Next, let the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> not be equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, but let <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> be greater. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>Now the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is also greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let then <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and let the parallelepipedal solid <hi rend="ital">VC</hi> be completed on <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi> as base and with <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> as height. </p>
      <p>Now, since the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> is outside them, while equals have to the same the same ratio, [<ref target="elem.5.7">V. 7</ref>] therefore, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, for the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> are of equal height; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] and, as the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">MQ</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">TQ</hi> [<ref target="elem.11.25">XI. 25</ref>] and <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> [<ref target="elem.6.1">VI. 1</ref>]; therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>; therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. <pb n="V3_347"/></p>
      <p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so let the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; I say that the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the sides which stand up be again at right angles to the bases. </p>
      <p>Now, if the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, and, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, therefore the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also equal to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<ref target="elem.11.31">XI. 31</ref>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, let the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> not be equal to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, but let <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> be greater; therefore the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is also greater than the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, that is, <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">CT</hi> be again made equal to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, and let the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> be similarly completed. </p>
      <p>Since, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>, therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, for the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> are of equal height; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] and, as <hi rend="ital">CM</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CT</hi>, so is the base <hi rend="ital">MQ</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">QT</hi> [<ref target="elem.6.1">VI. 1</ref>] and the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.25">XI. 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">CV</hi>; therefore each of the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">CV</hi> the same ratio. <pb n="V3_348"/></p>
      <p>Therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.9">V. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now let the sides which stand up, <hi rend="ital">FE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ON</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RQ</hi>, not be at right angles to their bases; let perpendiculars be drawn from the points <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi> to the planes through <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, and let them meet the planes at <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, <hi rend="ital">T</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi>, <hi rend="ital">V</hi>, <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, <hi rend="ital">X</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Y</hi>, <hi rend="ital">a</hi>, and let the solids <hi rend="ital">FV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Oa</hi> be completed; I say that, in this case too, if the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> are equal, the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>Since the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> and of the same height; [<ref target="elem.11.29 elem.11.30">XI. 29, 30</ref>] and the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>, for they are again on the same base <hi rend="ital">RO</hi> and of the same height; [<hi rend="ital">id.</hi>] therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> is also equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. [Part 1.] </p>
      <p>But the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi> to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. <pb n="V3_349"/></p>
      <p>But the solids <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> and the solids <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DC</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so let the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>; I say that the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, with the same construction, since, as the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, while the base <hi rend="ital">EH</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi> to <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the solids <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> and <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">OR</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi>. [Part 1.] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">BT</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, for they are on the same base <hi rend="ital">FK</hi> and of the same height; [<ref target="elem.11.29 elem.11.30">XI. 29, 30</ref>] and the solid <hi rend="ital">DX</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>.

      <p>Since then <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, the two sides <hi rend="ital">CA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the angle <hi rend="ital">CAB</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">FDE</hi>; therefore the base <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, the triangle to the triangle, and the remaining angles to the remaining angles; [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ACB</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">DFE</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the right angle <hi rend="ital">ACK</hi> is also equal to the right angle <hi rend="ital">DFN</hi>; therefore the remaining angle <hi rend="ital">BCK</hi> is also equal to the remaining angle <hi rend="ital">EFN</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the angle <hi rend="ital">CBK</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">FEN</hi>. <pb n="V3_354"/></p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">BCK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EFN</hi> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, that adjacent to the equal angles, that is, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<ref target="elem.1.26">I. 26</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>; therefore the two sides <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">DF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>; and they contain right angles. </p>
      <p>Therefore the base <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">DN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">AH</hi> is also equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the squares on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AH</hi>, for the angle <hi rend="ital">AKH</hi> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>] and the squares on <hi rend="ital">DN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NM</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">DM</hi>, for the angle <hi rend="ital">DNM</hi> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>] therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> are equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">DN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NM</hi>; and of these the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">DN</hi>; therefore the remaining square on <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">NM</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">HA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">MD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DN</hi> respectively, and the base <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> was proved equal to the base <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">HAK</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">MDN</hi>.

    <head>BOOK XII.</head>
    <head>HISTORICAL NOTE.</head>
    <p>The predominant feature of Book XII. is the use of the <hi rend="ital">method of exhaustion</hi>, which is applied in Propositions <ref target="elem.12.2">2</ref>, <ref target="elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5">3-5</ref>, <ref target="elem.12.10 elem.12.11 elem.12.12">10, 11, 12</ref>, and (in a slightly different form) in <ref target="elem.12.16 elem.12.17 elem.12.18">Propositions 16-18</ref>. We conclude therefore that for the content of this Book Euclid was greatly indebted to Eudoxus, to whom the discovery of the method of exhaustion is attributed. The evidence for this attribution comes mainly from Archimedes. (1) In the preface to <title>On the Sphere and Cylinder</title> I., after stating the main results obtained by himself regarding the surface of a sphere or a segment thereof, and the volume and surface of a right cylinder with height equal to its diameter as compared with those of a sphere with the same diameter, Archimedes adds: <quote>Having now discovered that the properties mentioned are true of these figures, I cannot feel any hesitation in setting them side by side both with my former investigations and <hi rend="ital">with those of the theorems of Eudoxus on solids</hi> which are held to be most irrefragably established, namely that <hi rend="ital">any pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height</hi> [i.e. Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7">XII. 7</ref>], and that <hi rend="ital">any cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height</hi> [i.e. Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.10">XII. 10</ref>]. For, though these properties also were naturally inherent in the figures all along, yet they were in fact unknown to all the many able geometers who lived before Eudoxus and had not been observed by any one.</quote>
 (2) In the preface to the treatise known as the <title>Quadrature of the Parabola</title> Archimedes states the <quote>lemma</quote>
 assumed by him and known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 (see note on <ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref> above) and proceeds: <quote>Earlier geometers (<foreign lang="greek">oi( pro/teron gewme/trai</foreign>) have also used this lemma; for it is by the use of this same lemma that they have shown that <hi rend="ital">circles are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their diameters</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.2">XII. 2</ref>], and that <hi rend="ital">spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their diameters</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.18">XII. 18</ref>], and further that <hi rend="ital">every pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7">XII. 7</ref>]; also, that <hi rend="ital">every cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height</hi> [Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.10">XII. 10</ref>] they proved by assuming <hi rend="ital">a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid</hi>.</quote>
 Thus in the first passage two theorems of Eucl. XII. are definitely attributed to Eudoxus; and, when Archimedes says, in the second passage, that <quote>earlier geometers</quote>
 proved these two theorems by means of the lemma known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 and of a lemma similar to it respectively, we can hardly suppose him to be alluding to <pb n="V3_366"/>any other proof than that given by Eudoxus. As a matter of fact, the lemma used by Euclid to prove both propositions (<ref target="elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5">XII. 3-5</ref> and <ref target="elem.12.7">7</ref>, and <ref target="elem.12.10">XII. 10</ref>) is the theorem of Eucl. <ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref>. As regards the connexion between the two <quote>lemmas</quote>
 see note on <ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref>. </p>
    <p>We are not, however, to suppose that none of the <hi rend="ital">results</hi> obtained by the method of exhaustion had been discovered before the time of Eudoxus (fl. about 368-5 B.C.). Two at least are of earlier date, those of <ref target="elem.12.2">Eucl. XII. 2</ref> and <ref target="elem.12.7">XII. 7</ref>. </p>
    <p>(<hi rend="ital">a</hi>) Simplicius (<title>Comment. in Aristot. Phys.</title> p. 61, ed. Diels) quotes Eudemus as saying, in his <title>History of Geometry</title>, that Hippocrates of Chios (fl. say 430 B.C.) first laid it down (<foreign lang="greek">e)/qeto</foreign>) that similar segments of circles are in the ratio of the squares on their bases and that he proved this (<foreign lang="greek">e)dei/knuen</foreign>) by proving (<foreign lang="greek">e)k tou= dei=cai</foreign>) that the squares on the diameters have the same ratio as the (whole) circles. We know nothing of the method by which Hippocrates proved this proposition; but, having regard to the evidence from Archimedes quoted above, it is not permissible to suppose that the method was the fully developed <hi rend="ital">method of exhaustion</hi> as we know it. </p>
    <p>(<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) As regards the two theorems about the volume of a pyramid and of a cone respectively, which Eudoxus was the first to prove, we now have authentic evidence in the short treatise by Archimedes discovered by Heiberg in a MS. at Constantinople in 1906 and published in <title>Hermes</title> the following year (see now <title>Archimedis opera omnia</title>, ed. Heiberg, 2. ed., Vol. II., 1913, pp. 425-507; T. L. Heath, <title>The Method of Archimedes</title>, Cambridge, 1912). The said treatise, complete in all essentials, bears the title <foreign lang="greek">*)arximh/dous peri\ tw=n mhxanikw=n qewrhma/twn pro\s *)eratosqe/nhn e)/fodos</foreign>. This <quote>Method</quote>

), addressed to Eratosthenes, is none other than the <foreign lang="greek">e)fo/dion</foreign> on which, according to Suidas, Theodosius wrote a commentary, and which is several times cited by Heron in his <title>Metrica</title>; its discovery adds a new and important chapter to the history of the integral calculus. In the preface to this work Archimedes alludes to the theorems which he first discovered by means of mechanical considerations, but proved afterwards by geometry, because the investigation by means of mechanics did not constitute a rigid proof; he observes, however, that the mechanical method is of great use for the <hi rend="ital">discovery</hi> of theorems, and it is much easier to provide the rigid proof when the fact to be proved has once been discovered than it would be if nothing were known to begin with. He goes on: <quote>Hence too, in the case of those theorems the proof of which was first discovered by Eudoxus, namely those relating to the cone and the pyramid, that the cone is one third part of the cylinder, and the pyramid one third part of the prism, having the same base and equal height, no small part of the credit will naturally be assigned to Democritus, who was the first to make the statement (of the fact) regarding the said figure [i.e. property], though without proving it.</quote>
 Hence the <hi rend="ital">discovery</hi> of the two theorems must now be attributed to Democritus (fl. towards the end of 5th cent. B.C.). The words <quote>without proving it</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">xwri\s a)podei/cews</foreign>) do not mean that Democritus gave no sort of proof, but only that he did not give a proof on the rigorous lines required later; for the same words are used by Archimedes of his own investigations by means of mechanics, which, however, do constitute a reasoned argument. The character of Archimedes' mechanical arguments combined with a passage of Plutarch about a particular question in infinitesimals said to have been raised by Democritus may perhaps give a clue to the line of Democritus' argument as regards the pyramid. The essential <pb n="V3_367"/>feature of Archimedes' mechanical arguments in this tract is that he regards an area as the sum of an infinite number of <hi rend="ital">siraight lines</hi> parallel to one another and terminated by the boundary or boundaries of the closed figure the area of which is to be found, and a volume as the sum of an infinite number of <hi rend="ital">plane sections</hi> parallel to one another: which is of course the same thing as taking (as we do in the integral calculus) the sum of an infinite number of strips of breadth <hi rend="ital">dx</hi> (say), when <hi rend="ital">dx</hi> becomes indefinitely small, or the sum of an infinite number of parallel laminae of depth <hi rend="ital">dz</hi> (say), when <hi rend="ital">dz</hi> becomes indefinitely small. To give only one instance, we may take the case of the area of a segment of a parabola cut off by a chord. </p>
    <p>Let <hi rend="ital">CBA</hi> be the parabolic segment, <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> the tangent at <hi rend="ital">C</hi> meeting the <figure/> diameter <hi rend="ital">EBD</hi> through the middle point of the chord <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> in <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so that <hi rend="center">.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>Draw <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">ED</hi> meeting <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> produced in <hi rend="ital">F</hi>. Produce <hi rend="ital">CB</hi> to <hi rend="ital">H</hi> so that , where <hi rend="ital">K</hi> is the point in which <hi rend="ital">CH</hi> meets <hi rend="ital">AF</hi>; and suppose <hi rend="ital">CH</hi> to be a lever. </p>
    <p>Let any diameter <hi rend="ital">MNPO</hi> be drawn meeting the curve in <hi rend="ital">P</hi> and <hi rend="ital">CF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CA</hi> in <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi> respectively. </p>
    <p>Archimedes then observes that <hi rend="center"/> (<quote>for this is proved in a lemma</quote>
), whence <hi rend="center">,</hi> so that, if a straight line <hi rend="ital">TG</hi> equal to <hi rend="ital">PO</hi> be placed with its middle point at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, the straight line <hi rend="ital">MO</hi> with centre of gravity at <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, and the straight line <hi rend="ital">TG</hi> with centre of gravity at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, will balance about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>. </p>
    <p>Taking all other parts of diameters like <hi rend="ital">PO</hi> intercepted between the curve and <hi rend="ital">CA</hi>, and placing equal straight lines with their centres of gravity at <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, these straight lines collected at <hi rend="ital">H</hi> will balance (about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>) all the lines like <hi rend="ital">MO</hi> parallel to <hi rend="ital">FA</hi> intercepted within the triangle <hi rend="ital">CFA</hi> in the positions in which they severally lie in the figure. </p>
    <p>Hence Archimedes infers that an area equal to that of the parabolic segment hung at <hi rend="ital">H</hi> will balance (about <hi rend="ital">K</hi>) the triangle <hi rend="ital">CFA</hi> hung at its centre of gravity, the point <hi rend="ital">X</hi> (a point on <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> such that ), and therefore that <hi rend="center"> ,</hi>
     <pb n="V3_368"/>from which it follows that <hi rend="center">.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>The same sort of argument is used for solids, <hi rend="ital">plane sections</hi> taking the place of <hi rend="ital">straight lines</hi>. </p>
    <p>Archimedes is careful to state once more that this method of argument does not constitute a <hi rend="ital">proof</hi>. Thus, at the end of the above proposition about the parabolic segment, he adds: <quote>This property is of course not proved by what has just been said; but it has furnished a sort of <hi rend="ital">indication</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">e)/mfasi/n tina</foreign>) that the conclusion is true.</quote>
 </p>
    <p>Let us now turn to the passage of Plutarch (<title>De Comm. Not. adv. Stoicos</title> XXXIX 3) about Democritus above referred to. Plutarch speaks of Democritus as having raised the question in natural philosophy (<foreign lang="greek">fusikw=s</foreign>): <quote>if a cone were cut by a plane parallel to the base [by which is clearly meant a plane indefinitely near to the base], what must we think of the surfaces of the sections, that they are equal or unequal? For, if they are unequal, they will make the cone irregular, as having many indentations, like steps, and unevennesses; but, if they are equal, the sections will be equal, and the cone will appear to have the property of the cylinder and to be made up of equal, not unequal circles, which is very absurd.</quote>
 The phrase <quote><hi rend="ital">made up</hi> of equal...circles</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">e)c i)/swn sugkei/menos...ku/klwn</foreign>) shows that Democritus already had the idea of a solid being the sum of an infinite number of parallel planes, or indefinitely thin laminae, indefinitely near together: a most important anticipation of the same thought which led to such fruitful results in Archimedes. If then one may hazard a conjecture as to Democritus' argument with regard to a pyramid, it seems probable that he would notice that, if two pyramids of the same height and equal triangular bases are respectively cut by planes parallel to the base and dividing the heights in the same ratio, the corresponding sections of the two pyramids are equal, whence he would infer that the pyramids are equal as being the sum of the same infinite number of equal plane sections or indefinitely thin laminae. (This would be a particular anticipation of Cavalieri's proposition that the areal or solid contents of two figures are equal if two sections of them taken at the same height, whatever the height may be, always give equal straight lines or equal surfaces respectively.) And Democritus would of course see that the three pyramids into which a prism on the same base and of equal height with the original pyramid is divided (as in Eucl. <ref target="elem.12.7">XII. 7</ref>) satisfy this test of equality, so that the pyramid would be one third part of the prism. The extension to a pyramid with a polygonal base would be easy. And Democritus may have stated the proposition for the cone (of course without an absolute proof) as a natural inference from the result of increasing indefinitely the number of sides in a regular polygon forming the base of a pyramid.<pb n="V3_369"/></p>

      <p>Now, since the polygon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> is similar to the polygon <hi rend="ital">FGHKL</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>.

      <p>Thus <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi> are two triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <hi rend="ital">BAE</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">GFL</hi>, and the sides about the equal angles proportional; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABE</hi> is equiangular with the triangle <hi rend="ital">FGL</hi>.

       <hi rend="ital">Circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be circles, and <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> their diameters; I say that, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For, if the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is not to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, then, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so will the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> be either to some less area than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, or to a greater. </p>
      <p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; then the inscribed square is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, inasmuch as, if through the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> we draw tangents to the circle, the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is half the square circumscribed about the circle, and the circle is less than the circumscribed square; hence the inscribed square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi> be joined; therefore each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> is also greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it, inasmuch as, if through the points <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi> we draw tangents to the circle and complete the parallelograms on the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi>, each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <pb n="V3_372"/><hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> will be half of the parallelogram about it, while the segment about it is less than the parallelogram; hence each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FLG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GMH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HNE</hi> is greater than the half of the segment of the circle about it. </p>
      <p>Thus, by bisecting the remaining circumferences and joining straight lines, and by doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the circle which will be less than the excess by which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> exceeds the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>For it was proved in the first theorem of the tenth book that, if two unequal magnitudes be set out, and if from the greater there be subtracted a magnitude greater than the half, and from that which is left a greater than the half, and if this be done continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the lesser magnitude set out. </p>
      <p>Let segments be left such as described, and let the segments of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> on <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi> be less than the excess by which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> exceeds the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the remainder, the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>, is greater than the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let there be inscribed, also, in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> similar to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>; therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.1">XII. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so also is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>; therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">AOBPCQDR</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>; [<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the polygon inscribed in it, so is the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is greater than the polygon inscribed in it; therefore the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> is also greater than the polygon <hi rend="ital">EKFLGMHN</hi>. <pb n="V3_373"/></p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is not the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area greater than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater area <hi rend="ital">S</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, inversely, as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, so is the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the area <hi rend="ital">S</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to some area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; therefore also, as the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> to some area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>: [<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is not the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to any area greater than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to any area less than the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; therefore, as the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>

      <p>And, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HG</hi> are equal to the two <hi rend="ital">KD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DL</hi> respectively, and the angle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>, therefore the base <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.4">I. 4</ref>] therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi> is equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">KDL</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is also equal and similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal and similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> has been drawn parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, one of the sides of the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi>, <pb n="V3_380"/>the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is equiangular to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>, [<ref target="elem.1.29">I. 29</ref>] and they have their sides proportional; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADB</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DHK</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">DBC</hi> is also similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DKL</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">ADC</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DLH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> meeting one another are parallel to the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> meeting one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<ref target="elem.11.10">XI. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">BAC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">KHL</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> to <hi rend="ital">HL</hi>; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the pyramids <hi rend="ital">AEGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKLD</hi> is similar to the whole pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, since <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is double of the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are equal, [<ref target="elem.11.39">XI. 39</ref>] therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">BKF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHG</hi>, and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EBKH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi> is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> and the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">KFCL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LCGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKFG</hi>. </p>
      <p>And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is its opposite, and that in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, is greater than each of the pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices, <pb n="V3_381"/>inasmuch as, if we join the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">K</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex; for they are contained by equal and similar planes. </p>
      <p>Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>But the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EBFG</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> its opposite is equal to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">GFC</hi> is the base and the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> its opposite, and the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said two pyramids of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HKL</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertices. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex, has been divided into two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.

      <p>Let there be two pyramids of the same height which have the triangular bases <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, and vertices the points <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and let each of them be divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; [<ref target="elem.12.3">XII. 3</ref>] I say that, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are all the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, <pb n="V3_383"/></p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">BO</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">OC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to <hi rend="ital">LC</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">LO</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, and the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is also similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">CO</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> of <hi rend="ital">FV</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">CO</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FV</hi>. </p>
      <p>And on <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CO</hi> are described the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, and on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FV</hi> the similar and similarly situated figures <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>; therefore, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, so is the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.22">VI. 22</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite; [Lemma following] therefore also, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite. </p>
      <p>But, as the said prisms are to one another, so is the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KBOL</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">PM</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">QEVR</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">ST</hi> its opposite. [<ref target="elem.11.39">XI. 39</ref>; cf. <ref target="elem.12.3">XII. 3</ref>] <pb n="V3_384"/></p>
      <p>Therefore also the two prisms, that in which the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">KBOL</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PM</hi> its opposite, and that in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite, are to the prisms in which <hi rend="ital">QEVR</hi> is the base and the straight line <hi rend="ital">ST</hi> its opposite and in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite in the same ratio [<ref target="elem.5.12">V. 12</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the said two prisms to the said two prisms. </p>
      <p>And similarly, if the pyramids <hi rend="ital">PMNG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi> be divided into two prisms and two pyramids, as the base <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">STU</hi>, so will the two prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">PMNG</hi> be to the two prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi>. </p>

      <p>Therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the four prisms to the four prisms. </p>
      <p>And similarly also, if we divide the remaining pyramids into two pyramids and into two prisms, then, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so will all the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> be to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. Q. E. D.</p>
      <div4 id="elem.12.4.l.1" type="lemma" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
       <head>LEMMA.</head>
       <p>But that, as the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>, so is the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> its opposite, we must prove as follows. </p>
       <p>For in the same figure let perpendiculars be conceived drawn from <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; these are of course equal because, by hypothesis, the pyramids are of equal height. </p>
       <p>Now, since the two straight lines <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> and the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are cut by the parallel planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, they will be cut in the same ratios. [<ref target="elem.11.17">XI. 17</ref>] <pb n="V3_385"/></p>
       <p>And <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> is bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi> at <hi rend="ital">N</hi>; therefore the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">G</hi> to the plane <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> will also be bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>. </p>
       <p>For the same reason the perpendicular from <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the plane <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> will also be bisected by the plane <hi rend="ital">STU</hi>. </p>
       <p>And the perpendiculars from <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> are equal; therefore the perpendiculars from the triangles <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> to the planes <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> are also equal. </p>
       <p>Therefore the prisms in which the triangles <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi> are bases, and <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STU</hi> their opposites, are of equal height. </p>
       <p>Hence also the parallelepipedal solids described from the said prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their bases; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] therefore their halves, namely the said prisms, are to one another as the base <hi rend="ital">LOC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">RVF</hi>.

       <hi rend="ital">Pyramids which are of the same height and have triangular bases are to one another as the bases.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Let there be pyramids of the same height, of which the triangles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertices; I say that, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For, if the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is not to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, then, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so will the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> be either to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> or to a greater. </p>
      <p>Let it, first, be in that ratio to a less solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, and let the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> be divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; then the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. [<ref target="elem.12.3">XII. 3</ref>] <pb n="V3_387"/></p>
      <p>Again, let the pyramids arising from the division be similarly divided, and let this be done continually until there are left over from the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> some pyramids which are less than the excess by which the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let such be left, and let them be, for the sake of argument, <hi rend="ital">DQRS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">STUH</hi>; therefore the remainders, the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, are greater than the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> also be divided similarly, and a similar number of times, with the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. [<ref target="elem.12.4">XII. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so also is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>; therefore also, as the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>; [<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is to the prisms in it, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> to the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is greater than the prisms in it; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> is also greater than the prisms in the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is not to any solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that neither is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to any solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to any solid greater than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi>; therefore, inversely, as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>. <pb n="V3_388"/></p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">W</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, as was before proved; [<ref target="elem.12.2.l.1">XII. 2, Lemma</ref>] therefore also, as the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to some solid less than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>: [<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] which was proved absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is not to any solid greater than the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to a less solid. </p>

      <p>Let there be a prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> its opposite; I say that the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Since <hi rend="ital">ABED</hi> is a parallelogram, and <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBD</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.34">I. 34</ref>] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex.

      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">DEB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">EBC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">FCBE</hi> is a parallelogram, and <hi rend="ital">CE</hi> is its diameter, the triangle <hi rend="ital">CEF</hi> is equal to the triangle <hi rend="ital">CBE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.34">I. 34</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BCE</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ECF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.12.5">XII. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BCE</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex; <pb n="V3_395"/>therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">CEF</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex; therefore the prism <hi rend="ital">ABCDEF</hi> has been divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases. </p>
      <p>And, since the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">CAB</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">D</hi> the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> as its opposite. </p>

      <p>Let there be similar and similarly situated pyramids of <pb n="V3_396"/>which the triangles <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, are the bases and the points <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> the vertices; I say that the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> has to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For let the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Now, since the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is similar to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">GBC</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">HEF</hi>, and the angle <hi rend="ital">ABG</hi> to the angle <hi rend="ital">DEH</hi>; and, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And since, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, and the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is similar to the parallelogram <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">BN</hi> is also similar to <hi rend="ital">ER</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>; therefore the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">MB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BN</hi> are similar to the three <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ER</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the three parallelograms <hi rend="ital">MB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BN</hi> are equal and similar to their three opposites, and the three <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ER</hi> are equal and similar to their three opposites. [<ref target="elem.11.24">XI. 24</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the solids <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> are contained by similar planes equal in multitude. </p>
      <p>Therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> is similar to the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But similar parallelepipedal solids are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [<ref target="elem.11.33">XI. 33</ref>] <pb n="V3_397"/></p>
      <p>Therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> has to the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi>, so is the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, inasmuch as the pyramid is a sixth part of the solid, because the prism which is half of the parallelepipedal solid [<ref target="elem.11.28">XI. 28</ref>] is also triple of the pyramid. [<ref target="elem.12.7">XII. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> also has to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. Q. E. D. </p>

       <p>From this it is manifest that similar pyramids which have polygonal bases are also to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. </p>
       <p>For, if they are divided into the pyramids contained in them which have triangular bases, by virtue of the fact that the similar polygons forming their bases are also divided into similar triangles equal in multitude and corresponding to the wholes [<ref target="elem.6.20">VI. 20</ref>], then, as the one pyramid which has a triangular base in the one complete pyramid is to the one pyramid which has a triangular base in the other complete pyramid, so also will all the pyramids which have triangular bases contained in the one pyramid be to all the pyramids which have triangular bases contained in the other pyramid [<ref target="elem.5.12">V. 12</ref>], that is, the pyramid itself which has a polygonal base to the pyramid which has a polygonal base. </p>
       <p>But the pyramid which has a triangular base is to the pyramid which has a triangular base in the triplicate ratio of the corresponding sides; therefore also the pyramid which has a polygonal base has to the pyramid which has a similar base the ratio triplicate of that which the side has to the side.</p>

      <p>For let there be equal pyramids which have the triangular bases <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> and vertices the points <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>; I say that in the pyramids <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For let the parallelepipedal solids <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> be completed. </p>
      <p>Now, since the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is equal to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, and the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> is six times the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, and the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> six times the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> is equal to the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But in equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; [<ref target="elem.11.34">XI. 34</ref>] therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, so is the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> to the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>. </p>

      <p>But the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> is the same with the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi>, and the height of the solid <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi> is the same with the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>, so is the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> to the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore in the pyramids <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>

      <p>But the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">DEFH</hi> is the same with the height of the parallelepiped <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi>, and the height of the pyramid <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is the same with the height of the parallelepiped <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>; therefore, as the base <hi rend="ital">BM</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, so is the height of the parallelepiped <hi rend="ital">EHQP</hi> to the height of the parallelepiped <hi rend="ital">BGML</hi>. </p>

       <hi rend="ital">Any cone is a third part of the cylinder which has the same base with it and equal height.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For let a cone have the same base, namely the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, with a cylinder and equal height; I say that the cone is a third part of the cylinder, that is, that the cylinder is triple of the cone. </p>
      <p>For if the cylinder is not triple of the cone, the cylinder will be either greater than triple or less than triple of the cone. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>First let it be greater than triple, and let the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; [<ref target="elem.4.6">IV. 6</ref>] then the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>From the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> let there be set up a prism of equal height with the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Then the prism so set up is greater than the half of the cylinder, <pb n="V3_401"/>inasmuch as, if we also circumscribe a square about the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> [<ref target="elem.4.7">IV. 7</ref>], the square inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is half of that circumscribed about it, and the solids set up from them are parallelepipedal prisms of equal height, while parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are to one another as their bases; [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] therefore also the prism set up on the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is half of the prism set up from the square circumscribed about the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; [cf. <ref target="elem.11.28">XI. 28</ref>, or <ref target="elem.12.6 elem.12.7.p.1">XII. 6 and 7, Por.</ref>] and the cylinder is less than the prism set up from the square circumscribed about the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; therefore the prism set up from the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> and of equal height with the cylinder is greater than the half of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HA</hi> be joined; then each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> is greater than the half of that segment of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> which is about it, as we proved before. [<ref target="elem.12.2">XII. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>On each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> let prisms be set up of equal height with the cylinder; then each of the prisms so set up is greater than the half part of that segment of the cylinder which is about it, inasmuch as, if we draw through the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi> parallels to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>, complete the parallelograms on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi>, and set up from them parallelepipedal solids of equal height with the cylinder, the prisms on the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> are halves of the several solids set up; and the segments of the cylinder are less than the parallelepipedal solids set up; hence also the prisms on the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> are greater than the half of the segments of the cylinder about them. </p>
      <p>Thus, bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining <pb n="V3_402"/>straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles prisms of equal height with the cylinder, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cylinder which will be less than the excess by which the cylinder exceeds the triple of the cone. [<ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let such segments be left, and let them be <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HA</hi>; therefore the remainder, the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height is the same as that of the cylinder, is greater than triple of the cone. </p>
      <p>But the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height the same as that of the cylinder is triple of the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone; [<ref target="elem.12.7.p.1">XII. 7, Por.</ref>] therefore also the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same as that of the cone is greater than the cone which has the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> as base. </p>
      <p>But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cylinder is not greater than triple of the cone. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the cylinder less than triple of the cone, </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let the cylinder be less than triple of the cone, therefore, inversely, the cone is greater than a third part of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>; therefore the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now let there be set up from the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> a pyramid having the same vertex with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half part of the cone, seeing that, as we proved before, if we circumscribe a square <pb n="V3_403"/>about the circle, the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> will be half of the square circumscribed about the circle, and if we set up from the squares parallelepipedal solids of equal height with the cone, which are also called prisms, the solid set up from the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> will be half of that set up from the square circumscribed about the circle; for they are to one another as their bases. [<ref target="elem.11.32">XI. 32</ref>] </p>
      <p>Hence also the thirds of them are in that ratio; therefore also the pyramid of which the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base is half of the pyramid set up from the square circumscribed about the circle. </p>
      <p>And the pyramid set up from the square about the circle is greater than the cone, for it encloses it. </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the square <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and the vertex is the same with that of the cone is greater than the half of the cone. </p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">AE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HA</hi> be joined; therefore also each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> is greater than the half part of that segment of the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> which is about it. </p>
      <p>Now, on each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">AEB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BFC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">CGD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DHA</hi> let pyramids be set up which have the same vertex as the cone; therefore also each of the pyramids so set up is, in the same manner, greater than the half part of that segment of the cone which is about it. </p>
      <p>Thus, by bisecting the circumferences that are left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles a pyramid which has the same vertex as the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the excess by which the cone exceeds the third part of the cylinder.

      <p>But the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the vertex the same with that of the cone is a third part of the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height is the same with that of the cylinder; therefore the prism of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">AEBFCGDH</hi> is the base and the height is the same with that of the cylinder is greater than the cylinder of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base. </p>
      <p>But it is also less, for it is enclosed by it: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cylinder is not less than triple of the cone. </p>

      <p>Let there be cones and cylinders of the same height, let the circles <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be their bases, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> their axes and <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> the diameters of their bases; I say that, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For, if not, then, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so will the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> be either to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> or to a greater. </p>
      <p>First, let it be in that ratio to a less solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, and let the solid <hi rend="ital">X</hi> be equal to that by which the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>; therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> is equal to the solids <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, <hi rend="ital">X</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; therefore the square is greater than the half of the circle. </p>
      <p>Let there be set up from the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> a pyramid of equal height with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half of the cone, inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a square about the circle, and set up from it a pyramid of equal height with the cone, the inscribed pyramid is half of the circumscribed pyramid, for they are to one another as their bases, [<ref target="elem.12.6">XII. 6</ref>] while the cone is less than the circumscribed pyramid. <pb n="V3_407"/></p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">HP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SH</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Therefore each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">HPE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EQF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FRG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GSH</hi> is greater than the half of that segment of the circle which is about it. </p>
      <p>On each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">HPE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EQF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FRG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GSH</hi> let there be set up a pyramid of equal height with the cone; therefore, also, each of the pyramids so set up is greater than the half of that segment of the cone which is about it. </p>
      <p>Thus, bisecting the circumferences which are left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles pyramids of equal height with the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the solid <hi rend="ital">X</hi>. [<ref target="elem.10.1">X. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let such be left, and let them be the segments on <hi rend="ital">HP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SH</hi>; therefore the remainder, the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi> is the base and the height the same with that of the cone, is greater than the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let there also be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> similar and similarly situated to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>, and on it let a pyramid be set up of equal height with the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Since then, as the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>, [<ref target="elem.12.1">XII. 1</ref>] while, as the square on <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is to the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi>, so is the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, [<ref target="elem.12.2">XII. 2</ref>] therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, and, as the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> is to the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.12.6">XII. 6</ref>] <pb n="V3_408"/></p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">DTAUBVCW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">HPEQFRGS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex; [<ref target="elem.5.11">V. 11</ref>] therefore, alternately, as the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is to the pyramid in it, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> to the pyramid in the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is greater than the pyramid in it; therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is also greater than the pyramid in the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it is also less: which is absurd. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is not to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither is the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that neither is the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to any solid greater than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>; therefore, inversely, as the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> to the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is to the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>; therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi>: which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is not to any solid greater than the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi> as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But it was proved that neither is it in this ratio to a less solid; therefore, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the cone <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> to the cone <hi rend="ital">EN</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the cylinder, for each is triple of each; [<ref target="elem.12.10">XII. 10</ref>] <pb n="V3_409"/></p>
      <p>Therefore also, as the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so are the cylinders on them which are of equal height. </p>

      </p>
      <p>For, if the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> has not to the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> will have that triplicate ratio either to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> or to a greater. </p>
      <p>First, let it have that triplicate ratio to a less solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> be inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>; [<ref target="elem.4.6">IV. 6</ref>] therefore the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is greater than the half of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now let there be set up on the square <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> a pyramid having the same vertex with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half part of the cone. <pb n="V3_411"/></p>
      <p>Let the circumferences <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HE</hi> be bisected at the points <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">EP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SE</hi> be joined. </p>

      <p>Now on each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">EPF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FQG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GRH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HSE</hi> let a pyramid be set up having the same vertex with the cone; therefore each of the pyramids so set up is also greater than the half part of that segment of the cone which is about it. </p>
      <p>Thus, bisecting the circumferences so left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles pyramids having the same vertex with the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the excess by which the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> exceeds the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>.

      <p>Let there be also inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> similar and similarly situated to the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi>, and let there be set up on the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> a pyramid having the same vertex with the cone; of the triangles containing the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex let <hi rend="ital">LBT</hi> be one, and of the triangles containing the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex let <hi rend="ital">NFP</hi> be one; and let <hi rend="ital">KT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MP</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> is similar to the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>, so is the axis <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> to the axis <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.def.24">XI. Def. 24</ref>] <pb n="V3_412"/></p>

      <p>And the sides are proportional about equal angles, namely the angles <hi rend="ital">BKL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FMN</hi>; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">BKL</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">FMN</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.6">VI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since, as <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">KT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">FM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">MP</hi>, and they are about equal angles, namely the angles <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi>, inasmuch as, whatever part the angle <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi> is of the four right angles at the centre <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, the same part also is the angle <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi> of the four right angles at the centre <hi rend="ital">M</hi>; since then the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.6">VI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>Again, since it was proved that, as <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">FM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">KT</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">FM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PM</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">TK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PM</hi> to <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>; and the sides are proportional about equal angles, namely the angles <hi rend="ital">TKL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PMN</hi>, for they are right; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">LKT</hi> is similar to the triangle <hi rend="ital">NMP</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.6">VI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>And since, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">LKB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NMF</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>, and, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FP</hi>, therefore, <hi rend="ital">ex aequali</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FP</hi>.

      <p>Again since, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPM</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TK</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PM</hi>, and, owing to the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">TKB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PMF</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">KT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">MP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PF</hi>; therefore, <hi rend="ital">ex aequali</hi>, as <hi rend="ital">LT</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">TB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22">V. 22</ref>] <pb n="V3_413"/></p>
      <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">TB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BL</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">FN</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">TL</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PN</hi> to <hi rend="ital">NF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.5.22">V. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore in the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPF</hi> the sides are proportional; therefore the triangles <hi rend="ital">LTB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NPF</hi> are equiangular; [<ref target="elem.6.5">VI. 5</ref>] hence they are also similar. [<ref target="elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. I</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">BKT</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is also similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <hi rend="ital">FMP</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex, for they are contained by similar planes equal in multitude. [<ref target="elem.11.def.9">XI. Def. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>But similar pyramids which have triangular bases are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [<ref target="elem.12.8">XII. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the pyramid <hi rend="ital">BKTL</hi> has to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">FMPN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly, by joining straight lines from <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">V</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi> to <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, and from <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, and setting up on each of the triangles pyramids which have the same vertex with the cones, we can prove that each of the similarly arranged pyramids will also have to each similarly arranged pyramid the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> has to the corresponding side <hi rend="ital">FM</hi>, that is, which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12">V. 12</ref>] therefore also, as the pyramid <hi rend="ital">BKTL</hi> is to the pyramid <hi rend="ital">FMPN</hi>, so is the whole pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the whole pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex; hence also the pyramid of which <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, by hypothesis, the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi>
       <pb n="V3_414"/>is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has also to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>; therefore, as the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is to the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex; therefore, alternately, as the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex is to the pyramid contained in it of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">ATBUCVDW</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex, so is the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> to the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex. [<ref target="elem.5.16">V. 16</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the said cone is greater than the pyramid in it; for it encloses it. </p>
      <p>Therefore the solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi> is also greater than the pyramid of which the polygon <hi rend="ital">EPFQGRHS</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex. </p>

      <p>Therefore the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is the base and <hi rend="ital">L</hi> the vertex has not to any solid less than the cone of which the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> is the base and the point <hi rend="ital">N</hi> the vertex the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>: </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that neither has the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> to any solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>

      <p>For, if possible, let it have that ratio to a greater solid <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>

      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> also has to some solid less than the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">FH</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>: which was proved impossible. <pb n="V3_415"/></p>
      <p>Therefore the cone <hi rend="ital">ABCDL</hi> has not to any solid greater than the cone <hi rend="ital">EFGHN</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>

      <p>But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the cylinder, for the cylinder which is on the same base as the cone and of equal height with it is triple of the cone; [<ref target="elem.12.10">XII. 10</ref>] therefore the cylinder also has to the cylinder the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">FH</hi>. </p>

      <p>Then, since the axes <hi rend="ital">LN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> are equal to one another, <pb n="V3_418"/>therefore the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are to one another as their bases.

      <p>But the bases are equal; therefore the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p>Since then the axes <hi rend="ital">LN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> are equal to one another, and the cylinders <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BG</hi> are also equal to one another, and the multitude of the former is equal to the multitude of the latter, therefore, whatever multiple the axis <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is of the axis <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, the same multiple also will the cylinder <hi rend="ital">QG</hi> be of the cylinder <hi rend="ital">GB</hi>. </p>

      <p>I say that in the cylinders <hi rend="ital">AO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the height <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> to the height <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>. <figure/>
      </p>
      <p>For the height <hi rend="ital">LK</hi> is either equal to the height <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> or not equal. </p>
      <p>First, let it be equal. </p>
      <p>Now the cylinder <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> is also equal to the cylinder <hi rend="ital">EP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But cones and cylinders which are of the same height are to one another as their bases; [<ref target="elem.12.11">XII. 11</ref>] therefore the base <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is also equal to the base <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>. </p>
      <p>Hence also, reciprocally, as the base <hi rend="ital">ABCD</hi> is to the base <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, so is the height <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> to the height <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>. </p>
      <p>Next, let the height <hi rend="ital">LK</hi> not be equal to <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>, but let <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> be greater; from the height <hi rend="ital">MN</hi> let <hi rend="ital">QN</hi> be cut off equal to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, through the point <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> let the cylinder <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> be cut by the plane <hi rend="ital">TUS</hi> parallel to the planes of the circles <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RP</hi>, <pb n="V3_421"/>and let the cylinder <hi rend="ital">ES</hi> be conceived erected from the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGH</hi> as base and with height <hi rend="ital">NQ</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since the cylinder <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> is equal to the cylinder <hi rend="ital">EP</hi>, therefore, as the cylinder <hi rend="ital">AO</hi> is to the cylinder <hi rend="ital">ES</hi>, so is the cylinder <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> to the cylinder <hi rend="ital">ES</hi>.

      <p>Therefore in the cylinders <hi rend="ital">AO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>

      <p>But the whole <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is also equal to the whole <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>; therefore the remainder <hi rend="ital">VA</hi> is also equal to the remainder <hi rend="ital">WA</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">VA</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">KW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WA</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.2">VI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">PV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SW</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">BCDE</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">PV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">SW</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.6">XI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it was also proved equal to it; therefore <hi rend="ital">WV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> are also equal and parallel. [<ref target="elem.1.33">I. 33</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> is also parallel to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.9">XI. 9</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KS</hi> join their extremities; therefore the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> is in one plane, inasmuch as, if two straight lines be parallel, and points be taken at random on each of them, the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallels. [<ref target="elem.11.7">XI. 7</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the quadrilaterals <hi rend="ital">SPQT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TQRU</hi> is also in one plane. </p>
      <p>But the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi> is also in one plane. [<ref target="elem.11.2">XI. 2</ref>] </p>
      <p>If then we conceive straight lines joined from the points <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">T</hi>, <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, <hi rend="ital">U</hi> to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral solid figure between the circumferences <hi rend="ital">BO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KO</hi>, consisting of pyramids of which the quadrilaterals <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SPQT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TQRU</hi> and the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi> are the bases and the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the vertex. <pb n="V3_428"/></p>
      <p>And, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the sides <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ME</hi> as in the case of <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, and further in the case of the remaining three quadrants, there will be constructed a certain polyhedral figure inscribed in the sphere and contained by pyramids, of which the said quadrilaterals and the triangle <hi rend="ital">URO</hi>, and the others corresponding to them, are the bases and the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the vertex. </p>
      <p>I say that the said polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere at the surface on which the circle <hi rend="ital">FGH</hi> is. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> be drawn from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> perpendicular to the plane of the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, and let it meet the plane at the point <hi rend="ital">X</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.11">XI. 11</ref>] let <hi rend="ital">XB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the quadrilateral <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi>, therefore it is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of the quadrilateral. [<ref target="elem.11.def.3">XI. Def. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XB</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, for the angle at <hi rend="ital">X</hi> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>] and the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. [<hi rend="ital">id</hi>.] </p>
      <p>Therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XB</hi> are equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let the square on <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, is equal to the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">BX</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the straight lines joined from <hi rend="ital">X</hi> to <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> are equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi>. <pb n="V3_429"/></p>
      <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <hi rend="ital">X</hi> and distance one of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">XB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XK</hi> will pass through <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, <hi rend="ital">S</hi> also, and <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> will be a quadrilateral in a circle. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">WV</hi>, while <hi rend="ital">WV</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>; therefore each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">SP</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">KBPS</hi> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KS</hi> are equal, and <hi rend="ital">PS</hi> less, and <hi rend="ital">BX</hi> is the radius of the circle, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> be drawn from <hi rend="ital">K</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="ital">BV</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is less than double of <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, so is the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> to the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi>, if a square be described upon <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> and the parallelogram on <hi rend="ital">ZD</hi> be completed, then the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> is also less than double of the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, if <hi rend="ital">KD</hi> be joined, the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BZ</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>, and the rectangle <hi rend="ital">DZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZB</hi> equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>; [<ref target="elem.3.31">III. 31</ref>, <ref target="elem.6.8 elem.6.8.p.1">VI. 8 and Por.</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is less than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">KB</hi> is greater than double of the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the squares on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XA</hi> are equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, and the squares on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi> equal to the square on <hi rend="ital">KA</hi>; [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>] therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XA</hi> are equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi>, <pb n="V3_430"/>and of these the square on <hi rend="ital">KZ</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">BX</hi>; therefore the remainder, the square on <hi rend="ital">ZA</hi>, is less than the square on <hi rend="ital">XA</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">AZ</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is much greater than <hi rend="ital">AG</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AX</hi> is the perpendicular on one base of the polyhedron, and <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> on the surface of the lesser sphere; hence the polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on its surface. </p>
      <p>Therefore, given two spheres about the same centre, a polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater sphere which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. Q. E. F. </p>

       <p>For, the solids being divided into their pyramids similar in multitude and arrangement, the pyramids will be similar. </p>

      <p>First, let it have that ratio to a less sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> be conceived about the same centre with <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi>, let there be inscribed in the greater sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere <hi rend="ital">GHK</hi> at its surface, [<ref target="elem.12.17">XII. 17</ref>] <pb n="V3_435"/>and let there also be inscribed in the sphere <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> a polyhedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in the sphere <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi>; therefore the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> has to the polyhedral solid in <hi rend="ital">DEF</hi> the ratio triplicate of that which <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> has to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>.

    <head>HISTORICAL NOTE.</head>
    <p>I have already given, in the note to <ref target="elem.4.10">IV. 10</ref>, the evidence upon which the construction of the five regular solids is attributed to the Pythagoreans. Some of them, the cube, the tetrahedron (which is nothing but a pyramid), and the octahedron (which is only a double pyramid with a square base), cannot but have been known to the Egyptians. And it appears that dodecahedra have been found, of bronze or other material, which may belong to periods earlier than Pythagoras' time by some centuries (for references see Cantor's <title>Geschichte der Mathematik</title> I_{3}, pp. 175-6). </p>
    <p>It is true that the author of the scholium No. I to Eucl. XIII. says that the Book is about <quote>the five so-called Platonic figures, which however do not belong to Plato, three of the aforesaid five figures being due to the Pythagoreans, namely the cube, the pyramid and the dodecahedron, while the octahedron and the icosahedron are due to Theaetetus.</quote>
 This statement (taken probably from Geminus) may perhaps rest on the fact that Theaetetus was the first to write at any length about the two last-mentioned solids. We are told indeed by Suidas (S. V. <foreign lang="greek">*qeai/thtos</foreign>) that Theaetetus <quote>first wrote on the ’five solids’ as they are called.</quote>
 This no doubt means that Theaetetus was the first to write a complete and systematic treatise on all the regular solids; it does not exclude the possibility that Hippasus or others had already written on the dodecahedron. The fact that Theaetetus wrote upon the regular solids agrees very well with the evidence which we possess of his contributions to the theory of irrationals, the connexion between which and the investigation of the regular solids is seen in Euclid's Book XIII. </p>
    <p>Theaetetus flourished about 380 B.C., and his work on the regular solids was soon followed by another, that of Aristaeus, an elder contemporary of Euclid, who also wrote an important book on <title>Solid Loci</title>, i.e. on conics treated as loci. This Aristaeus (known as <quote>the elder</quote>
) wrote in the period about 320 B.C. We hear of his <title>Comparison of the five regular solids</title> from Hypsicles (2nd cent. B.C.), the writer of the short book commonly included in the editions of the <title>Elements</title> as Book XIV. Hypsicles gives in this Book some six propositions supplementing Eucl. XIII.; and he introduces the second of the propositions (Heiberg's Euclid, Vol. v. p. 6) as follows: </p>
    <p><quote><hi rend="ital">The same circle circumscribes both the pentagon of the dodecahedron and the triangle of the icosahedron when both are inscribed in the same sphere</hi>. This is proved by Aristaeus in the book entitled <title>Comparison of the five figures</title>.</quote>
 <pb n="V3_439"/></p>
    <p>Hypsicles proceeds (pp. 7 sqq.) to give a proof of this theorem. Allman pointed out (<title>Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid</title>, 1889, pp. 201-2) that this proof depends on eight theorems, six of which appear in Euclid's Book XIII. (in Propositions <ref target="elem.13.8">8</ref>, <ref target="elem.13.10">10</ref>, <ref target="elem.13.12">12</ref>, <ref target="elem.13.15 elem.13.16 elem.13.17">15, 16 with Por., 17</ref>); two other propositions not mentioned by Allman are also used, namely <ref target="elem.13.4 elem.13.9">XIII. 4 and 9</ref>. This seems, as Allman says, to confirm the inference of Bretschneider (p. 171) that, as Aristaeus' work was the newest and latest in which, before Euclid's time, this subject was treated, we have in Eucl. XIII. at least a partial recapitulation of the contents of the treatise of Aristaeus. </p>
    <p>After Euclid, Apollonius wrote on the comparison of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron inscribed in one and the same sphere. This we also learn from Hypsicles, who says in the next words following those about Aristaeus above quoted: <quote>But it is proved by Apollonius in the second edition of his <title>Comparison of the dodecahedron with the icosahedron</title> that, as the surface of the dodecahedron is to the surface of the icosahedron [inscribed in the same sphere], so is the dodecahedron itself [i.e. its volume] to the icosahedron, because the perpendicular is the same from the centre of the sphere to the pentagon of the dodecahedron and to the triangle of the icosahedron.</quote>

      <p>I say that the square on the side of the pentagon <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> is equal to the squares on the side of the hexagon and on that of the decagon inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi>. </p>

      <p>Since the circumference <hi rend="ital">ABCG</hi> is equal to the circumference <hi rend="ital">AEDG</hi>, and in them <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AED</hi>, therefore the remainder, the circumference <hi rend="ital">CG</hi>, is equal to the remainder <hi rend="ital">GD</hi>. <figure/>

      <p>But <hi rend="ital">CD</hi> belongs to a pentagon; therefore <hi rend="ital">CG</hi> belongs to a decagon. </p>

      <p>Hence the circumference <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">KB</hi>; [<ref target="elem.3.26">III. 26</ref>] therefore the circumference <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is double of the circumference <hi rend="ital">BK</hi>; therefore the straight line <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> is a side of a decagon. </p>

      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">MK</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> has not to the square on <hi rend="ital">KM</hi> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <hi rend="ital">BK</hi> is incommensurable in length with <hi rend="ital">KM</hi>.

      </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFG</hi>, therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFG</hi>.

      <p>But <hi rend="ital">DA</hi> was proved equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KG</hi>; therefore each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GE</hi> is also equal to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">KE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KG</hi>; therefore the four triangles <hi rend="ital">EFG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KEF</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KFG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KEG</hi> are equilateral. </p>

      <p>If then, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through the points <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, since, if <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LG</hi> be joined, the angles at <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> similarly become right angles; and the pyramid will be comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
      <p>For <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, the diameter of the sphere, is equal to the diameter <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> of the given sphere, inasmuch as <hi rend="ital">KH</hi> was made equal to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">HL</hi> to <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>. </p>

      <p>And <hi rend="ital">BA</hi> is the diameter of the given sphere, and <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is equal to the side of the pyramid. </p>

      </p>
      <p>It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">KG</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then, since the angle <hi rend="ital">KEG</hi> is right, because <hi rend="ital">KE</hi> is also at right angles to the plane <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> and of course to the straight line <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> also, [<ref target="elem.11.def.3">XI.

      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">FL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> is also at right angles to the plane <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>; hence also, if we join <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> will be at right angles to <hi rend="ital">FK</hi>; <pb n="V3_479"/>and for this reason again the semicircle described on <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> will also pass through <hi rend="ital">F</hi>. </p>

      <p>If then, <hi rend="ital">KG</hi> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, the cube will be comprehended in a sphere. </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">GF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">FE</hi>, and the angle at <hi rend="ital">F</hi> is right, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> is double of the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">EG</hi> is double of the square on <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>; hence the squares on <hi rend="ital">GE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>, that is the square on <hi rend="ital">GK</hi> [<ref target="elem.1.47">I. 47</ref>], is triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is triple of <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, while, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>

      <p>Therefore the pentagon <hi rend="ital">LMNOP</hi> is also equilateral, and the straight line <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> belongs to a decagon. </p>
      <p>Now from the points <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi> let the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">GS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KU</hi> be set up at right angles to the plane of the circle, and let them be equal to the radius of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ST</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PQ</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KU</hi> is at right angles to the same plane, therefore <hi rend="ital">EQ</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">KU</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.6">XI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But it is also equal to it; and the straight lines joining those extremities of equal and parallel straight lines which are in the same direction are equal and parallel. [<ref target="elem.1.33">I. 33</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">QU</hi> is equal and parallel to <hi rend="ital">EK</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EK</hi> belongs to an equilateral pentagon; therefore <hi rend="ital">QU</hi> also belongs to the equilateral pentagon inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ST</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TU</hi> also belongs to the equilateral pentagon inscribed in the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi>; therefore the pentagon <hi rend="ital">QRSTU</hi> is equilateral. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">QE</hi> belongs to a hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">EP</hi> to a decagon, and the angle <hi rend="ital">QEP</hi> is right, therefore <hi rend="ital">QP</hi> belongs to a pentagon; for the square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the square on the side of the hexagon and the square on the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle. [<ref target="elem.13.10">XIII. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">PU</hi> is also a side of a pentagon. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">QU</hi> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">QPU</hi> is equilateral. </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">QLR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RMS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SNT</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TOU</hi> is also equilateral. <pb n="V3_483"/></p>
      <p>And, since each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">QL</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QP</hi> was proved to belong to a pentagon, and <hi rend="ital">LP</hi> also belongs to a pentagon, therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">QLP</hi> is equilateral. </p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the triangles <hi rend="ital">LRM</hi>, <hi rend="ital">MSN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NTO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OUP</hi> is also equilateral. </p>
      <p>Let the centre of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi> the point <hi rend="ital">V</hi>, be taken; from <hi rend="ital">V</hi> let <hi rend="ital">VZ</hi> be set up at right angles to the plane of the circle, let it be produced in the other direction, as <hi rend="ital">VX</hi>, let there be cut off <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>, the side of a hexagon, and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">VX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi>, being sides of a decagon, and let <hi rend="ital">QZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XM</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QE</hi> is at right angles to the plane of the circle, therefore <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">QE</hi>. [<ref target="elem.11.6">XI. 6</ref>] </p>
      <p>But they are also equal; therefore <hi rend="ital">EV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">QW</hi> are also equal and parallel. [<ref target="elem.1.33">I. 33</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">EV</hi> belongs to a hexagon; therefore <hi rend="ital">QW</hi> also belongs to a hexagon. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">QW</hi> belongs to a hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi> to a decagon, and the angle <hi rend="ital">QWZ</hi> is right, therefore <hi rend="ital">QZ</hi> belongs to a pentagon. [<ref target="elem.13.10">XIII. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> also belongs to a pentagon, inasmuch as, if we join <hi rend="ital">VK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WU</hi>, they will be equal and opposite, and <hi rend="ital">VK</hi>, being a radius, belongs to a hexagon; [<ref target="elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">WU</hi> also belongs to a hexagon. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi> belongs to a decagon, and the angle <hi rend="ital">UWZ</hi> is right; therefore <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> belongs to a pentagon. [<ref target="elem.13.10">XIII. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">QU</hi> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">QUZ</hi> is equilateral. <pb n="V3_484"/></p>
      <p>For the same reason each of the remaining triangles of which the straight lines <hi rend="ital">QR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ST</hi>, <hi rend="ital">TU</hi> are the bases, and the point <hi rend="ital">Z</hi> the vertex, is also equilateral. </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">VL</hi> belongs to a hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">VX</hi> to a decagon, and the angle <hi rend="ital">LVX</hi> is right, therefore <hi rend="ital">LX</hi> belongs to a pentagon. [<ref target="elem.13.10">XIII. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason, if we join <hi rend="ital">MV</hi>, which belongs to a hexagon, <hi rend="ital">MX</hi> is also inferred to belong to a pentagon. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <hi rend="ital">LMX</hi> is equilateral. </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the remaining triangles of which <hi rend="ital">MN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NO</hi>, <hi rend="ital">OP</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PL</hi> are the bases, and the point <hi rend="ital">X</hi> the vertex, is also equilateral. </p>
      <p>Therefore an icosahedron has been constructed which is contained by twenty equilateral triangles. </p>
      <p>It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> belongs to a hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi> to a decagon, therefore <hi rend="ital">VZ</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> is its greater segment; [<ref target="elem.13.9">XIII. 9</ref>] therefore, as <hi rend="ital">ZV</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">VE</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi> to <hi rend="ital">VX</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">ZV</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">VE</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">EV</hi> to <hi rend="ital">VX</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the angles <hi rend="ital">ZVE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EVX</hi> are right; therefore, if we join the straight line <hi rend="ital">EZ</hi>, the angle <hi rend="ital">XEZ</hi> will be right because of the similarity of the triangles <hi rend="ital">XEZ</hi>, <hi rend="ital">VEZ</hi>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, since, as <hi rend="ital">ZV</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">ZV</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">XW</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WQ</hi>, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">XW</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">WQ</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">QW</hi> to <hi rend="ital">WZ</hi>. <pb n="V3_485"/></p>
      <p>And for this reason again, if we join <hi rend="ital">QX</hi>, the angle at <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> will be right; [<ref target="elem.6.8">VI. 8</ref>] therefore the semicircle described on <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi> will also pass through <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>. [<ref target="elem.3.31">III. 31</ref>] </p>
      <p>And if, <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> and the remaining angular points of the icosahedron, and the icosahedron will have been comprehended in a sphere. </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> be bisected at <hi rend="ital">A'</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since the straight line <hi rend="ital">VZ</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">W</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">ZW</hi> is its lesser segment, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">ZW</hi> added to the half of the greater segment, that is <hi rend="ital">WA'</hi>, is five times the square on the half of the greater segment; [<ref target="elem.13.3">XIII. 3</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">ZA'</hi> is five times the square on . </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">ZX</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">ZA'</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">VW</hi> double of ; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">ZX</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">WV</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is quadruple of <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is five times <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>; [<ref target="elem.6.8">VI. 8</ref>, <ref target="elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">ZX</hi> was also proved to be five times the square on <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">VW</hi>, for each of them is equal to the radius of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi> is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere. </p>
      <p>Therefore the icosahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere <pb n="V3_486"/></p>
      <p>I say next that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
      <p>For, since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is five times the square on the radius of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi>, therefore the radius of the circle <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi> is also rational; hence its diameter is also rational. </p>
      <p>But, if an equilateral pentagon be inscribed in a circle which has its diameter rational, the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor. [<ref target="elem.13.11">XIII. 11</ref>] </p>
      <p>And the side of the pentagon <hi rend="ital">EFGHK</hi> is the side of the icosahedron. </p>
      <p>Therefore the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>

      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">PX</hi> be drawn from <hi rend="ital">P</hi> parallel to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">RU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SV</hi> and towards the outside of the cube, and let <hi rend="ital">XH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HW</hi> be joined; I say that <hi rend="ital">XHW</hi> is a straight line. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">HQ</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">T</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">QT</hi> is its greater segment, therefore, as <hi rend="ital">HQ</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">QT</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">QT</hi> to <hi rend="ital">TH</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">HQ</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">HP</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">QT</hi> to each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">TW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">PX</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">HP</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">PX</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">WT</hi> to <hi rend="ital">TH</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">HP</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">TW</hi>, for each of them is at right angles to the plane <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>; [<ref target="elem.11.6">XI. 6</ref>] and <hi rend="ital">TH</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="ital">PX</hi>, for each of them is at right angles to the plane <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>. [<hi rend="ital">id</hi>.] <pb n="V3_495"/></p>
      <p>But if two triangles, as <hi rend="ital">XPH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HTW</hi>, which have two sides proportional to two sides be placed together at one angle so that their corresponding sides are also parallel, the remaining straight lines will be in a straight line; [<ref target="elem.6.32">VI. 32</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">XH</hi> is in a straight line with <hi rend="ital">HW</hi>. </p>
      <p>But every straight line is in one plane; [<ref target="elem.11.1">XI. 1</ref>] therefore the pentagon <hi rend="ital">UBWCV</hi> is in one plane. </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the straight line <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">R</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">PR</hi> is the greater segment, while <hi rend="ital">PR</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">PS</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">NS</hi> has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is the greater segment; [<ref target="elem.13.5">XIII. 5</ref>] therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">NS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> are triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NP</hi>. [<ref target="elem.13.4">XIII. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">PS</hi> to <hi rend="ital">SV</hi>; therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">NS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SV</hi> are triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>; hence the squares on <hi rend="ital">VS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> are quadruple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">SB</hi> is equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">SN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>; therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">BS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SV</hi>, that is, the square on <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> —for the angle <hi rend="ital">VSB</hi> is right—is quadruple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">VB</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">BN</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is also double of <hi rend="ital">BN</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, since the two sides <hi rend="ital">BU</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UV</hi> are equal to the two sides <hi rend="ital">BW</hi>, <hi rend="ital">WC</hi>, and the base <hi rend="ital">BV</hi> is equal to the base <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, therefore the angle <hi rend="ital">BUV</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">BWC</hi>. [<ref target="elem.1.8">I. 8</ref>] </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the angle <hi rend="ital">UVC</hi> is also equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">BWC</hi>; therefore the three angles <hi rend="ital">BWC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">BUV</hi>, <hi rend="ital">UVC</hi> are equal to one another. <pb n="V3_496"/></p>
      <p>But if in an equilateral pentagon three angles are equal to one another, the pentagon will be equiangular, [<ref target="elem.13.7">XIII. 7</ref>] therefore the pentagon <hi rend="ital">BUVCW</hi> is equiangular. </p>
      <p>And it was also proved equilateral; therefore the pentagon <hi rend="ital">BUVCW</hi> is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one side <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> of the cube. </p>
      <p>Therefore, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the twelve sides of the cube, a solid figure will have been constructed which is contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, and which is called a dodecahedron. </p>
      <p>It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>
      <p>For let <hi rend="ital">XP</hi> be produced, and let the produced straight line be <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">PZ</hi> meets the diameter of the cube, and they bisect one another, for this has been proved in the last theorem but one of the eleventh book. [<ref target="elem.11.38">XI. 38</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let them cut at <hi rend="ital">Z</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">Z</hi> is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube, and <hi rend="ital">ZP</hi> is half of the side of the cube. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the straight line <hi rend="ital">NS</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">P</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is its greater segment, therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">NS</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SP</hi> are triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NP</hi>. [<ref target="elem.13.4">XIII. 4</ref>] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">NS</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">XZ</hi>, inasmuch as <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">PZ</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">XP</hi> to <hi rend="ital">PS</hi>. </p>
      <p>But further <hi rend="ital">PS</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">XU</hi>, since it is also equal to <hi rend="ital">RP</hi>; therefore the squares on <hi rend="ital">ZX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XU</hi> are triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NP</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> is equal to the squares on <hi rend="ital">ZX</hi>, <hi rend="ital">XU</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> is triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">NP</hi>. <pb n="V3_497"/></p>
      <p>But the square on the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube is also triple of the square on the half of the side of the cube, for it has previously been shown how to construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<ref target="elem.13.15">XIII. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if whole is so related to whole, so is half to half also; and <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is half of the side of the cube; therefore <hi rend="ital">UZ</hi> is equal to the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">Z</hi> is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube; therefore the point <hi rend="ital">U</hi> is on the surface of the sphere. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere; therefore the dodecahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
      <p>I say next that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>
      <p>For since, when <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">RP</hi> is the greater segment, and, when <hi rend="ital">PO</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">PS</hi> is the greater segment, therefore, when the whole <hi rend="ital">NO</hi> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">RS</hi> is the greater segment. </p>
      <p>[Thus, since, as <hi rend="ital">NP</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">PR</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">PR</hi> to <hi rend="ital">RN</hi>, the same is true of the doubles also, for parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples; [<ref target="elem.5.15">V. 15</ref>] therefore as <hi rend="ital">NO</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">RS</hi> to the sum of <hi rend="ital">NR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SO</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">NO</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">RS</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">RS</hi> is also greater than the sum of <hi rend="ital">NR</hi>, <hi rend="ital">SO</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">NO</hi> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <hi rend="ital">RS</hi> is its greater segment.] </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">RS</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">UV</hi>; therefore, when <hi rend="ital">NO</hi> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">UV</hi> is the greater segment. <pb n="V3_498"/></p>
      <p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is triple of the square on the side of the cube, therefore <hi rend="ital">NO</hi>, being a side of the cube, is rational. </p>
      <p>[But if a rational line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, each of the segments is an irrational apotome.] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">UV</hi>, being a side of the dodecahedron, is an irrational apotome. [<ref target="elem.13.6">XIII. 6</ref>] </p>

      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the diameter of the sphere; therefore <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> is the side of the cube. </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AC</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is double of the square on <hi rend="ital">BE</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also double of the square on the side of the octahedron. [<ref target="elem.13.14">XIII. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> is the side of the octahedron. </p>
      <p>Next, let <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> be drawn from the point <hi rend="ital">A</hi> at right angles to the straight line <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">AG</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, let <hi rend="ital">GC</hi> be joined, and from <hi rend="ital">H</hi> let <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> be drawn perpendicular to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Then, since <hi rend="ital">GA</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, for <hi rend="ital">GA</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, and, as <hi rend="ital">GA</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">AC</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> to <hi rend="ital">KC</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> is also double of <hi rend="ital">KC</hi>. <pb n="V3_505"/></p>

      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">CB</hi>, and, in them, <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, therefore the remainder <hi rend="ital">BD</hi> is double of the remainder <hi rend="ital">DC</hi>. </p>

      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">CK</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">CD</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let <hi rend="ital">CL</hi> be made equal to <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>, from <hi rend="ital">L</hi> let <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> be drawn at right angles to <hi rend="ital">AB</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">MB</hi> be joined. </p>
      <p>Now, since the square on <hi rend="ital">BC</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">BC</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> double of <hi rend="ital">CK</hi>, therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is five times the square on <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. [<ref target="elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the diameter of the sphere; therefore <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described; therefore <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is a side of the hexagon in the said circle. [<ref target="elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is made up of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the same circle, [<ref target="elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</ref>] and <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is the diameter of the sphere, while <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is a side of the hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">AK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">LB</hi>, therefore each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">AK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> is a side of the decagon inscribed in the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. <pb n="V3_506"/></p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">LB</hi> belongs to a decagon, and <hi rend="ital">ML</hi> to a hexagon, for <hi rend="ital">ML</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">KL</hi>, since it is also equal to <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, being the same distance from the centre, and each of the straight lines <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">KC</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">MB</hi> belongs to a pentagon. [<ref target="elem.13.10">XIII. 10</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosahedron; [<ref target="elem.13.16">XIII. 16</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">MB</hi> belongs to the icosahedron. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">FB</hi> is a side of the cube, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <hi rend="ital">N</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> be the greater segment; therefore <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> is a side of the dodecahedron. [<ref target="elem.13.17.p.1">XIII. 17, Por.</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since the square on the diameter of the sphere was proved to be one and a half times the square on the side <hi rend="ital">AF</hi> of the pyramid, double of the square on the side <hi rend="ital">BE</hi> of the octahedron and triple of the side <hi rend="ital">FB</hi> of the cube, therefore, of parts of which the square on the diameter of the sphere contains six, the square on the side of the pyramid contains four, the square on the side of the octahedron three, and the square on the side of the cube two. </p>
      <p>Therefore the square on the side of the pyramid is fourthirds of the square on the side of the octahedron, and double of the square on the side of the cube; and the square on the side of the octahedron is one and a half times the square on the side of the cube. </p>
      <p>The said sides, therefore, of the three figures, I mean the pyramid, the octahedron and the cube, are to one another in rational ratios. </p>
      <p>But the remaining two, I mean the side of the icosahedron and the side of the dodecahedron, are not in rational ratios either to one another or to the aforesaid sides; for they are irrational, the one being minor [<ref target="elem.13.16">XIII. 16</ref>] and the other an apotome [<ref target="elem.13.17">XIII. 17</ref>]. </p>
      <p>That the side <hi rend="ital">MB</hi> of the icosahedron is greater than the side <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> of the dodecahedron we can prove thus. </p>
      <p>For, since the triangle <hi rend="ital">FDB</hi> is equiangular with the triangle <hi rend="ital">FAB</hi>, [<ref target="elem.6.8">VI. 8</ref>] proportionally, as <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">BF</hi> to <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>. [<ref target="elem.6.4">VI. 4</ref>] <pb n="V3_507"/></p>
      <p>And, since the three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the square on the second; [<ref target="elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</ref>, <ref target="elem.6.20.p.1">VI. 20, Por.</ref>] therefore, as <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BA</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">DB</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">BF</hi>; therefore, inversely, as <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>, so is the square on <hi rend="ital">FB</hi> to the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">AB</hi> is triple of <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">FB</hi> is triple of the square on <hi rend="ital">BD</hi>. </p>
      <p>But the square on <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is also quadruple of the square on <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>, for <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">DB</hi>; therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is greater than the square on <hi rend="ital">FB</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AD</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">FB</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is by far greater than <hi rend="ital">FB</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, when <hi rend="ital">AL</hi> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is the greater segment, inasmuch as <hi rend="ital">LK</hi> belongs to a hexagon, and <hi rend="ital">KA</hi> to a decagon; [<ref target="elem.13.9">XIII. 9</ref>] and, when <hi rend="ital">FB</hi> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> is the greater segment; therefore <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">KL</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">LM</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">LM</hi> is greater than <hi rend="ital">NB</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">MB</hi>, which is a side of the icosahedron, is by far greater than <hi rend="ital">NB</hi> which is a side of the dodecahedron. Q. E. D. </p>
      <p>I say next that <hi rend="ital">no other figure</hi>, <hi rend="ital">besides the said five figures</hi>, <hi rend="ital">can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular figures equal to one another.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For a solid angle cannot be constructed with two triangles, or indeed planes. </p>
      <p>With three triangles the angle of the pyramid is constructed, with four the angle of the octahedron, and with five the angle of the icosahedron; but a solid angle cannot be formed by six equilateral and equiangular triangles placed together at one point, <pb n="V3_508"/>for, the angle of the equilateral triangle being two-thirds of a right angle, the six will be equal to four right angles: which is impossible, for any solid angle is contained by angles less than four right angles. [<ref target="elem.11.21">XI. 21</ref>] </p>
      <p>For the same reason, neither can a solid angle be constructed by more than six plane angles. </p>
      <p>By three squares the angle of the cube is contained, but by four it is impossible for a solid angle to be contained, for they will again be four right angles. </p>
      <p>By three equilateral and equiangular pentagons the angle of the dodecahedron is contained; but by four such it is impossible for any solid angle to be contained, for, the angle of the equilateral pentagon being a right angle and a fifth, the four angles will be greater than four right angles: which is impossible. </p>
      <p>Neither again will a solid angle be contained by other polygonal figures by reason of the same absurdity. </p>
      <p>Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>

       <head>LEMMA.</head>
       <p>But that <hi rend="ital">the angle of the equilateral and equiangular pentagon is a right angle and a fifth</hi> we must prove thus. </p>
       <p>Let <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> be an equilateral and equiangular pentagon, let the circle <hi rend="ital">ABCDE</hi> be circumscribed about it, let its centre <hi rend="ital">F</hi> be taken, and let <hi rend="ital">FA</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FC</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FE</hi> be joined. </p>
       <p>Therefore they bisect the angles of the pentagon at <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. <figure/>
       </p>
       <p>And, since the angles at <hi rend="ital">F</hi> are equal to four right angles and are equal, <pb n="V3_509"/>therefore one of them, as the angle <hi rend="ital">AFB</hi>, is one right angle less a fifth; therefore the remaining angles <hi rend="ital">FAB</hi>, <hi rend="ital">ABF</hi> consist of one right angle and a fifth. </p>
       <p>But the angle <hi rend="ital">FAB</hi> is equal to the angle <hi rend="ital">FBC</hi>; therefore the whole angle <hi rend="ital">ABC</hi> of the pentagon consists of one right angle and a fifth. Q. E. D.</p>
