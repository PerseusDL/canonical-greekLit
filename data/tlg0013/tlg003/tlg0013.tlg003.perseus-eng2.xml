           <milestone n="1" unit="card"/><l n="1"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>I will remember and not be unmindful of Apollo who shoots afar. As he goes through
          the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he
          draws near, as he bends his bright bow. </l>
            <l n="5">But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in thunder; and then she
          unstrings his bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his strong shoulders
          in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pillar of his father's house. Then
          she leads him to a seat and makes him sit: </l>
            <l n="10">and the Father gives him nectar in a golden cup welcoming his dear son, while the
          other gods make him sit down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a mighty
          son and an archer. Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, </l>

          sing of you who in all ways are a worthy theme of song? </l>
            <l n="20">For everywhere, O Phoebus, the whole range of song is fallen to you, both over the
          mainland that rears heifers and over the isles. All mountain-peaks and high headlands of
          lofty hills and rivers flowing out to the deep and beaches sloping seawards and havens of
          the sea are your delight. </l>
            <l n="25">Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you to be the joy of men, as she rested

            <l n="45">so far roamed Leto in travail with the god who shoots afar, to see if any land
          would be willing to make a dwelling for her son. <milestone n="47" unit="card"/>But they
          greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest of them, dared receive
          Phoebus, </l>
            <l n="50">until queenly Leto set foot on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>
              and uttered winged words and asked her: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote" -->“<placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>,
          if you would be willing to be the abode of my son Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich
          temple —; for no other will touch you, as you will find: and I think you will never be
          rich in oxen and sheep, </l>
            <l n="55">nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have the temple of
          far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and incessant
          savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed those who dwell in you </l>
          <l n="60">from the hand of strangers; for truly your own soil is not rich.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote" --> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So spake Leto.
          And <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> rejoiced and answered and said:
            <!-- <milestone type="startquote" -->“Leto, most glorious daughter of great Coeus, joyfully would I receive your child the
          far-shooting lord; for it is all too true that I am ill-spoken of </l>
            <l n="65">among men, whereas thus I should become very greatly honored. But this saying I
          fear, and I will not hide it from you, Leto. They say that Apollo will be one that is very
          haughty and will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth. </l>
            <l n="70">Therefore, I greatly fear in heart and spirit that as soon as he sees the light of
          the sun, he will scorn this island —for truly I have but a hard, rocky soil —and overturn
          me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of the sea; then will the great ocean
          wash deep above my head for ever, </l>
            <l n="75">and he will go to another land such as will please him, there to make his temple
          and wooded groves. So many-footed creatures of the sea will make their lairs in me and
          black seals their dwellings undisturbed, because I lack people. Yet if you will but dare
          to swear a great oath, goddess, </l>
            <l n="80">that here first he will build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, then let
          him afterwards </l>
            <l n="81a">make temples and wooded groves amongst all men; for surely he will be greatly
              renowned.<!-- <milestone type="endquote" --> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So said <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. And Leto swear the
              great oath of the gods: <!-- <milestone type="startquote" -->“Now hear this, Earth and wide Heaven above, </l>
            <l n="85">and dropping water of Styx (this is the strongest and most awful oath for the
          blessed gods), surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you he
          shall honor above all.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote" --><milestone n="89" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Now when Leto had sworn and ended
          her oath, </l>
            <l n="90">
               <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> was very glad at the birth of the
          far-shooting lord. But Leto was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont. </l>
            <l n="95">And there were with her all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rhea and
          Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other deathless goddesses save
          white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus. Only Eilithyia, goddess of
          sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's </l>
            <l n="100">contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses
              was soon to bear a son faultless and strong. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>But the goddesses sent out Iris from the
          well-set isle to bring Eilithyia, promising her a great necklace strung with golden
          threads, nine cubits long. </l>
            <l n="105">And they bade Iris call her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she might
          afterwards turn her from coming with her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the
          wind, had heard all this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came
          to the home of the gods, sheer <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, </l>
            <l n="110">and forthwith called Eilithyia out from the hall to the door and spoke winged
          words to her, telling her all as the goddesses who dwell on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> had bidden her. So she moved the heart of Eilithyia in her dear
          breast; and they went their way, like shy wild-doves in their going. </l>
          <l n="115"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And as soon as Eilithyia the goddess of sore travail set foot on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, the pains of birth seized Leto, and she longed to
          bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and kneeled on the soft meadow while
          the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the
          goddesses raised a cry. </l>
            <l n="120">Straightway, great Phoebus, the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with
          sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and fastened a
          golden band about you. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Now Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her
          breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia </l>
            <l n="125">with her divine hands: and Leto was glad because she had borne a strong son and
          an archer. But as soon as you had tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could
          no longer then be held by golden cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were
          undone. </l>
          <l n="130">Forth-with Phoebus Apollo spoke out among the deathless goddesses:<milestone n="131" unit="card"/><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will
            declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who
          shoots afar and began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; </l>
             <l n="135">and all the goddesses were amazed at him. Then with gold all <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> [<surplus reason="intrusive">was laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto,
          for joy because the god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in her:
          and she loved him yet more in her heart.</surplus>] blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland
          flowers. </l>
          <l n="140"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And you, O lord Apollo, god of the silver bow, shooting afar, now walked on
          craggy Cynthus, and now kept wandering about the islands and the people in them. Many are
          your temples and wooded groves, and all peaks and towering bluffs </l>
            <l n="145">of lofty mountains and rivers flowing to the sea are dear to you, Phoebus, yet in
            <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> do you most delight your heart; for
          there the long robed Ionians gather in your honor with their children and shy wives: with
          boxing and dancing and song, </l>
            <l n="150">mindful, they delight you so often as they hold their gathering. A man would say
          that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the Ionians so met
          together. For he would see the graces of them all, and would be pleased in heart gazing at
          the men and well-girded women </l>
            <l n="155">with their swift ships and great wealth. And there is this great wonder besides
          —and its renown shall never perish —, the girls of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, hand-maidens of the Far-shooter; for when they have praised Apollo
          first, and also Leto and Artemis who delights in arrows, </l>
            <l n="160">they sing a strain telling of men and women of past days, and charm the tribes of
          men. Also they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would
          say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song. </l>
          <l n="165"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And now may Apollo be favorable and Artemis; and farewell all you maidens.
          Remember me in after time whenever any one of men on earth, a stranger who has seen and
          suffered much, comes here and asks of you: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Whom think ye, girls, is the sweetest singer
            that comes here, and in whom do you most delight?”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> </l>
          <l n="170">Then answer, each and all, with one voice: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“He is a blind man, and dwells in
            rocky <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>: his lays are evermore supreme.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> As
          for me, I will carry your renown as far as I roam over the earth </l>
            <l n="175">to the well-placed cities of man, and they will believe also; for indeed this
          thing is true. And I will never cease to praise far-shooting Apollo, god of the silver
          bow, whom rich-haired Leto bare.</l></div>

          there and wooded groves. From there you crossed the Euripus, far-shooting Apollo, and went
          up the green, holy hills, going on to Mycalessus and grassy-bedded Teumessus,<milestone n="225" unit="card"/>
            </l>
            <l n="225">and so came to the wood-clad abode of Thebe; for as yet no man lived in holy
              Thebe, nor were there tracks or ways about Thebe's wheat-bearing plain as yet. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And further
          still you went, O far-shooting Apollo, </l>
            <l n="230">and came to Onchestus, Poseidon's bright grove: there the new-broken colt
          distressed with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit again, and the skilled driver springs
          from his car and goes on his way. Then the horses for a while rattle the empty car, being
          rid of guidance; </l>
            <l n="235">and if they break the chariot in the woody grove, men look after the horses, but
          tilt the chariot and leave it there; for this was the rite from the very first. And the

              <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Further yet you went, O far-shooting Apollo, </l>
            <l n="240">and reached next Cephissus' sweet stream which pours forth its sweet-flowing

            <l n="275">So said Telphusa, that she alone, and not the Far-Shooter, should have renown

            <l n="285">There the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple, and thus he

          and Agamedes, dear to the deathless gods, laid a footing of stone. And the countless

            <l n="300"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>But near by was a sweet flowing spring, and there with his strong bow the lord,

            <l n="305">She it was who once received from gold-throned Hera and brought up fell, cruel
          Typhaon to be a plague to men. Once on a time Hera bare him because she was angry with
          father Zeus, when the Son of Cronos bare all-glorious Athena in his head. Thereupon
          queenly Hera was angry </l>
  <l n="310">and spoke thus among the assembled gods: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Hear from me, all gods and goddesses,

            <l n="330">And I will not come to your bed, but will consort with the blessed gods far off
              from you.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>When she had so spoken, she went apart from the gods, being very angry. Then
          straightway large-eyed queenly Hera prayed, striking the ground flatwise with her hand,
          and speaking thus: </l>
  <l n="335"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Hear now, I pray, Earth and wide Heaven above and you Titan gods who dwell

          than Cronos.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> </l>
            <l n="340">Thus she cried and lashed the earth with her strong hand. Then the life-giving
          earth was moved: and when Hera saw it she was glad in heart, for she thought her prayer
          would be fulfilled. And thereafter she never came to the bed of wise Zeus for a full year, </l>
            <l n="345">nor to sit in her carved chair as aforetime to plan wise counsel for him, but
          stayed in her temples where many pray, and delighted in her offerings, large-eyed queenly

            <l n="350">and the seasons duly came on as the earth moved round, she bare one neither like

          large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one evil thing to another such, gave him to
          the dragoness; and she received him. </l>
            <l n="355">And this Typhaon used to work great mischief among the famous tribes of men.
          Whosoever met the dragoness, the day of doom would sweep him away, until the lord Apollo,
          who deals death from afar, shot a strong arrow at her. Then she, rent with bitter pangs,
          lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling about that place. </l>
            <l n="360">An awful noise swelled up unspeakable as she writhed continually this way and
          that amid the wood: and so she left her life, breathing it forth in blood. Then Phoebus
          Apollo boasted over her: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man' You at least shall

          here shall the Earth and shining Hyperion make you rot.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> </l>
            <l n="370"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Thus said Phoebus, exulting over her: and darkness covered her eyes. And the holy
          strength of Helios made her rot away there; wherefore the place is now called <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, and men call the lord Apollo by another name,
          Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away. </l>
            <l n="375"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing spring had beguiled him, and he
          started out in anger against Telphusa; and soon coming to her, he stood close by and spoke
          to her: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Telphusa, you were not, after all, to keep to yourself this lovely place by

              yours alone?”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Thus spoke the lord, far-working Apollo, and pushed over upon her a crag
          with a shower of rocks, hiding her streams: and he made himself an altar in a wooded grove </l>
            <l n="385">very near the clear-flowing stream. In that place all men pray to the great one
              by the name Telphusian, because he humbled the stream of holy Telphusa. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then Phoebus
          Apollo pondered in his heart what men he should bring in</l>
            <l n="390">to be his ministers in sacrifice and to serve him in rocky <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>. And while he considered this, he became aware of a
          swift ship upon the wine-like sea in which were many men and goodly, Cretans from
            <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossos</placeName>,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Inscriptions show that there was a temple of Apollo Delphinius (cp. ll. 495-6) at

            <l n="395">whatsoever Phoebus Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, speaks in answer from his
          laurel tree below the dells of <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>.<milestone n="397" unit="card"/> These men were sailing in their
          black ship for traffic and for profit to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and to the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.
          But Phoebus Apollo met them: </l>
            <l n="400">in the open sea he sprang upon their swift ship, like a dolphin in shape, and lay
          there, a great and awesome monster, and none of them gave heed so as to understand<note anchored="true" resp="ed">
                  <hi rend="ital">sc.</hi> that the dolphin was really
            Apollo.</note>; </l>
            <l n="402a">but they sought to cast the dolphin overboard. But he kept shaking the black
          ship every way and making the timbers quiver. So they sat silent in their craft for fear, </l>
            <l n="405">and did not loose the sheets throughout the black, hollow ship, nor lowered the
          sail of their dark-prowed vessel, but as they had set it first of all with oxhide ropes,
          so they kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind hurried on the swift ship from behind.
          First they passed by Malea, </l>
            <l n="410">and then along the Laconian coast they came to Taenarum, sea-garlanded town and
          country of Helios who gladdens men, where the thick-fleeced sheep of the lord Helios feed
          continually and occupy a gladsome country. There they wished to put their ship to shore,
          and land </l>
            <l n="415">and comprehend the great marvel and see with their eyes whether the monster would
          remain upon the deck of the hollow ship, or spring back into the briny deep where fishes
          shoal. But the well-built ship would not obey the helm, but went on its way all along
            <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>: </l>
            <l n="420">and the lord, far-working Apollo, guided it easily with the breath of the breeze.
          So the ship ran on its course and came to Arena and lovely Argyphea and Thryon, the ford
          of Alpheus, and well-placed Aepy and sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>; </l>
            <l n="425">past Cruni it went and <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> and

          exulting in the breeze from Zeus, there appeared to them below the clouds the steep

            <l n="430">But when they were passed by all the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, then, towards <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName>,
          that vast gulf began to heave in sight which through all its length cuts off the rich isle

          heaven vehemently, that with all speed </l>
            <l n="435">the ship might finish coursing over the briny water of the sea. So they began

            <l n="440"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then, like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship:
          flashes of fire flew from him thick and their brightness reached to heaven. He entered
          into his shrine between priceless tripods, <milestone n="444" unit="card"/>and there made

          well-girded daughters of the Crisaeans raised a cry at that outburst of Phoebus; for he
          cast great fear upon them all. From his shrine he sprang forth again, swift as a thought,
          to speed again to the ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy, </l>
            <l n="450">in the prime of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his hair:
              and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged words: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Strangers, who are you? Whence come

          on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. And when they had put away craving
          for drink and food, they started out with the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, to lead them, </l>
            <l n="515">holding a lyre in his hands, and playing sweetly as he stepped high and featly.
          So the Cretans followed him to <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, marching in
          time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers and of
          those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced song. </l>
            <l n="520">With tireless feet they approached the ridge and straightway came to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> and the lovely place where they were to dwell
          honored by many men. There Apollo brought them and showed them his most holy sanctuary and
          rich temple. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>But their spirit was stirred in their dear breasts, </l>
  <l n="525">and the master of the Cretans asked him, saying: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Lord, since you have brought us
          here far from our dear ones and our fatherland, —for so it seemed good to your heart,—tell
          us now how we shall live. That we would know of you. This land is not to be desired either
          for vineyards or for pastures </l>
  <l n="530">so that we can live well thereon and also minister to men.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --><milestone n="531" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then Apollo, the son of Zeus, smiled upon them and said: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"> -->“Foolish mortals
          and poor drudges are you, that you seek cares and hard toils and straits! Easily will I
          tell you a word and set it in your hearts. </l>
            <l n="535">Though each one of you with knife in hand should slaughter sheep continually, yet
          would you always have abundant store, even all that the glorious tribes of men bring here
          for me. But guard you my temple and receive the tribes of men that gather to this place, </l>
            <l n="539a">and especially show mortal men my will, and do you keep righteousness in your
          heart. </l>
            <l n="539b">But if any shall be disobedient and pay no heed to my warning, </l>
            <l n="540">or if there shall be any idle word or deed and outrage as is common among mortal
          men, then other men shall be your masters and with a strong hand shall make you subject
          for ever. All has been told you: do you keep it in your heart.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"> --> </l>
            <l n="545"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And so, farewell, son of Zeus and Leto; but I will remember you and another hymn
          also. </l></div>
