       <head>To Demeter</head>
        <milestone unit="card" n="1" ed="P"/><l n="1"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>I begin to sing of rich-haired Demeter, awful goddess —of her and her trim-ankled
        daughter whom Aidoneus rapt away, given to him by all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Apart
        from Demeter, lady of the golden sword and glorious fruits, </l>
         <l n="5">she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus and gathering flowers over
        a soft meadow, roses and crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the
        narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of Zeus and to please the Host of Many, to
        be a snare for the bloom-like girl — </l>
         <l n="10">a marvellous, radiant flower. It was a thing of awe whether for deathless gods or
        mortal men to see: from its root grew a hundred blooms and it smelled most sweetly, so that
        all wide heaven above and the whole earth and the sea's salt swell laughed for joy. </l>
         <l n="15">And the girl was amazed and reached out with both hands to take the lovely toy; but
        the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the plain of <placeName key="perseus,Nysa">Nysa</placeName>, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal horses sprang out upon
        her —the Son of Cronos, He who has many names.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The Greeks
          feared to name Pluto directly and mentioned him by one of many descriptive titles, such as
          “Host of Many”: compare the Christian use of ὁ διάβολος or our “Evil One.”</note> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>He caught her up reluctant on his golden
        car and bare her away </l>
         <l n="20">lamenting. Then she cried out shrilly with her voice, calling upon her father, the
        Son of Cronos, who is most high and excellent. But no one, either of the deathless gods or
        of mortal men, heard her voice, nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit: </l>
         <l n="25">only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of Persaeus, heard the girl
        from her cave, and the lord Helios, Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father, the
        Son of Cronos. But he was sitting aloof, apart from the gods, in his temple where many pray,
        and receiving sweet offerings from mortal men. So he, that son of Cronos, of many names, who
        is Ruler of Many and Host of Many, </l>
         <l n="30">was bearing her away by leave of Zeus on his immortal chariot —his own brother's
          child and all unwilling. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And so long as she, the goddess, yet beheld earth and starry heaven
        and the strong-flowing sea where fishes shoal, </l>
         <l n="35">and the rays of the sun, and still hoped to see her dear mother and the tribes of
        the eternal gods, so long hope calmed her great heart for all her trouble<gap reason="lost"/>and the
        heights of the mountains and the depths of the sea rang with her immortal voice: and her
        queenly mother heard her. </l>
        <l n="40"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the covering upon her divine hair with
        her dear hands: her dark cloak she cast down from both her shoulders and sped, like a
        wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child. </l>
         <l n="45">But no one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal man; and of the birds of
        omen none came with true news for her. Then for nine days queenly Deo wandered over the
        earth with flaming torches in her hands, so grieved that she never tasted ambrosia and the
        sweet draught of nectar, </l>
         <l n="50">nor sprinkled her body with water. But when the tenth enlightening dawn had come,
          Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/> -->“Queenly
        Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts, </l>
         <l n="55">what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away Persephone and pierced with
        sorrow your dear heart? For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was. But I
        tell you truly and shortly all I know.”<!--<milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So, then, said Hecate. </l>
         <l n="60">And the daughter of rich-haired Rhea answered her not, but sped swiftly with her,
        holding flaming torches in her hands. So they came to Helios, who is watchman of both gods
        and men, and stood in front of his horses: and the bright goddess enquired of him: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Helios,
        do you at least regard me, goddess as I am, </l>
         <l n="65">if ever by word or deed of mine I have cheered your heart and spirit. Through the
        fruitless air I heard the thrilling cry of my daughter whom I bare, sweet scion of my body
        and lovely in form, as of one seized violently; though with my eyes I saw nothing. But you
        —for with your beams you look down </l>
         <l n="70">from the bright upper air over all the earth and sea —tell me truly of my dear
        child, if you have seen her anywhere, what god or mortal man has violently seized her
        against her will and mine, and so made off.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So said she. And the Son of Hyperion answered
        her: </l>
        <l n="75"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the truth; for I
        greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of
        the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades, her
        father's brother, to be called his buxom wife. </l>
         <l n="80">And Hades seized her and took her loudly crying in his chariot down to his realm of
        mist and gloom. Yet, goddess, cease your loud lament and keep not vain anger unrelentingly:
        Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your
        child, </l>
         <l n="85">being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honor, he has that
        third share which he received when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of
        those among whom he dwells.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--></l>
         <l n="87">
          <milestone n="87" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So he spake, and called to his horses: and at his chiding
        they quickly whirled the swift chariot along, like long-winged birds. </l>
        <l n="90"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>But grief yet more terrible and savage came into the heart of Demeter, and
        thereafter she was so angered with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos that she avoided the
        gathering of the gods and high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and went to
        the towns and rich fields of men, disfiguring her form a long while. And no one of men </l>
         <l n="95">or deep-bosomed women knew her when they saw her, until she came to the house of
        wise Celeus who then was lord of fragrant <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>. Vexed in her dear heart, she sat near the wayside by the Maiden
        Well, from which the women of the place were used to draw water, </l>
         <l n="100">in a shady place over which grew an olive shrub. And she was like an ancient woman
        who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite, like the nurses
        of kings' children who deal justice, or like the house-keepers in their echoing halls. </l>
         <l n="105">There the daughters of Celeus, son of <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, saw her, as they were coming for easy-drawn water, to carry it in
        pitchers of bronze to their dear father's house: four were they and like goddesses in the
        flower of their girlhood, Callidice and Cleisidice and lovely Demo </l>
         <l n="110">and Callithoë who was the eldest of them all. They knew her not,—for the gods are
          not easily discerned by mortals—, but standing near by her spoke winged words: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Old mother,
        whence and who are you of folk born long ago? Why are you gone away from the city and do not
        draw near the houses? </l>
         <l n="115">For there in the shady halls are women of just such age as you, and others younger;
          and they would welcome you both by word and by deed.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--></l>
         <l n="118">
          <milestone n="118" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Thus they said. And she, that queen among goddesses
          answered them saying: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Hail, dear children, whosoever you are of woman-kind. </l>
         <l n="120">I will tell you my story; for it is not unseemly that I should tell you truly what
        you ask. Doso is my name, for my stately mother gave it me. And now I am come from
          <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> over the sea's wide back,—not willingly;
        but against my liking, by force of strength, </l>
         <l n="125">pirates brought me thence. Afterwards they put in with their swift craft to
        Thoricus, and there the women landed on the shore in full throng and the men likewise, and
        they began to make ready a meal by the stern-cables of the ship. But my heart craved not
        pleasant food, </l>
         <l n="130">and I fled secretly across the dark country and escaped my masters, that they
        should not take me unpurchased across the sea, there to win a price for me. And so I
        wandered and am come here: and I know not at all what land this is or what people are in it. </l>
         <l n="135">But may all those who dwell on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>
        give you husbands and birth of children as parents desire, so you take pity on me, maidens, </l>
         <l n="137a">and show me this clearly that I may learn, dear children, to the house of what man
        and woman I may go, </l>
         <l n="140">to work for them cheerfully at such tasks as belong to a woman of my age. Well
        could I nurse a new born child, holding him in my arms, or keep house, or spread my masters'
        bed in a recess of the well-built chamber, or teach the women their work.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> </l>
        <l n="145"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So said the goddess. And straightway the unwed maiden Callidice, goodliest in form
         of the daughters of Celeus, answered her and said:<milestone n="147" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Mother,
        what the gods send us, we mortals bear perforce, although we suffer; for they are much
        stronger than we. But now I will teach you clearly, </l>
         <l n="150">telling you the names of men who have great power and honor here and are chief
        among the people, guarding our city's coif of towers by their wisdom and true judgements:
        there is wise Triptolemus and Dioclus and Polyxeinus and blameless Eumolpus </l>
         <l n="155">and Dolichus and our own brave father. All these have wives who manage in the
        house, and no one of them, so soon as she had seen you, would dishonor you and turn you from
        the house, but they will welcome you; for indeed you are godlike. </l>
         <l n="160">But if you will, stay here; and we will go to our father's house and tell
        Metaneira, our deep-bosomed mother, all this matter fully, that she may bid you rather come
        to our home than search after the houses of others. She has an only son, </l>
         <l n="165">late-born, who is being nursed in our well-built house, a child of many prayers and
        welcome: if you could bring him up until he reached the full measure of youth, any one of
        womankind who should see you would straightway envy you, such gifts would our mother give
        for his upbringing.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So she spake: and the goddess bowed her head in assent. And they filled
        their shining vessels </l>
         <l n="170">with water and carried them off rejoicing. Quickly they came to their father's
        great house and straightway told their mother according as they had heard and seen. Then she
        bade them go with all speed and invite the stranger to come for a measureless hire. As hinds
        or heifers in spring time, </l>
         <l n="175">when sated with pasture, bound about a meadow, so they, holding up the folds of
        their lovely garments, darted down the hollow path, and their hair like a crocus flower
        streamed about their shoulders. And they found the good goddess near the wayside where they
        had left her before, </l>
         <l n="180">and led her to the house of their dear father. And she walked behind, distressed in
        her dear heart, with her head veiled and wearing a dark cloak which waved about the slender
        feet of the goddess.<milestone ed="P" n="184" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Soon they came to the house of
        heaven-nurtured Celeus </l>
         <l n="185">and went through the portico to where their queenly mother sat by a pillar of the
        close-fitted roof, holding her son, a tender scion, in her bosom. And the girls ran to her.
        But the goddess walked to the threshold: and her head reached the roof and she filled the
        doorway with a heavenly radiance. </l>
         <l n="190">Then awe and reverence and pale fear took hold of Metaneira, and she rose up from
        her couch before Demeter, and bade her be seated. But Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver
        of perfect gifts, would not sit upon the bright couch, but stayed silent with lovely eyes
        cast down </l>
         <l n="195">until careful Iambe placed a jointed seat for her and threw over it a silvery
        fleece. Then she sat down and held her veil in her hands before her face. A long time she
        sat upon the stool<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Demeter chooses the lowlier seat,
          supposedly as being more suitable to her assumed condition, but really because in her
          sorrow she refuses all comforts.</note> without speaking because of her sorrow, and
        greeted no one by word or by sign, but rested, </l>
         <l n="200">never smiling, and tasting neither food nor drink, because she pined with longing
        for her deep-bosomed daughter, until careful Iambe —who pleased her moods in aftertime also
        —moved the holy lady with many a quip and jest to smile and laugh and cheer her heart. </l>
         <l n="205">Then Metaneira filled a cup with sweet wine and offered it to her; but she refused
        it, for she said it was not lawful for her to drink red wine, but bade them mix meal and
        water with soft mint and give her to drink. </l>
         <l n="210">And Metaneira mixed the draught and gave it to the goddess as she bade. So the
        great queen Deo received it to observe the sacrament<note anchored="true" resp="ed">An act
         of communion —the drinking of the potion (κυκεών)
          here described— was one of the most important pieces of ritual in the Eleusinian
          mysteries, as commemorating the sorrows of the goddess.</note>
          <gap reason="lost"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And of them all, well-girded Metaneira first began to speak: <milestone n="213" unit="card"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Hail, lady! For I think you are not meanly but nobly born; truly dignity and </l>
         <l n="215">grace are conspicuous upon your eyes as in the eyes of kings that deal justice. Yet
        we mortals bear perforce what the gods send us, though we be grieved; for a yoke is set upon
        our necks. But now, since you are come here, you shall have what I can bestow: and nurse me
        this child whom the gods gave me in my old age and beyond my hope, </l>
         <l n="220">a son much prayed for. If you should bring him up until he reach the full measure
        of youth, any one of woman-kind that sees you will straightway envy you, so great reward
        would I give for his upbringing.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then rich-haired Demeter answered her: </l>
        <l n="225"><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“And to you, also, lady, all hail, and may the gods give you good! Gladly will I
        take the boy to my breast, as you bid me, and will nurse him. Never, I ween, through any
        heedlessness of his nurse shall witchcraft hurt him nor yet the Undercutter:<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Undercutter and Woodcutter are probably popular names (after the
          style of Hesiod's “Boneless One”) for the worm thought to be the cause of teething and
          toothache.</note> for I know a charm far stronger than the Woodcutter, </l>
        <l n="230">and I know an excellent safeguard against woeful witchcraft.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>When she had so
        spoken, she took the child in her fragrant bosom with her divine hands: and his mother was
        glad in her heart. So the goddess nursed in the palace Demophoon, wise Celeus' goodly son
        whom well-girded Metaneira bare. </l>
         <l n="235">And the child grew like some immortal being, not fed with food nor nourished at the
        breast: for by day </l>
         <l n="236a">rich-crowned Demeter would anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of
        a god and breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom. But at night she would hide
        him like a brand in the heart of the fire, </l>
         <l n="240">unknown to his dear parents. And it wrought great wonder in these that he grew
        beyond his age; for he was like the gods face to face. And she would have made him deathless
        and unageing, had not well-girded Metaneira in her heedlessness kept watch by night from her
        sweet-smelling chamber and </l>
         <l n="245">spied. But she wailed and smote her two hips, because she feared for her son and
          was greatly distraught in her heart; so she lamented and uttered winged words:<milestone n="248" unit="card"/><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/> <!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Demophoön, my son, the strange woman buries you deep in fire and
          works grief and bitter sorrow for me.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--></l>
        <l n="250"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Thus she spoke, mourning. And the bright goddess, lovely-crowned Demeter, heard
        her, and was wroth with her. So with her divine hands she snatched from the fire the dear
        son whom Metaneira had born unhoped-for in the palace, and cast him from her to the ground;
        for she was terribly angry in her heart. </l>
        <l n="255">Forthwith she said to well-girded Metaneira: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Witless are you mortals and dull to
        foresee your lot, whether of good or evil, that comes upon you. For now in your heedlessness
        you have wrought folly past healing; for —be witness the oath of the gods, the relentless
        water of Styx — </l>
         <l n="260">I would have made your dear son deathless and unaging all his days and would have
        bestowed on him everlasting honor, but now he can in no way escape death and the fates. Yet
        shall unfailing honor always rest upon him, because he lay upon my knees and slept in my
        arms. </l>
         <l n="265">But, as the years move round and when he is in his prime, the sons of the
        Eleusinians shall ever wage war and dread strife with one another continually. Lo! I am that
        Demeter who has share of honor and is the greatest help and cause of joy to the undying gods
        and mortal men. </l>
         <l n="270">But now, let all the people build me a great temple and an altar below it and
        beneath the city and its sheer wall upon a rising hillock above Callichorus. And I myself
        will teach my rites, that hereafter you may reverently perform them and so win the favour of
        my heart.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--></l>
        <l n="275"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>When she had so said, the goddess changed her stature and her looks, thrusting old
        age away from her: beauty spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her
        sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar, while
        golden tresses spread down over her shoulders, </l>
         <l n="280">so that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning. And so she
          went out from the palace. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And straightway Metaneira's knees were loosed and she remained
        speechless for a long while and did not remember to take up her late-born son from the
        ground. But his sisters heard his pitiful wailing and sprang down from their well-spread
        beds: </l>
         <l n="285">one of them took up the child in her arms and laid him in her bosom, while another
        revived the fire, and a third rushed with soft feet to bring their mother from her fragrant
        chamber. And they gathered about the struggling child and washed him, </l>
         <l n="290">embracing him lovingly; but he was not comforted, because nurses and handmaids much
          less skilful were holding him now.<milestone n="292" unit="card"/> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>All night long they
        sought to appease the glorious goddess, quaking with fear. But, as soon as dawn began to
        show, they told powerful Celeus all things without fail, </l>
         <l n="295">as the lovely-crowned goddess Demeter charged them. So Celeus called the countless
        people to an assembly and bade them make a goodly temple for rich-haired Demeter and an
        altar upon the rising hillock. And they obeyed him right speedily and harkened to his voice, </l>
        <l n="300">doing as he commanded. As for the child, he grew like an immortal being. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Now when
        they had finished building and had drawn back from their toil, they went every man to his
        house. But golden-haired Demeter sat there apart from all the blessed gods and stayed,
        wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. </l>
         <l n="305">Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind over the all-nourishing
        earth: the ground would not make the seed sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid. In
        the fields the oxen drew many a curved plough in vain, and much white barley was cast upon
        the land without avail. </l>
         <l n="310">So she would have destroyed the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed
        them who dwell on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> of their glorious right
        of gifts and sacrifices, had not Zeus perceived and marked this in his heart. First he sent
        golden-winged Iris to call </l>
         <l n="315">rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form. So he commanded. And she obeyed the
        dark-clouded Son of Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between. She came to
        the stronghold of fragrant <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and there
        finding dark-cloaked Demeter in her temple,</l>
        <l n="320">spake to her and uttered winged words: <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Demeter, father Zeus, whose wisdom is
        everlasting, calls you to come join the tribes of the eternal gods: come therefore, and let
        not the message I bring from Zeus pass unobeyed.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Thus said Iris imploring her. But
        Demeter's heart was not moved. </l>
         <l n="325">Then again the father sent forth all the blessed and eternal gods besides: and they
        came, one after the other, and kept calling her and offering many very beautiful gifts and
        whatever rights she might be pleased to choose among the deathless gods. Yet no one was able
        to persuade her mind and will, </l>
         <l n="330">so wroth was she in her heart; but she stubbornly rejected all their words: for she
        vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld with her
          eyes her own fair-faced daughter. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Now when all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer heard this, </l>
         <l n="335">he sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to Erebus, so that having won
        over Hades with soft words, he might lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the
        misty gloom to join the gods, and that her mother might see her with her eyes and cease from
        her anger. </l>
         <l n="340">And Hermes obeyed, and leaving the house of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, straightway sprang down with speed to the hidden places of the
        earth. And he found the lord Hades in his house seated upon a couch, and his shy mate with
        him, much reluctant, because she yearned for her mother. But she was afar off, </l>
         <l n="345">brooding on her fell design because of the deeds of the blessed gods. And the
     strong Slayer of Argus drew near and said:<milestone n="347" unit="card"/>
     <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>--> “Dark-haired Hades, ruler
     over the departed, father Zeus bids me bring noble Persephone forth from Erebus unto the gods, </l>
         <l n="350">that her mother may see her with her eyes and cease from her dread anger with the
        immortals; for now she plans an awful deed, to destroy the weakly tribes of earth-born men
        by keeping seed hidden beneath the earth, and so she makes an end of the honors of the
        undying gods. For she keeps fearful anger and does not consort with the gods, </l>
        <l n="355">but sits aloof in her fragrant temple, dwelling in the rocky hold of <placeName
         key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>-->
     <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So he said. And Aidoneus, ruler over the dead, smiled grimly and
     obeyed the behest of Zeus the king. For he straightway urged wise Persephone, saying: </l>
        <l n="360"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Go now, Persephone, to your dark-robed mother, go, and feel kindly in your heart
        towards me: be not so exceedingly cast down; for I shall be no unfitting husband for you
        among the deathless gods, that am own brother to father Zeus. And while you are here, </l>
         <l n="365">you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among
        the deathless gods: those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings,
        reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be punished for evermore.”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--></l>
        <l n="370"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>When he said this, wise Persephone was filled with joy and hastily sprang up for
        gladness. But he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care
        for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter. Then
        Aidoneus the Ruler of Many openly got ready his deathless </l>
         <l n="375">horses beneath the golden chariot. And she mounted on the chariot, and the strong
        Slayer of Argus took reins and whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the
        horses speeding readily. </l>
         <l n="380">Swiftly they traversed their long course, and neither the sea nor river-waters nor
        grassy glens nor mountain-peaks checked the career of the immortal horses, but they clave
        the deep air above them as they went. And Hermes brought them to the place where
        rich-crowned Demeter was staying and checked them </l>
        <l n="385">before her fragrant temple. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And when Demeter saw them, she rushed forth as does a
        Maenad down some thick-wooded mountain, while Persephone on the other side, when she saw her
        mother's sweet eyes, left the chariot and horses, and leaped down to run to her, and falling
        upon her neck, embraced her. </l>
         <l n="390">But while Demeter was still holding her dear child in her arms, her heart suddenly
        misgave her for some snare, so that she feared greatly and ceased fondling her daughter and
        asked of her at once: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“My child, tell me, surely you have not tasted any food while you were
        below? Speak out and hide nothing, but let us both know. </l>
         <l n="395">For if you have not, you shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and
        your father, the dark-clouded Son of Cronos and be honored by all the deathless gods;
          <milestone n="398" unit="card"/>but if you have tasted food, you must go back again
        beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every

         <l n="400">yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods. But when
        the earth shall bloom with the fragrant flowers of spring in every kind, then from the realm
        of darkness and gloom thou shalt come up once more to be a wonder for gods and mortal men. </l>
         <l n="403a">And now tell me how he rapt you away to the realm of darkness and gloom, and by
          what trick did the strong Host of Many beguile you?”<!-- <milestone type="endquote"/>--> </l>
        <l n="405"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then beautiful Persephone answered her thus: <!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Mother, I will tell you all without
        error. When luck-bringing Hermes came, swift messenger from my father the Son of Cronos and

         <l n="410">and so cease from your anger and fearful wrath against the gods, I sprang up at

        to taste against my will. Also I will tell how he rapt me away by the deep plan </l>
         <l n="415">of my father the Son of Cronos and carried me off beneath the depths of the earth,

         <l n="430">parted beneath, and there the strong lord, the Host of Many, sprang forth and in

          <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So did they then,
        with hearts at one, </l>
         <l n="435">greatly cheer each the other's soul and spirit with many an embrace: their hearts
          had relief from their griefs while each took and gave back joyousness. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>Then bright-coiffed
        Hecate came near to them, and often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: </l>
        <l n="440">and from that time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone. <milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>And
        all-seeing Zeus sent a messenger to them, rich-haired Rhea, to bring dark-cloaked Demeter to

        among the deathless gods </l>
         <l n="445">and agreed that her daughter should go down for the third part of the circling year
        to darkness and gloom, but for the two parts should live with her mother and the other

          <milestone n="449" unit="card"/>swiftly she rushed down from the peaks of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>
         </l>
         <l n="450">and came to the plain of Rharus, rich, fertile corn-land once, but then in nowise
        fruitful, for it lay idle and utterly leafless, because the white grain was hidden by design
        of trim-ankled Demeter. But afterwards, </l>
         <l n="455">as spring-time waxed, it was soon to be waving with long ears of corn, and its rich
        furrows to be loaded with grain upon the ground, while others would already be bound in
        sheaves. There first she landed from the fruitless upper air: and glad were the goddesses to
        see each other and cheered in heart. Then bright-coiffed Rhea said to Demeter: </l>
        <l n="460"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/><!-- <milestone type="startquote"/>-->“Come, my daughter; for far-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer calls you to join the

        <l n="470"><milestone unit="Para" ed="P"/>So spake Rhea. And rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made fruit

         <l n="475">and to doughty Eumolpus and Celeus, leader of the people, she showed the conduct of
