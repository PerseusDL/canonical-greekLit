            <head>WHETHER LAND OR SEA ANIMALS ARE CLEVERER (DE SOLLERTIA ANIMALIUM) <lb/> INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					There can be little doubt that Plutarch composed
					this pleasant work from <hi rend="italics">commentarii</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pomnh/mata</foreign>)
					derived not merely from Aristotle (mentioned specifically in 965 d and quoted often), but also from various
					other compendia, the remains of which are to be
					seen in Aelian's and Pliny's natural histories and
					elsewhere.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">On the sources see Ziegler's article <q>Plutarchos</q> in Pauly-Wissowa, col. 738, and, of the authorities he cites, particularly Wellmann's papers in <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxvi, xxvii, and li, and Max Schuster, <hi rend="italics">Untersuchungen zu Plutarchs De Sollertia Animalium</hi> (Diss. Munich, 1917). There is also an amusing work of Philo, surviving only in an Armenian version, which is most conveniently accessible in Aucher's Latin translation in vol. 8 of the <hi rend="italics">Bibliotheca Sacra</hi> edition (Schwickert, Leipzig, 1830): <hi rend="italics">De Ratione quam habere etiam Bruta Animalia dicebat Alexander</hi>. In the first part of this work Alexander presents the arguments for animal intelligence, which Philo himself attempts to refute in a somewhat summary fashion at the end. The occasional parallels with Plutarch will be cited as Philo, with Aucher's section and page numbers. Antigonus of Carystus, <hi rend="italics">Historia Mirabilium</hi>, will be cited from O. Keller's edition of the <hi rend="italics">Naturalium Rerum Scriptores Graeci</hi> (Teubner, 1877) and Aelian's <hi rend="italics">De Natura Animalium</hi> from R. Hercher's Teubner (not Didot) edition.</note> In fact, if one reads Plutarch and Aelian
					and Pliny side by side, one may acquire the impression that they had before them substantially the
					same sources, and that these were numerous. Whereas
						
					<pb n="v.12.p.312"/>
					
					Pliny and Aelian appear to adopt nearly everything their authorities may have offered (for they
					were writing factual commentaries), Plutarch, as
					always, selects. It is possible, in some cases, that
					Plutarch's mss. (which are not good and also contain
					lacunae) may have been interpolated from Aelian's ;
					and the reverse is likewise possible. This is a very
					difficult matter, but the hope may be entertained
					that some main sources of Plutarch and Aelian, if not
					of Pliny, and the as yet unassessed evidence of Philo,
					may eventually be disentangled for substantial sections, though this is not the place to attempt such a
					feat.
				</p>
            <p>
					The title is not well chosen, since the victory is
					awarded to neither side. The real point of the dialogue seems to be, in its second as well as its first
					part, that all animals of whatever provenance are
					intelligent.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Schuster thinks, rather, that Plutarch's chief aim is to make clear a moral and juridical relationship between man and beasts.</note> The occasionally bantering tone may
					serve to indicate that we have before us something
					of a school exercise from Plutarch's own academy,
					with perhaps the first draft of the second part composed by pupils.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See Schuster, pp. 57 ff. Aristotimus and Phaedimus were doubtless actual pupils of Plutarch.</note> Note the carefully established
					details : the contest will take place at a fixed time
					(960 b, 963 b) before their fellow-pupils and a specially
					appointed judge (965 c-e). More or less elaborate
					preparation has been made by the contestants (960 b,
					975 d).<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Plutarch lays special emphasis on preparation: <hi rend="italics">Mor.</hi> 80 d, 652 b.</note> Because of the occasion the school has been
					granted a holiday.
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.313"/>
				        </p>
            <p>
					In the first part (chapters 1-8), the author demonstrates through the authoritarian voice of his own
					father that the Stoics, in so far as they affirm the
					irrationality of animals, contradict their own tenets.
					The second part proves that animals of all kinds are
					rational (chapters 9-36) ; the last small section, while
					refusing to award first honours in the debate, appears
					to contain Plutarch's exhortation to his pupils to
					continue the fight against the Stoics. For an excellent summary with sympathetic comments see E. R.
					Dodds, <hi rend="italics">Greece and Rome</hi>, ii (1932/3), pp. 104-105.
				</p>
            <p>
					D' Agostino<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">V. D' Agostino, <hi rend="italics">Archivo Italiano di Psicologia</hi>, xi (1933), pp. 21 ff., a useful summarizing article.</note> and others have shown that there is
					little originality in Plutarch's animal psychology, while
					not denying our author considerable vivacity in
					presentation. While it is true that whole sections, like
					976 a-d, are drawn from the identical source that
					Aelian (<hi rend="italics">De Natura Animalium</hi>, viii. 4-6) used, yet one
					has only to compare the use these authors have made
					of precisely the same material to recognize the great
					superiority of Plutarch. The principal sources have
					been disputed<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Hirzel, <hi rend="italics">Der Dialog</hi>, ii, p. 179, n. 1. All of Hirzel's discussion is worth reading, though there are occasional slips, as when he affirms (p. 173, n. 2) that the story in 969 e f. goes back to Plutarch's own experience. This is quite unlikely in view of Aelian's version of the same story; nor has Aelian drawn from Plutarch as some, including Wyttenbach, have thought.</note>: Chrysippus, Theophrastus, Hagnon, Alexander of Myndus,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">For the difficulty and danger involved in identifying the sources exactly see the lists of authorities furnished by Pliny in his first book. Alexander of Myndus, for example, does not appear at all as a source for books 8-11.</note> Juba, Xenocrates have
					all been suggested, but there can be little doubt (as
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.314"/>
					
					with <hi rend="italics">De Tranquillitate</hi>
               <note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See the introduction in the Loeb edition.</note> and many other works) that
					a considerable variety of sources has been utilized.
					Now that Schläpfer<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Plutarch und die klassischen Dichter</hi>, Zürich, 1950, especially pp. 59-60.</note> has demonstrated that Plutarch
					had himself read and meditated upon great sections
					of classical poetry, critics may perhaps be more
					willing to allow our author first-hand familiarity with
					a wider range of prose, and works of reference as
					well.
				</p>
            <p>
					It is by no means impossible that the work is incomplete in our mss. ; there are, at least, several
					demonstrable lacunae and it is possible that it was
					considerably longer and may even have justified its
					title when it left Plutarch's hands.
				</p>
            <p>
					As for the date of the dialogue, the <hi rend="italics">terminus post
					quem</hi> is a.d. 70 (not 79, as it cannot be certainly
					inferred from 974 a that Vespasian was then dead) ;
					it is probably a work of Plutarch's youth, preceding
					in any case the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Symposiacs</hi>. It may
					well date from Plutarch's anti-Stoic period which
					produced the <hi rend="italics">De Facie</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">De Communibus Notitiis</hi>,
					and the other anti-Chrysippean polemics. It has
					much in common with the <hi rend="italics">Gryllus</hi> and the fragments
					of <hi rend="italics">De Esu Carnium</hi> and some correspondence with
					the <hi rend="italics">Amatorius</hi>.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">But allowance must be made for exaggerated and partially false premises in Hartman, <hi rend="italics">De Plutarcho</hi>, p. 567. A modified chronological scheme of Plutarch's writings has lately been proposed by T. Sinko (<hi rend="italics">Polish Acad. Cracow</hi>, 1947), but it is too complicated to be examined here.</note> It may, in fact, have been written
					during nearly the same period as that in which the
					elder Pliny (whose preface is dated a.d. 77) was
					compiling his own <hi rend="italics">Natural History</hi>.
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.315"/>
				        </p>
            <p>
					The citations in D'Arcy Thompson's Oxford translation of Aristotle's <hi rend="italics">Historia Animalium</hi>
               <note resp="#ed" anchored="true">The Loeb edition of A. L. Peck is still awaited at this date of writing. It should be noted that quotations from the ninth book, in particular, are liable to peculiar suspicion and may not proceed from the great naturalist himself.</note> are somewhat
					inaccurate and inconsistent, being, as he says, <q>compiled at various times and at long intervals during
						many years.</q> Nevertheless the work is of great
					value and it may be hoped that the notes in this
					edition that rely on it (and these are many) have
					been adequately sifted. Also to be constantly and
					gratefully consulted are Thompson's <hi rend="italics">A Glossary of
					Greek Fishes</hi> (Oxford, 1947) and <hi rend="italics">A Glossary of Greek
					Birds</hi> (2nd edition, Oxford, 1936). There will be
					many references to Thompson's Aristotle ; but if the
					creature in question is a bird or a fish, it is to be
					understood that supplementary and often corrective
					material is to be found in the Glossaries. There is,
					further, a tribute of admiration due to A. W. Mair's
					L.C.L. edition of Oppian, with its exhaustive notes.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Even the extremely hostile review in <hi rend="italics">Phil. Woch.</hi> li (1931), pp. 1569 ff., exempts the notes from censure.</note>
					Rackham (L.C.L. Pliny, vol. Ill, books viii-xi) is very
					interesting on the text, but has almost completely
					denied himself the privilege of citing parallel passages.
				</p>
            <p>
					The debunking of many of Plutarch's stories, if
					such a task is necessary, has been pleasantly done
					in the leisurely course of Bergen Evans' <hi rend="italics">The Natural
					History of Nonsense</hi> (New York, 1946). It should be
					added, however, that modern scientific speculation
					is approaching somewhat closer to one of Plutarch's
					main tenets, if one may judge from such a work as
					W. C. Allee's <hi rend="italics">Coöperation Among Animals</hi> (New York,
					1951 : a revision of his earlier <hi rend="italics">The Social Life of</hi>
					
					          <pb n="v.12.p.316"/>
					
					          <hi rend="italics">Animals</hi>) ; and on the thesis of animal intelligence
					see Evans himself, p. 173, and the authorities cited
					there, note 1.
				</p>
            <p>
					Both the translation and the notes of this and the
					following essays have benefited immeasurably from
					an exhaustive criticism generously given them by
					Professor Alfred C. Andrews of the University of
					Miami, Florida. He has in fact supplied a number of
					valuable notes and also the Appendix, a classified
					zoological index. It must be understood, however,
					that any errors remaining are to be attributed solely
					to the editor.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Since our text was formed and our translation and notes composed a year or more before the appearance of the new Teubner edition, almost no new references have been added which are not purely textual. The curious reader is referred to Hubert's wealth of illustration to supplement our contributions.</note>

            <p>
					The dialogue is no. 147 in the catalogue of Lamprias. According to this document Plutarch wrote
					another work (no. 135) on the same subject: <hi rend="italics">Do
					Beasts Possess Reason</hi>? But no. 127, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peri\ zw/|wn
					a)lo/gwn poihtiko/s</foreign>, is probably the same as our
					<hi rend="italics">Gryllus</hi>, the following dialogue in this edition.

					Well, we have somehow fallen unawares into a
					discussion not unconnected with what we said yesterday nor yet with the argument that is presently to
					take place to-day. Yesterday, as you know, we
					proposed the thesis that all animals partake in one
					way or another of reason and understanding, and
					thereby offered our young hunters a field of competition not lacking in either instruction or pleasure :
					the question whether land or sea animals have
					superior intelligence. This argument, it seems, we
					shall to-day adjudicate if Aristotimus and Phaedimus
					stand by their challenges ; for Aristotimus put himself at his comrades' disposal to advocate the land as
					producer of animals with superior intelligence, while
					the other will be pleader for the sea.

					maintained that, while rationality exists in the universe, there is nothing irrational ? For there is a

					sort of counterpart for the rational: everything that
					is soulless, since it has no reason or intelligence, is by
					definition in opposition to that which, together with
					a soul, possesses also reason and understanding. Yet
					suppose someone were to maintain that nature must

					as well as its rational aspect, someone else is bound
					to maintain that nature endowed with a soul must
					have both an imaginative and an unimaginative part,
					and both a sentient part and an insentient. They

					moment if it had not learned to give the one sort a
					wide berth while freely mixing with the other. It
					is, to be sure, sensation that enables each creature
					to recognize both kinds ; but the acts of seizing or
					pursuing that ensue upon the perception of what is
					beneficial, as well as the eluding or fleeing of what is
					destructive or painful, could by no means occur in
					creatures naturally incapable of some sort of reasoning and judging, remembering and attending. Those
					beings, then, which you deprive of all expectation,
					memory, design, or preparation, and of all hopes,
					fears, desires, or griefs - they will have no use for eyes
					or ears either, even though they have them. Indeed,
					it would be better to be rid of all sensation and

					receive any reason at all is, in the first place, no
					better than one who asserts that apes are not naturally ugly or tortoises naturally slow for the reason
					that they are not capable of possessing beauty or

					reason<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Diogenes Laertius, vii. 54.</note> is the product of care and education. And

					For as one capacity for seeing or flying differs from
					another (hawks and cicadas do not see alike, nor do

					dexterity or acumen that has attained perfection.
					For just as there are many examples in animals of

					here, one with a large collection of examples drawn
					from the land, the other with his from the sea, I
					should not have denied myself the pleasure of giving

					capacity of beasts - of which fair Rome<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See, for example, 968 c, e <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> has provided

            <p>
					There is, however, one small matter which I should
					like to discuss with you quietly. It is my opinion
					that each part and faculty has its own particular
					weakness or defect or ailment which appears in
					nothing else, as blindness in the eye, lameness in the
					leg, stuttering in the tongue. There can be no
					blindness in an organ which was not created to see,
					or lameness in a part which was not designed for
					walking ; nor would you ever describe an animal
					without a tongue as stuttering, or one voiceless by
					nature as inarticulate. And in the same way you
					would not call delirious or witless or mad anything
					that was not endowed by Nature with reason or intelligence or understanding ; for it is impossible to ail
					where you have no faculty of which the ailment is
					a deficiency or loss or some other kind of impairment. Yet certainly you have encountered mad
					dogs, and I have also known of mad horses; and
					there are some who say that cattle and foxes also
					go mad.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">So too, perhaps, wolves in Theocritus, iv. 11.</note> But dogs will do, since no one questions the
					fact in their case, which provides evidence that the
					creature possesses reason and a by no means despicable intellectual faculty. What is called rabies and
					madness is an ailment of that faculty when it becomes
					disturbed and disordered. For we observe no derangement either of the dogs' sight or of their hearing; yet, just as when a human being suffers from
					melancholy or insanity, anyone is absurd who does
					not admit that it is the organ that thinks and reasons
					and remembers which has been displaced or damaged
					(we habitually say, in fact, of madmen that they <q>are
						
						<pb n="v.12.p.347"/>
						
						not themselves,</q> but have <q>fallen out of their wits</q>),
					just so, whoever believes that rabid dogs have any
					other ailment than an affliction of their natural organ
					of judgement and reason and memory so that, when
					this has become infected with disorder and insanity,
					they no longer recognize beloved faces and shun
					their natural haunts - such a man, I say, either must
					be disregarding the evidence or, if he does take note
					of the conclusion to which it leads, must be quarrelling with the truth.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">The Stoics again; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Galen, <hi rend="italics">De Hippocratis et Platonis Placitis</hi>, v. 1 (p. 431 Kühn).</note>

					Just so, in hunting and fishing, men amuse themselves with the suffering and death of animals, even

					age, used to go down every day to the Ceramicus
					and meet the beasts which brought the stones,

					On this subject I have a story to tell you which I
					heard myself from many Greeks and Romans who
					were eye-witnesses. A certain barber at Rome had
					his shop directly opposite the precinct which they
					call the Market of the Greeks.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Graecostadium</hi> (see Platner and Ashby, <hi rend="italics">A Topographical Dictionary of Rome, s.v.</hi>) or <hi rend="italics">Forum Graecorum</hi>.</note> He bred up a
					wonderful prodigy of a jay<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Porphyry, <hi rend="italics">De Abstinentia</hi>, iii. 2 (p. 191. 8, ed. Nauck); Gow on Theocritus, v. 136; Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">Historia Animal.</hi> ix. 13 (615 b 19 f.). See also the talking birds in Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Nat. Hist.</hi> x. 118-134.</note> with a huge range of
					tones and expressions, which could reproduce the
					phrases of human speech and the cries of beasts and
					the sound of instruments - under no compulsion, but
					making it a rule and a point of honour to let nothing
					go unrepeated or unimitated. Now it happened that
					a certain rich man was buried from that quarter to
					the blast of many trumpets and, as is customary,
					there was a halt in front of the barber-shop while
					the trumpeters, who were applauded and encored,
					played for a long time. From that day on the jay
					was speechless and mute, not letting out even a
					peep to request the necessities of life ; so those
					who habitually passed the place and had formerly
					wondered at her voice, were now even more astonished at her silence. Some suspected that she
					had been poisoned by rival bird-trainers, but most
					conjectured that the trumpets had blasted her hearing and that her voice had been simultaneously
					extinguished. Now neither of these guesses was
					correct: it was self-discipline, it would seem, and her
					talent for mimicry that had sought an inner retreat
					as she refitted and prepared her voice like a musical
					instrument. For suddenly her mimicry returned
					
					<pb n="v.12.p.405"/>
					
					and there blazed forth none of those old familiar
					imitations, but only the music of the trumpets,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This is also the accomplishment of a homonymous bird in Aelian, <hi rend="italics">De Natura Animal.</hi> vi. 19.</note>
					reproduced with its exact sequences and every
					change of pitch and rhythm and tone. I conclude,
					as I said before,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See 973 a <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> that self-instruction implies more

					myself was a spectator at Rome. The dog appeared

					characters and conformed in its acting at all points
					with the acts and reactions required by the text.
					In particular, they experimented on it with a drug
					that was really soporific, but supposed in the story
					to be deadly. The dog took the bread that was
					supposedly drugged, swallowed it, and a little later
					appeared to shiver and stagger and nod until it
					finally sprawled out and lay there like a corpse,
					letting itself be dragged and hauled about, as the
					plot of the play prescribed. But when it recognized
					from the words and action that the time had come,
					at first it began to stir slightly, as though recovering
					from a profound sleep, and lifted its head and looked
					about. Then to the amazement of the spectators it
					got up and proceeded to the right person and fawned

            <p>
					A word of caution is needed : Plutarch emphatically was
					no naturalist. The zoological material is a hodge-podge of
					misinformation dredged up from various zoological sources,
					seasoned here and there with personal contributions, which
					are not necessarily correct. In the original sources, terms
					for specific types of animals were probably used with considerable precision. It is my impression that Plutarch often
					had only a vague idea of the meaning of such terms. For
					example, he consistently uses the specific term for a rock
					dove, but probably had in mind any type of domestic dove.
					Similarly, dorcas was used in Greece commonly as a term
					for the roedeer, but in Asia Minor for the common gazelle.
					In the original sources the word probably denoted specifically
					one or the other, depending on where the man lived ; but
					Plutarch may well have used the term vaguely for any type
					of small deer, including gazelles and antelopes.
