<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="0"><pb xml:id="v.12.p.311"/> 
	<head>INTRODUCTION</head> 
<p rend="indent">There can be little doubt that Plutarch composed this pleasant work from <foreign xml:lang="lat">commentarii</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομνήματα</foreign>) derived not merely from Aristotle (mentioned specifically in 965 d and quoted often), but also from various other compendia, the remains of which are to be seen in Aelian’s and Pliny’s natural histories and elsewhere.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">On the sources see Ziegler’s article <title>Plutarchos</title> in Pauly-Wissowa, col. 738, and, of the authorities he cites, particularly Wellmann’s papers in <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxvi, xxvii, and li, and Max Schuster, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Untersuchungen zu Plutarchs De Sollertia Animalium</title> (Diss. Munich, 1917). There is also an amusing work of Philo, surviving only in an Armenian version, which is most conveniently accessible in Aucher’s Latin translation in vol. 8 of the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Bibliotheca Sacra</title> edition (Schwickert, Leipzig, 1830): <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ratione quam habere etiam Bruta Animalia dicebat Alexander</title>. In the first part of this work Alexander presents the arguments for animal intelligence, which Philo himself attempts to refute in a somewhat summary fashion at the end. The occasional parallels with Plutarch will be cited as Philo, with Aucher’s section and page numbers. Antigonus of Carystus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Historia Mirabilium</title>, will be cited from O. Keller’s edition of the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Naturalium Rerum Scriptores Graeci</title> (Teubner, 1877) and Aelian’s <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Natura Animalium</title> from R. Hercher’s Teubner (not Didot) edition.</note> In fact, if one reads Plutarch and Aelian and Pliny side by side, one may acquire the impression that they had before them substantially the same sources, and that these were numerous. Whereas <pb xml:id="v.12.p.312"/> Pliny and Aelian appear to adopt nearly everything their authorities may have offered (for they were writing factual commentaries), Plutarch, as always, selects. It is possible, in some cases, that Plutarch’s mss. (which are not good and also contain lacunae) may have been interpolated from Aelian’s; and the reverse is likewise possible. This is a very difficult matter, but the hope may be entertained that some main sources of Plutarch and Aelian, if not of Pliny, and the as yet unassessed evidence of Philo, may eventually be disentangled for substantial sections, though this is not the place to attempt such a feat. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The title is not well chosen, since the victory is awarded to neither side. The real point of the dialogue seems to be, in its second as well as its first part, that all animals of whatever provenance are intelligent.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Schuster thinks, rather, that Plutarch’s chief aim is to make clear a moral and juridical relationship between man and beasts.</note> The occasionally bantering tone may serve to indicate that we have before us something of a school exercise from Plutarch’s own academy, with perhaps the first draft of the second part composed by pupils.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Schuster, pp. 57 ff. Aristotimus and Phaedimus were doubtless actual pupils of Plutarch.</note> Note the carefully established details: the contest will take place at a fixed time (960 b, 963 b) before their fellow-pupils and a specially appointed judge (965 c-e). More or less elaborate preparation has been made by the contestants (960 b, 975 d).<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch lays special emphasis on preparation: <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Mor.</title> 80 d, 652 b.</note> Because of the occasion the school has been granted a holiday. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.313"/> </p> 
<p rend="indent">In the first part (chapters 1-8), the author demonstrates through the authoritarian voice of his own father that the Stoics, in so far as they affirm the irrationality of animals, contradict their own tenets. The second part proves that animals of all kinds are rational (chapters 9-36); the last small section, while refusing to award first honours in the debate, appears to contain Plutarch’s exhortation to his pupils to continue the fight against the Stoics. For an excellent summary with sympathetic comments see E. R. Dodds, <title rend="italic">Greece and Rome</title>, ii (1932/3), pp. 104-105. </p> 
<p rend="indent">D’ Agostino<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">V. D’ Agostino, <title xml:lang="ita" rend="italic">Archivo Italiano di Psicologia</title>, xi (1933), pp. 21 ff., a useful summarizing article.</note> and others have shown that there is little originality in Plutarch’s animal psychology, while not denying our author considerable vivacity in presentation. While it is true that whole sections, like 976 a-d, are drawn from the identical source that Aelian (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Natura Animalium</title>, viii. 4-6) used, yet one has only to compare the use these authors have made of precisely the same material to recognize the great superiority of Plutarch. The principal sources have been disputed<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der Dialog</title>, ii, p. 179, n. 1. All of Hirzel’s discussion is worth reading, though there are occasional slips, as when he affirms (p. 173, n. 2) that the story in 969 e f. goes back to Plutarch’s own experience. This is quite unlikely in view of Aelian’s version of the same story; nor has Aelian drawn from Plutarch as some, including Wyttenbach, have thought.</note>: Chrysippus, Theophrastus, Hagnon, Alexander of Myndus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the difficulty and danger involved in identifying the sources exactly see the lists of authorities furnished by Pliny in his first book. Alexander of Myndus, for example, does not appear at all as a source for books 8-11.</note> Juba, Xenocrates have all been suggested, but there can be little doubt (as <pb xml:id="v.12.p.314"/> with <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Tranquillitate</title> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the introduction in the Loeb edition.</note> and many other works) that a considerable variety of sources has been utilized. Now that Schläpfer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Plutarch und die klassischen Dichter</title>, Zürich, 1950, especially pp. 59-60.</note> has demonstrated that Plutarch had himself read and meditated upon great sections of classical poetry, critics may perhaps be more willing to allow our author first-hand familiarity with a wider range of prose, and works of reference as well. </p> 
<p rend="indent">It is by no means impossible that the work is incomplete in our mss.; there are, at least, several demonstrable lacunae and it is possible that it was considerably longer and may even have justified its title when it left Plutarch’s hands. </p> 
<p rend="indent">As for the date of the dialogue, the <foreign xml:lang="lat">terminus post quem</foreign> is a.d. 70 (not 79, as it cannot be certainly inferred from 974 a that Vespasian was then dead); it is probably a work of Plutarch’s youth, preceding in any case the <title rend="italic" >Lives</title> and the <title rend="italic">Symposiacs</title>. It may well date from Plutarch’s anti-Stoic period which produced the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Facie</title>, the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Communibus Notitiis</title>, and the other anti-Chrysippean polemics. It has much in common with the <title rend="italic">Gryllus</title> and the fragments of <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Esu Carnium</title> and some correspondence with the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Amatorius</title>.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >But allowance must be made for exaggerated and partially false premises in Hartman, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>, p. 567. A modified chronological scheme of Plutarch’s writings has lately been proposed by T. Sinko (<emph>Polish Acad. Cracow</emph>, 1947), but it is too complicated to be examined here.</note> It may, in fact, have been written during nearly the same period as that in which the elder Pliny (whose preface is dated a.d. 77) was compiling his own <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.315"/> </p> 
<p rend="indent">The citations in D’Arcy Thompson’s Oxford translation of Aristotle’s <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Historia Animalium</title> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Loeb edition of A. L. Peck is still awaited at this date of writing. It should be noted that quotations from the ninth book, in particular, are liable to peculiar suspicion and may not proceed from the great naturalist himself.</note> are somewhat inaccurate and inconsistent, being, as he says, <q>compiled at various times and at long intervals during many years.</q> Nevertheless the work is of great value and it may be hoped that the notes in this edition that rely on it (and these are many) have been adequately sifted. Also to be constantly and gratefully consulted are Thompson’s <title rend="italic">A Glossary of Greek Fishes</title> (Oxford, 1947) and <title rend="italic">A Glossary of Greek Birds</title> (2nd edition, Oxford, 1936). There will be many references to Thompson’s Aristotle; but if the creature in question is a bird or a fish, it is to be understood that supplementary and often corrective material is to be found in the Glossaries. There is, further, a tribute of admiration due to A. W. Mair’s L.C.L. edition of Oppian, with its exhaustive notes.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Even the extremely hostile review in <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic" >Phil. Woch.</title> li (1931), pp. 1569 ff., exempts the notes from censure.</note> Rackham (L.C.L. Pliny, vol. Ill, books viii-xi) is very interesting on the text, but has almost completely denied himself the privilege of citing parallel passages. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The debunking of many of Plutarch’s stories, if such a task is necessary, has been pleasantly done in the leisurely course of Bergen Evans’ <title rend="italic">The Natural History of Nonsense</title> (New York, 1946). It should be added, however, that modern scientific speculation is approaching somewhat closer to one of Plutarch’s main tenets, if one may judge from such a work as W. C. Allee’s <title rend="italic">Coöperation Among Animals</title> (New York, 1951: a revision of his earlier <title rend="italic">The Social Life of</title> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.316"/> <title rend="italic">Animals</title>); and on the thesis of animal intelligence see Evans himself, p. 173, and the authorities cited there, note 1. </p> 
<p rend="indent">Both the translation and the notes of this and the following essays have benefited immeasurably from an exhaustive criticism generously given them by Professor Alfred C. Andrews of the University of Miami, Florida. He has in fact supplied a number of valuable notes and also the Appendix, a classified zoological index. It must be understood, however, that any errors remaining are to be attributed solely to the editor.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Since our text was formed and our translation and notes composed a year or more before the appearance of the new Teubner edition, almost no new references have been added which are not purely textual. The curious reader is referred to Hubert’s wealth of illustration to supplement our contributions.</note> </p> 
<p rend="indent">The dialogue is no. 147 in the catalogue of Lamprias. According to this document Plutarch wrote another work (no. 135) on the same subject: <title rend="italic">Do Beasts Possess Reason</title>? But no. 127, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ ζώλων ἀλόγων ποιητικός</foreign>, is probably the same as our <title rend="italic">Gryllus</title>, the following dialogue in this edition. </p>

Yesterday, as you know, we proposed the thesis that all animals partake in one way or another of reason and understanding, and thereby offered our young hunters a field of competition not lacking in either instruction or pleasure: the question whether land or sea animals have superior intelligence. This argument, it seems, we shall to-day adjudicate if Aristotimus and Phaedimus stand by their challenges; for Aristotimus put himself at his comrades’ disposal to advocate the land as producer of animals with superior intelligence, while the other will be pleader for the sea. </said> </p>

But, if you like, before the contest begins, let us review the discussion of whatever topics are germane to our conversation of yesterday, but were not then discussed, either because no occasion offered, or, since we were in our cups, were treated too lightly. I thought, in fact, that I caught the reverberation of a material objection from the Stoa<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">S.V.F.</title> ii, pp. 49 ff., 172 ff.; and Pohlenz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic" >B.P.W.</title> xxiii (1903), col. 966, on Chrysippus, frag. 182.</note>: just as the immortal is opposed to the mortal and the imperishable to the perishable, and, of course, the incorporeal to the corporeal; just so, if there is rationality, the irrational must exist as its opposite and counterpart. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.327"/> This alone, among all these pairings, must not be left incomplete and mutilated. </said> </p> </div>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Autobulus"><label>AUTOBULUS.</label> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">There seems to be a great deal more anti-Stoic polemic in the following speeches than von Arnim has admitted into his compilation. See especially the notes on 961 c ff. <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> But who ever, my dear Soclarus, maintained that, while rationality exists in the universe, there is nothing irrational ? For there is a plentiful abundance of the irrational in all things that are not endowed with a soul; we need no other sort of counterpart for the rational: everything that is soulless, since it has no reason or intelligence, is by definition in opposition to that which, together with a soul, possesses also reason and understanding. Yet suppose someone were to maintain that nature must not be left maimed, but that that part of nature which, is endowed with a soul should have its irrational as well as its rational aspect, someone else is bound to maintain that nature endowed with a soul must have both an imaginative and an unimaginative part, and both a sentient part and an insentient. They want nature, they say, to have these counteractive and contraposed positives and negatives of the same kind counterbalanced, as it were. But if it is ridiculous to require an antithesis of sentient and insentient within the class of living things, or an antithesis of imaginative and unimaginative, seeing that it is the nature of every creature with a soul to be sentient and imaginative from the hour of its birth, so he, also, is unreasonable who demands a division of the living into a rational and an irrational part - and that, too, when he is arguing with men who believe that nothing is endowed with sensation which does not also partake of intelligence and that there is no living thing which does not naturally <pb xml:id="v.12.p.329"/> possess both opinion and reason, just as it has sensation and appetite. For nature, which, they<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aristotle and Theophrastus <foreign xml:lang="lat">passim</foreign>; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> also <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 646 c, 698 b.</note> rightly say, does everything with some purpose and to some end, did not create the sentient creature merely to be sentient when something happens to it. No, for there are in the world many things friendly to it, many also hostile; and it could not survive for a moment if it had not learned to give the one sort a wide berth while freely mixing with the other. It is, to be sure, sensation that enables each creature to recognize both kinds; but the acts of seizing or pursuing that ensue upon the perception of what is beneficial, as well as the eluding or fleeing of what is destructive or painful, could by no means occur in creatures naturally incapable of some sort of reasoning and judging, remembering and attending. Those beings, then, which you deprive of all expectation, memory, design, or preparation, and of all hopes, fears, desires, or griefs - they will have no use for eyes or ears either, even though they have them. Indeed, it would be better to be rid of all sensation and imagination that has nothing to make use of it, rather than to know toil and distress and pain while not possessing any means of averting them.</said> </p>

There can be no blindness in an organ which was not created to see, or lameness in a part which was not designed for walking; nor would you ever describe an animal without a tongue as stuttering, or one voiceless by nature as inarticulate. And in the same way you would not call delirious or witless or mad anything that was not endowed by Nature with reason or intelligence or understanding; for it is impossible to ail where you have no faculty of which the ailment is a deficiency or loss or some other kind of impairment.

And let us not declare that this is a nicety of perception unaided by reason; it is, rather, a syllogistic conclusion developed from the evidence of perception: <q>What makes noise must be in motion; what is in motion is not frozen; what is not frozen is liquid; what is liquid gives way.</q> So logicians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Specifically Chrysippus (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">S.V.F.</title> ii, pp. 726 f.). <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Sextus Empiricus, <title rend="italic">Outlines of Pyrrhonism</title>, i. 69 (the whole passage i. 62-72 is worth reading); Aelian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Natura Animal.</title> vi. 59; Philo, 45 (p. 122).</note> assert that a dog, at a point where many paths split off, makes use of a multiple disjunctive<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the form of the syllogism see Diogenes Laertius, vii. 81.</note> argument and reasons with himself: <q>Either the wild beast has taken this <pb xml:id="v.12.p.379"/> path, or this, or this.

From that day on the jay was speechless and mute, not letting out even a peep to request the necessities of life; so those who habitually passed the place and had formerly wondered at her voice, were now even more astonished at her silence. Some suspected that she had been poisoned by rival bird-trainers, but most conjectured that the trumpets had blasted her hearing and that her voice had been simultaneously extinguished. Now neither of these guesses was correct: it was self-discipline, it would seem, and her talent for mimicry that had sought an inner retreat as she refitted and prepared her voice like a musical instrument.

	<head>APPENDIX: CLASSIFIED ZOOLOGICAL INDEX</head> 
<p rend="indent">A word of caution is needed: Plutarch emphatically was no naturalist. The zoological material is a hodge-podge of misinformation dredged up from various zoological sources, seasoned here and there with personal contributions, which are not necessarily correct. In the original sources, terms for specific types of animals were probably used with considerable precision. It is my impression that Plutarch often had only a vague idea of the meaning of such terms. For example, he consistently uses the specific term for a rock dove, but probably had in mind any type of domestic dove. Similarly, dorcas was used in Greece commonly as a term for the roedeer, but in Asia Minor for the common gazelle. In the original sources the word probably denoted specifically one or the other, depending on where the man lived; but Plutarch may well have used the term vaguely for any type of small deer, including gazelles and antelopes.
