					<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
					<p> There can be little doubt that Plutarch composed this pleasant work from
							<foreign xml:lang="lat">commentarii</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc"
							>ὑπομνήματα</foreign>) derived not merely from Aristotle (mentioned
						specifically in 965 d and quoted often), but also from various other
						compendia, the remains of which are to be seen in Aelian's and Pliny's
						natural histories and elsewhere.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
							anchored="true">On the sources see Ziegler's article <title>Plutarchos</title> in Pauly-Wissowa, col. 738, and,
							of the authorities he cites, particularly Wellmann's papers in <title
								rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxvi, xxvii, and li, and Max
							Schuster, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Untersuchungen zu
								Plutarchs De Sollertia Animalium</title> (Diss. Munich, 1917). There
							is also an amusing work of Philo, surviving only in an Armenian version,
							which is most conveniently accessible in Aucher's Latin translation in
							vol. 8 of the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Bibliotheca
								Sacra</title> edition (Schwickert, Leipzig, 1830): <title
								xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Ratione quam habere etiam Bruta
								Animalia dicebat Alexander</title>. In the first part of this work
							Alexander presents the arguments for animal intelligence, which Philo
							himself attempts to refute in a somewhat summary fashion at the end. The
							occasional parallels with Plutarch will be cited as Philo, with Aucher's
							section and page numbers. Antigonus of Carystus, <title xml:lang="lat"
								rend="italic">Historia Mirabilium</title>, will be cited from O.
							Keller's edition of the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Naturalium
								Rerum Scriptores Graeci</title> (Teubner, 1877) and Aelian's <title
								xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Natura Animalium</title> from R.
							Hercher's Teubner (not Didot) edition.</note> In fact, if one reads
						Plutarch and Aelian and Pliny side by side, one may acquire the impression
						that they had before them substantially the same sources, and that these
						were numerous. Whereas <pb xml:id="v.12.p.312"/> Pliny and Aelian appear to
						adopt nearly everything their authorities may have offered (for they were
						writing factual commentaries), Plutarch, as always, selects. It is possible,
						in some cases, that Plutarch's mss. (which are not good and also contain
						lacunae) may have been interpolated from Aelian's ; and the reverse is
						likewise possible. This is a very difficult matter, but the hope may be
						entertained that some main sources of Plutarch and Aelian, if not of Pliny,
						and the as yet unassessed evidence of Philo, may eventually be disentangled
						for substantial sections, though this is not the place to attempt such a
						feat. </p>
					<p> The title is not well chosen, since the victory is awarded to neither side.
						The real point of the dialogue seems to be, in its second as well as its
						first part, that all animals of whatever provenance are intelligent.<note
							resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Schuster thinks, rather,
							that Plutarch's chief aim is to make clear a moral and juridical
							relationship between man and beasts.</note> The occasionally bantering
						tone may serve to indicate that we have before us something of a school
						exercise from Plutarch's own academy, with perhaps the first draft of the
						second part composed by pupils.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
							anchored="true">See Schuster, pp. 57 ff. Aristotimus and Phaedimus were
							doubtless actual pupils of Plutarch.</note> Note the carefully
						established details : the contest will take place at a fixed time (960 b,
						963 b) before their fellow-pupils and a specially appointed judge (965 c-e).
						More or less elaborate preparation has been made by the contestants (960 b,
						975 d).<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch lays
							special emphasis on preparation: <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic"
								>Mor.</title> 80 d, 652 b.</note> Because of the occasion the school
						has been granted a holiday. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.313"/>
					</p>
					<p> In the first part (chapters 1-8), the author demonstrates through the
						authoritarian voice of his own father that the Stoics, in so far as they
						affirm the irrationality of animals, contradict their own tenets. The second
						part proves that animals of all kinds are rational (chapters 9-36) ; the
						last small section, while refusing to award first honours in the debate,
						appears to contain Plutarch's exhortation to his pupils to continue the
						fight against the Stoics. For an excellent summary with sympathetic comments
						see E. R. Dodds, <title rend="italic">Greece and Rome</title>, ii (1932/3),
						pp. 104-105. </p>
					<p> D' Agostino<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">V. D'
							Agostino, <title xml:lang="ita" rend="italic">Archivo Italiano di
								Psicologia</title>, xi (1933), pp. 21 ff., a useful summarizing
							article.</note> and others have shown that there is little originality
						in Plutarch's animal psychology, while not denying our author considerable
						vivacity in presentation. While it is true that whole sections, like 976
						a-d, are drawn from the identical source that Aelian (<title xml:lang="lat"
							rend="italic">De Natura Animalium</title>, viii. 4-6) used, yet one has
						only to compare the use these authors have made of precisely the same
						material to recognize the great superiority of Plutarch. The principal
						sources have been disputed<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
							anchored="true">Hirzel, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Der
								Dialog</title>, ii, p. 179, n. 1. All of Hirzel's discussion is
							worth reading, though there are occasional slips, as when he affirms (p.
							173, n. 2) that the story in 969 e f. goes back to Plutarch's own
							experience. This is quite unlikely in view of Aelian's version of the
							same story; nor has Aelian drawn from Plutarch as some, including
							Wyttenbach, have thought.</note>: Chrysippus, Theophrastus, Hagnon,
						Alexander of Myndus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For
							the difficulty and danger involved in identifying the sources exactly
							see the lists of authorities furnished by Pliny in his first book.
							Alexander of Myndus, for example, does not appear at all as a source for
							books 8-11.</note> Juba, Xenocrates have all been suggested, but there
						can be little doubt (as <pb xml:id="v.12.p.314"/> with <title xml:lang="lat"
							rend="italic">De Tranquillitate</title>
						<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the introduction in
							the Loeb edition.</note> and many other works) that a considerable
						variety of sources has been utilized. Now that Schläpfer<note resp="ed"
							place="unspecified" anchored="true">
							<title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Plutarch und die klassischen
								Dichter</title>, Zürich, 1950, especially pp. 59-60.</note> has
						demonstrated that Plutarch had himself read and meditated upon great
						sections of classical poetry, critics may perhaps be more willing to allow
						our author first-hand familiarity with a wider range of prose, and works of
						reference as well. </p>
					<p> It is by no means impossible that the work is incomplete in our mss. ; there
						are, at least, several demonstrable lacunae and it is possible that it was
						considerably longer and may even have justified its title when it left
						Plutarch's hands. </p>
					<p> As for the date of the dialogue, the <foreign xml:lang="lat">terminus post
							quem</foreign> is a.d. 70 (not 79, as it cannot be certainly inferred
						from 974 a that Vespasian was then dead) ; it is probably a work of
						Plutarch's youth, preceding in any case the <title rend="italic"
							>Lives</title> and the <title rend="italic">Symposiacs</title>. It may
						well date from Plutarch's anti-Stoic period which produced the <title
							xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Facie</title>, the <title
							xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Communibus Notitiis</title>, and the
						other anti-Chrysippean polemics. It has much in common with the <title
							rend="italic">Gryllus</title> and the fragments of <title
							xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Esu Carnium</title> and some
						correspondence with the <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic"
							>Amatorius</title>.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"
							>But allowance must be made for exaggerated and partially false premises
							in Hartman, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>,
							p. 567. A modified chronological scheme of Plutarch's writings has
							lately been proposed by T. Sinko (<emph>Polish Acad. Cracow</emph>,
							1947), but it is too complicated to be examined here.</note> It may, in
						fact, have been written during nearly the same period as that in which the
						elder Pliny (whose preface is dated a.d. 77) was compiling his own <title
							rend="italic">Natural History</title>. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.315"/>
					</p>
					<p> The citations in D'Arcy Thompson's Oxford translation of Aristotle's <title
							xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Historia Animalium</title>
						<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Loeb edition of A.
							L. Peck is still awaited at this date of writing. It should be noted
							that quotations from the ninth book, in particular, are liable to
							peculiar suspicion and may not proceed from the great naturalist
							himself.</note> are somewhat inaccurate and inconsistent, being, as he
						says, <q type="unspecified">compiled at various times and at long intervals
							during many years.</q> Nevertheless the work is of great value and it
						may be hoped that the notes in this edition that rely on it (and these are
						many) have been adequately sifted. Also to be constantly and gratefully
						consulted are Thompson's <title rend="italic">A Glossary of Greek
							Fishes</title> (Oxford, 1947) and <title rend="italic">A Glossary of
							Greek Birds</title> (2nd edition, Oxford, 1936). There will be many
						references to Thompson's Aristotle ; but if the creature in question is a
						bird or a fish, it is to be understood that supplementary and often
						corrective material is to be found in the Glossaries. There is, further, a
						tribute of admiration due to A. W. Mair's L.C.L. edition of Oppian, with its
						exhaustive notes.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Even
							the extremely hostile review in <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic"
								>Phil. Woch.</title> li (1931), pp. 1569 ff., exempts the notes from
							censure.</note> Rackham (L.C.L. Pliny, vol. Ill, books viii-xi) is very
						interesting on the text, but has almost completely denied himself the
						privilege of citing parallel passages. </p>
					<p> The debunking of many of Plutarch's stories, if such a task is necessary,
						has been pleasantly done in the leisurely course of Bergen Evans' <title
							rend="italic">The Natural History of Nonsense</title> (New York, 1946).
						It should be added, however, that modern scientific speculation is
						approaching somewhat closer to one of Plutarch's main tenets, if one may
						judge from such a work as W. C. Allee's <title rend="italic">Coöperation
							Among Animals</title> (New York, 1951 : a revision of his earlier <title
							rend="italic">The Social Life of</title>
						<pb xml:id="v.12.p.316"/>
						<title rend="italic">Animals</title>) ; and on the thesis of animal
						intelligence see Evans himself, p. 173, and the authorities cited there,
						note 1. </p>
					<p> Both the translation and the notes of this and the following essays have
						benefited immeasurably from an exhaustive criticism generously given them by
						Professor Alfred C. Andrews of the University of Miami, Florida. He has in
						fact supplied a number of valuable notes and also the Appendix, a classified
						zoological index. It must be understood, however, that any errors remaining
						are to be attributed solely to the editor.<note resp="ed"
							place="unspecified" anchored="true">Since our text was formed and our
							translation and notes composed a year or more before the appearance of
							the new Teubner edition, almost no new references have been added which
							are not purely textual. The curious reader is referred to Hubert's
							wealth of illustration to supplement our contributions.</note>
					</p>
					<p> The dialogue is no. 147 in the catalogue of Lamprias. According to this
						document Plutarch wrote another work (no. 135) on the same subject: <title
							rend="italic">Do Beasts Possess Reason</title>? But no. 127, <foreign
							xml:lang="grc">Περὶ ζώλων ἀλόγων ποιητικός</foreign>, is probably the
						same as our <title rend="italic">Gryllus</title>, the following dialogue in
						this edition. </p>

							There can be no blindness in an organ which was not created to see, or
							lameness in a part which was not designed for walking ; nor would you
							ever describe an animal without a tongue as stuttering, or one voiceless
							by nature as inarticulate. And in the same way you would not call
							delirious or witless or mad anything that was not endowed by Nature with
							reason or intelligence or understanding ; for it is impossible to ail
							where you have no faculty of which the ailment is a deficiency or loss
							or some other kind of impairment. Yet certainly you have encountered mad
							dogs, and I have also known of mad horses; and there are some who say

							and madness is an ailment of that faculty when it becomes disturbed and
							disordered. For we observe no derangement either of the dogs' sight or
							of their hearing; yet, just as when a human being suffers from
							melancholy or insanity, anyone is absurd who does not admit that it is

					<head>APPENDIX: CLASSIFIED ZOOLOGICAL INDEX</head>
					<p> A word of caution is needed : Plutarch emphatically was no naturalist. The
						zoological material is a hodge-podge of misinformation dredged up from
						various zoological sources, seasoned here and there with personal
						contributions, which are not necessarily correct. In the original sources,
						terms for specific types of animals were probably used with considerable
						precision. It is my impression that Plutarch often had only a vague idea of
						the meaning of such terms. For example, he consistently uses the specific
						term for a rock dove, but probably had in mind any type of domestic dove.
						Similarly, dorcas was used in Greece commonly as a term for the roedeer, but
						in Asia Minor for the common gazelle. In the original sources the word
						probably denoted specifically one or the other, depending on where the man
						lived ; but Plutarch may well have used the term vaguely for any type of
						small deer, including gazelles and antelopes. Alfred C. Andrews </p>
