<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.227"/> 
   <head>INTRODUCTION</head> 
   <p>This little essay, or open letter to Favorinus, is not written in a controversial spirit, though a few sharp comments are made from time to time. Having established (chapters 5-7) that an element of Cold really exists, Plutarch proceeds to consider what that element may be. Since fire is obviously excluded, can it be air, as the Stoics believe (8-12), or water, as Empedocles, and an early Peripatetic, Strato, hold (13-16)? Or, indeed, may it be earth itself (17-22)? This latter opinion is apparently put forward by Plutarch as an original contribution to theoretical physics and there is no reason to believe it is not his. The essay closes, however, with a recommendation to scepticism,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See J. Schröter, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Plutarchs Stellung zur Skepsis</title> (Greifswald, 1911), pp. 23 and 40. He compares other recomendations to the suspension of judgement, such as <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 430 f - 431 a. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Hartman, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>, pp. 253 f.</note> so that our author may not have regarded his attempted proof as cogent, as indeed it is not.</p> 
   <p rend="indent">The work was probably written in Delphi (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 953 c-d and e) after A.D. 107-(949 e, note) and addressed to the young philosopher Favorinus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the details see Ziegler’s article on Plutarch in Pauly-Wissowa, <title rend="italic">RE</title>, col. 675.</note> the great lover of Aristotle (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 734 f), who is also a speaker in <title rend="italic">Symposiacs</title>, viii. 10. Though Favorinus was in all <pb xml:id="v.12.p.228"/> likelihood some twenty years younger than Plutarch, the two men dedicated several works to each other.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Lamprias cat. 132: Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Letter to Favorinus on Friendship</title> (or <title rend="italic">The Use of Friends</title>); Galen, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">de Opt. Doctr.</title> (i. 41 K): Favorinus’s <title rend="italic">Plutarch, or On the Academic Disposition</title>. See also Suidas, <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαβωρῖνος</foreign>.</note> In the present essay it is, perhaps, odd that of the three quotations from Aristotle one is a rebuke (950 b), one is apparently a partial miscitation (948 a, note), while the third is of no importance. No doubt it is in virtue of Favorinus’ youth that his idol is treated so lightly, and that the sceptical note is sounded so firmly at the end. The young Peripatetic was also quoted by Plutarch (for partial refutation) in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 271 c; but Plutarch (if Tarn<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Alexander the Great</title>, ii. 298 f.</note> and others are right) became much more favourable to Peripatetics later in his life (e.g. in the <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>). </p> 
   <p rend="indent">Bernardakis’s text of this work is one of his most unsatisfactory; even for an <foreign xml:lang="lat">editio minor</foreign> it is careless and confused to a deplorable extent. Nor are the means of correcting and supplementing it at hand, the fifth Teubner volume being still, one fears, in the remote future. Then, too. the only photographs available were those of E and Β. which are not likely to add much to our knowledge.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the recent brisk controversy as to their relationship: Manton, <title rend="italic">Class. Quart.</title> xliii (1949), pp. 97-104; Hubert, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</title> xciii (1950), pp. 330-336; Einarson and De Lacy, <title rend="italic">Class. Phil.</title> xlvi (1951), p. 110, n. 56; Flaceliere, ed. Plutarch, <title rend="italic">Amatorius</title>, pp. 35 ff. The evidence in this essay, for what it may be worth, seems to make it unlikely that B was here copied from either E or an immediate descendant; they both appear to go back to a common ancestor, perhaps through several intermediaries: see, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign>, 951 a, b, d, 953 e. See now Cherniss <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, pp. 27, note <emph>a</emph>; 31, 32.</note> Consequently the only course that seemed prudent was to return to <pb xml:id="v.12.p.229"/> Wyttenbach wherever there was a reasonable doubt. Bernardakis has been tacitly corrected (or altered, whichever it may be) in a good many places. This has been done consistently when both E and Β agree with Wyttenbach’s and Hutten’s silence; Bernardakis’s silence, unfortunately, appears to have no significance. </p> 
   <p rend="indent">The work is no. 90 in the catalogue of Lamprias. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.231"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Is there, then, Favorinus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the introduction to this essay.</note> an active principle or substance of Cold (as fire is of Heat) through the presence of which and through participation in which everything else becomes cold? Or is coldness rather a negation of warmth, as they say darkness is of light and rest of motion? Cold, indeed, seems to have the quality of being stationary, as heat has that of motion; while the cooling off of hot things is not caused by the presence of any force,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As, for instance, the force of fire.</note> but merely by the displacement of heat, for it can be seen to depart completely at the same time as the remainder cools off. The steam, for example, which boiling water emits, is expelled in company with the departing heat; that is why the amount becomes less by cooling off; for this removes the heat and nothing else takes its place. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">First of all, must we not be wary of one point in this argument ? It eliminates many obvious forces by considering them not to be qualities or properties, but merely the negation of qualities or properties, weight being the negation of lightness and hardness that of softness, black that of white, and bitter that of sweet, and so in any other case where there is a natural opposition of forces rather than a relation of positive and negative. Another point is that all negation is inert and unproductive: blindness, for <pb xml:id="v.12.p.233"/> example, and deafness, silence or death. Here you have the defection of a definite form and the annihilation of a reality, not something that is in itself a part of nature or reality. It is the nature of coldness, however, to produce affects and alterations in bodies that it enters no less than those caused by heat. Many objects can be frozen solid, or become condensed or made viscous, by cold.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As steam is condensed and oil becomes viscous.</note> Moreover, the property whereby coldness promotes rest and resists motion is not inert, but acts by pressure and resistance. being constrictive and preservative because of its strength. This explains how, though negation is a disappearance and departure of the contrary force, many things may yet become<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The verb is ambiguous: <q>become cold</q> or <q>dry</q> or perhaps <q>congealed.</q> </note> cold while all the time containing within themselves considerable warmth. There are even some objects which cold solidifies and consolidates the more readily the hotter they are: steel, for example, plunged in water. The Stoics<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 1052 f; von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">S.V.F.</title> ii, pp. 134, 222; and see Hartman’s explanation, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarcho</title>, p. 566. Von Arnim thinks that the next five chapters also contain Stoic material.</note> also affirm that in the bodies of infant children the breath is tempered by cooling and, from being a physical substance, becomes a soul. This, however, is debatable; yet since there are many other effects which may be seen to be produced through the agency of cold, we are not justified in regarding it as a negation. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Besides, a negation does not permit degrees of less or more. Surely nobody will affirm that one blind man is blinder than another, or one dumb man more silent than another, or one corpse deader than its fellow; but among cold things there is a wide range of deviation from much to little, from very cold to not very, and, generally speaking, in degrees of intensity <pb xml:id="v.12.p.235"/> and remission, just as there is in hot things. This occurs because the matter involved is in different cases acted upon by the opposing forces with more or less intensity; it thus exhibits degrees of one or the other, and so of hot and cold. There is, in fact, no such thing as a blending of positive qualities with negative ones, nor may any positive force accept the assault of the negation that corresponds to it or take it into partnership; instead it gives place to it. Now hot things do admit a blending with cold up to a point, just as do black with white, high notes with low, sweet tastes with sour; and this harmonious association of colours and sounds, drugs and sauces, produces many combinations that are pleasant and grateful to the senses. </p> 
   <p rend="indent">For the opposition of a negation to a positive quality is an irreconcilable hostility, since the existence of the one is the annihilation of the other. The other opposition, however, of positive forces, if it occurs in due measure, is often operative in the arts, and very often indeed in various phenomena of nature, especially in connexion with the weather and the seasons and those matters from which the god derives his title of harmonizer and musician, because he organizes and regulates them. He does not receive these names merely for bringing sounds of high and low pitch, or black and white colours, into harmonious fellowship, but because he has authority over the association and disunion of heat and cold in the universe, to see that they observe due measure in their combination and separation, and because, by eliminating the excess of either, he brings both into proper order. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, we find that cold can be perceived <pb xml:id="v.12.p.237"/> as well as heat; but mere negation cannot be seen or heard or touched or recognized by the other senses. Perception, in fact, must be of something existent; but where nothing existent is observed, privation may be inferred, being the negation of existence, as blindness is of sight, silence of sound, void and emptiness of matter. We cannot perceive a void by touch; but where no matter can be touched, void is inferred. Nor can we hear silence; yet, even though we hear nothing, we infer silence. Nor, in the same way, is sense active when things are unseen or bare<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As, when a hill has been stripped of timber, you cannot see the trees.</note>; there is, rather, inference from the negation of perception. If, therefore, cold were a privation of warmth, we ought not to be able to feel it, but only to infer it from the deficiency in warmth; but if cold is perceived by the contraction and condensation of our flesh (just as heat is by the warming and loosening of it), clearly there is some special first principle and source of coldness, just as there is of heat. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">And yet another point: privation of any sort is something simple and uncomplicated, whereas substances have many differences and powers. Silence, for example, is of only one kind, while sound varies, sometimes annoying, at other times delighting, the perception. Both colours and figures show the same variation, for they produce different effects on different occasions when they meet the eye; but that which cannot be touched and is without colour or any quality whatever, admits no difference, but is always the same. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent">Is cold, then, so like this sort of privation that <pb xml:id="v.12.p.239"/> it produces no effects that differ ? Or is the contrary true: Do not great and useful pleasures accrue to our bodies from the presence of cold, as well as mighty detriments and pains and depressions, before which the heat does not always depart and quit the field ? Often, rather, though cut off within, it makes a stand and gives battle. This struggle of hot and cold is called shivering or shaking; and if heat is overcome, freezing and torpor set in; but if cold is defeated, there is diffused through the body a relaxed and pleasantly warm sensation which Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign>, <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, vi. 156; <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, xxiii. 598, 600; and <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 454 d, 735 f.</note> calls <q>to be aglow.</q> Surely these facts are obvious to everyone; and it is chiefly by these effects that cold is shown to be in opposition to heat, not as a negation or privation, but as one substance or one state<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Heat, for example, may be said to be a <q>state</q> or condition of metal.</note> to another: it is not a mere destruction or abolition of heat, but a positive substance or force. Otherwise we might just as well exclude winter from the list of seasons or the northerly blasts from that of winds, on the pretext that they are only a deficiency of hot weather or southerly gales and have no proper origin of their own. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent">Furthermore, given four primary bodies in the universe<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Diels-Kranz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> <hi rend="super">5</hi>, i, pp. 315 ff., Empedocles, frag. B 17. The doctrine is clearly stated by, for example, Pliny, <title rend="italic">Nat. Hist.</title> ii. 10. The author of the <title rend="italic">Epinomis</title> (981 c) adds a fifth element, aether (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 951 d <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>).</note> which, because of their quantity, simplicity, and potentiality, most judges regard as being the elements or first principles of everything else - I mean fire, water, air, and earth - the number of primary, simple qualities must be the same. And what should these be but warmth and cold, dryness <pb xml:id="v.12.p.241"/> and moisture, which by their very nature cause all the elements to act and be acted upon?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Post translates his emendation: <q>by which all things are qualified through the natural action of the elements,</q> pointing out that elements have nothing but size, shape, and motion. Fire causes heat, but its atoms are not themselves hot.</note> Just as in grammar we have elements long and short and in music elements high and low in pitch - and in neither case is one element merely a negation of the other - so also in physical bodies we must assume an elementary opposition of wet to dry and cold to hot, and in this way we shall be faithful both to logic and to experience. Or are we, as old Anaximenes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels-Kranz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> <hi rend="super">5</hi>, i, p. 95; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Diller, <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, lxvii, pp. 35 f.</note> maintained, to leave neither hot nor cold in the realm of being, but to treat them as states belonging equally to any matter and occurring as a result of changes within it ? He affirms, in fact, that anything which undergoes contraction and condensation of matter is cold, while anything that suffers rarefaction and distention - this comes close to his own phrasing - is hot. So there is no contradiction in the remark that the man blew both hot and cold,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Aesop’s <title rend="italic">Fables</title> (no. 60 in Chambry’s Bude edition, vol. i, pp. 131 ff.), where the satyr renounces friendship with the man because the latter blows both hot and cold through the same mouth.</note> for breath grows cold when it is compressed and condensed by the lips; but when it is expelled from the mouth left slack, it becomes hot through rarefaction. Aristotle,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Probably (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> the note on 950 b <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>) <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Problemata</title>, xxxiv. 7 (964 a 10 ff.); contrast Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 79 a-c.</note> however, holds that in this Anaximenes was mistaken: when the mouth is slack, what is exhaled is warm air from our own bodies; but when we compress the lips and blow, it is not air from ourselves, but the cold air in front of the mouth that is propelled forward and makes contact. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.243"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">Perhaps we should now leave the question whether heat and cold are substances; if so, let us advance the argument to the next point and inquire what sort of substance coldness has, and what is its first principle and nature. Now those who affirm that there are certain uneven, triangular formations in our bodies<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 53 c, 54 b-c.</note> and that shivering and trembling, shuddering and the like manifestations, proceed from this rough irregularity, even if they are wrong in the particulars, at least derive the first principle from the proper place; for the investigation should begin, as it were from the very hearth,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or, perhaps, <q>with Hestia,</q> as the first principle of the cosmos (see, for example, Ritter, on Plato, <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, 247 a, pp. 123-124 of his edition). This passage is somewhat obscurely quoted below in 954 f. There were already three different interpretations known to the scholiast on Plato, <title rend="italic">Euthyphro</title>, 3 a (p. 2, ed. Greene).</note> from the substance of all things. This is, it would seem, the great difference between a philosopher and a physician or a farmer or a flute-player; for the latter are content to examine the causes most remote from the first cause, since as soon as the most immediate cause of an effect is grasped - that fever is brought about by exertion or an overflow of blood, that rusting of grain is caused by days of blazing sun after a rain, that a low note is produced by the angle and construction of the pipes - that is enough to enable a technician to do his proper job. But when the natural philosopher sets out to find the truth as a matter of speculative knowledge, the discovery of immediate causes is not the end, but the beginning of his journey to the first and highest causes. This is the reason why Plato and Democritus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wyttenbach suggested <q>Xenocrates</q> for <q>Democritus</q> in this passage, which may be right, though his proposal is not considered by either Mullach or Heinze.</note> when they were inquiring into the causes of heat and heaviness, were right not to stop their investigation with earth and fire, but <pb xml:id="v.12.p.245"/> to go on carrying back sensible phenomena to rational origins until they reached, as it were, the minimum number of seeds. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p rend="indent">Nevertheless it is better for us first to attack things perceptible to the senses,in which Empedocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diels-Kranz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> <hi rend="super">5</hi>, i, p. 319, frag.

(chapters 17-22).</note> But let us examine Stoic doctrine before the others. </p> 
   <p rend="indent">Since fire is not only warm but bright, the opposite natural entity (they say) must be both cold and dark: as gloomy is the opposite of bright, so is cold of hot. Besides, as darkness confounds the sight, so cold confuses the sense of touch. Heat, on the other hand, transmits the sensation of touching, as brightness does that of seeing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p rend="indent">But the argument which attributes it to water finds in the same way facts to support it; Empedocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels-Kranz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> <hi rend="super">5</hi>, i, p. 319, frag.

On Empedocles’ meaning see Cherniss, <title rend="italic">Aristotle’s Criticism of the Presocratics</title>, p. 110.</note> says something like this: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Behold the sun, everywhere bright and warm; </l> <l>And then the rain, to all men dark and cold.</l> </quote> By thus setting cold against hot, as he does dark against bright, he has given us to understand that dark and cold belong to the same substance, as do also bright and hot. And our senses bear witness that darkness is an attribute of water, not of air, since nothing, to put it simply, is blackened by air and everything is by water.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 364 b.</note> For if you throw the whitest wool or the whitest garment into water, it will come <pb xml:id="v.12.p.255"/> out black and it will remain black until the moisture is evaporated by heat or is squeezed out by some sort of wringing or pressure. When a patch of ground is sprinkled, the spots which are covered by the drops turn black, but the rest remains as it was. In fact, of water itself the deepest looks the darkest because there is so much of it, while those parts that lie near the air flash and sparkle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 952 f <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note>; and of the other liquids oil is the most transparent, as containing the most air. A proof of this is its lightness, by reason of which it maintains itself on the surface of all other things, buoyed up by the air.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 696 b, 702 b.</note> If it is sprinkled upon the waves, it will calm the sea, not because it is so smooth that the winds slip off it, as Aristotle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Problemata</title>, 961 a 23 ff., though this work is surely not by Aristotle in the form in which it has come down to us.</note> affirmed; but because the waves are dissipated when they are struck by any moist substance. But it is peculiar to oil that it provides light and sight at the bottom since the moist elements are interspersed with air; it is, in fact, not only on the surface that it provides light for those who pass the night at sea; it does so also for sponge-divers<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 981 e <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>; Oppian, <title rend="italic">Hal.</title> v. 638 ff.</note> below the surface when it is blown out of their mouths. Air, therefore, has no greater proportion of darkness than water has, and it has less cold. Certainly oil, which has more air than any other moist substance, is least cold; and when it freezes, it forms a soft jelly: the air that is intermixed does not permit it to freeze hard. They dip needles, iron clasps, and all delicate artifacts in oil rather than in water, fearing that the water’s excessive frigidity <pb xml:id="v.12.p.257"/> may distort them. It is, in fact, fairer to judge the argument by this evidence than by that of colour, since snow and hail and ice are at their brightest when they are coldest. Moreover, pitch is both hotter and darker than honey. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p rend="indent">I am surprised, nevertheless, when those who maintain that the air is cold because it is dark do not perceive that others think it must be hot because it is light. For darkness is not so closely connected and akin to cold as heaviness and stability are; many things, in fact, which have no heat are bright, but nothing cold is buoyant, light, and soaring. Why, the very clouds, as long as they are akin to the substance of air, float aloft; but as soon as they change to moisture, they fall at once and lose their lightness no less than their warmth as coldness grows within them. Contrariwise, when heat supervenes, they reverse the movement again, for their substance begins to soar as soon as it has changed to air. </p> 
   <p rend="indent">Nor is the argument from destruction true either; for when anything is destroyed, it does not perish by becoming its opposite, though it does perish by the action of its opposite, as fire, for instance, is changed by water into air.

For if anything into which the thing destroyed changes is its opposite, why will fire, any more than water, seem opposite to air ? For air changes into water by condensation, and into fire by rarefaction just as, on the other hand, water vanishes into air by rarefaction, but into earth by condensation. Now these processes take place, in my opinion, not because these elements are contrary or hostile to one another, but because they are in close affinity and relationship. But my opponents,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Presumably those who, in 950 d <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, claim that air is cold because it is dark.</note> whichever way they state their case, ruin their proof.

For clouds, mists, and flecks in the sky are not congelations, but condensations and thickenings of air that is moist and vaporous. But waterless, dry air never admits loss of heat to the point where such a change might occur. There are, in fact, mountains which do not know clouds or dew or mist because their peaks reach a region of pure air that has no humidity at all. From this fact it is especially obvious that it is the condensation and density below that contribute to air the cold, moist element that is found in combination with it. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p rend="indent">It is reasonable that the lower portion of large rivers should not freeze; for the upper portion, being frozen, does not transmit the exhalation which is, accordingly, shut in and turned back, and so provides heat for the deep waters. A demonstration of this is the fact that when the ice melts again a great quantity of vapour rises from the waters. This is also the reason why the bodies of animals are warmer in the winter, because the heat is driven inwards by the cold from without and they keep it within them. </p>

   <p rend="indent">That such a function of cold belongs not to air, but to water, may be demonstrated as follows from a fresh <pb xml:id="v.12.p.263"/> start. In the first place, it is improbable that air, which lies adjacent to the aether<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">On the difference between <foreign xml:lang="lat">aer</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">aether</foreign> see the lucid discussion of Guthrie, <title rend="italic">The Greeks and their Gods</title>, pp. 207 f.</note> and touches and is touched by the revolving fiery substance, should have a force that is contrary to that of aether. For one thing, it is impossible for two substances whose boundaries touch and are contiguous not to be acted upon by each other - and if acted upon, for the weaker not to be contaminated by the force that resides in the stronger. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that Nature has placed side by side destroyer and victim, as though she were the author of strife and dissension, not of union and harmony. She does, indeed, make use of opposites to constitute the universe; yet she does not employ them without a tempering element, or where they will collide. She disposes them rather so that a space is skipped and an inserted strip duly assigned whereby they will not destroy one another, but may enjoy communication and co-operation. And this strip is occupied by air, suffused as it is through a space under the fire<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, the aether. See also Cherniss, <foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> p. 126.</note> between it and water. It makes distribution both ways and receives contributions from both, being itself neither hot nor cold, but a blending and union of the two. When these are so fused, they meet without injury and the fused matter sends forth or takes to itself the opposing extremes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Heat and cold.</note> without violence. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p rend="indent">Then, too, air is everywhere equal; though neither winter nor cold is identical everywhere. It is no accident that some parts of the world are cold and damp, while others are hot and dry; it is due to the existence of a single substance that includes <pb xml:id="v.12.p.265"/> coldness and wetness in one. The greater part of Africa is hot and without water; while those who have travelled through Scythia, Thrace, and Pontus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch may be thinking of the old kingdom of Pontus, which included tracts south, east, and north of the Black Sea.</note> report that these regions have great lakes or marshes and are traversed by many deep rivers. As for the regions that lie between, those that are near lakes and marshes are especially cold because of the exhalations from the water, Posidonius,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The fragment has not yet been numbered in L. Edelstein’s forthcoming collection; for the literature see <title rend="italic">A.J.P.</title> lvii (1936), p. 301 and n. 61.</note> then, in affirming that the freshness and moistness of marsh air is the reason for the cold, has done nothing to disturb the plausibility of the argument; he has, rather, made it more plausible. For fresh air would not always seem colder if cold did not take its origin from moisture. So Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Odyssey</title>, v. 469.</note> spoke more truly when he affirmed <quote rend="blockquote">The river-air blows chill before the dawn,</quote> thereby indicating the source of coldness. </p> 
   <p rend="indent">Our senses, moreover, often deceive us and we imagine, when we touch cold garments or cold wool, that we are touching moist objects: this is because wet and cold have a common substance and their natures have a close affinity and relationship. In very cold climates the low temperature often breaks vessels whether they are of bronze or of clay - not, of course, when they are empty, but only when they are full and the water exerts pressure by means of its coldness. Theophrastus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The fragment is apparently omitted by Wimmer.</note> to be sure, declares that the air breaks these vessels, using the liquid as a spike. But take care<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This seems to be addressed to Favorinus’s Peripatetic sympathies.</note> that there isn’t more wit than <pb xml:id="v.12.p.267"/> truth in such a remark!

   <p rend="indent">Water, however, seems to be cold of itself, and primordially so. It is the antithesis, in its coldness, to the heat of fire, just as in its wetness to the dryness of fire, and in its heaviness to the other’s lightness. To sum up: fire is of a disintegrating and separative nature, while water is adhesive and retentive, holding and gluing together by means of its moistness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent">Now you must pursue the subject by comparing these arguments with those of my opponents. For Chrysippus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">S.V.F.</title> ii, p. 140; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 1053 e.</note> thinking that the air is primordially cold because it is also dark, merely mentioned those who affirm that water is at a greater distance from the aether<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See 951 d <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> than is air; and, wishing to make them some answer, he said, <q>If so, we might as well declare that even earth is primordially cold because it is at the <pb xml:id="v.12.p.269"/> greatest distance from the aether</q> - tossing off this argument as if it were utterly inadmissible and absurd. But I have a mind to maintain the thesis that earth too is not destitute of probable and convincing arguments, and I shall start with the one that Chrysippus has found most serviceable for air. And what is this ? Why, that it is primordially dark and cold. For if he takes these two pairs of opposing forces and assumes that one must of necessity accompany the other, there are, surely, innumerable oppositions and antipathies between the aether and the earth with which one might suppose this to be consistent. For it is not only opposed as heavy to light and as moving by gravity downwards, not upwards, or as dense to rare or as slow and stable to mobile and active, but as heaviest to lightest and as densest to rarest and, finally, as immovable of itself to self-moving, and as occupying the central position in the universe to revolving forever around a centre. It is not absurd, then, if oppositions so numerous and important carry with them the opposition of cold and heat as well. <q>Yes,</q> Chrysippus may say, <q>but fire is bright.</q> Is not the earth, then, dark ? Why, it is the darkest and most unilluminated of all things. Certainly air is first of all to participate in light; it is instantly altered and when it is saturated, it distributes illumination everywhere, lending itself to light as a body in which to reside. For when the sun arises, as one of the dithyrambic writers<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diehl, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Anthologia Lyrica Graeca</title>, ii. 302; Edmonds, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Lyra Graeca</title> (L.C.L.), iii, p. 460 (adespota no. 95).</note> has said, <quote rend="blockquote">It straightway fills the mighty home of the air-borne winds.</quote> <pb xml:id="v.12.p.271"/> Next the air, moving downward, infuses a part of its brightness into the lakes and the sea, and the depths of the rivers flash brightly,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aeschylus, <title rend="italic">Prometheus</title>, 90, and 950 b <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> to the extent that air is able to penetrate them. Of all bodies only the earth remains constantly without light, impenetrable to the illumination of sun or moon; yet it is warmed by them and permits the heat to sink in and warm it up to a slight depth. But because it is solid, earth does not give passage to light, but is encircled by light on its surface only, while the inner parts are called Darkness and Chaos and Hades<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Invisible Place, according to the etymology adopted above in 948 f.</note> - so that Erebus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Theogony</title>, 125.

The air, indeed, is saturated with darkness by the earth, just as it is with light by the sun. The unlighted portion of the air is the area of night, amounting to the space occupied by the earth’s shadow. This is the reason why men make use of the air out of doors even when it is night, as well as many beasts which do their pasturing in the darkness, since it retains some vestiges of light and dispersed glimmerings of radiance; but the house-bound man who is under a roof is utterly blind and without light inasmuch as there the earth envelops him from all directions. Whole skins, furthermore, and horns of animals do not let light pass through them because of their solidity; yet if sections are sawed off and polished, they become translucent when once the air has been mixed with them. It is also my opinion <pb xml:id="v.12.p.273"/> that the earth is called black by the poets,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign> Homer, <title rend="italic">Iliad</title>, ii. 699; Alcman, 36 (Edmonds, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Lyra Graeca</title>, i, p. 76; Diehl, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Anthologia Lyrica Graeca</title>, ii. 27); Sappho, 38 (Edmonds, <foreign xml:lang="lat">op. cit.</foreign> i, p. 208).</note> whenever they have occasion to do so, because of its murky and lightless characteristics. The result, then, of these considerations is that the much-prized antithesis of light and darkness belongs to earth rather than to air. </p> </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p rend="indent">This, however, has no relevance to the question under discussion; for it has been shown that there are many cold objects which are bright and many hot which are dull and dark. Yet there are qualities more closely connected that belong to coldness: heaviness, stability, solidity, and resistance to change. Air has no part at all in them, while earth has a greater share in all of them than water has. Cold, moreover, is perceptibly one of the hardest of things and it makes things hard and unyielding. Theophrastus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 184 Wimmer.</note> for instance, tells us that when frozen fish are dropped on the ground, they are broken and smashed to bits just like objects of glass or earthenware. And at Delphi you yourself heard, in the case of those who climbed Parnassus to rescue the Thyiades<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Thyiades were Attic women, devotees of Dionysus, who went every other year to Delphi to join in the midwinter festival. See Guthrie, <title rend="italic">The Greeks and their Gods</title>, p. 178.) The rites must have involved considerable discomfort and even risk, as Dodds says (edition of Euripides, <title rend="italic">Bacchae</title>, p. xi).</note> when they were trapped by a fierce gale and snowstorm, that their capes were frozen so stiff and wooden that when they were opened out, they broke and split apart. Excessive cold, because of its hardness and immobility, also stiffens the muscles and renders the tongue speechless, for it congeals the moist and tender parts of the body. <pb xml:id="v.12.p.275"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p rend="indent">In view of these considerations, regard the facts in the following light: every force, presumably, whenever it prevails, by a law of nature changes and turns into itself whatever it overcomes. What is mastered by heat is reduced to flames, what is mastered by wind turns to air; and anything that falls into the water, unless it gets out quickly, dissolves and liquefies. It follows, then, that whatever is completely frozen must turn into primordial cold. Now freezing is extreme refrigeration that terminates in a complete alteration and petrifaction when, since the cold has obtained complete mastery, the moist elements are frozen solid and the heat is squeezed out. This is the reason why the earth at its bottommost point is practically all solid frost and ice. For there undiluted and unmitigated cold abides at bay, thrust back to the point farthest removed from the flaming aether.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See 951 d above.</note> As for these features that are visible, cliffs and crags and rocks, Empedocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels-Kranz, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> <hi rend="super">5</hi>, i, p. 296, frag.

For the cold freezes substances to a varying degree, but hardest those of which it is naturally a primary constituent. Thus, if <pb xml:id="v.12.p.277"/> it is the nature of heat to lighten, the lightest object will have most heat, and if it is the nature of humidity to soften, the softest will have the most humidity; so, if it is also true that the nature of cold is to harden, then it must also follow that the hardest object will have the most cold - that is to say, just as the earth has. But what is coldest by nature is surely also primarily cold, so that the earth is in fact cold both primordially and naturally; and, of course, this is obvious even to the senses. Mud, in fact, is a colder thing than water; and men extinguish a fire by dumping earth upon it. Blacksmiths, when their iron becomes fiery and begins to melt, sprinkle on it marble chips and gypsum to check and cool it off before it melts too much. It is also true that dust cools the bodies of athletes and dries up their sweat. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p rend="indent">And what is the meaning of our demand for a yearly change of habitation ? In winter we retreat to the loftiest parts of our houses, those farthest from the earth, while in summer we require the lower parts, submerging ourselves and going in quest of comfortable retreats, as we make the best of a life in the embrace of mother earth. Since we do this, are we not guided to the earth by our perception of its coldness ? Do we not acknowledge it as the natural seat of primordial cold ? And surely our living by the sea in the winter is, in a way, an escape from the earth, since we abandon the land as far as possible because of the frost and wrap ourselves in salt sea air because it is warm. Then again, in the summer by reason of the heat, we long for the earth-born, upland air, not <pb xml:id="v.12.p.279"/> because it is itself chilly, but because it has sprung from the naturally and primordially cold and has been imbued with its earthy power, as steel is tempered by being plunged in water.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Mor.</title> 433 a and 946 c <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> And of flowing waters, also, the coldest are those that fall from rocks or mountains, and of well waters the deepest are the coldest; the air from outside does not, in the case of these wells, affect the water, so deep are they, while any such streams burst forth through pure unmixed earth, like the one at Taenarum,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch knew that the mouth of Hades was at Taenarum (Pindar, <title rend="italic">Pythian</title>, iv. 44) and transferred the Styx to that place.
