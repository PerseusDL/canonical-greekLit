            <p rend="indent">THE ancient statues of Castor and Pollux are called
				by the Spartans Docana; and they are two pieces of wood
				one over against the other joined with two other cross
				ends, and the community and undividedness of this consecrated representation seems to resemble the fraternal
				love of these two Gods. In like manner do I devote this
				discourse of Brotherly Love to you, Nigrinus and Quintus,
				as a gift in common betwixt you both, who well deserve
				it. For as to the things it advises to, you will, while you
				already practise them, seem rather to give your testimonies
				to them than to be exhorted by them. And the satisfaction you have from well-doing will give the more firm durance to your judgment, when you shall find yourselves approved by wise and judicious spectators. Aristarchus the
				father of Theodectes said indeed once, by way of flout
				of the Sophists, that formerly there were scarce seven
				Sophists to be found, but that in his time there could
				hardly be found so many who were not Sophists. But I
				see brotherly love is as scarce in our days as brotherly
				hatred was in ancient times, the instances of which have
				been publicly exposed in tragedies and public shows for
				their strangeness. But all in our times, when they have
				fortuned to have good brothers, do no less admire them
				than the famed Molionidae, that are supposed to have been
				born with their bodies joined with each other. And to
				enjoy in common their fathers’ wealth, friends, and slaves
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.37"/>
				
				is looked upon as incredible and prodigious, as if one soul
				should make use of the hands, feet, and eyes of two
				bodies.</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
            <p rend="indent">And Nature hath given us very near examples of the
				use of brothers, by contriving most of the necessary parts
				of our bodies double, as it were, brothers and twins,—as hands, feet, eyes, ears, nostrils,—thereby telling us
				that all these were thus distinguished for mutual benefit
				and assistance, and not for variance and discord. And
				when she parted the very hands into many and unequal
				fingers, she made them thereby the most curious and artificial of all our members; insomuch that the ancient philosopher Anaxagoras assigned the hands for the reason of
				all human knowledge and discretion. But the contrary to
				this seems the truth. For it is not man’s having hands
				that makes him the wisest animal, but his being naturally
				reasonable and capable of art was the reason why such
				organs were conferred upon him. And this also is most
				manifest to every one, that the reason why Nature out of
				one seed and source formed two, three, and more breth
				ren was not for difference and opposition, but that their
				being apart might render them the more capable of assisting one another. For those that were treble-bodied and
				hundred-handed, if any such there were, while they had
				all their members joined to each other, could do nothing
				without them or apart, as brothers can who can live together and travel, undertake public employments and practise husbandry, by one another’s help, if they preserve
				but that principle of benevolence and concord that Nature
				hath bestowed upon them. But if they do not, they will
				not at all differ in my opinion from feet that trip up one
				another, and fingers that are unnaturally writhen and distorted by one another. Yea, rather, as things moist and
				dry, cold and hot, partake of one nature in the same body,
				and by their consent and agreement engender the best
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.38"/>
				
				and most pleasant temperament and harmony,—without
				which (they say) there is neither satisfaction nor benefit in
				either riches or kingship itself, which renders man equal to
				Gods,—but if excess and discord befall them, they miserably ruinate and confound the animal; so, where there is an
				unanimous accordance amongst brothers, the family thrives
				and flourishes, and friends and acquaintance, like a well
				furnished choir, in all their actions, words, and thoughts
				maintain a delightful harmony.

            <p rend="indent">The Arcadian prophet in Herodotus was forced to
				supply the loss of one of his feet with an artificial one
				made of wood. But he who in a difference throws off his
				brother, and out of places of common resort takes a stranger for his comrade, seems to do no less than wilfully to
				mangle off a part of himself, attempting to repair the barbarous breach by the unnatural application of an extraneous
				member. For the ordinary inclinations and desires of men,
				being after some sort of society or other, sufficiently admonish them to set the highest value upon relations, to pay
				them all becoming respects, and to have a tender regard
				for their persons, nothing being more irksome to nature
				than to live in that destitution and solitude that denies
				them the happiness of a friend and the privilege of communication. Well therefore was that of Menander:

            <p rend="indent">For a great deal of friendship in the world is really no

					and regard for this kind of friendship, I know no reason
					ally one has to credit his kindest pretensions. For what
					shall we make of that man who in his complaisance, either
					in company or in his letters, salutes his friend by the name
					of brother, and yet scorns the company of that very brother

					For, as it is the part of a madman to adorn and set out
					the effigies of his brother, and in the mean time to abuse,
					beat, and maim his person; so, to value and honor the
					name in others but to hate and shun the brother himself is
					likewise an action of one that is not so well in his wits as he
					should be, and that never yet considered that Nature is a

      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
            <p rend="indent">I remember, when I was at Rome, I undertook an
				umpirage between two brothers. The one pretended to the
				study of philosophy, but (as it appeared by the event) with
				as little reason as to the relation of a brother. For, when
				I advised him that now was the time for him to show his
				philosophy, in the prudent managery and government of
				himself, whilst he was to treat with so dear a relation as a
				brother, and such a one especially as wanted those advantages of knowledge and education that he had; Your
				counsel, replied my philosopher, may do well with some
				illiterate novice or other; but, for my part, I see no such
				great matter in that which you so gravely allege, our being
				the issue of the same parents. True, I answered, you declare evidently enough that you make no account of your
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.40"/>
				
				affinity. But, by your favor, Mr. Philosopher, all of your
				profession that I ever was acquainted with, whatever their
				private opinions were, affirm both in their prose and poetry
				that, next to the Gods and the laws, her conservators and
				guardians, Nature had assigned to parents the highest
				honor and veneration. And there is nothing that men can
				perform more grateful to the Gods, than freely and constantly to pay their utmost acknowledgments and thanks
				to their parents, and those from whom they received their
				nurture and education; as, on the other hand, there is no
				greater argument of a profane and impious spirit than a
				contemptuous and surly behavior towards them. We are
				therefore enjoined to take heed of doing any one wrong.
				But he that demeans not himself with that exactness before
				his parents that all his actions may afford them a pleasure
				and satisfaction, though he give them no other distaste,
				is sure to undergo a very hard censure. Now what can
				more effectually express the gratitude of children to their
				parents, or what actions or dispositions in their children
				can be more delightful and rejoicing, than firm love and
				amity amongst them?</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
            <p rend="indent">And this may be understood by lesser instances. For,
				if parents will be displeased when an old servant that has
				been favored by them shall be reproached and flouted at
				by the children, or if the plants and the fields wherein
				they took pleasure be neglected, if the forgetting a dog or
				a beloved horse fret their humorsome age (that is very apt
				to be jealous of the love and obedience of their children),
				if, lastly, when they disaffect and despise those recreations
				that are pleasing to the eye and ear, or those juvenile exercises and games which they themselves formerly delighted
				in,—if at any of all these things the parents will be angry
				and offended,—how will they endure such discord as inflames their children with mutual malice and hatred, fills
				their mouths with opprobrious and execrating language,
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.41"/>
				
				and works them into such an inveteracy that the contrary
				and spiteful method of their actions declares a drift and
				design of ruining one another? If, I say, those smaller
				matters provoke their anger, how will all the rest be resented? Who can resolve me? But, on the other hand,
				where the love of brothers is such that they make up that
				distance Nature has placed them at (in respect of their
				different bodies) by united affections, insomuch that their
				studies and recreations, their earnest and their jest, keep
				true time and agree exactly together, such a pleasing consort amongst their children proves a nursing melody to the
				decayed parents to preserve, and maintain their quiet and
				peace in their old (though tender) age. For never was
				any father so intent upon oratory, ambitious of honor, or
				craving after riches, as fond of his children. Wherefore
				neither is it so great a satisfaction to hear them speak well,
				find them grow wealthy, or see them honored with the
				power of magistracy, as to be endeared to each other in
				mutual affection. Wherefore it is reported of Apollonis
				of Cyzicum, mother of King Eumenes and three other sons,
				Attalus, Philetaerus, and Athenaeus, that she always accounted herself happy and gave the Gods thanks, not so
				much for wealth or empire, as because she saw her three
				sons guarding the eldest, and him reigning securely among
				his armed brothers. And on the contrary, Artaxerxes, understanding that his son Ochus had laid a plot against his
				brothers, died with sorrow at the surprise. For the quarrels of brothers are pernicious, saith Euripides, but most of
				all to the parents themselves. For he that hates and
				plagues his brother can hardly forbear blaming the father
				who begot and the mother who bare him.</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
            <p rend="indent">Wherefore Pisistratus, being about to marry again,
				his sons being grown up to a mature age, gave them their
				deserved character of praise, together with the reason of
				his designs for a second marriage,—that he might be the
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.42"/>
				
				happy father of more such children. Now those who are
				truly ingenious do not only love one another the more entirely for the sake of their common parents, but they love
				their very parents for the sake of one another; always
				owning themselves bound to their parents especially for the
				mutual happiness that they enjoy in each other, and looking upon their brethren as the dearest and the most valuable treasure they could have received from their parents.
				And thus Homer elegantly expresses Telemachus bewailing the want of a brother:

					brothers is a plain argument of their children’s love to
					themselves. And to the children of the brothers themselves it is the best of precedents, and that which affords
					the most effectual advice that can be thought of; as again,

            <p rend="indent">It is therefore very needful to throw off those ill dispositions, as being very grievous and troublesome to their
				parents, and more destructive to children in respect of the
				ill example. Besides, it occasions many strange censures
				and much obloquy amongst men. For they will not be apt
				to imagine that so near and intimate relations as brothers,
				that have eaten of the same bread and all along participated
				of the same common maintenance, and who have conversed
				so familiarly together, should break out into contention,
				except they were conscious to themselves of a great deal
				of naughtiness. For it must be some great matter that
				violates the bonds of natural affection; whence it is that
				such breaches are so hardly healed up again. For, as
				those things which are joined together by art, being parted,
				may by the same art be compacted again, but if there be a
				fracture in a natural body, there is much difficulty in setting and uniting the broken parts; so, if friendships that
				through a long tract of time have been firmly and closely
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.44"/>
				
				contracted come once to be violated, no endeavors will
				bring then together any more. And brothers, when they
				have once broke natural affection, are hardly made true
				friends again; or, if there be some kind of peace made
				betwixt then, it is like to prove but superficial only, and
				such as carries a filthy festering scar along with it. Now
				all enmity between man and man which is attended with
				these perturbations of quarrelsomeness, passion, envy,
				recording of an injury, must needs be troublesome and
				vexatious; but that which is harbored against a brother,
				with whom they communicate in sacrifices and other religious rites of their parents, with whom they have the same
				common charnel-house and the same or a near habitation,
				is much more to be lamented,—especially if we reflect
				upon the horrid madness of some brothers, in being so
				prejudiced against their own flesh and blood, that his face
				and person once so welcome and familiar, his voice all
				along from his childhood as well beloved as known, should
				on a sudden become so very detestable. How loudly does
				this reproach their ill-nature and savage dispositions, that,
				whilst they behold other brethren lovingly conversing in
				the same house and dieting together at the same table,
				managing the same estate and attended by the same servants, they alone divide friends, choose contrary acquaintance, resolving to abandon every thing that their brother
				may approve of? Now it is obvious to any to understand,
				that new friends and companions may be compassed and
				new kindred may come in when the old, like decayed
				weapons and worn-out utensils, are lost and gone. But
				there is no more regaining of a lost brother, than of a hand

					find none of them all clear, pure, and free from all faults.
					Wherefore the Spartan, when he married a little wife, said
					that of evils he had to choose the least. But brothers
					would do well to bear with one another’s familiar failings,
					rather than to adventure upon the trial of strangers. For
					as the former is blameless because it is necessary, so the
					other is blameworthy because it is voluntary. For it is not

				I shall enter upon my instructions not as others do, with
				the distribution of the parents’ goods, but with advice rather
				to avoid envious strifes and emulation whilst the parents
				are living. Agesilaus was punished with a mulct by the
				Lacedaemonian council for sending every one of the ancient
				men an ox as a reward of his fortitude; the reason they
				gave for their distaste was, that by this means he won too
				much upon the people, and made the commonalty become
				wholly serviceable to his own private interest. Now I
				would persuade the son to show all possible honor and
				reverence to his parents, but not with that greedy design
				of engrossing all their love to himself,—of which too many
				have been guilty, working their brethren out of favor, on
				purpose to make way for their own interest,—a fault which
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.47"/>
				
				they are apt to palliate with specious, but unjust pretences.
				For they deprive and cheat their brethren out of the greatest and most valuable good they are capable of receiving
				from their parents, viz., their kindness and affection, whilst
				they slyly and disingenuously steal in upon them in their
				business, and surprise them in their errors, demeaning
				themselves with all imaginable observance to their parents,
				and especially with the greatest care and preciseness in
				those things wherein they see their brethren have been
				faulty or suspected to be so. But a kind brother, and one
				that truly deserves the name, will make his brother’s condition his own, freely take upon himself a share of his
				sufferings, particularly in the anger of his parents, and be
				ready to do any thing that may conduce to the restoring him
				into favor; but if he has neglected some opportunity or
				something which ought to have been done by him, to excuse it upon his nature, as being more ready and seriously
				disposed for other things. That of Agamemnon therefore
				was well spoken in the behalf of his brother:

					smart-spirited youth and one that will not endure to be

				And then, either amongst themselves, or, if need be, in

            <p rend="indent">Solon discoursing about the commonwealth approved of equality, as being that which would occasion no
				tumult or faction. But this opinion appeared too popular;
				for by this arithmetical method he would have set up
				democracy in the room of a far happier government, consisting with a more suitable (viz., a geometrical) proportion.
				But he that advises brethren in the dividing of an estate
				should give them Plato’s counsel to the citizens, that they
				would lay aside self-interest, or, if they cannot be persuaded to that, to be satisfied with an equal division. And
				this is the way to lay a good and lasting foundation of love
				and peace betwixt them. Besides that, he may have the
				advantage of naming eminent instances. Such was that of
				Pittacus, who, being asked of the Lydian king whether he
				had any estate, replied that he had twice as much as he
				wanted, his brother being dead. But since that not only
				in the affluence or want of riches he that has a less share
				is liable to hostility with him that has more, but generally,
				as Plato says, in all inequality there is inquietude and disturbance, and in the contrary a during confidence; so a
				disparity among brethren tends dangerously to discord.
				But for them to be equal in all respects, I grant, is impossible.
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.51"/>
				
				 For what through the difference that nature made
				immediately betwixt them at the first, and what through
				the following contingencies of their lives, it comes to pass
				that they contract an envy and hatred against one another,
				and such abominable humors as render them the plagues
				not only of their private families but even of commonwealths. And this indeed is a disease which it were well
				to prevent, or to cure when it is engendered. I would
				persuade that brother therefore that excels his fellows in
				any accomplishments, in those very things to communicate
				and impart to them the utmost he can, that they may shine
				in his honor, and flourish with his interest. For instance,
				if he be a good orator, to endeavor to make that faculty
				theirs, accounting it never the less for being imparted. And
				care ought to be taken that all this kindness be not followed with a fastidious pride, but rather with such a
				becoming condescension and familiarity as may secure
				his worth from envy, and by his own equanimity and
				sweet disposition, as far as is possible, make up the
				inequality of their fortunes. Lucullus refused the honor
				of magistracy on purpose to give way to his younger
				brother, contentedly waiting for the expiration of his year.
				Pollux chose rather to be half a deity with his brother
				than a deity by himself, and therefore to debase himself
				into a share of mortality, that he might raise his brother as
				much above it. You then are a happy man, one would
				think, that can oblige your brother at a cheaper rate, illustrate him with the honor of your virtues, and make him
				great like yourself, without any damage or derogation.
				Thus Plato made his brothers famous by mentioning them
				in the choicest of his books,—Glauco and Adimantus in
				that concerning the Commonwealth, and Antipho his
				youngest brother in his Parmenides.</p>

				that are betwixt brethren, be mitigated. But there are
				other differences that happen amongst ill-constructed brothers
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.56"/>
				
				 in respect of their age. For, whilst the elder justly
				claim the privilege of pre-eminence and authority over the
				younger, they become troublesome and uneasy to them;
				and the younger, growing pert and refractory, begin to
				slight and contemn the elder. Hence it is that the younger,
				looking upon themselves as hated and curbed, decline and
				stomach their admonitions. The elder again, being fond
				of superiority, are jealous of their brothers’ advancement,
				as though it tended to lessen them. Therefore, as we judge
				of a kindness that it ought to be valued more by the party
				obliged than by him who bestows it, so, if the elder would
				be persuaded to set less by his seniority and the younger
				to esteem it more, there would be no supercilious slighting and contemptuous carriage betwixt them. But, seeing
				it is fitting the elder should take care of them, lead, and instruct them, and the younger respect, observe, and follow
				them; it is likewise convenient that the elder’s care should
				carry more of familiarity in it, and that he should act more
				by persuasion than command, being readier to express much
				satisfaction and to applaud his brother when he does well
				than to reprove and chastise him for his faults. Now the
				younger’s imitation should be free from such a thing as
				angry striving. For unprejudiced endeavors in following
				another speak the esteem of a friend and admirer, the
				other the envy of an antagonist. Whence it is that those
				who, out of love to virtue, desire to be like their brother
				are beloved; but those again who, out of a stomaching ambition, contend to be equal with them meet with answerable usage. But above all other respects due from the
				younger to the elder, that of observance is most commendable, and occasions the return of a strong affection and
				equal regard. Such was the obsequious behavior of Cato
				to his elder brother Caepio all along from their childhood,
				that, when they came to be men, he had so much overcome
				him with his humble and excellent disposition, and his
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.57"/>
				
				meek silence and attentive obedience had begot in him
				such a reverence towards him, that Caepio neither spake
				nor did any thing material without him. It is recorded
				that, when Caepio had sealed some writing of depositions,
				and his brother coming in was against it, he called for the
				writing and took off his seal, without so much as asking
				Cato why he did suspect the testimony. The reverence
				that Epicurus’s brothers showed him was likewise remarkable, and well merited by his good will and affectionate
				care for them. They were so especially influenced by him
				in the way of his philosophy, that. they began betimes to
				entertain a high opinion of his accomplishments, and to
				declare that there was never a wiser man heard of than
				Epicurus. If they erred, yet we may here observe the
				obliging behavior of Epicurus, and the return of their passionate respects to him. And amongst later philosophers,
				Apollonius the Peripatetic convinced him who said honor
				was incommunicable, by raising his younger brother Sotion
				to a higher degree of eminence than himself. Amongst
				all the good things I am bound to Fortune for, I have that
				of a kind and affectionate brother Timon, which cannot be
				unknown to any who have conversed with me, and especially those of my own family.</p>

            <p rend="indent">There are yet other disturbances that brothers near
				the same age ought to be warned of; they are but small
				indeed at present, but they are frequent and leave a lasting grudge, such as makes them ready upon all occasions
				to fret and exasperate one another, and conclude at last in
				implacable hatred and malice. For, having once begun to
				fall out in their sports, and to differ about little things, like
				the feeding and fighting of cocks and other fowl, the exercises of children, the hunting of dogs, the racing of horses,
				it comes to pass that they have no government of themselves in greater matters, nor the power to restrain a proud
				and contentious humor. So the great men among the
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.58"/>
				
				Grecians in our time, disagreeing first about players
				and musicians, afterward about the bath in Aedepsus,
				and again about rooms of entertainment, from contending and opposing one another about places, and from
				cutting and turning water-courses, they were grown so
				fierce and mad against one another, that they were dispossessed of all their goods by a tyrant, reduced to extreme poverty, and put to very hard shifts. In a word, so
				miserably were they altered from themselves, that there
				was nothing of the same but their inveterate hatred remaining in them. Wherefore there is no small care to be
				taken by brothers in subduing their passions and preventing quarrels about small matters, yielding rather for
				peace’s sake, and taking greater pleasure in indulging than
				crossing and conquering one another’s humors. For the
				ancients accounted the Cadmean victory to be no other
				than that between the brothers at Thebes, esteeming that
				the worst and basest of victories. But you will say, Are
				there not some things wherein men of mild and quiet dis
				positions may have occasion to dissent from others? There
				are, doubtless; but then they must take care that the main
				difference be betwixt the things themselves, and that their
				passions be not too much concerned. But they must
				rather have a regard to justice, and as soon as they have
				referred the controversy to arbitrament, immediately discharge their thoughts of it, for fear too much ruminating
				leave a deep impression of it in the mind, and render it
				hard to be forgotten. The Pythagoreans were imitable
				for this, that, though no nearer related than by mere common discipline and education, if at any time in a passion
				they broke out into opprobrious language, before the sun
				set they gave one another their hands, and with them a discharge from all injuries, and so with a mutual salutation
				concluded friends. For as a fever attending an inflamed
				sore threatens no great danger to the body, but, if the
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.59"/>
				
				sore being healed the fever stays, it appears then to be a
				distemper and to have some deeper cause; so, when among
				brothers upon the ending of a difference all discord ceases
				betwixt them, it is an argument that the cause lay in the
				matter of difference only, but, if the discord survive the
				decision of the controversy, it is plain that the pretended
				matter served only for a false scar, drawn over on purpose
				to hide the cause of an incurable wound.</p>

      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
            <p rend="indent">It is worth the while at present to hear an account
				of a dispute between two foreign brothers, not concerning
				a little patch of land, nor a few servants or cattle, but no
				less than the kingdom of Persia. When Darius was dead,
				some were for Ariamenes’s succeeding to the crown as being eldest son; others were for Xerxes, who was born to
				Darius of Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, in the time of his
				reign over Persia. Ariamenes therefore came from Media
				in no hostile posture, but very peaceably, to hear the matter determined. Xerxes being there used the majesty and
				power of a king. But when his brother was come, he laid
				down his crown and other royal ornaments, went and meeting greeted him. And sending him presents, he gave a
				charge to his servants to deliver them with these words:
				With these presents your brother Xerxes expresses the
				honor he has for you; and, if by the judgment and suffrage of the Persians I be declared king, I place you next
				to myself. Ariamenes replied: I accept your gifts, but
				presume the kingdom of Persia to be my right. Yet for
				all my younger brethren I shall have an honor, but for
				Xerxes in the first place. The day of determining who
				should reign being come, the Persians made Artabanus
				brother to Darius judge. Xerxes excepting against him,
				confiding most in the multitude, his mother Atossa reproved him, saying: Why, son, are you so shy of Artabanus,
				your uncle, and one of the best men amongst the Persians?
				And why should you dread the trial, where the worst you
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.60"/>
				
				can fear is to be next the throne, and to be called the king
				of Persia’s brother? Xerxes at length submitting, after
				some debate Artabanus adjudged the kingdom to Xerxes.
				Ariamenes presently started up, and went and showed obeisance to his brother, and taking him by the hand, placed
				him in the throne. And from that time, being placed himself by Xerxes next in the kingdom, he continued the same
				affection to him, insomuch that, for his brother’s honor engaging himself in the naval fight at Salamis, he was killed
				there. And this may serve for a clear and unquestionable
				instance of true kindness and greatness of mind.</p>
            <p rend="indent">Antiochus’s restless ambition after a crown was as
					much to be condemned; but still we may admire this in
					him, that it did not totally extinguish natural affection and
					destroy the love of a brother. He went to war with his
					brother Seleucus for the kingdom, himself being the
					younger brother, and having the assistance of his mother.
					In the durance of which war Seleucus joins battle with
					the Galatians and is defeated; being not heard of for a
					time, he is supposed to be slain and his whole army to
					be slaughtered by the enemy. Antiochus, understanding
					it, put off his purple, went into mourning, caused his
					palace to be shut up, and retired to lament the death of
					his brother. But, within a short time after, hearing that
					his brother was safe and raising new forces, he went and
					offered sacrifices for joy, and commanded his subjects to
					do the like and to crown themselves with garlands. But
					the Athenians, though they made a ridiculous story about
					a falling out amongst the Deities, compensated for the absurdity pretty well in striking out the second day of their
					month Boedromion, because upon that day Neptune and
					Minerva were at variance. And why should not we cancel
					out of our memories, as an unhappy day and no more to be
					spoken of, that wherein we have differed with any of our
					family or relations? But rather, far be it from us that the
					
					<pb xml:id="v.3.p.61"/>
					
					feuds of that day should bury the memory of all that
					happier time wherein we were educated and conversed
					together. For, except nature has bestowed those virtues
					of meekness and patience upon us in vain and to no purpose, we have certainly the greatest reason to exercise them
					towards our intimate friends and kindred. Now the acknowledgments of the offender and the begging pardon
					for the crime express a kind and amicable nature no less
					than the remitting of it. Wherefore it is not for us to
					slight the anger of those whom we have incensed through
					our folly, neither should they be so implacable as to refuse
					an humble submission; but rather, where we have done
					the wrong, we should endeavor to prevent a distaste by the
					earliest and humblest acknowledgments and impetrations
					of pardon, and where we have received any, to be as ready
					and free in the forgiving of it. Euclides, Socrates’s auditor, was famous in the schools for his mild return to his
					raving brother, whom he heard bellow out threats against
					him after this manner: Let me perish, if I be not revenged
					on you. He answered: And let me perish, if I do not prevail with you to desist from this passion, and to let us be as
					good friends as ever we were. This Euclides spake; but
					what king Eumenes did was an act of meekness seldom to
					be paralleled, and never yet outdone. For Perseus king
					of Macedon, being his great enemy, had engaged some
					persons to attempt the killing him. In order to which
					barbarous act they lay in wait for him at Delphi, and,
					when they perceived him going from the sea toward
					the Oracle, came behind him and set. upon him with
					great stones, wounding him in the head and neck, till
					reeling with his hurt he fell down and was supposed
					dead. The rumor of this action dispersed every way, and
					some friends and servants of his coming to Pergamus,
					who were the amazed spectators of the supposed murder, brought the news. Whereupon Attalus, Eumenes’s
					
					<pb xml:id="v.3.p.62"/>
					
					eldest brother, a well-tempered man and one that had
					showed the greatest affection and respect to his brother,
					was proclaimed king, and not only assumed the crown, but
					married his deceased brother’s queen, Stratonica. But intelligence coming a while after that Eumenes was alive
					and coming home, he presently laid aside the crown, and
					putting on his usual habiliments, went with the rest of the
					guard to meet and attend him. Eumenes received him
					with the most affectionate embrace, and saluted the queen
					with honorable respect and much endearment. And not
					long after, at his death, he was so free from passion or
					jealousy against his brother, that he bequeathed to him
					both his crown and his queen. The return of Attalus to
					his brother’s kindness was ingenuous and very remarkable.
					For after his brother’s death he took no care to advance
					his own children, though he had many, but provided especially for the education of Eumenes’s son, and when he
					came to age, placed the crown upon his head, and saluted
					him with the title of king. But Cambyses, being disturbed
					only with a dream that his brother was like to reign over
					Asia, without any enquiry after farther evidence or ground
					for his jealousy, caused him to be put to death. Whereupon the succession went out of Cyrus’s family into the
					line of Darius, a prince who understood how to share the
					management of his affairs and even his regal authority not
					merely with his brothers, but also with his friends.</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
            <p rend="indent">Again, this rule is to be observed, that, whenever
				any difference happens betwixt brothers, during the time
				of strangeness especially they hold a correspondence with
				one another’s friends, but by all means avoid their enemies.
				The Cretans are herein very observable; who, being accustomed to frequent skirmishes and fights, nevertheless, as
				soon as they were attacked by a foreign enemy, were
				reconciled and went together. And that was it which
				they commonly called Syncretism. For there are some
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.63"/>
				
				who, like waters running among loose and chinky grounds,
				overthrow all familiarity and friendship; enemies to both
				parties, but especially bent upon the ruining of him whose
				weakness exposes him most to danger. For every sincere substantial friend joins in affection with one that
				approves himself such to him. And you shall observe, on
				the other hand, that the most inveterate and pernicious
				enemy contributes the poison of his ill-nature to heighten
				the passion of an angry brother. Therefore as the cat, in
				Aesop, out of pretended kindness asked the sick hen how
				she did, and she answered, The better if you were further
				off; after the same manner one would answer an incendiary that throws in words to breed discord, and to that
				end pries into things that are not to be spoken of, saying:
				I have no controversy with my brother nor he with me, if
				neither of us shall hearken to such sycophants as you are.
				I cannot understand why—seeing it is commonly held
				convenient for those who have tender eyes and a weak
				sight to shun those objects that are apt to make a strong
				reflection—the rule should not hold good in morals, and
				why those whom we would imagine sick of the trouble of
				fraternal quarrels and contentions should rather seem to
				take pleasure in them, and even seek the company of those
				who will only excite them the more and make all worse.
				How much more prudential a course would they take in
				avoiding the enemies of their offended brethren, and rather
				conversing with their relations and friends or even with
				their wives, and discovering their grievances to them
				frankly and with plainness of speech! But some are of
				that scrupulous opinion, that brothers walking together
				must not suffer a stone to lie in the way betwixt them, and
				are very much concerned if a dog happen to run betwixt
				them; and many such things, being looked upon as ominous, discompose and terrify them. Whereas none of
				them all any way tends to the breaking of friendship or
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.64"/>
				
				the causing of dissension; but they are not in the least
				aware that men of snarling dispositions, base detractors,
				and instigators of mischief, whom they improvidently admit into their society, are the things that do them the
				greatest hurt.</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
            <p rend="indent">Therefore (this discourse suggesting one thing after
				another) Theophrastus said well: If there ought to be all
				things common amongst friends, why should not the best
				of those things, their friends themselves, be communicated?
				And this is advice that cannot be too soon tendered to
				brethren, for their separate acquaintance and conversation
				conduce to the estranging them from one another. For
				those who affect divers friends will be apt to delight in
				them so much as to emulate them, and will therefore be
				easily drawn and persuaded by them; for friendships have
				their distinctive marks and manners, and there is no
				greater argument of a different genius and disposition
				than the choice of different friends. Wherefore neither
				the common table nor the common recreations nor any
				other sort of intimacy comprehends so much of amity betwixt brothers, as to be united in their interest and to
				have the same common friends and enemies; for ordinary
				friendship suffers neither calumnies nor clashings, but if
				there be any anger or discontent, honest and impartial
				friends make an end of it. For as tin unites and solders
				up broken brass, being put to the ends and attempered to
				the nature of the broken pieces; so it is the part of a
				friend betwixt two brothers, to suit and accommodate
				himself to the humors of both, that he may confirm and
				secure their friendship. But those of different and uncomplying tempers are like improper notes in music, that serve
				only to spoil the consort, and offend the ear with a harsh
				noise. It is a question therefore whether Hesiod was in
				the right or not when he said:
				
            	<quote rend="blockquote">Let not thy friend become thy brother’s peer.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 707.</note>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <pb xml:id="v.3.p.65"/>
            <p rend="indent">For one of an even behavior, that freely communicates
					himself between both, may by his interest in both contract
					a firm and happy tie and engagement of love between
					brothers. But Hesiod, it seems, spoke of those he suspected,—the greatest part and the worst sort of friends,—men of envious and selfish designs. He is wise who
					avoids such friends; and if in the mean time he divide his
					kindness equally between a true friend and a brother, let
					him do it with this reserve always, that the brother have
					the preference in magistracy and the management of public affairs, that he have the greater respect shown him in
					invitations and in contracting acquaintance with great
					persons, and in any thing that looks honorable and great
					in the eyes of the people, that the pre-eminence be given
					to Nature; for in these instances to prefer a friend does
					him not so much credit as that base and unworthy action
					of lessening and slighting a brother does the vilifying
					brother disgrace. But several have given their opinions
					in this thing. That of Menander is very well,
					
					<quote rend="blockquote">No one who loves will bear to be contemned.</quote>
            </p>
            <p rend="indent">This may remind brothers to preserve a tender regard to
					one another, and not to presume that Nature will overcome
					all their slights and disdain. A horse naturally loves a
					man, and a dog his master; but, if they are neglected in
					what is fitting and necessary for them, they will grow
					strange and unmanageable. The body, that is so intimately united to the soul, if the soul suspend a careful
					influence from it, will not be forward to assist it in its
					operations; it may rather spoil and cross them.</p>
         </div>
      		<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
            <p rend="indent">Now as the kind regards of brother to brother are
				highly commendable, so may they be expressed to the
				greater advantage, when he confines them not wholly to
				his person, but pays them, as occasion serves, rather by
				reflection to his kindred and such as retain to him; when
				he maintains a kind and complaisant humor amidst all
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.66"/>
				
				contingencies, when he obliges the servile part of the
				family with a courteous and affable carriage, when he is
				grateful to the physician and good friends for the safe
				recovery of his brother, and is ready to go upon any expedition or service for him. Again, it is highly commendable in him to have the highest esteem and honor for his
				brother’s wife, reputing and honoring her as the most
				sacred of all his brother’s sacred treasures, and thus to do
				honor to him; condoling with her when she is neglected,
				and appeasing her when she is angered; if she have a
				little offended, to intercede and sue for her peace; if there
				have been any private difference between himself and his
				brother, to make his complaint before her in order to a reconcilement. But especially let him be much troubled at his
				brother’s single state; or, if he be married, at his want of
				children. If not married, let him follow him with arguments and persuasions, to teaze him with rebukes and
				reproaches, and to do every thing that may incline him to
				enter into a conjugal state. When he has children, let
				him express his affection and respects to both parents
				with the greater ardency. Let him love the children
				equally with his own, but be more favorable and indulgent to them, that, if it chance that they commit some of
				their youthful faults, they may not run away and hide
				themselves among naughty acquaintances through fear of
				their parents’ anger, but may have in their uncle a recourse
				and refuge, where they will be admonished lovingly and
				will find an intercessor to make their excuse and get their
				pardon. So Plato reclaimed his nephew Speusippus, that
				was far gone in idleness and debauchery; the young man,
				impatient of his parents’ reprehensions, ran away from
				them, who were more impatient of his extravagancies.
				His uncle expressed nothing of disturbance at all this,
				but continued calm and free from passion; whereupon
				Speusippus was seized with an extraordinary shame, and
				
				<pb xml:id="v.3.p.67"/>
				
				from that time became an admirer of both his uncle and
				his philosophy. Many of Plato’s friends blamed him that
				he had not instructed the youth; he made answer, that he
				instructed him by his life and conversation, from which he
				might learn, if he pleased, the difference betwixt ill and
				virtuous actions. The father of Aleuas the Thessalian,
				looking upon his son as of a fierce and injurious nature,
				kept him under with a great deal of severity, but his uncle
				received him with as great kindness. When therefore the
				Thessalians sent some lots to the oracle at Delphi, to
				enquire by them who should be their king, his uncle stole
				in one lot privately in the name of Aleuas; the priestess
				answered from the oracle, that Aleuas should be king.
				His father being surprised averred that there was never
				a lot thrown in for Aleuas that he knew of; at last all
				concluded that some mistake was committed in putting
				down the names, whereupon they sent again to enquire
				of the oracle. The priestess, confirming her first words,
				answered:
				
				<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <lg>
                     <l>I mean the youth with reddish hair,
				</l>
                     <l>Whom dame Archedice did bear.</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p rend="indent">Thus Aleuas was by the oracle, through his uncle’s kind
					policy, declared king; by which means he surmounted all
					his ancestors, and advanced his family into a splendid condition. For it is prudence in a brother, when he beholds
					with joy the brave and worthy actions of his nephews growing great and honorable by their own deserts, to prompt
					and encourage them on by congratulation and applause.
					For to praise his own son may be absurd and offensive, but
					to commend the good actions of a brother’s son, is an excellent thing, and one which proceeds from no self-interest,
					nor any other principle but a true veneration for virtue.
					Now the very name of uncle (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῖος</foreign>) intimates that mutual
					beneficence and friendship that ought to be between him
					and his nephews. Besides this, we have a precedent from
					
					<pb xml:id="v.3.p.68"/>
					
					those that are of a sublimer make and nature than ourselves. Hercules, who was the father of sixty-eight sons,
					had a brother’s son that was as dear to him as any of his
					own; and even to this time Hercules and his nephew Iolaus
					have in many places one common altar betwixt them, and
					share in the same adorations. He is called literally Hercules’s assistant. And when his brother Iphicles was slain
					in a battle at Lacedaemon, in his exceeding grief he left
					the whole of Peloponnesus. Also Leucothea, her sister
					being dead, took her infant, nursed him up, and consecrated
					him with herself among the deities; from whence the Roman
					matrons, upon the festivals of Leucothea whom they call
					also Matuta) have a custom of nursing their sisters’ children
					instead of their own, during the time of the festival.</p>
