					In this essay Plutarch has arranged his material somewhat more methodically than is his usual practice.
					In chaps. 1-7 he shows that Brotherly Love is in
					accordance with nature; in 9-19 he tells us how we
					should conduct ourselves toward a brother: (a) while
					our parents are alive, (b) when they are dead, (c) when
					the brother is our inferior, (d) when our superior;
					and also the reasons for quarrels and the treatment
					thereof. He closes with some pleasant tales of
					affection for brothers' children.

								aliquot Plui. libellis</title>, diss. Güttingen, 1913, pp. 17-24,
					58; and see the excellent tables on pp. 47, 61).
					Plutarch appears to have retained a certain amount
					of more or less irrelevant material on friendship from
					his recent work on these treatises, and also to have
					drawn upon some portions of Theophrastus's treatise

					that in his own day an equally large number of

					were so amazing that the times made them known to
					all as warning examples in tragedies and other

					nostrils; and she has thus taught us that she has
					divided them in this fashion for mutual preservation
					and assistance, not for variance and strife. And

					being separate they might the more readily co-operate
					with one another. For indeed creatures that had
					three bodies and an hundred hands, if any such were

					from one another, as may brothers, who can either
					remain at home or reside abroad, as well as undertake
					public office and husbandry through each other's help
					if they but preserve that principle of goodwill and
					concord which Nature has given them. But if they

					play the demagogue against their brothers, having a

					they deprive them of the greatest and fairest of inheritances, their parents' goodwill, by servilely and

					opportunely making their attacks when the parents
					are occupied and unsuspecting, and, in particular,

					bear the brunt of it together with his brother, by such
					assistance making the anger lighter, and then by
					rendering services and favours to help somehow or

					If there is error of omission, he can allege in the

					But since envy and jealousy of those who surpass
					them in repute and honour are implanted by nature
					chiefly in men of ambitious character, to guard
					against these vices it is highly expedient that brothers
					should not seek to acquire honours or power in the
					same field, but in quite different fields. Wild beasts,

					same things, war against each other, and athletes
					who direct their efforts toward one and the same

					pancratiasts and long-distance runners are well disposed toward wrestlers, and they mutually assist and
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.293"/>
					
					cheer for each other. This, in fact, is the reason why,
					of the two sons of Tyndareüs, Polydeuces won his
					victories in boxing and Castor in running. And
					Homer did well to represent Teucer as renowned in
					archery, while his brother was foremost among the
					heavy-armed:
            	<quote rend="blockquote">And he covered Teucer with gleaming shield.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Ajax and Teucer: <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, viii. 272.</note>

					So, of those engaged in the service of the state,

					barristers envy teachers of rhetoric; nor, among
					physicians, do dieticians envy surgeons; but they
					even call each other into consultation and commend
					one another. For brothers to seek eminence and
					repute from the same art or faculty is precisely the
					same as for both to fall in love with one woman
					and each seek to outstrip the other in her esteem.
					Those, indeed, who travel different roads afford each
					other no help, but those who follow different

					each pair harangued the people and drew up laws,
					the latter commanded armies and translated words
					into action. Therefore those who cannot, by their
					very nature, share without envy their brothers' reputation and influence, should divert as far as possible

				</p>
            <p>
					But although these means are the best for smoothing away such inequalities, yet there are the other
					differences which naturally arise among brothers who
					lack the proper training, differences due to disparity
					in their ages. For, generally speaking, elder brothers,
					when they claim the right always to dominate and
					to have precedence over the younger and to have the
					advantage in every matter where reputation and influence are involved, are oppressive and disagreeable;
					and younger brothers, in turn, being restive under the
					curb and becoming fractious, make it their practice
					to despise and belittle the elder. The result is that
					while the younger, feeling that they are being treated
					despitefully and are discriminated against, resent and
					try to avoid their elders' admonitions, the elder, ever
					clinging fast to their superiority, fear their brothers'
					
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.297"/>
					
					augmentation as though it meant elimination for
					themselves. Just as, then, we think it right that
					those who receive a favour should look upon it as of
					greater, and those who bestow it as of lesser value,
					so, in regard to a difference in ages, if we advise the
					elder to regard it as no great matter and the younger
					to think it no slight thing, we should rid the one
					of arrogance and neglect, and the other of disdain
					and contempt. And since it is fitting that the older
					should be solicitous about the younger and should
					lead and admonish him, and that the younger should
					honour and emulate and follow the older, let the
					solicitude of the former be rather that of a comrade than of a father, and of one who would persuade rather than command, and would rejoice in
					a brother's successes and applaud them rather than
					criticize him if he errs and restrain him-a spirit
					showing not only a greater desire to help, but also
					more kindness of heart. And in the emulation of
					the younger let imitation, not rivalry, be present;
					for imitation is the act of one who admires, but
					rivalry of one who envies. It is for this reason that
					men love those who wish to become like themselves,
					but repress and crush those who wish to become their
					equals. And among the many honours which it is
					fitting that the young render to their elders, obedience
					is most highly esteemed, and, together with respectfulness, brings about a staunch goodwill and favour
					which will in turn lead to concessions. Thus it was
					with Cato<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic">Cf. Life of Cato Minor</title>, iii. (761 b-c). Q. Servillus Caepio was Cato's half-brother.</note>: he so won over his elder brother Caepio by

					great a respect for himself that Caepio would neither
					
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.299"/>
					
					do nor say anything without Cato's knowledge. For
					example, it is said that on one occasion, when Caepio
					had affixed his seal to a deposition and Cato carne up
					later and was unwilling to add his own seal, Caepio
					demanded that the document be returned and removed his seal before asking the reason why his
					brother had suspected the deposition instead of
					believing it to be true. In the case of Epicurus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Cf. Moralia</title>, 1100 a; Epicurus, Frag. 178 (Usener, <title rend="italic">Epicurea</title>, p. 155).</note> also
					his brothers' respect for him was clearly great because
					of the goodwill and solicitude he had for them,
					inspired as they were with admiration both for his
					other attainments and especially for his philosophy.
					For even if they were mistaken in their opinion, yet
					since they were convinced and constantly declared
					from their earliest childhood that there was no one
					wiser than Epicurus, we may well admire both the
					man who inspired this devotion and also those who
					felt it. However, of the more recent philosophers,
					Apollonius the Peripatetic, by making Sotion, his
					younger brother, more famous than himself, refuted
					the man who asserted that fame could not be
					shared with another. And for myself, though I have
					received from Fortune many favours which call for

					which at last ends in incurable hatred and
					malevolence. For having once begun to differ in
					childish matters, about the care of animals and their
					fights, as, for instance, those of quails or cocks, they
					then continue to differ about the contests of boys in
					the palaestra, of dogs on the hunt, and of horses at

					resist the spirit of contentiousness and jealousy
					among brothers when it first creeps in over trivial
					matters, practising the art of making mutual concessions, of learning to take defeat, and of taking
					pleasure in indulging brothers rather than in winning

					occasions for controversy and dissension even to those

					we must see to it that the affairs fight the battle

					the contest, like a hook, as it were, any emotion
					arising from contentiousness or anger; but, keeping
					our eyes fixed impartially upon the swaying of
					Justice, as though we were watching a pair of

					sought to evade their decision that the judgement

					Ariamenes at once leapt up and did obeisance to his

					mere word, but a deed, which revealed a gentleness
					that no one could surpass. For Perseus, the king of
					Macedonia, who was his enemy, procured men to kill
					him. These men set an ambush near Delphi, observing that he was coming on foot from the sea to the

					temple of the god. They carne behind him and
					hurled great stones down upon his head and neck;
					these made him dizzy and he fell down and was
					thought to be dead. A report of his death spread
					far and wide, and some of his friends and servants
					Carne back to Pergamum, and were thought to bring
					their report as actual eye-witnesses of the calamity.
					Attalus, therefore, the eldest of the king's brothers,

					any of the others,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The other brothers are mentioned by name in 480 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> not only took the crown and was

					the news carne that Eumenes was alive, and he himself was approaching, Attalus laid aside the crown,
					took his spears, as had been his custom before, and
					went with the other guardsmen to meet the king.
					And Eumenes not only cordially clasped his hand, but
					also embraced the queen, showing her honour and
					friendliness; and living a considerable time after his
					return, without giving a hint of blame or suspicion, he
					died, leaving to Attalus both his kingdom and his
					wife. And what did Attalus? When Eumenes was
					dead, he was unwilling to acknowledge as his own<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">By the ceremony in which the father raises the child in his arms to acknowledge its legitimacy.

See W. S. Ferguson, <title rend="italic">Class.

						then by all means the friends of friends should be
						common</q>; and one should urge this advice upon
					brothers with special emphasis. For associations
					and intimacies which are maintained separately and
					apart lead brothers away from each other and turn
					them toward others, since an immediate consequence
					of affection for others is to take pleasure in others, to
					emulate others, and to follow the lead of others.
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.317"/>
					
					For friendships shape character and there is no
					more important indication of a difference in
					character than the selection of different friends.
					For this reason neither eating and drinking together nor playing and spending the day together
					can so firmly cement concord between brothers
					as the sharing of friendships and enmities, taking
					pleasure in the company of the same persons, and
					loathing and avoiding the same. For friendships
					held in common do not tolerate either slanders or
					conflicts, but if any occasion for wrath or blame arises,
					it is dissipated by the mediation of friends, who
					take it upon themselves and disperse it, if they are
					but intimate with both parties and incline in their
					goodwill to both alike. For as tin joins together
					broken bronze and solders it by being applied to both
					ends, since it is of a material sympathetic to both, so
					should the friend, well-suited as he is to both and
					being theirs in common, join still closer their mutual
					goodwill; but those who are uneven and will not
					blend, like false notes of a scale in music, create discord, not harmony.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">More exactly, <q type="unspecified">the disjunction, not conjunction</q> of tetrachords.</note> One may, then, be in doubt

						<title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 707; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> the <title rend="italic">Commentarii in Hesiodum</title>, 65 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. pp. 83 f.).</note> was right or not in saying,
					Nor should one make a friend a brother's peer.
					For that man who is a considerate and a common
					friend to both brothers, as we have described him,
					compounded as he is of the natures of both, will the
					more readily be a bond of brotherly love between
					them. But Hesiod, it is likely, was afraid of the
					common run of friends who are evil because of their
					jealous and selfish natures.
				</p>
            <p>
					But even if we feel an equal affection for a friend,
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.319"/>
					
					we should always be careful to reserve for a brother
					the first place in public offices and administration, and
					in invitations and introductions to distinguished men,
					and, in general, whenever we deal with occasions
					which in the eyes of the public give distinction and
					tend to confer honour, rendering thus to Nature the
					appropriate dignity and prerogative. For undue
					precedence in such matters is not so grand a thing
					for the friend, as the slight is shameful and degrading for a brother.

					So they sent again and questioned the god a second
