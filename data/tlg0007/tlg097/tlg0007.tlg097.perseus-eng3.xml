					In this essay Plutarch has arranged his material somewhat more methodically than is his usual practice.
					In chaps. 1-7 he shows that Brotherly Love is in
					accordance with nature; in 9-19 he tells us how we
					should conduct ourselves toward a brother: (a) while
					our parents are alive, (b) when they are dead, (c) when
					the brother is our inferior, (d) when our superior;
					and also the reasons for quarrels and the treatment
					thereof. He closes with some pleasant tales of
					affection for brothers’ children.

					58; and see the excellent tables on pp. 47, 61).
					Plutarch appears to have retained a certain amount
					of more or less irrelevant material on friendship from

					drawn upon some portions of Theophrastus’s treatise

					that in his own day an equally large number of

					were so amazing that the times made them known to
					all as warning examples in tragedies and other

					divided them in this fashion for mutual preservation

					being separate they might the more readily co-operate
					with one another. For indeed creatures that had
					three bodies and an hundred hands, if any such were

					from one another, as may brothers, who can either
					remain at home or reside abroad, as well as undertake
					public office and husbandry through each other’s help
					if they but preserve that principle of goodwill and

					when sons quarrel, hate and malign each other, and

					from others to himself. It is in this way that many
					play the demagogue against their brothers, having a
					specious but unjust pretext for this rapacity; for
					they deprive them of the greatest and fairest of inheritances, their parents’ goodwill, by servilely and
					unscrupulously cutting across their brothers’ path,
					opportunely making their attacks when the parents
					are occupied and unsuspecting, and, in particular,
					showing themselves dutiful and obedient and prudent

					to be in error, or seeming to be so. But the right
					way, on the contrary, when a son sees that his father

					bear the brunt of it together with his brother, by such
					assistance making the anger lighter, and then by
					rendering services and favours to help somehow or
					other to restore his brother to his father’s grace.
					If there is error of omission, he can allege in the

					in other directions. The saying of Agamemnon<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">On behalf of Menelaüs: <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, x. 122-123.</note>

					must be on our guard and must cure them, if they

					adorning them with a portion of his repute and adopting them into his friendships, and if he is a cleverer
					speaker than they, to make his eloquence available

					But since envy and jealousy of those who surpass

					chiefly in men of ambitious character, to guard
					against these vices it is highly expedient that brothers
					should not seek to acquire honours or power in the

					cheer for each other. This, in fact, is the reason why,
					of the two sons of Tyndareüs, Polydeuces won his
					victories in boxing and Castor in running. And
					Homer did well to represent Teucer as renowned in
					archery, while his brother was foremost among the
					heavy-armed:
            	<quote rend="blockquote">And he covered Teucer with gleaming shield.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Ajax and Teucer: <title rend="italic">Il.</title>, viii. 272.</note>

					So, of those engaged in the service of the state,

					even call each other into consultation and commend
					one another. For brothers to seek eminence and
					repute from the same art or faculty is precisely the
					same as for both to fall in love with one woman
					and each seek to outstrip the other in her esteem.
					Those, indeed, who travel different roads afford each

					our ambition by saying: <q>Your brother carries all
						before him and is admired and courted, but you are
						not visited by anybody and enjoy no distinction at
						all.</q> 
               <q>Not so,</q> a sensible man would reply. <q>I have
							a brother who is highly esteemed, and most of his

					remarked that he would rather have Darius than

					who has attained to fame by virtue of office or
					wealth or eloquence.
				</p>
            <p rend="indent">
					But although these means are the best for smoothing away such inequalities, yet there are the other
					differences which naturally arise among brothers who
					lack the proper training, differences due to disparity
					in their ages. For, generally speaking, elder brothers,
					when they claim the right always to dominate and
					to have precedence over the younger and to have the
					advantage in every matter where reputation and influence are involved, are oppressive and disagreeable;
					and younger brothers, in turn, being restive under the
					curb and becoming fractious, make it their practice
					to despise and belittle the elder. The result is that
					while the younger, feeling that they are being treated
					despitefully and are discriminated against, resent and
					try to avoid their elders’ admonitions, the elder, ever
					clinging fast to their superiority, fear their brothers’
					
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.297"/>
					
					augmentation as though it meant elimination for
					themselves. Just as, then, we think it right that
					those who receive a favour should look upon it as of
					greater, and those who bestow it as of lesser value,
					so, in regard to a difference in ages, if we advise the
					elder to regard it as no great matter and the younger
					to think it no slight thing, we should rid the one
					of arrogance and neglect, and the other of disdain
					and contempt. And since it is fitting that the older
					should be solicitous about the younger and should
					lead and admonish him, and that the younger should
					honour and emulate and follow the older, let the
					solicitude of the former be rather that of a comrade than of a father, and of one who would persuade rather than command, and would rejoice in
					a brother’s successes and applaud them rather than
					criticize him if he errs and restrain him-a spirit
					showing not only a greater desire to help, but also
					more kindness of heart. And in the emulation of
					the younger let imitation, not rivalry, be present;
					for imitation is the act of one who admires, but
					rivalry of one who envies. It is for this reason that
					men love those who wish to become like themselves,
					but repress and crush those who wish to become their
					equals. And among the many honours which it is
					fitting that the young render to their elders, obedience
					is most highly esteemed, and, together with respectfulness, brings about a staunch goodwill and favour
					which will in turn lead to concessions. Thus it was
					with Cato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic">Cf. Life of Cato Minor</title>, iii. (761 b-c). Q. Servillus Caepio was Cato’s half-brother.</note>: he so won over his elder brother Caepio by

					men, he had so subdued him and filled him with so
					great a respect for himself that Caepio would neither
					
					
					<pb xml:id="v.6.p.299"/>
					
					do nor say anything without Cato’s knowledge. For
					example, it is said that on one occasion, when Caepio
					had affixed his seal to a deposition and Cato carne up
					later and was unwilling to add his own seal, Caepio
					demanded that the document be returned and removed his seal before asking the reason why his
					brother had suspected the deposition instead of
					believing it to be true. In the case of Epicurus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">
						<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Cf. Moralia</title>, 1100 a; Epicurus, Frag. 178 (Usener, <title rend="italic">Epicurea</title>, p. 155).</note> also
					his brothers’ respect for him was clearly great because
					of the goodwill and solicitude he had for them,
					inspired as they were with admiration both for his
					other attainments and especially for his philosophy.
					For even if they were mistaken in their opinion, yet
					since they were convinced and constantly declared
					from their earliest childhood that there was no one
					wiser than Epicurus, we may well admire both the
					man who inspired this devotion and also those who
					felt it. However, of the more recent philosophers,
					Apollonius the Peripatetic, by making Sotion, his
					younger brother, more famous than himself, refuted
					the man who asserted that fame could not be
					shared with another. And for myself, though I have
					received from Fortune many favours which call for
					gratitude, that my brother Timon’s<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Timon appears in the <title rend="italic">Quaest. Symp.</title>, i. 2 and ii. 5.</note> affection for me

					which at last ends in incurable hatred and
					malevolence. For having once begun to differ in
					childish matters, about the care of animals and their
					fights, as, for instance, those of quails or cocks, they
					then continue to differ about the contests of boys in
					the palaestra, of dogs on the hunt, and of horses at

					and, becoming exiles and paupers and-I had almost

					resist the spirit of contentiousness and jealousy
					among brothers when it first creeps in over trivial
					matters, practising the art of making mutual concessions, of learning to take defeat, and of taking
					pleasure in indulging brothers rather than in winning

					For friendships shape character and there is no
					more important indication of a difference in

					For this reason neither eating and drinking together nor playing and spending the day together
					can so firmly cement concord between brothers
					as the sharing of friendships and enmities, taking

					loathing and avoiding the same. For friendships

					conflicts, but if any occasion for wrath or blame arises,
					it is dissipated by the mediation of friends, who
					take it upon themselves and disperse it, if they are
					but intimate with both parties and incline in their
					goodwill to both alike. For as tin joins together
					broken bronze and solders it by being applied to both
					ends, since it is of a material sympathetic to both, so
					should the friend, well-suited as he is to both and
					being theirs in common, join still closer their mutual
					goodwill; but those who are uneven and will not

					Nor should one make a friend a brother’s peer.
					For that man who is a considerate and a common
					friend to both brothers, as we have described him,
					compounded as he is of the natures of both, will the
					more readily be a bond of brotherly love between
					them. But Hesiod, it is likely, was afraid of the
					common run of friends who are evil because of their
					jealous and selfish natures.

            <p rend="indent">
					But even if we feel an equal affection for a friend,

					we should always be careful to reserve for a brother

					in invitations and introductions to distinguished men,
					and, in general, whenever we deal with occasions
					which in the eyes of the public give distinction and
					tend to confer honour, rendering thus to Nature the
