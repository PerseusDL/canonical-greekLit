            <head>ON BROTHERLY LOVE
					(DE FRATERNO AMORE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					In this essay Plutarch has arranged his material somewhat more methodically than is his usual practice.
					In chaps. 1-7 he shows that Brotherly Love is in
					accordance with nature ; in 9-19 he tells us how we
					should conduct ourselves toward a brother : (a) while
					our parents are alive, (b) when they are dead, (c) when
					the brother is our inferior, (d) when our superior ;
					and also the reasons for quarrels and the treatment
					thereof. He closes with some pleasant tales of
					affection for brothers' children.
				</p>
            <p>
					That Plutarch wrote this work after <hi rend="italics">De Adulatore
						et Amico</hi>, <hi rend="italics">De Amicorum Multitudine</hi>,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This point was subsequently shown, but with much less care and detail, by G. Hein (<hi rend="italics">Quaestiones Plut.</hi>, diss. Berlin, 1916, p. 37), who seems to have been ignorant of Brokate's far superior work.</note> and the <hi rend="italics">Life of
							Cato Minor</hi> was demonstrated by C. Brokate (<hi rend="italics">De
								aliquot Plui. libellis</hi>, diss. GÃ¶ttingen, 1913, pp. 17-24,
					58; and see the excellent tables on pp. 47, 61).
					Plutarch appears to have retained a certain amount
					of more or less irrelevant material on friendship from
					his recent work on these treatises, and also to have
					drawn upon some portions of Theophrastus's treatise
					<hi rend="italics">On Friendship</hi>.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Brokate, <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 7 ff.</note>

					The essay is No. 98 in the Lamprias catalogue.

					since you are already putting them into practice, you
					will seem to be giving your testimony in their favour
					rather than to be encouraged to perform them ; and
					the pleasure you will take in acts which are right will
					make the perseverance of your judgement more firm,

					Now Aristarchus,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Nauck, comparing Suidas, <hi rend="italics">s.v.</hi> Theodectes, and Stephanus Byzantius, would correct <q>Aristarchus</q> to Aristandrus, the father of the tragic poet Theodectas of Phaselis.</note> the father of Theodectes, by way
					of jeering at the crowd of sophists, used to say that in
					the old days there were barely seven Sophists,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">That is, the Seven Wise Men. Plutarch so uses <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofisth/s</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">cf.

					<pb n="v.6.p.249"/>
					
					that in his own day an equally large number of
					non-sophists could not easily be found. And according to my observation, brotherly love is as rare in
					our day as brotherly hatred was among the men of
					old ; when instances of such hatred appeared, they
					were so amazing that the times made them known to
					all as warning examples in tragedies and other
					stage-performances ; but all men of to-day, when they
					encounter brothers who are good to each other,
					wonder at them no less than at those famous sons of
					Molione,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 1083 c; Fraser's note on Apollodorus, ii. 7. 2 (L.C.L. vol. i. p. 249).</note> who, according to common belief, were
					born with their bodies grown together ; and to use
					in common a fathers wealth and friends and
					slaves is considered as incredible and portentous as
					for one soul to make use of the hands and feet and
					eyes of two bodies.

            <p>And yet the illustration of such common use by
					brothers Nature has placed at no great distance from
					us ; on the contrary, in the body itself she has contrived to make most of the necessary parts double
					and brothers and twins<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Hierocles, Frag. <hi rend="italics">De Fraterno Amore</hi> (Stobaeus, vol. iv. p. 663 ed. Hense).</note>: hands, feet, eyes, ears,
					nostrils ; and she has thus taught us that she has
					divided them in this fashion for mutual preservation
					and assistance, not for variance and strife. And
					when she separated the very hands into a number of
					unequal fingers, she supplied men with the most
					accurate and skilful of instruments, so that Anaxagoras<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</hi>
                  <hi rend="italics">5</hi>, ii. p. 30, 102.</note> of old assigned the reason for man's wisdom
					and intelligence to his having hands. The contrary
					of this, however, seems to be true<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">De Partibus Animalium</hi>, iv. 10 (687 a 17 ff.).</note>: it is not because

					<pb n="v.6.p.251"/>
					
					it is because by nature he was endowed with reason
					and skill that he acquired instruments of a nature
					adapted to these powers. And this fact is obvious to
					everyone : Nature from one seed and one source has
					created two brothers, or three, or more, not for
					difference and opposition to each other, but that by
					being separate they might the more readily co-operate
					with one another. For indeed creatures that had
					three bodies and an hundred hands, if any such were
					ever really born, being joined together in all their
					members, could do nothing independently and apart
					from one another, as may brothers, who can either
					remain at home or reside abroad, as well as undertake
					public office and husbandry through each other's help
					if they but preserve that principle of goodwill and
					concord which Nature has given them. But if they
					do not, they will differ not at all, I think, from feet
					which trip up one another and fingers which are unnaturally entwined and twisted by each other.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

					For most friendships are in reality shadows and

					<q>brother</q> in salutations and letters, but does not
					care even to walk with his own brother when they

            <p>I remember, for instance, that in Rome I undertook to arbitrate between two brothers, of whom one
					had the reputation of being a philosopher. But he

					be not present, men consider it unholy and unlawful.
					Hence what deed or favour or disposition, which

         <div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="section">
            <p>And surely this fact is quite easy to perceive

					are grieved by sons who maltreat a servant honoured
					by mother and father, and neglect plants or farm-lands
					in which their parents took delight, and that remissness in caring for some house-dog or horse hurts
					elderly persons who feel a jealous affection for them ;
					and when, again, we observe that parents are vexed
					when their children disparage and hiss at concerts
					and spectacles and athletes all of which they themselves used to admire ; when we observe these things,

					when sons quarrel, hate and malign each other, and
					array themselves ever against each other s interests
					and activities, and are finally ruined by each other?
					No one can say that the parents are indifferent.
					Hence when, on the other hand, brothers love and
					feel affection for each other, and, in so far as
					Nature has made them separate in their bodies,
					so far do they become united in their emotions
					and actions, and share with each other their studies
					and recreations and games, then they have made
					their brotherly love a sweet and blessed <q>sustainer

					so fond of oratory or of honour or of riches as he is
					of his children ; therefore fathers do not find such
					pleasure in seeing their sons gaining a reputation
					as orators, acquiring wealth, or holding office as in
					seeing that they love one another. So they report

					and three other sons, Attalus and Philetaerus and
					Athenaeus, that she always congratulated herself
					and gave thanks to the gods, not because of wealth
					or empire, but because she saw her three sons members of the body-guard of the eldest, who passed
					his days without fear surrounded by brothers with
					swords and spears in their hands. So again, on the
					contrary, when Artaxerxes<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Artaxerxes</hi>, xxx. (1027 b).</note> perceived that his son

					from others to himself. It is in this way that many
					play the demagogue against their brothers, having a
					specious but unjust pretext for this rapacity; for
					they deprive them of the greatest and fairest of inheritances, their parents' goodwill, by servilely and
					unscrupulously cutting across their brothers' path,
					opportunely making their attacks when the parents
					are occupied and unsuspecting, and, in particular,
					showing themselves dutiful and obedient and prudent
					in those matters in which they perceive their brothers
					to be in error, or seeming to be so. But the right
					way, on the contrary, when a son sees that his father
					is angry with his brother, is to take his share of it and
					bear the brunt of it together with his brother, by such
					assistance making the anger lighter, and then by
					rendering services and favours to help somehow or
					other to restore his brother to his father's grace.
					If there is error of omission, he can allege in the
					brother's favour the absence of opportunity, or that
					he was engaged on some other work, or his very
					nature, as being more useful and more intelligent
					in other directions. The saying of Agamemnon<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">On behalf of MenelaÃ¼s: <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi>, x. 122-123.</note>
					also is admirable :

					But since envy and jealousy of those who surpass
					them in repute and honour are implanted by nature
					chiefly in men of ambitious character, to guard
					against these vices it is highly expedient that brothers
					should not seek to acquire honours or power in the
					same field, but in quite different fields. Wild beasts,

					<pb n="v.6.p.293"/>
					
					cheer for each other. This, in fact, is the reason why,
					of the two sons of TyndareÃ¼s, Polydeuces won his
					victories in boxing and Castor in running. And
					Homer did well to represent Teucer as renowned in
					archery, while his brother was foremost among the
					heavy-armed :

					So, of those engaged in the service of the state,
					generals do not at all envy popular leaders ; nor,

					even call each other into consultation and commend
					one another. For brothers to seek eminence and
					repute from the same art or faculty is precisely the
					same as for both to fall in love with one woman
					and each seek to outstrip the other in her esteem.
					Those, indeed, who travel different roads afford each

            <p>But, over and above these considerations, we

               <q>Not so,</q> a sensible man would reply. <q>I have
							a brother who is highly esteemed, and most of his

					remarked that he would rather have Darius than

					wealth, high office, or eloquence, to have a brother
					who has attained to fame by virtue of office or
					wealth or eloquence.
				</p>
            <p>
					But although these means are the best for smoothing away such inequalities, yet there are the other
					differences which naturally arise among brothers who
					lack the proper training, differences due to disparity
					in their ages. For, generally speaking, elder brothers,
					when they claim the right always to dominate and
					to have precedence over the younger and to have the
					advantage in every matter where reputation and influence are involved, are oppressive and disagreeable;
					and younger brothers, in turn, being restive under the
					curb and becoming fractious, make it their practice
					to despise and belittle the elder. The result is that
					while the younger, feeling that they are being treated
					despitefully and are discriminated against, resent and
					try to avoid their elders' admonitions, the elder, ever
					clinging fast to their superiority, fear their brothers'
					
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.297"/>
					
					augmentation as though it meant elimination for
					themselves. Just as, then, we think it right that
					those who receive a favour should look upon it as of
					greater, and those who bestow it as of lesser value,
					so, in regard to a difference in ages, if we advise the
					elder to regard it as no great matter and the younger
					to think it no slight thing, we should rid the one
					of arrogance and neglect, and the other of disdain
					and contempt. And since it is fitting that the older
					should be solicitous about the younger and should
					lead and admonish him, and that the younger should
					honour and emulate and follow the older, let the
					solicitude of the former be rather that of a comrade than of a father, and of one who would persuade rather than command, and would rejoice in
					a brother's successes and applaud them rather than
					criticize him if he errs and restrain him-a spirit
					showing not only a greater desire to help, but also
					more kindness of heart. And in the emulation of
					the younger let imitation, not rivalry, be present;
					for imitation is the act of one who admires, but
					rivalry of one who envies. It is for this reason that
					men love those who wish to become like themselves,
					but repress and crush those who wish to become their
					equals. And among the many honours which it is
					fitting that the young render to their elders, obedience
					is most highly esteemed, and, together with respectfulness, brings about a staunch goodwill and favour
					which will in turn lead to concessions. Thus it was
					with Cato<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Cato Minor</hi>, iii. (761 b-c). Q. Servillus Caepio was Cato's half-brother.</note>: he so won over his elder brother Caepio by
					obedience and gentleness and silence from his earliest
					childhood that finally, by the time they both were
					men, he had so subdued him and filled him with so
					great a respect for himself that Caepio would neither
					
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.299"/>
					
					do nor say anything without Cato's knowledge. For
					example, it is said that on one occasion, when Caepio
					had affixed his seal to a deposition and Cato carne up
					later and was unwilling to add his own seal, Caepio
					demanded that the document be returned and removed his seal before asking the reason why his
					brother had suspected the deposition instead of
					believing it to be true. In the case of Epicurus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 1100 a; Epicurus, Frag. 178 (Usener, <hi rend="italics">Epicurea</hi>, p. 155).</note> also
					his brothers' respect for him was clearly great because
					of the goodwill and solicitude he had for them,
					inspired as they were with admiration both for his
					other attainments and especially for his philosophy.
					For even if they were mistaken in their opinion, yet
					since they were convinced and constantly declared
					from their earliest childhood that there was no one
					wiser than Epicurus, we may well admire both the
					man who inspired this devotion and also those who
					felt it. However, of the more recent philosophers,
					Apollonius the Peripatetic, by making Sotion, his
					younger brother, more famous than himself, refuted
					the man who asserted that fame could not be
					shared with another. And for myself, though I have
					received from Fortune many favours which call for
					gratitude, that my brother Timon's<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Timon appears in the <hi rend="italics">Quaest. Symp.</hi>, i. 2 and ii. 5.</note> affection for me

         <div type="textpart" n="17" subtype="section">
            <p>Furthermore, there are other disturbances

					offending and exasperating one another on all occasions,
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.301"/>
					
					which at last ends in incurable hatred and
					malevolence. For having once begun to differ in
					childish matters, about the care of animals and their
					fights, as, for instance, those of quails or cocks, they
					then continue to differ about the contests of boys in
					the palaestra, of dogs on the hunt, and of horses at
					the races, until they are no longer able to control or
					subdue their contentious and ambitious spirit in more
					important matters. So the most powerful of the
					Greeks in my time, disagreeing first about rival
					dancers, then about harp-players, and afterwards by
					continually holding up to invidious comparison the
					swimming-baths and porticoes and banquet-halls at
					Aedepsus,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Medicinal hot baths in Euboea; <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 667 c-d.</note> and then manoeuvring for places and positions, and going on to cut off aqueducts and divert

					they were deprived of everything by the despot,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Probably Domitian, as Reiske conjectured.</note>
					and, becoming exiles and paupers and-I had almost
					said-something other than their former selves, they
					remained the same only in their hatred for one
					another. It is therefore of no slight importance to
					resist the spirit of contentiousness and jealousy
					among brothers when it first creeps in over trivial
					matters, practising the art of making mutual concessions, of learning to take defeat, and of taking
					pleasure in indulging brothers rather than in winning
					victories over them. For the men of old gave the
					name of <q>Cadmean<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

					What then? Do not practical affairs bring many
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.303"/>
					
					occasions for controversy and dissension even to those
					who have the reputation of being of an equitable and
					gentle disposition? Yes, certainly. But there also
					we must see to it that the affairs fight the battle
					quite by themselves, without our inserting into
					the contest, like a hook, as it were, any emotion
					arising from contentiousness or anger; but, keeping
					our eyes fixed impartially upon the swaying of
					Justice, as though we were watching a pair of

					matter in dispute to the decision of a jury or of
					arbitrators, and cleanse its filth away before, like a

					become fast and hard to wash out. We should

					before they joined right hands, embraced each
					other, and were reconciled. For just as it is nothing
					alarming if a fever attends a swelling in the groin,
					but if the fever persists when the swelling is gone,
					it is thought to be a malady and to have a deeper
					origin : so when the dissension of brothers ceases
					after the matter in dispute is settled, the dissension
					was caused by the matter ; but if it remains, the
					matter was but a pretext and contained some
					malignant and festering reason.

						my brothers their honour after my own, and for

					What, then, prevents us also from treating the day
					on which we have quarrelled with any of our family
					or relatives as one to be consigned to oblivion, and
					counting it one of the unlucky days, instead of forgetting because of one day the many good days in
					which we grew up and lived together? For either it
					is in vain and to no avail that Nature has given us
					gentleness and forbearance, the child of restraint, or
					we should make the utmost use of these virtues in our
					relations with our family and relatives. And our
					asking and receiving forgiveness for our own errors
					reveals goodwill and affection quite as much as granting it to others when they err. For this reason we
					should neither overlook the anger of others, nor be
					stubborn with them when they ask forgiveness, but,
					on the contrary, should try to forestall their anger,
					when we ourselves are time and again at fault, by
					begging forgiveness, and again, when we have been
					wronged, in our turn should forestall their request for
					forgiveness by granting it before being asked.

					But in the case of King Eumenes<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Eumenes II of Pergamum; and <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 184 b, 480 c, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> it was not a
					mere word, but a deed, which revealed a gentleness
					that no one could surpass. For Perseus, the king of
					Macedonia, who was his enemy, procured men to kill
					him. These men set an ambush near Delphi, observing that he was coming on foot from the sea to the
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.311"/>
					
					temple of the god. They carne behind him and
					hurled great stones down upon his head and neck ;
					these made him dizzy and he fell down and was
					thought to be dead. A report of his death spread
					far and wide, and some of his friends and servants
					Carne back to Pergamum, and were thought to bring
					their report as actual eye-witnesses of the calamity.
					Attalus, therefore, the eldest of the king's brothers,
					an honourable man and more loyal to Eumenes than
					any of the others,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">The other brothers are mentioned by name in 480 c, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> not only took the crown and was
					proclaimed king, but also married his brother's wife,
					Strato nice, and had intercourse with her. But when
					the news carne that Eumenes was alive, and he himself was approaching, Attalus laid aside the crown,
					took his spears, as had been his custom before, and
					went with the other guardsmen to meet the king.
					And Eumenes not only cordially clasped his hand, but
					also embraced the queen, showing her honour and
					friendliness; and living a considerable time after his
					return, without giving a hint of blame or suspicion, he
					died, leaving to Attalus both his kingdom and his
					wife. And what did Attalus? When Eumenes was
					dead, he was unwilling to acknowledge as his own<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">By the ceremony in which the father raises the child in his arms to acknowledge its legitimacy. Probably Attalus did not actually disown his children, but merely made it clear that he did not regard them as heirs to the throne.</note>

					they were many, but brought up and educated his
					brother's son<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Stratonice had been childless for over sixteen years; she now became pregnant and, in due course, bore a son, whom Eumenes, according to Polybius, xxx. 2, had not acknowledge at least five years later; but subsequently he succeeded his legal uncle, Attalus II, as Attalus III. See W. S. Ferguson, <hi rend="italics">Class.

            <p>Then this further matter must be borne in

					enemies, imitating in this point, at least., the practice
					of Cretans, who, though they often quarrelled with

					when a man is in love his young and guileless friends
					share his love, it is also true that the most ill-disposed of enemies make a show of sharing the indignation and wrath of one who is angered and at variance
					with his brother. As, then, Aesop's<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Fabulae</hi>, 16 and 16 b ed. Halm.</note> hen said to the

					offend the sight,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 469 a, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>, and the note.</note> yet when we are in the midst of
					fault-finding and bursts of anger and suspicion toward
					our brothers, we enjoy the company of those who
					cause the disturbance and we take on from them a
					false colouring, when it would be wise to run away
					from our enemies and ill-wishers and avoid their
					notice, and to associate and spend our days almost
					entirely with relatives and intimates and friends of
					our brothers, visiting their wives also and frankly

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 491 d, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> And yet
					there is a saying that brothers walking together

					people are troubled if a dog runs between brothers,
					and are afraid of many such signs, not one of which
					ever ruptured the concord of brothers ; yet they do
					not perceive what they are doing when they allow
					snarling and slanderous men to come between them
					and cause them to stumble.

         </div>
         <div type="textpart" n="20" subtype="section">
            <p>And so the saying of Theophrastus,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Frag. 75 ed. Wimmer; <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 65 a.</note> - its
					relevance is suggested by our very subject - is excellent: <q>If the possessions of friends are common,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">Ethica Nicomachea</hi>, viii. 9. 1 (1159 b 31); Kock, <hi rend="italics">Com. Att. Frag.</hi>, iii. p. 6, Menander, Frag. 9, from the <hi rend="italics">Adelphoe</hi>.</note>
						then by all means the friends of friends should be
						common</q> ; and one should urge this advice upon
					brothers with special emphasis. For associations
					and intimacies which are maintained separately and
					apart lead brothers away from each other and turn
					them toward others, since an immediate consequence
					of affection for others is to take pleasure in others, to
					emulate others, and to follow the lead of others.
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.317"/>
					
					For friendships shape character and there is no
					more important indication of a difference in
					character than the selection of different friends.
					For this reason neither eating and drinking together nor playing and spending the day together
					can so firmly cement concord between brothers
					as the sharing of friendships and enmities, taking
					pleasure in the company of the same persons, and
					loathing and avoiding the same. For friendships
					held in common do not tolerate either slanders or
					conflicts, but if any occasion for wrath or blame arises,
					it is dissipated by the mediation of friends, who
					take it upon themselves and disperse it, if they are
					but intimate with both parties and incline in their
					goodwill to both alike. For as tin joins together
					broken bronze and solders it by being applied to both
					ends, since it is of a material sympathetic to both, so
					should the friend, well-suited as he is to both and
					being theirs in common, join still closer their mutual
					goodwill ; but those who are uneven and will not
					blend, like false notes of a scale in music, create discord, not harmony.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">More exactly, <q>the disjunction, not conjunction</q> of tetrachords.</note> One may, then, be in doubt
					as to whether Hesiod<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Works and Days</hi>, 707; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Commentarii in Hesiodum</hi>, 65 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. pp. 83 f.).</note> was right or not in saying,
					Nor should one make a friend a brother's peer.
					For that man who is a considerate and a common
					friend to both brothers, as we have described him,
					compounded as he is of the natures of both, will the
					more readily be a bond of brotherly love between
					them. But Hesiod, it is likely, was afraid of the
					common run of friends who are evil because of their
					jealous and selfish natures.
				</p>
            <p>
					But even if we feel an equal affection for a friend,
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.319"/>
					
					we should always be careful to reserve for a brother
					the first place in public offices and administration, and
					in invitations and introductions to distinguished men,
					and, in general, whenever we deal with occasions
					which in the eyes of the public give distinction and
					tend to confer honour, rendering thus to Nature the
					appropriate dignity and prerogative. For undue
					precedence in such matters is not so grand a thing
					for the friend, as the slight is shameful and degrading for a brother.

					But concerning this subject my opinions have been

					reminds and teaches us to be considerate of our

					not meet with the proper tending or care, they grow

         <div type="textpart" n="21" subtype="section">
            <p>But while care for brothers themselves is an

					faithful friends as have rendered zealous and efficient

					every side into marriage and in getting him well
					fastened in the bonds of lawful matrimony. And
					when he gets children, we should make even more

					to his wife ; and to their children let us be as welldisposed as toward our own, but even more gentle
					and tender, so that when they err, as children will,
					they may not run away or, through fear of father
					or mother, enter into association with knaves or sluggards, but may have recourse and refuge which at once
					admonishes in a kindly way and intercedes for their
					offence. It was in this way that Plato<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">This manner of education corresponds to that advocated in <hi rend="italics">Ep.</hi>, vii. (<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> 343 e ff.).</note> reclaimed his

					anything that would cause him pain, but when the
					young man was avoiding his parents, who were always
					showing him to be in the wrong and upbraiding him,
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.323"/>
					
					Plato showed himself friendly and free from anger to
					Speusippus and so brought about in him great respect
					and admiration for Plato himself and for philosophy.
					Yet many of Plato's friends used to rebuke him for
					not admonishing the youth, but Plato<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 71 e.</note> would say that
					he was indeed admonishing him : by his own, the

					So Aleuas the Thessalian, who was an arrogant and
					insolent youth, was kept down and treated harshly
					by his father; but his uncle received him and attached
					him to himself, and when the Thessalians sent to the
					god at Delphi lots<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">With <foreign xml:lang="greek">fruktou/s</foreign> the noun <foreign xml:lang="greek">kua/mous</foreign> is understood. The use of parched beans as lots seems to be known from this passage only.</note> to determine who should be king,
					the uncle, without the father's knowledge, slipped in
					a lot for Aleuas. When the Pythian priestess drew
					the lot of Aleuas, his father denied that he had put
					in one for him, and to everyone it appeared that
					there had been some error in the recording of names.
					So they sent again and questioned the god a second
					time ; and the prophetic priestess, as though to
					confirm fully her former declaration, answered :
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>It is the red-haired<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

                  <l>The child whom Archedice bore.</l>

					And in this manner Aleuas was proclaimed king by

					to honourable achievement, and, when they succeed,

               </note> admirably points the way to goodwill
					and affection for nephews. And one must also strive
					to emulate the deeds of those beings who are superior
					to man. So Heracles, though he begat sixty-eight

					even to this day in many places IolaÃ¼s<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Heracles' nephew, who helped him in his encounter with the Nemean lion.</note> has an altar
					in common with Heracles and men pray to them
					together, calling IolaÃ¼s Heracles' assistant. And
					when his brother Iphicles<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Twin-brother of Heracles, son of Alcmene and Amphitryon; <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 285 f.</note> fell at the battle in Lacedaemon, Heracles was filled with great grief and
