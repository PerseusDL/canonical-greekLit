Wilamowitz (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Commentariolum Grammaticum</title>, iii, pp. 27-28) suggested that the dialogue was published under the name of Lamprias; and this notion that Lamprias was in some sense either the real or the reputed author was adopted by Christ in the third edition of his <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Geschichte der griechischen Litteratur</title> (1898), p. 662, and by Hirzel (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">r Dialog</title>, ii, p. 185).</note> On the other hand, despite statements to the contrary, it is certainly mutilated at the beginning,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Mutilation was assumed by Xylander, Kepler, and Dübner and has been reasserted by Pohlenz (<title rend="italic">B.P.W.</title> xxxii [1912], pp. 649-650), von Arnim (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarch über Dämonen und Mantik</title>, p. 38), Raingeard (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="fre">Le <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΠΕΡΙ ΤΟΥ ΠΡΟΣΟΠΟΥ</foreign> de Plutarque</title>, pp. 49-50 on 920 B 1), and K. Ziegler (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 214). It was denied by Wilamowitz (<foreign xml:lang="lat">loc. cit.</foreign>), Hirzel (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">r Dialog</title>, ii, p. 186, n. 6), and M. Adler (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Diss. Phil. Vind.</title> x, pp. 88-89). Wyttenbach contended that <q>either nothing or no great part</q> had perished.</note> although one cannot tell whether much or little has been lost; this follows not merely from the abruptness of the opening as we have it, the lack of any kind of introduction, and the failure to identify the main speaker until two-thirds of the dialogue have been <pb xml:id="v12.p.3"/> finished, but even more surely from the nature of the text in the opening sentences .<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Those who have defended <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μὲν οὖν Σύλλας</foreign> <q xml:lang="grc">ταῦτ</q> <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶρε</foreign> <q xml:lang="grc">τῷ γ’ ἐμῷ μύθῳ προσήκει</q> <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτλ.</foreign> as a possible opening apparently were unaware that the reading of E is <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀαυνοσυλλας ταῦτα εἰρε. τῷ γὰρ ἐμῷ μύθῳ προσήκει κτλ..</foreign> and that B’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μὲν οῦν Σύλλας</foreign> is in all probability a conjecture made by the scribe of that MS. This being so, it is unjustifiable to <q>emend</q> the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ γὰρ ἐμῷ μύθῳ</foreign>, the reading of both E and B; and, if this <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign> stands, it is certain that our MSS. do not preserve the beginning of the dialogue. The next sentence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ εἰ δεῖ τι <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>προσανακροῦσαθαι, πρῦτον ἡδέως ἄν μοι δοκῶ πυθέσθαι</foreign>, which Wyttenbach needlessly <q>emended,</q> implies that some introduction of Sulla and his myth preceded the present beginning; and 937 C (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>Σύλλαν <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>οἷον ἐπὶ ῥητοῖς ἀκροατὴν γεγενημένον</foreign>) suggests what the nature of this introduction may have been. Even the tense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δ’ οὐκ ἐμέλλομεν</foreign> implies some preceding reference to an earlier conversation or a conversation itself interrupted by the arrival of Sulla.</note> </p> </div> 
<div subtype="chapter" type="textpart" n="2"><p rend="indent">In the dialogue as it stands the first speaker is Sulla. His chief function is to recount the myth which he mentions in the first extant words and which occupies the final fifth of the work; but he interrupts the dialogue proper at 929 E 930 A to ask whether a certain difficulty was treated in the discussion which Lucius is reporting. He is a Carthaginian (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 942 C), presumably the Sextius Sulla cited by Plutarch in his <title rend="italic">Romulus</title>, chap. 15 (26 C), and the same as the Carthaginian Sulla who gave a dinner for Plutarch in Rome (<bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv.</title> 727 B</bibl>). He is probably the Sulla who appears as the interlocutor of Fundanus in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Cohibenda Ira</title> (note b, 453 A) but probably not the same as the Sulla of <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv.</title> 636 A (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἑταῖρος</foreign>) and 650 A (one of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν συνήθων</foreign>).</p> <p>The second speaker, at once the narrator of the whole conversation and the leader of the dialogue <pb xml:id="v12.p.4"/> proper, is Lamprias,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">His name is not mentioned until 937 D. There at the beginning of a section which serves as the transition from the main or <q>scientific</q> part of the dialogue to the myth Theon calls Lamprias by name, as Sulla does also at the beginning of his myth (940 F) and at the end of it (945 D). It is probable that in the lost beginning of the work Lamprias was similarly identified.</note> who is also the narrator of the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Defectu Oraculorum</title> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 413 D), a dialogue in which he plays the leading role.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Flaceliére, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fre">Plutarque: Sur la Disparition des Oracles</title> (Paris, 1947), pp. 19-22.</note> In the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> E apud Delphos</title>, where Lamprias appears with Plutarch, Plutarch calls him brother (385 D); and he is frequently identified as Plutarchs brother in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv.</title> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 635 A, 726 D - E, 744 C [with 745 A], and possibly 626 A). He is characterized as a wit and a tease (726 D - E, 740 A), one accustomed to speak out in a loud voice (617 E-F), and capable of inventing a story as evidence to support his argument (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> E</title> 386 A); he is an expert in culinary matters (643 E, 669 C, 670 E) and in the dance (747 B) and shrinks from appearing as a kill-joy to younger men (704 E). He is made to emphasize his close relations with a Cynic (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 413 B); but he is no Cynic himself, and he is mortified to think that he might be supposed to have used his skill in argument to discredit any pious belief (435 E). He is said to honour the school of Aristotle above that of Epicurus (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest Conviv.</title> 635 A - B); but he does not hesitate to disagree with Aristotle in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Defectu Oraculorum</title> (424 C ff.) and to espouse against him the doctrine of the Academy (430 E ff.). In the De Facie he is a vehement critic of Stoic doctrine and a supporter of the Academic position (cf 922 F). Lamprias bore the name of his grandfather; but this <pb xml:id="v12.p.5"/> does not prove, as has sometimes been asserted, that he was older than his brothers, Plutarch and Timon. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 431 C - D, has been thought to show that he was a priest of the oracle in Lebadeia,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Hirzel, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">r Dialog</title>, ii, p. 189, n. 3; Flaceliére, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Op. cit.</foreign> p. 251, n. 233; Ziegler, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 10. </note> though this is not a necessary implication of that passage; and a Delphic inscription proves him to have been an archon at Delphi towards the end of Trajan’s reign or in the beginning of Hadrian’s. <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Dittenberger, <title rend="italic">S. I. G.</title> ii. 868 C, n. 6; Stein, <title rend="italic">R. E.</title> xii. 1. 586, <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαμπρίας</foreign> 4.</note></p>
   <p rend="indent">Apollonides, the third speaker, is at once identified as expert in geometry (920 F), and Lamprias indicates that the scope and limitations of his specialty coincide with those of Hipparchus, the great astronomer (921 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 925 A). He puts forward objections to Lamprias’s explanation of the <q>face</q> based upon astronomical terminology and calculations (933 f, 935 d-e). An Apollonides appears at Quaest Conviv. 650 F along with Sulla; but he is called o( taktiko\s *)apollwni/dhs, and there is no compelling reason to identify the two.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Ziegler (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 34) says that the sentence at 927 B, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ ἐν στρατορέδῳ τακτικῶν ὄφελος κτλ.</foreign>, is spoken <q>obviously with reference to the interlocutor Apollonides</q>; but this is pretty obviously not true. Lamprias is not here speaking in answer to Apollonides; and his subsequent words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ κηρουρῶν οὐδ’ οἰκοδόμων</foreign>, certainly have reference to none of the present company. These are in fact stock examples of the argument from design.</note> Prickard may well be right in saying that the name Apollonides here was used by Plutarch to mean <q>one of the clan of Apollonius,</q> <foreign xml:lang="lat">i.e.</foreign> a mathematician who, like Apollonius,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Apollonius of Perga; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Hultsch, <title rend="italic">R. E.</title> ii. 151-160.</note> is interested in astronomical theory.</p> <pb xml:id="v12.p.6"/> <p>Certainly Aristotle, who puts forward the orthodox Peripatetic theory of the heavenly bodies (928 E ff.), is only a name chosen by Plutarch to signify the school that he represents (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 920 F), even as the representative Epicurean in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Sera Numinis Vindicta</title> is called Epicurus.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">There is no reason to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐπίκουρος</foreign> of the MSS. in 548 A to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐπικούρειος</foreign>, as Fabricius did. <q>Aristotle</q> here supports <q>Epicurus</q> there.</note></p>
<p rend="indent">The Stoic position is represented by Pharnaces. This name was borne by the son of Mithridates, of whom Plutarch tells in the Lives of Pompey and Caesar, as well as by several notable Persians mentioned by Herodotus and Thucydides<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">There was also a city in Pontus named Pharnaceia (<bibl> <title rend="italic">Lucullus</title>, 17 [502 F]</bibl>).</note>; and Plutarch probably chose it for his Stoic because of its Asiatic sound.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Hirzel (Der Dialog, ii, p. 186, n. 4) says that Pharnaces is certainly a former slave, one who had shared the fate and sentiments of Epictetus. This, of course, is the merest fancy; not all Asiatics, not even all in Rome at this time, had been slaves. For Athenians named Pharnaces <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">I. G.</title> ii². 1039. 84 and 202. 55.</note></p>
<p rend="indent">After the role of Lamprias the largest in the dialogue proper is that of Lucius, who is probably the same as <q>Lucius, the pupil of Moderatus the Pythagorean, from Etruria,</q> a guest at the dinner which Sulla gave for Plutarch in Rome (<bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv</title> viii. 7-8 [727 B ff., 728 D ff.]</bibl>).<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Another Lucius, the son of Florus, appears in <bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv</title> vii. 4 [702 F]</bibl>; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <bibl>Ziegler, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 55</bibl>.</note> Early in the dialogue (921 F) Lamprias turns to Lucius for aid; he seems to think it appropriate that Lucius should set forth the strict <q>demonstration</q> of the Academic theory concerning <pb xml:id="v12.p.7"/> the moon (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 928 D - E); and in fact the statement and defence of this position are shared by the two of them.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">It is Lucius who demands that the Stoic theory should not be passed over without refutation (921 F). It is he who replies when Pharnaces complains of Lamprias’s violent treatment of the Stoics (922 F). His speeches extend from 922 F to 923 F, where Lamprias takes over to give him time to collect his thoughts, from 928 F to 929 E, from 930 A to 931 C, and from 931 D to 933 E.</note></p>
<p rend="indent">Theon, whom Lamprias asks to identify a quotation (923 F) and whom he later teases for admiring Aristarchus to the neglect of Crates (938 D), is recognized as the literary authority in the group (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 931 E, 940 A). He is probably to be identified with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θέων ὁ γραμμοτικός</foreign>, who was a guest at Sulla’s dinner along with Lucius (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv</title> 728 F) and who also dined with Plutarch at the house of Mestrius Florus (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv</title> 626 E).<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">This Theon, whose home was Egypt (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 939 C - D), is certainly not the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θέων ὁ ἑταῖρος</foreign> (<bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest. Conviv</title> 620 A</bibl>, <bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> E</title>, 386 D</bibl>), who is probably the Theon of <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Pythiae Oraculis, Non Posse Suaviter Vivi</title>, and <bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Quaest.

Lucius addresses him directly once (930 A), but Menelaus makes no reply and neither speaks nor is spoken to elsewhere in the dialogue as we have it,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Unless the plural <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμῖν</foreign> used twice by Lamprias at 939 C - D is meant to include Menelaus as well as Theon; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> note a on p. 170 <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign>.</note> He is not mentioned anywhere else by Plutarch either; but he is probably meant to be the Menelaus of Alexandria whom Ptolemy once calls <pb xml:id="v12.p.8"/> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ γεωμέτρης</foreign> and twice cites for astronomical observations which he made at Rome in the first year of Trajan (A.D. 98).<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <bibl> <author>Ptolemy</author>, <title rend="italic">Syntaxis</title>, vii. 3</bibl> (ii, p. 30. 18 ff. and p. 33. 3 ff.

   <div subtype="chapter" type="textpart" n="3"><p rend="indent">From 937 C - D it follows that the interlocutors have hitherto been promenading as they talked and that now they sit down upon the steps, seats, or benches (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῶν βάθρων</foreign>) and remain seated to the end. No other indication of the scene or location is given in the work as we have it. It had generally been assumed that the dialogue was meant to take place in Chaeronea<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Hirzel, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">r Dialog</title>, ii, p. 184, n. 1, who discusses and rejects the suggestion that the scene is Delphi. Raingeard in his note on 939 C (p. 129 of his commentary) says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ ἄνω περὶ Θήβας</foreign> there would allow the inference that the speakers are on the coast of Egypt. No such inference is justified by this phrase, of course; in fact, the preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλην δὲ καὶ καρποὺς αὐτοῦ</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόθι</foreign>, as Raingeard conjectures) <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν ὄμβροι τρέφουσιν</foreign> and the subsequent <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ’ ὑμῖν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ</foreign> (939 D 1) show that the scene of the dialogue is not anywhere in Egypt.</note>; but nothing in the text requires this, and F. H. Sandbach has adduced strong arguments for believing that the dramatic location is Rome or the vicinity of Rome.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">F. H. Sandbach, <q>The Date of the Eclipse in Plutarch’s De Facie</q> <title rend="italic">Class. Quart.</title> xxiii (1929), pp. 15-16; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Ziegler, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 73-74. I am indebted to Mr. Sandbach for sending me, along with copies of his publications, many of his unpublished opinions concerning points in the De Facie and copies of his correspondence with J. K. Fotheringham occasioned by the publication of the article cited above.</note> The persons in the dialogue furnish one of these arguments. Apollonides, Aristotle, and Pharnaces occur nowhere else in Plutarch’s writings and are probably all fictitious <pb xml:id="v12.p.9"/> characters. Plutarch nowhere else mentions Menelaus the mathematician either, but we know that Menelaus spent some time in Rome (see note a, p. 8). Sulla, Lucius, and Theon all appear together at a dinner given for Plutarch when he had returned to Rome after an interval of absence (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Quaest Conviv.</title> viii. 7-8); and none of these three is ever mentioned as being anywhere but in Rome or its vicinity (see § 2, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>).

Adler then, assuming that after the ceremonious restoration of the temple in A.D. 84 Plutarch would not remind his readers of its devastation, concluded that the dialogue must have been written before A.D. 84. This argument was criticized by K. Mras (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Zeitschrift für die österreichischen Gymnasien</title>, lxv [1914], p. 187), who in turn deleted <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυφὦνες</foreign> from the text and read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τιτυοὶ δὲ καὶ ὁ Τυφὼν ὁ νφών Δελφούς <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

Kaltwasser’s change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυφών</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πύθων</foreign>, on the other hand, is practically certain. Confusion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">π</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ</foreign> and of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φ</foreign> is easy and common, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύθων</foreign> coming after <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυφώνες</foreign> would very easily be assimilated to it. Moreover, in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 421 C, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ περὶ Πύθωνα</foreign> are included among <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαιμόνων πάθη</foreign> along with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ Τυφωνικά</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ Τιτανικά</foreign>. In 414 A - B the oracle at Delphi is said to have been long deserted in what is represented as <q>ancient times</q>; and, if it is denied that the beast (which is not here named but is certainly Pythons3) was the cause, that is done in order to ascribe the cause to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαίμονες</foreign>. Finally, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πύθων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τιτυός</foreign> are named together by Plutarch in Pelopidas, 16 (286 C) as they are by Strabo (ix. 3. 12 [cc. 422-423]) and Apollodorus (<title rend="italic">Bibliotheca</title>, i. 4. 1. 3-5 [22-23]).</note>; and we are restricted by the evidence at present available to the conclusion that the conversation was meant to have taken place in or about Rome some time and perhaps quite a long time after A.D. 75.</p> <p>So much for the dramatic date.

<div subtype="chapter" type="textpart" n="4"><p rend="indent">The structure of the De Facie is complicated. The whole of the work is narrated by Lamprias who speaks in the first person and quotes those who took part in the conversation, including himself, some few times in indirect discourse (e.g. 933 F) but for the most part directly. The last part of his narration (chaps. 26-30 [940 F 945 D] consists entirely of Sulla’s myth given in Sulla’s own words; this myth, Sulla himself says, is a story told to him by an unnamed stranger, whom he quotes first indirectly and then (942 D ff.) directly to the end. The second or eschatological part of the myth the stranger had told Sulla that he had himself heard from <q>the chamberlains and servitors of Cronus</q> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 945 D). Hearing it from Lamprias now, the reader has this part at fourth hand and the geographical introduction of the stranger at third hand.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Cf, Plato’s <title rend="italic">Parmenides</title> and Shorey, <title rend="italic">What Plato Said</title>, p. 287.</note></p>
   <p rend="indent">From 937 C it appears that Sulla had promised to tell his myth in return for an account of what had been said in an earlier discussion about the nature of the face which appears in the moon. Such a compact may have been expressly made in the beginning of the dialogue which is lost, where Sulla may have come upon the company already engaged in reviewing that earlier discussion (see note a, p. 3). So much is no more than conjecture. It is certain, however, <pb xml:id="v12.p.15"/> that most of what Lamprias narrates from chapter 2 through chapter 23 is a conversation which is itself represented as containing a resume or report of what was said at an earlier conversation. This the beginning of chapter 24 (937 C) states explicitly: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμεῖς μὲν οὖν, ἔφην, ὅσα μὴ διαπέφευγε τὴν μνήμην τῶν ἐκεῖ λεχθέντων ἀπηγγέλκαμεν</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδόκει λέγεσθαι</foreign> at the end of chapter 2 (920 F) implies that what Lamprias has hitherto said in that chapter had been used as an argument in the earlier discussion.

Nevertheless, Pharnaces’ words in the latter passage, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὲ δ’ οὖν οὐκ ἐξλαξεσθε τήμερον κτλ.</foreign>, are open to the interpretation that he had been present at the earlier discussion and had there been drawn out by the Academic gambit.</note>; and concerning Aristotle and Menelaus the text as we have it allows no clear inference to be drawn.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Lucius’s one remark to Menelaus (930 A), <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχύνομαι <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>σοῦ παρόντος κτλ.</foreign>, seems to imply that the latter had not been present at the earlier discussion; but this is not decisive, especially in view of the fact that Menelaus makes no reply. Aristotle’s silence when Lamprias addresses him in 920 F might be taken to mean that he had heard this before; and <foreign xml:lang="grc"><gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>πρὸς Κλέαρχον, ὦ Ἀριστότελες, <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>ἐδόκει λέθεσθαι τὸν ὑμέρτον</foreign> could be interpreted as a reminder, although what follows, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμέτερος γὰρ ἁνὴρ κτλ.</foreign>, sounds as if this were something new. In 929 B Lucius in a speech addressed especially to Aristotle refers to what <q>our comrade</q> said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῇ διατριβῇ</foreign> and adds that he will not repeat what he learned <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ ὑμῶν μεθ ὑμῶν</foreign>, which might be taken to imply that Aristotle too had attended the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διατριβή</foreign> in question, although it might have a more general meaning.</note> What these men other than Lamprias and Lucius say in chapters 2-23 is not, then, part of the report of that earlier discussion; but neither is all that Lucius says, for in several places his remarks or arguments are expressly declared to be his own contribution.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Lamprias’s comment, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ οὕτως δ’ ὁ ἑταῖρος ἡμῶν</foreign>, in 921 F and his <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλῷ λόγῳ καλὴν ἀναλογίαν προσλεθηκας: οὐ γὰρ ἀποστερητόν σε τῶν ἰδίων</foreign> (931 D). The latter marks the last sentence of Lucius’s preceding speech (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δότε δή μοι γεωμετρικῶς εἰρεῖν κτλ.</foreign>) as his own, while Lucius’s own subsequent statement (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκοῦν καὶ δεύτερον ἀναλογίᾳ προσχρητέον</foreign>) makes the same claim for what follows. In 933 C (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρίημι δ’ ὅσα <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>ἐλέχθη</foreign>) and possibly in 929 B (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ δὲ ταῦτα μὲν οὐκ ἐρῶ κτλ.</foreign> [see note b <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>]) Lucius indicates that he is not giving a full account of the earlier discussion.</note> That earlier discussion cannot, however, be identified with any that Plutarch <pb xml:id="v12.p.17"/> may have had with his friends or with any lecture that he may have given; it is primarily a literary fiction, part of the structure of the dialogue for which it provides a specious motivation.</p> <p>The recapitulation of this fictitious discussion along with the incidental arguments provoked by it contains all that Plutarch would consider to be <q>scientific</q> in the dialogue. At its conclusion Lamprias is ready for Sulla’s myth (chap. 24 <foreign xml:lang="lat">init.</foreign> [937 C - D]); but before Sulla can begin to speak Theon raises the question of the habitability of the moon, contending that, if it is not habitable, there can be no reason for it to exist with the nature or composition that according to Lamprias and Lucius it does have.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 937 D: <foreign xml:lang="greek"><gap reason="lost" rend=" . . . "/>εἰ δυνατὸν ἐκεῖ κατοικεῖν. εἰ γὰρ δυνατόν, ἄλογον καὶ τὸ γῆν εἰναι τὴν σελήνην: δόκει γάρ πρὸς οὐδὲν ἀλλὰ μάτην γεγονέναι κτλ.</foreign> </note> Lamprias calls Theon’s speech a kind of relaxation after the seriousness of the preceding discussion. In fact, however, Theon has raised the metaphysical problem of the final cause; and to this Lamprias replies at length (chap. 25). He argues first that the moon, constituted as he contends it is, need not, even if uninhabitable, be without a purpose in the universe (938 C - F), and secondly that, even if uninhabitable by corporeal human beings, it may still be inhabited by living beings of an entirely different kind to whom the moon may justly appear to be the only real earth and our earth the slime and dregs of the universe, uninhabitable by creatures that have warmth and breath and motion. Here Sulla checks Lamprias (chap. 26 <foreign xml:lang="lat">init.</foreign> [940 F]) lest the latter encroach upon his myth; and Lamprias was upon the very threshold <pb xml:id="v12.p.18"/> of it, for the myth, as it turns out, teaches that the moon is inhabited by souls that have left their bodies after death on earth or have not yet been incorporated by birth into terrestrial bodies. So the episode consisting of Theon’s speech and Lamprias’s reply (chaps. 24-25) is not merely a formal literary device. It is, to be sure, a transition from the scientific part of the dialogue, in which it is argued that the lunar phenomena imply the earth-like constitution of the moon, to the concluding myth in which the purpose of such a moon in the universe is imaginatively portrayed; but this <q>transitional episode</q> raises the philosophical question, without the answer to which the strictly astronomical conclusion could to a Platonist or Aristotelian be no complete or satisfactory explanation, and itself contains the metaphysical answer, of which the myth is, despite all its intrinsic interest, essentially a poetical embellishment. When this <q>transition</q> is properly attended to, there can be no question about the integral unity of the whole dialogue or any doubt that the purpose of the whole is to establish and defend the position that the moon is entirely earthy in its constitution and that on this hypothesis alone can the astronomical phenomena and the existence of the moon itself be accounted for.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> M.

Hipparchus and Aristarchus of Samos are familiarly cited and a technical work of the latter is quoted verbatim, the laws of reflection are debated, the doctrine of natural motion to the universal centre is rejected, and stress is laid upon the cosmological importance of the velocity of heavenly bodies. <note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">It is interesting to compare the treatise of Ibn Al-Haitham (965-1039) which was translated from the Arabic by Carl Schoy under the title <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Abhandlung des Schaichs Ibn Alî Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Haitham: über die Natur der Spuren [Flecken], die man auf der Oberfläche des Mondes sieht</title> (Hannover, 1925). Ibn Al-Haitham’s explanation of the <q>face</q> is that the nature of the moon’s substance must differ from place to place, since the variation in illumination can be the result only of a difference in the power to absorb and reflect light, and the spots are places of greater density and less power of absorption (pp. 20 ff. and 29-31). Though Schoy appears to have been unaware of it and Plutarch does not mention it, this explanation is ascribed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἀρὸ τῶν μαθηματικῶν</foreign> in Aëtius, ii. 30. 7 (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Dox. Graeci</title>, p. 362. 5-13). Ibn Al-Haitham rejects the theory that the spots are shadows cast by prominences on the moon, arguing that such shadows would not always have the same shape and position, as the spots do (pp. 14-17). Like Plutarch, however, he knows and refutes the notion that they are a reflection of the terrestrial ocean or any other terrestrial feature (pp. 1-2, 5-7; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Facie</title>, chaps. 3-4); and he also adduces the colour of the moon in eclipse (pp. 31 f.; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Facie</title>, 934 B - D). He proves impossible as well (pp. 4-5, <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> p. 2) an explanation unmentioned by Plutarch but recorded by Simplicius (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Caelo</title>, p. 457. 25-30) that the spots are the result of vapours rising from below and obscuring the moon’s brilliance (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign>, however, for something similar, Milton, <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, v. 415-420, and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Facie</title>, 922 B - C). Like Cleomedes (ii. 4. 103 [p. 186. 14-27 Ziegler]), Ibn Al-Haitham seems to hold that the moon as a reflecting convex mirror would have to appear as a single point of light (pp. 7 f. with Schoy’s note, p. 8, n. 1).</note> <pb xml:id="v12.p.20"/> Most of the attention given to the dialogue, however, has been attracted by the concluding myth.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">It was probably the myth as much as the more strictly astronomical part of the dialogue that caused Kepler to make his Latin translation and commentary of the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Facie</title>, which he did shortly before his death.

<p rend="indent">The discussion of the second part of the myth, the demonology and eschatology, has also been concerned mainly with the problem of Plutarch’s sources.

Later, against Karl Reinhardt’s attempt to trace the myth back to a hypothetical <q>solar esehatology</q> of Posidonius, Jones re-established the Platonic character of Plutarch’s eschatology, psychology, and demonology here and the impossibility of taking Posidonius for the source.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">K.

As to Hamilton’s notion of the seriousness with which Plutarch intended the myth, Ziegler is surely right in saying (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 217) that Sulla’s final sentence, taken together with Lamprias’s remark in 920 B - C, shows that Plutarch had no intention of insisting upon the literal truth of the myth; in this attitude also he follows Plato: see note a on p. 223 <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign>.</note> Soury in his extensive study of the myth, while emphasizing the possible influence of the mysteries, agrees in general with Hamilton that it is preponderantly Platonic.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">G.

<p rend="indent">Anyone who without a preconceived thesis to defend reads the De Facie will recognize, I believe, that Plato was Plutarch’s inspiration throughout the dialogue but that Plutarch is himself the true author of the whole work and that, while there is in it a distillation of his wide and varied scientific and philosophical reading, he cannot possibly have composed it by copying out any source or combination of sources. I have tried in the exegetical notes to indicate the <q>parallels</q> which will help the reader to understand the dialogue itself by seeing its relation <pb xml:id="v12.p.26"/> to the rest of ancient scientific and philosophical thought. Among these <q>parallels</q> some of the most striking are drawn from later writers, especially Neo-Platonists; these I have mentioned not in order to insinuate that they show Plutarch’s direct influence upon those later writers, although many of them certainly were acquainted with him, but because they illuminate the meaning of the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Facie</title> and at the same time indicate what may have been contained in some of the philosophical writings known to Plutarch and long since lost to us, and may help to cast some flicker of light upon that obscure and controversial problem, the prehistory of Neo-Platonism.</p> </div>

He makes one noteworthy alteration in the text at 941 A - B: adopting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν δὲ βριάρεων ἔχοντα φρονρόν</foreign>, after which he puts a full stop, he removes the following words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν τε νήσων <gap reason="lost" rend=" . . .

The following words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι’ ἧς ἐπιλάμπει κτλ.</foreign>, themselves explain what Plutarch means (see note g on 944 E <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign>), and there is no excuse for any supplement at all.</p> <p>945 B: He rightly defends Kaltwasser’s alteration of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυφὼν</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πύθων</foreign> (see Introduction, p. 12, note b <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>).</p> <p>H.

On that assumption there should have been no distinction of dark and shadowy air; but all the air should become dark when occulted, or when the moon is caught by the sun it should all shine out with an even light. For with us too, while <pb xml:id="v12.p.53"/> the air in the depths and hollows of the earth, wherever the suns rays do not penetrate, remains shadowy and unlit, that which suffuses the earth outside takes on brilliance and a luminous colour.

Since the sun is eclipsed by being overtaken and the moon by encountering that which produces the eclipse, it is reasonable or rather it is necessary that the sun be caught first from behind and the moon from the front, for the obstruction begins from that point which the intercepting body first assails. The sun is assailed from the west by the moon that is striving after him, and she is assailed from the east [by the earth’s shadow] that is sweeping down as it were in the opposite direction. Thirdly, moreover, consider the matter of the duration and the magnitude of lunar eclipses. If the moon is eclipsed when she is high and far from the earth, she is concealed for a little time; but, if this very thing happens to her when she is low and near the earth, she is strongly curbed and is slow to get out of the shadow, although when she is low her exertions of motion are greatest and when she is high they are least. The reason for the difference lies in the shadow, which being broadest at the base, as cones are, and gradually contracting terminates at the vertex in a sharp and fine tip. Consequently the moon, if she has met the shadow when <pb xml:id="v12.p.129"/> she is low, is involved by it in its largest circles<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <bibl> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Communibus Notitiis</title>, 1080 B</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐταὶ γάρ δήπουθεν αἱ τῶν κωνικῶν τμημάτων ἐπιφάνειαι. κύκλοι εἰσίν</foreign>.</note> and traverses its deep and darkest part; but above as it were in shallow water by reason of the fineness of the shadow she is just grazed and quickly gets clean away.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Cleomedes, ii. 6. 119 (pp. 214. 13-216. 8 [Ziegler]); for the observation that the planets appear to move most swiftly when they are nearest to the earth and most slowly when they are farthest away <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Cleomedes, ii. 5. 112-114 (pp. 202. 26-206. 27), and Theon of Smyrna, p. 135. 6-11 and p. 157. 2-12 (Hiller).

In the present passage Plutarch does not say why his interpretation of Homer’s line justifies him in calling the moon <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ Ἅιδου πέρας</foreign>, but the rest of the myth makes it certain that Hades is the region between earth and moon (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 943 C <foreign xml:lang="lat">s.v.</foreign>).

Most people rightly hold man to be composite but wrongly hold him to be composed of only two parts. The reason is that they suppose mind to be somehow part of soul, thus erring no less than those who believe soul to be part of body, for in the same degree as soul is superior to body so is mind better and more divine than soul.

Here, however, Artemis and Ilithyia are supposed to be names for two contrary faculties of the moon. In 938 F <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign> the identification of the moon with Artemis because she is <q>sterile but is helpful and beneficial to other females</q> implies that Artemis <emph>is</emph> Ilithyia, as she is in Plato’s <bibl> <title rend="italic">Theaetetus</title>, 149 B</bibl> (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Cornutus, p. 73, 7-18 [Lang]).

L. A. Post has suggested that he may also have intended <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρταμεῖν</foreign> as an etymology of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀρτεμις</foreign>.
