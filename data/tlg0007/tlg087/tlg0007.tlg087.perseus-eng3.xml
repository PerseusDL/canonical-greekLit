	<head>ON THE FORTUNE OR THE VIRTUE OF ALEXANDER (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE ALEXANDRI MAGNI FORTUNA AUT VIRTUTE</foreign>) I AND II</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="indent"> Again we have epideictic orations similar to the preceding and the following essays, and the conclusion again is abrupt, as if the speaker had been obliged to stop after a certain period of time had elapsed. Note, however, the very considerable difference in length between the first and the second part of the present work. </p><p rend="indent">We know nothing of the circumstances under which these orations were delivered, but it is quite possible that they were spoken at Rome to show the Romans what an educated Greek could do in the treatment of a controversial subject. </p><p rend="indent">The first oration deals mainly with the manner in which Fortune used Alexander; but much is also said of the manner in which he met the buffetings of Fortune and rose superior to them. In the second oration Fortune is by no means neglected, but rather more is said of Alexander’s Virtue; thus it is not surprising to find in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works two entries: the first, No. 176, <title rend="italic" >Alexander’s Fortune</title> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου τύχης </foreign>) and the second, No. 186, <title rend="italic">Alexander’s Virtue</title> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου άρετῆς</foreign>). </p><p rend="indent">Much that is included here is found also in Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, in Arrian’s <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, and in other writers cited in the notes. <pb xml:id="v.4.p.381"/> </p><p rend="indent">The genuineness of the tradition which ascribes these works to Plutarch (for the attribution had been attacked by A. Schäfer and by L. Weber) has been brilliantly vindicated by W. Nachstädt in his dissertation, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De Plutarchi Declamationibus quae sunt De Alexandri Fortuna (Berliner Beiträge für klassischen Philologie</title>, ii.), Karl Vogt, Berlin, 1895. This excellent work also contains a discussion of many of the problems which confront the editor of these essays and has been of great service. </p> </div> </div> <pb xml:id="v.4.p.383"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">This is Fortune’s discourse, who declares that Alexander is her own characteristic handiwork, and hers alone. But some rejoinder must be made on behalf of philosophy, or rather on Alexander’s behalf, who would be vexed and indignant if he should be thought to have received as a pure gift, even at the hands of Fortune, the supremacy which he won at the price of much blood and of wounds that followed one after another; and <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Many a night did he spend without sleeping, </l> <l>Many a blood-stained day did he pass amid combats unceasing,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Adapted from Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ix. 325-326.</note> </l> </quote> against irresistible forces and innumerable tribes, against impassable rivers and mountain fastnesses whose summit no arrow could reach, furthered by wise counsels, steadfast purpose, manly courage, and a prudent heart. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">I think that if Fortune should try to inscribe her name on his successes, he would say to her, <q>Slander not my virtues, nor take away my fair fame by detraction. Darius was your handiwork: he who was <pb xml:id="v.4.p.385"/> a slave and courier of the king,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 340 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. xviii.

Adorn yourself, proud Fortune, and vaunt your dominion over kings that never felt a wound nor shed a drop of blood. For they have been Fortune’s favourites, men such as Ochus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Artaxerxes III. (358-338 b.c.).</note> was and Artaxerses, whom at the very hour of their birth you placed upon the throne of Cyrus. But my body bears many a token of an opposing Fortune and no ally of mine. First, among the Illyrians,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This wound is elsewhere unknown to history. For the wounds of Alexander see the excellent tables of Nachstädt, <emph>op. cit.</emph> pp. 38-44.</note> my head was wounded by a stone and my neck by a cudgel.

Next at Gaza<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The text is probably corrupt; in Curtius, iv. 6, we hear of two wounds, and they are quite different ones.

Then at Maracandaf<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 341 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; Arrian, <title rend="italic" >Anabasis</title>, iii. 30. 11; Curitus, vii. 6.</note> the bone of my leg was split open by an arrow.

But if Ptolemy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Peucestas in <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, and in Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>.</note> had not held his shield above me, and Limnaeus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Leonnatus according to Arrian (<title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, vi. 10. 2).</note> taking his stand before me had not fallen, a target for ten thousand shafts, and if my Macedonians had not overthrown the wall with spirit and main force, then that nameless village in a foreign land must needs have become the tomb of Alexander.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">Moreover, there were the trials of the campaign itself: storms, droughts, deep rivers, the heights of the Birdless Rock,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 181 c; Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, iv. 28; Diodorus, xvii. 85.

Then there were also the difficulties before his expedition:<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. xi. (670 b).</note> Greece was still gasping over Philip’s wars; Thebes, staggering to her feet after her fall, was shaking the dust of Chaeroneia from her arms, and Athens was stretching forth a helping hand to join with Thebes.

But King Ptolemy puts them at thirty thousand foot and five thousand horse, Anaximenes at forty-three thousand foot, fifty-five hundred horse. And the great and glorious war-chest which Fortune had ready for him was only seventy talents,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">£14,000 or $70,000.</note> as Aristobulus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 342 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> says, though Duris<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Müller, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> ii. p. 472.</note> says it was provision for only thirty days. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent">Was, then, Alexander ill-advised and precipitate in setting forth with such humble resources to acquire so vast an empire? By no means. For who has ever put forth with greater or fairer equipment than he: greatness of soul, keen intelligence, selfrestraint, and manly courage, with which Philosophy <pb xml:id="v.4.p.391"/> herself provided him for his campaign? Yes, the equipment that he had from Aristotle his teacher when he crossed over into Asia was more than what he had from his father Philip. But although we believe those who record that Alexander once said that the <title rend="italic">Iliad</title> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chaps. viii. (p. 668 d) and xxvi. (679 c-d); Pliny, <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, vii. 29. 108.</note> and the <title rend="italic">Odyssey</title> accompanied him as equipment for his campaigns, since we hold Homer in reverence, yet are we to contemn anyone who asserts that the works of Homer accompanied him as a consolation after toil and as a pastime for sweet hours of leisure, but that his true equipment was philosophic teaching, and treatises on Fearlessness and Courage, and Self-restraint also, and Greatness of Soul? For of course it is obvious that Alexander wrote nothing on the subject of either syllogisms or axioms, nor did he have the opportunity of sharing the walks in the Lyceum,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, of occupying himself with Peripatetic (Aristotelian) philosophy.</note> or of discussing propositions in the Academy. For it is by these criteria that those define philosophy who regard it as a theoretical rather than a practical pursuit. And yet even Pythagoras wrote nothing at all, nor did Socrates, nor Arcesilaus, nor Carneades, who were all most notable among philosophers. Nor were these philosophers continuously occupied with such tremendous wars, nor with spreading civilization among foreign princes, nor in establishing Grecian cities among savage nations, nor did they go on and on, instructing lawless and ignorant tribes in the principles of law and peace; but, even though they had leisure, they relinquished the writing of philosophy to sophists. Whence, then, comes our belief that they were true philosophers? Surely from what they said, or from the <pb xml:id="v.4.p.393"/> manner of life which they led, or from the principles which they taught. By these criteria let Alexander also be judged! For from his words, from his deeds, and from the instruction which he imparted, it will be seen that he was indeed a philosopher. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">And first, if you will, consider a matter entirely contrary to the general belief, and compare Alexander’s pupils with those of Plato and Socrates. Plato and Socrates taught pupils of splendid natural endowment who spoke the same language; so that, even if the pupils understood nothing else, at least they understood the Greek tongue. And even so, Plato and Socrates did not win over many. But their pupils, such as Critias and Alcibiades and Cleitophon,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">It is interesting to note that dialogues bearing the names of all these pupils have been handed down to us under the name of Plato, although some of them are thought to be spurious.</note> were prone to spew the good word forth, as a horse the curbing bit, and turned them to other ways. </p><p rend="indent">But if you examine the results of Alexander’s instruction, you will see that he educated the Hyrcanians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wyttenbach in sadness doubts whether these ethnological remarks are the fruit of any research on the part of Plutarch. But they probably derive from a hazy recollection of such passages as Herodotus, i. 216 (of the Massagetae). Note, however, that Strabo supports Plutarch on this custom of the Persians (xv. 3. 20), which is easily explained by the fact that the young king inherited his father’s harem as well as his father’s stable, and that the father’s younger wives furnished the beginning of the son’s harem. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Sophocles, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trachiniae</title>, 1221-1251.

O wondrous power of Philosophic Instruction, that brought the Indians to worship Greek gods, and the Scythians to bury their dead, not to devour them! We admire Carneades’ power, which made Cleitomachus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diogenes Laertius, iv. 67; Athenaeus, 402 c.</note> formerly called Hasdrubal, and a Carthaginian by birth, adopt Greek ways. We admire the character of Zeno, which <pb xml:id="v.4.p.395"/> persuaded Diogenes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diogenes, from Seleucia in Mesopotamia (Strabo, xvi. 1. 16; Diogenes Laertius, vi. 81), was said to have been a pupil of Chrysippus, and thus was converted to the inheritance of Zeno, Stoicism.</note> the Babylonian to be a philosopher. But when Alexander was civilizing Asia, Homer was commonly read, and the children of the Persians, of the Susianians, and of the Gedrosians learned to chant, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. viii. (p. 668 e).</note> And although Socrates, when tried on the charge of introducing foreign deities,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic" >Apology</title>, 24 b; Xenophon, <title rend="italic" >Memorabilia</title>, i. 1. 1.</note> lost his cause to the informers who infested Athens, yet through Alexander Bactria and the Caucasus learned to revere the gods of the Greeks. Plato wrote a book on the One Ideal Constitution, but because of its forbidding character he could not persuade anyone to adopt it; but Alexander established more than seventy cities among savage tribes, and sowed all Asia with Grecian magistracies, and thus overcame its uncivilized and brutish manner of living. Although few of us read Plato’s <title rend="italic" >Laws</title>, yet hundreds of thousands have made use of Alexander’s laws, and continue to use them. Those who were vanquished by Alexander are happier than those who escaped his hand; for these had no one to put an end to the wretchedness of their existence, while the victor compelled those others to lead a happy life. Therefore it is even more just to apply Themistocles’ saying<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 185 f, and the note there.</note> to the nations conquered by Alexander. For, when Themistocles in exile had obtained great gifts from Artaxerxes, and had received three cities to pay him tribute, one to supply his bread, another his wine, and a third his meat, he exclaimed, <q>My children, we should be ruined now, had we not been ruined before.</q> Thus Alexander’s new subjects would not have been civilized, had they not been vanquished; Egypt <pb xml:id="v.4.p.397"/> would not have its Alexandria, nor Mesopotamia its Seleuceia, nor Sogdiana its Prophthasia, nor India its Bucephalia, nor the Caucasus a Greek city<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Alexandria-in-the-Caucasus: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, iii. 28. 4; iv. 22. 4; v. 1. 5; Curtius, vii. 3. 23; Diodorus, xvii. 83. 1.</note> hard by; for by the founding of cities in these places savagery was extinguished and the worse element, gaining familiarity with the better, changed under its influence. If, then, philosophers take the greatest pride in civilizing and rendering adaptable the intractable and untutored elements in human character, and if Alexander has been shown to have changed the savage natures of countless tribes, it is with good reason that he should be regarded as a very great philosopher. </p> </div>

This Zeno wrote, giving shape to a dream or, as it were, shadowy picture of a well-ordered and philosophic commonwealth; but it was Alexander who gave effect to the idea. For Alexander did not follow Aristotle’s<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Aristotle’s name is not elsewhere linked with this advice; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Strabo, i. 4. 9 (p. 66), or Aristotle, Frag. 658 (ed.

But, as he believed that he carne as a heaven-sent governor to all, and as a mediator for the whole world, those whom he could not persuade to unite with him, he conquered by force of arms, and he brought together into one body all men everywhere, uniting and mixing in one great loving-cup, as it were, men’s lives, their characters, their marriages, their very habits of life.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Arrian, <title rend="italic" >Anabasis</title>, vii. 11. 8-9.</note> He bade them all consider as their fatherland the whole inhabited earth, as their stronghold and protection his camp, as akin to them all good men, and as foreigners only the wicked; they should not distinguish between Grecian and foreigner by Grecian cloak and targe, or scimitar and jacket; but the distinguishing mark of the Grecian should be seen in virtue, and that of the foreigner in iniquity; clothing and food, marriage and manner of life they should regard as common to all, being blended into one by ties of blood and children. </p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p rend="indent">Considering carefully this order of affairs, Alexander did not favour the Median raiment, but preferred the Persian, for it was much more simple than the Median.

As a philosopher what he wore was <pb xml:id="v.4.p.403"/> a matter of indifference, but as sovereign of both nations and benevolent king he strove to acquire the goodwill of the conquered by showing respect for their apparel, so that they might continue constant in loving the Macedonians as rulers, and might not feel hate toward them as enemies. Conversely it were the mark of an unwise and vainglorious mind to admire greatly a cloak of uniform colour and to be displeased by a tunic with a purple border, or again to disdain those things and to be struck with admiration for these, holding stubbornly, in the manner of an unreasoning child, to the raiment in which the custom of his country, like a nurse, had attired him. When men hunt wild animals, they put on the skins of deer, and when they go to catch birds, they dress in tunics adorned with plumes and feathers; they are careful not to be seen by bulls when they have on red garments, nor by elephants when dressed in white;<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 144 d.</note> for these animals are provoked and made savage by the sight of these particular colours. But if a great king, in taming and mollifying headstrong and warring nations, just as in dealing with animals, succeeded in soothing and stilling them by wearing a garb familiar to them and by following their wonted manner of life, thereby conciliating their rough natures and smoothing their sullen brows, can men impeach him? Must they not rather wonder at his wisdom, since by but a slight alteration of his apparel he made himself the popular leader of all Asia, conquering their bodies by his arms, but winning over their souls by his apparel? And yet men marvel at the disciple of Socrates, Aristippus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Horace, <title rend="italic" >Epistles</title>, i. 17. 23-29 <q> <foreign xml:lang="lat">personamque feret non inconcinnus utramque</foreign>.</q> </note> that whether he wore a threadbare <pb xml:id="v.4.p.405"/> cloak or a fine Milesian robe he retained his gentility in either; but they impeach Alexander because, although paying due respect to his own national dress, he did not disdain that of his conquered subjects in establishing the beginnings of a vast empire. For he did not overrun Asia like a robber nor was he minded to tear and rend it, as if it were booty and plunder bestowed by unexpected good fortune, after the manner in which Hannibal later descended upon Italy, or as earlier the Treres<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Strabo, i. 3. 21; xi. 8. 4.</note> descended upon Ionia and the Scythians<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, i. 15, 103-106.</note> upon Media. But Alexander desired to render all upon earth subject to one law of reason and one form of government and to reveal all men as one people, and to this purpose he made himself conform. But if the deity that sent down Alexander’s soul into this world of ours had not recalled him quickly, one law would govern all mankind, and they all would look toward one rule of justice as though toward a common source of light.

Or rather, in the manner of dead bodies, after the soul departs, when they are no longer held together by natural forces, but undergo dispersion and dissolution, and finally are dissipated and disappear altogether; even so Alexander’s forces, having lost him, maintained a gasping, agitated, and fevered existence through men like Perdiccas, Meleager, Seleucus, and Antigonus, who, as it were, provided still a warm breath of life and blood that still pulsed and circulated.

And when his men wTere earnestly trying to bring help from without and were attempting to scale the wails, Fortune, by breaking and shattering their ladders, took away their foothold and hurled them from the walls. And of the three<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">327 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. lxiii. (700 c) mention only two; but Plutarch here seems to follow the authority used by Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, vi. 10, who gives the number as three; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also 344 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> men who alone were quick enough to grasp the wall and, throwing themselves <pb xml:id="v.4.p.481"/> down inside, to take their stand beside the king, Fortune straightway snatched up one and made away with him before he could strike a blow; and a second, pierced through by many arrows, was only so far from death that he could see and perceive his king’s danger. But the charges and shouting of the Macedonians were unavailing for they had no machines nor siege engines with them; but in their zeal they tried to hack the walls with their swords, and were forced to break them off with their bare hands, and all but bite their way through. </p><p rend="indent">But the king, who was Fortune’s favourite, and was always guarded and personally protected by her, was caught within like a wild beast in the toils, alone and without succour; nor was he struggling for Susa or Babylon, nor to capture Bactriaj nor to vanquish the great Porus; for in great and glorious conflicts, even though men fail, disgrace, at least, can find no place. But so contentious and malicious was Fortune, so greatly did she favour barbarians and hate Alexander, that she tried to destroy not only his body and his life, but also, in so far as she could, to destroy his repute and to wipe out his fair fame. For it were not a terrible thing for Alexander to fall and lie buried beside the Euphrates or the Hydaspes, nor ignoble to meet death by coming into close combat with Darius or in confronting the horses and swords and battle-axes of the Persians as they fought to defend their king, nor to be overthrown while he bestrode the walls of Babylon and to fall from his high hope. Thus fell Pelopidas and Epameinondas; their death was a death belonging to Virtue, not to misfortune, engaged as they were in such a high emprise. But of what sort was the deed of Fortune, who is now <pb xml:id="v.4.p.483"/> under scrutiny? Was it not that on the farthest outposts of a land beside a foreign river within the walls of an obscure hamlet, which surrounded and hid away. from sight the lord and master of the inhabited world, he should perish, smitten and stricken by ignominious weapons and whatever else lay at hand? For his head was wounded through his helmet by an axe, and someone shot an arrow through his breastplate so that it penetrated the bones of his breast and was lodged there firmly, while the shaft protruded and hampered him and the iron point was four fingers broad and five fingers long.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch the rhetorician increases by one finger’s-breadth the dimensions of the arrow-point which are given by Plutarch the biographer in his <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. lxiii. (700 e).</note> But - the extreme of all the dangers he confronted - while he was defending himself against those who attacked him in front, the archer who shot him had plucked up courage to approach him with a sword, but Alexander with his dagger was too quick for the man and knocked him down and killed him; but while he was thus occupied, someone ran out from a mill, and gave him a blow on the neck with a cudgel from behind; this confused his senses, and his head swam. But Virtue was by his side and in him she engendered daring, and in his companions strength and zeal. For men like Limnaeus and Ptolemy and Leonnatus and all those who had surmounted the wall or had broken through it took their stand before him and were a bulwark of Virtue, exposing their bodies in the face of the foe and even their lives for the goodwill and love they bore their king. Surely it is not due to Fortune that the companions of good kings risk their lives and willingly die for them; but this they do <pb xml:id="v.4.p.485"/> through a passion for Virtue, even as bees, as if under the spell of love-charms, approach and closely surround their sovereign. </p><p rend="indent">What spectator, then, who might without danger to himself have been present at that scene, would not exclaim that he was witnessing the mighty contest of Fortune and Virtue; that through Fortune the foreign host was prevailing beyond its deserts, but through Virtue the Greeks were holding out beyond their ability? And if the enemy gains the upper hand, this will be the work of Fortune or of some jealous deity or of divine retribution; but if the Greeks prevail, it will be Virtue and daring, friendship and fidelity, that will win the guerdon of victory? These were, in fact, the only support that Alexander had with him at this time, since Fortune had put a barrier between him and the rest of his forces and equipment, fleets, horse, and camp. </p><p rend="indent">Finally, the Macedonians routed the barbarians, and, when they had fallen, pulled down their city on their heads. But this was no help to Alexander; for he had been hurried from the field, arrow and all, and he had the shaft in his vitals; the arrow was as a bond or bolt holding his breastplate to his body. And when they tried forcibly to pull it out of the wound by the roots, as it were, the iron would not budge, since it was lodged in the bony part of the breast in front of the heart. They did not dare to saw off the protruding portion of the shaft, since they were afraid that the bone might be split by the jarring and cause excruciating pain, and that an internal haemorrhage might result. But when Alexander perceived their great perplexity and hesitation, he himself tried with his dagger to cut off the arrow <pb xml:id="v.4.p.487"/> close to his breastplate; but his hand was unsteady and affected by a torpid languor from the inflammation of the wound. Accordingly with encouraging words he urged those that were unwounded to take hold and not to be afraid; and he railed at some who were weeping and could not control themselves, others he branded as deserters, since they had not the courage to Come to his assistance. And he cried aloud to his Companions, <q>Let no one be fainthearted even for my sake! For it will not be believed that I do not fear death, if you fear death for me!</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Some think the narrative closes abruptly, and that it should have been continued to include at least Alexander’s recovery, but the Greeks did not always insist on a happy ending narrated in full.</note> </p> </div> </div> </div>
