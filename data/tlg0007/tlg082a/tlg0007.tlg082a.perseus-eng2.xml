      	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"><head>INTRODUCTION</head> 
      		<p rend="indent">Plutarch wrote an article about the Spartans, as he tells us in his <title>Life of Lysander</title>, chap. xvii. (443 a). The only question, therefore, that can be raised is whether <title>The Ancient Customs of the Spartans</title> is that article. It is true that adverse judgement has been pronounced upon it, mainly because of some infelicities of language, and the character of the last chapter; yet, whether written by Plutarch or by another, it is in the main the work of Plutarch, and much of it comes from the same source as Plutarch’s <title>Life of Lycurgus</title>. The body of facts and traditions here set down is, in great part, to be found scattered here and there in other writers, especially in the extant histories of Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon, to say nothing of other historians whose works are now lost. Much had been brought together, long before Plutarch’s time, in the <title>Constitution of Sparta</title>, which is printed among the works of Xenophon.</p> 
	<p rend="indent">A hint that various sources were used in making this compilation may be found in the fact that some of the verbs are in the present tense and others in the past.</p> </div>

<p rend="indent">The young men slept together, according to division and company, upon pallets which they themselves brought together by breaking off by hand, without any implement, the tops of the reeds which grew on the banks of the Eurotas.

<p rend="indent">Affectionate regard for boys of good character was permissible, but embracing them was held to be disgraceful, on the ground that the affection was for the body and not for the mind.

<p rend="indent">Moreover, the young men were required not only to respect their own fathers and to be obedient to them, but to have regard for all the older men, to make room for them on the streets, to give up their seats to them, and to keep quiet in their presence. As the result of this custom each man had authority, not as in other states over his own children, slaves, and property, but also over his neighbour’s in like manner as over his own, to the end that the people should, as much as possible, have all things in common, and should take thought for them as for their own.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the note on <title>Moralia</title>, 232 b (3), <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> </p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p rend="indent">This was the object of the starvation diet. It was meagre both for the reasons given and purposely that the youth should never become accustomed to being sated, but to being able to go without food; for in this way, the Spartans thought, the youth would be more serviceable in war if they were able to carry on without food, and they would be more self-controlled and more frugal if they lived a very considerable time at small expense. And to put up with the plainest diet, so as to be able to consume anything that came to hand, they thought made the youths’ bodies more healthy owing to the scanty food, repressed in any impulse towards thickness and breadth, to grow tall, and also to make them handsome; for a spare and lean condition they felt served to produce suppleness, while an overfed condition, because of too much weight, was against it.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title>Life of Lycurgus</title>, chap. xvii.

<p rend="indent">They were no less seriously concerned over their music and their songs. These contained a stimulus to awaken a spirit of pride and to afford an inspiring and effective impulse.

<p rend="indent">So there were three choirs,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pollux, <title>Lexicon</title>, iv. 107, says that the three choirs were established by Tyrtacus.</note> corresponding to the three periods of life, which were made up at their festivals, and the choir of old men would begin with this song<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> Cf. <title>Moralia</title>, 544 e; Plutarch’s <title>Life of Lycurgus</title>, chap. xxi.

<p rend="indent">Moreover the rhythmic movement of their marching songs was such as to excite courage and boldness, and contempt for death; and these they used both in dancing, and also to the accompaniment of the flute when advancing upon the enemy. In fact, Lycurgus coupled fondness for music with military drill, so that the over-assertive warlike spirit, by being combined with melody, might have concord and harmony. It was for this reason that in time of battle the king offered sacrifice to the Muses before the conflict, so that those who fought should make their deeds worthy to be told and to be remembered with honour.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title>Life of Lycurgus</title>, chap. xxi.

Moreover, when Timotheus was competing at the Carneian Festival, one of the Ephors took a knife, and asked him on which side he should cut out the superfluous strings beyond the usual seven.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For variant versions of the story see the note on <title>Moralia</title>, 220 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> </p> </div>

<p rend="indent">Lycurgus did away with all superstitious fear connected with burials, granting the right to bury the dead within the city, and to have the tombs near the shrines. He also abolished the pollutions associated with death and burial. He permitted the people to bury nothing with their dead, but only to enfold the body in a red robe and olive leaves, and all to treat their dead alike.

<p rend="indent">One of the noble and blessed privileges which Lycurgus appears to have secured for his fellowcitizens was abundance of leisure. In fact it was not permitted them to take up any menial trade at all; and there was no need whatever of making money, which involves a toilsome accumulation, nor of busy activity, because of his having made wealth wholly unenvied and unhonoured. The Helots tilled the soil for them, paying a return which was regularly settled in advance. There was a ban against letting for a higher price, so that the Helots might make some profit, and thus be glad to do the work for their masters, and so that the masters might not look for any larger return.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title>Moralia</title>, 214 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and the note; Xenophon, <title>Constitution of Sparta</title>, 7. 1-6; Isocrates, <title>Busiris</title>, 20; Müller, <title>Frag.

<p rend="indent">It was forbidden them to be sailors and to fight on the sea. Later, however, they did engage in such battles, and, after they had made themselves masters of the sea, they again desisted, since they observed that the character of the citizens was deteriorating sadly. But they changed about again, as in all else. For example, when money was amassed for the Spartans, those who amassed it were condemned <pb xml:id="v.3.p.447"/> to death; for to Alcamenes and Theopompus, their kings, an oracle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Leutsch and Schneidewin, <title>Paroemiographi Graeci</title>, i. p. 39 and i. p. 201, and the references there given; also Diodorus, viii. 12. 5, and Plutarch, <title>Life of Agis</title>, chap. ix.

So it was, <pb xml:id="v.3.p.449"/> until they ceased altogether to observe the laws of Lycurgus, and came to be ruled despotically by their own citizens, preserving nothing of their ancestral discipline any longer, and so they became much like the rest, and put from them their former glory and freedom of speech, and were reduced to a state of subjection; and now they, like the rest of the Greeks, have come under Roman sway. </p> </div> </div></body>
