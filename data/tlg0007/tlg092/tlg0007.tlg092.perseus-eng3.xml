<div type="translation" xml:lang="eng" n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg092.perseus-eng3"> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.348"/> <head>THE OBSOLESCENCE OF ORACLES (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE DEFECTU ORACULORUM</foreign>)</head> <lb/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> Plutarch’s answer to the question why many oracles in Greece have ceased to function is that the population is now much less than it was, and so there is less need for oracles now than in earlier times. For example, at Delphi there used to be twro prophetic priestesses with a third held in reserve; now there is only one, and yet she is sufficient for every need. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The statement of this simple fact hardly requires twenty-nine folio pages, but in this essay, as in the two preceding, there is much of the conversation of cultured persons which is not directly connected with the subject. Thus we find a discussion of whether the year is growing shorter, whether the number of the worlds is one or some number not more than five or is one hundred and eighty-three. We have further discussion of the number five, some astronomy, and a good deal of geometry, some interesting bits of information about Britain and the East and a rather long discussion of the <emph>daimones</emph>, the beings a little lower than the gods and considerably higher than mortals; perhaps the translation <q>demi-gods</q> might best convey the idea in English. These beings are thought by many persons to be in charge of the oracles; certainly the god himself does not appear personally at his oracles; and in the case of the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.349"/> oracle at Delphi some account is given of the accidental discovery by a shepherd of the peculiar powers of the exhalation from the cleft in the rocks. </p> 
<p rend="indent">Students of English literature will be interested in the dramatic description of the announcement of the death of Pan; and students of religion will be interested in the essay as a very early effort to reconcile science and religion. That the essay had an appeal to theologians is clear from the generous quotations made from it by Eusebius and Theodoretus. We could wish that they had quoted even more, since their text is usually superior to that contained in the manuscripts, which in some places are quite hopeless. The mss. have also an unusual number of lacunae. Much has been done in the way of correction, sometimes perhaps too much, since Plutarch’s thought is not always necessarily so logical as the editors would make it. </p> 
<p rend="indent">Some parts of the essay make rather difficult reading, but it also contains passages of considerable interest and even beauty. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The essay is No. 88 in Lamprias’s list of Plutarch’s works. </p> 
<p rend="indent">The conversation is professedly narrated by Plutarch’s brother Lamprias to Terentius Priscus, but some have thought that Plutarch has used the person of Lamprias to represent himself, possibly because of the official position held by Plutarch at Delphi. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.351"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p rend="center"><label>(The persons taking part in the conversation are: Lamprias, Demetrius, Cleombrotus, Ammonius, Philip, Didymus, and Heracleon.)</label></p><p rend="indent">The story<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The numerous other references to this story may be found most conveniently in Frazer’s <title rend="italic">Pausanias</title>, v. p. 315.</note> is told, my dear Terentius Priscus, that certain eagles or swans, flying from the uttermost parts of the earth towards its centre, met in Delphi at the omphalus, as it is called; and at a later time Epimenides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, ii. p. 191, Epimenides, no. b 11.</note> of Phaestus put the story to test by referring it to the god and upon receiving a vague and ambiguous oracle said, <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Now do we know that there is no mid-centre of earth or of ocean; </l> <l>Yet if there be, it is known to the gods, but is hidden from mortals.</l> </quote> Now very likely the god repulsed him from his attempt to investigate an ancient myth as though it were a painting to be tested by the touch. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent">Yet a short time before the Pythian games, which were held when Callistratus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The year 83-84 a.d.</note> was in office in our own day, it happened that two revered men coming from opposite ends of the inhabited earth met together at Delphi, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.353"/> Demetrius<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>. <title rend="italic">Inscript. Graec.</title> xiv. no. 2548 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεοῖς τοῖς τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ Πραιτωρίου Σκριβ</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ώνιος</foreign>) (others <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκρῖβα</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημήτριος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὠκεανῷ καὶ Τηθύι Δημήτρι</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Huebner, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Ephemeris Epigr.</title> iii. 312; Clark, <title rend="italic">Archaeol. Jour.</title> xlii. p. 425; Dessau, in <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xlvi. (1911) pp. 156 ff.</note> the grammarian journeying homeward from Britain to Tarsus, and Cleombrotus of Sparta, who had made many excursions in Egypt and about the land of the Cave-dwellers, and had sailed beyond the Persian Gulf; his journevings were not for business, but he was fond of seeing things and of acquiring knowledge; he had wealth enough, and felt that it was not of any great moment to have more than enough, and so he employed his leisure for such purposes; he was getting together a history to serve as a basis for a philosophy that had as its end and aim theology, as he himself named it. He had recently been at the shrine of Ammon, and it was plain that he was not particularly impressed by most of the things there, but in regard to the everburning lamp he related a story told by the priests which deserves special consideration; it is that the lamp consumes less and less oil each year, and they hold that this is a proof of a disparity in the years, which all the time is making one year shorter in duration than its predecessor; for it is reasonable that in less duration of time the amount consumed should be less. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent">The company was surprised at this, and Demetrius went so far as to say that it was ridiculous to try in this way to draw great conclusions from small data, not, as Alcaeus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 184, Alcaeus, no. 113.</note> puts it, <q>painting the lion from a single claw,</q> but with a wick and lamp postulating a mutation in the heavens and the universe, and doing away completely with mathematical science. <pb n="v.5.p.355"/> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Neither of these things,</q> said Cleombrotus, <q>will disturb these men; certainly they will not concede any superior accuracy to the mathematicians, since it is more likely that a set period of time, in movements and cycles so far away, should elude mathematical calculation than that the measurement of the oil should elude the very men who were always giving careful attention to the anomaly and watching it closely because of its strangeness. Besides, Demetrius, not to allow that small things are indication of great stands directly in the way of many arts; for it will result in taking away from us the demonstration of many facts and the prognostication of many others. Yet you people try to demonstrate to us also a matter of no small importance: that the heroes of old shaved their bodies with a razor, because you meet with the word <q>razor</q> in Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title> x. 173.</note>; also that they lent money on interest because Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> iii. 367-368.</note> somewhere says that <q>a debt is owing, not recent nor small,</q> the assumption being that <q>owing</q> signifies <q>accumulating.</q> And again when Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Il.</title> x. 394, for example; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 923 b. Further explanation of the idea that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θοός</foreign> may mean <q>conical</q> may be found in the <title rend="italic">Life and Poetry of Homer</title>, 21 (Bernardakis’s edition, vol. vii. p. 347).</note> speaks of the night as <q>swift,</q> you cling to the expression with great satisfaction and say that it means this: that the Earth’s shadow is by him called conical, being caused by a spherical body; and as for the idea that medical science can predict a pestilential summer by a multitude of spiders’ webs or by the fig-leaves in the spring when they are like crows’ feet, who of those that insist that small things are not indications of great will allow this to go unchallenged? Who will endure <pb xml:id="v.5.p.357"/> that the magnitude of the sun be measured by reference to a quart or a gill, or that, in the sun-diai here, the inclination of the acute angle which its shadow makes with the level plane be called the measurement of the elevation of the ever-visible pole above the horizon? This was what one might hear from the priests of the prophetic shrine there; so some other rejoinder must be offered to them, if we would make for the sun the wonted order of its course immutable, in accord with the tradition of the ages.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent">Thereupon Ammonius the philosopher, who was present, exclaimed, <q>Not for the sun only, but for the whole heavens. For the sun’s course in passing from solstice to solstice must inevitably become shorter and not continue to be so large a part of the horizon as the mathematicians say it is, since the southern portion is constantly subject to a contracting movement, which brings it closer to the northern portion; and so our summer must become shorter and its temperature lower, as the sun turns about within narrower limits and touches fewer parallels of latitude at the solstitial points; moreover, the phenomenon observed at Syenê,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Syenê was on the Tropic of Cancer, and because of the fact that on the day of the summer solstice the sun was directly overhead it was used by Eratosthenes (third century b.c.) as one of the termini in calculating the circumference of the Earth. Cleomedes, <title rend="italic">On the Circular Movement of Heavenly Bodies</title>, i. 10, describes Eratosthenes’ method.</note> where the upright rods on the sun-dials cast no shadow at the time of the summer solstice, is bound to be a thing of the past; many of the fixed stars must have gone below the horizon, and some of them must be touching one another, or have become coalescent, as the space separating them has disappeared! But if, on the other hand, they are going to assert that, while all the other bodies are without change, the sun displays <pb n="v.5.p.359"/> irregularity in its movements, they will not be able to state the cause of the acceleration which affects the sun alone among so many bodies, and they will throw into confusion almost all the celestial mechanics, and into complete confusion those relating to the moon, so that they will have no need of measures of oil to prove the difference. In fact, the eclipses will prove it, as the sun more frequently casts a shadow on the moon and the moon on the earth; the other facts are clear, and there is no need to disclose in further detail the imposture in the argument.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>But,</q> said Cleombrotus, <q>I myself actually saw the measure; for they had many of them to show, and that of this past year failed to come up to the very oldest by not a little.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Then,</q> said Ammonius, taking up the argument again, <q>this fact has escaped the notice of the other peoples among whom ever-burning fires have been cherished and kept alive for a period of years which might be termed infinite? But on the assumption that the report is true, is it not better to assign the cause to some coldness or moisture in the air by which the flame is made to languish, and so very likely does not take up nor need very much to support it? Or, quite the reverse, may we assign the cause to spells of dryness and heat? In fact, I have heard people say before this regarding fire, that it burns better in the winter,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic">Comment. on Hesiod, Works and Days</title>, 559 (Bernardakis’s edition, vol. vii. p. 78).</note> being strongly compacted and condensed by the cold; whereas in warm, dry times it is very weak and loses its compactness and intensity, and if it burns in the sunlight, it does even worse, and takes hold of the fuel without energy, and consumes it more slowly. Best of all, the cause might be assigned to the oil itself; for it is not unlikely that in days of old it <pb xml:id="v.5.p.361"/> contained incombustible material and water, being produced from young trees; but that later, being ripened on full-grown trees and concentrated, it should, in an equal quantity, show more strength and provide a better fuel, if the people at Ammon’s shrine must have their assumption preserved for them in spite of its being so strange and unusual.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"> <p rend="indent">When Ammonius had ceased speaking, I said, <q>Won’t you rather tell us all about the oracle, Cleombrotus? For great was the ancient repute of the divine influence there, but at the present time it seems to be somewhat evanescent.</q></p> 
	<p rend="indent">As Cleombrotus made no reply and did not look up, Demetrius said, <q>There is no need to make any inquiries nor to raise any questions about the state of affairs there, when we see the evanescence of the oracles here, or rather the total disappearance of all but one or two; but we should deliberate the reason wrhy they have become so utterly weak. What need to speak of others, when in Boeotia, which in former times spoke with many tongues because of its oracles, the oracles have now failed completely, even as if they were streams of flowing water, and a great drought in prophecy has overspread the land? For nowhere now except in the neighbourhood of Lebadeia has Boeotia aught to offer to those who would draw from the well-spring of prophecy. As for the rest, silence has come upon some and utter desolation upon others. And yet at the time of the Persian Wars many had gained a high repute, that of Ptoan Apollo no less than that of Amphiaraüs; Mys, as it seems, made <pb n="v.5.p.363"/> trial of both.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The mss. show several lacunae and corruptions here; the general sense must be restored from Herodotus, viii. 133-135. For some unexplained reason Plutarch in his <title rend="italic">Life of Aristeides</title>, chap. xix. (330 c) and Pausanias, ix. 23, lay this scene at the oracle of Trophonius at Lebadeia.</note> The prophetic priest of this oracle, accustomed in former times to use the Aeolic dialect, on that occasion took the side of the barbarians and gave forth an oracle such that no one else of those present comprehended it, but only Mys himself, since it is quite clear from the inspired language then used by the prophetic priest that it is not for barbarians ever to receive a word in the Greek tongue subservient to their command.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Themistocles</title>, chap. vi. (114 d); <title rend="italic">Life of Cato the Elder</title>, chap. xxiii. (350 c).</note></q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">The minion who was sent to the oracle of Amphiaraüs had, in his sleep<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The oracle of Amphiaraüs was an incubation oracle: the consultants went to sleep in the shrine and received their answer in dreams.</note> there, a vision of a servant of the god who appeared to him and tried first to eject him by word of mouth, alleging that the god was not there; then next he tried to push him away with his hands, and, when the man persisted in staying, took up a large stone and smote him on the head. All this was in harmony, as it were, with events to come; for Mardonius was vanquished while the Greeks were led, not by a king, but by a guardian and deputy of a king<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Mardonius was defeated at Plataea in 479 b.c. by the Greeks under the command of Pausanias, who was regent of Sparta and guardian of Pleistarchus, son of Leonidas.</note>; and he fell, struck by a stone j ust as the Lydian dreamed that he was struck in his sleep.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">That time, too, was the most flourishing period of the oracle at Tegyrae, which place also by tradition is the birthplace of the god; and of the two streams of <pb xml:id="v.5.p.365"/> water that flow past it, the inhabitants even to this day call the one <q>Palm</q> and the other <q>Olive.</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch gives more information about Tegyrae in his <title rend="italic">Life of Pelopidas</title>, chap. xvi. (286 b).</note> Now in the Persian Wars, when Echecrates was the prophetic priest, the god prophesied for the Greeks victory and might in war; and in the Peloponnesian War, when the people of Delos had been driven out of their island,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the year 421 b.c. (Thucydides, v. 1).</note> an oracle, it is said, was brought to them from Delphi directing them to find the place where Apollo was born, and to perform certain sacrifices there. While they were wondering and questioning the mere possibility that the god had been born, not in their island, but somewhere else, the prophetic priestess told them in another oracle that a crow would show them the spot. So they went away and, when they reached Chaeroneia, they heard the woman who kept their inn conversing about the oracle with some strangers who were on their way to Tegyrae. The strangers, as they were leaving, bade good-bye to the woman and called her by her name, which actually was <q>Crow.</q> Then the Delians understood the meaning of the oracle and, having offered sacrifice in Tegyrae, they found a way to return home a short time thereafter. There have been also more recent manifestations than these at these oracles, but now the oracles are no more; so it is well worth while, here in the precinct of the Pythian god, to examine into the reason for the change.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent">Proceeding onward from the temple, we had by this time reached the doors of the Cnidian Clubhouse.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In the north-east corner of the sacred precinct. The foundations may still be seen.</note> Accordingly we passed inside, and there we saw sitting and waiting for us the friends to whom <pb xml:id="v.5.p.367"/> we were going. There was quiet among the other people there because of the hour, as they were engaged in taking a rub-down or else watching the athletes. Then Demetrius with a smile said, <q> <q>Shall I tell you a falsehood or speak out the truth?</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> iv. 140.</note> You seem to have on hand nothing worth considering; for I see that you are sitting about quite at your ease and with faces quite relaxed.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Yes,</q> said Heracleon of Megara in reply, <q>for we are not investigating which of the two lambdas in the verb <q>hurl</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Present <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάλλω</foreign>, future <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλῶ </foreign>.</note> is the one that it loses in the future tense; nor from what positives the adjectives <q type="unspecified" >worse</q> and <q>better</q> and <q>worst</q> and <q>best</q> are formed; for these and similar problems may set the face in hard lines, but the others it is possible to examine in a philosophic spirit, without knitting the brows, and to investigate quietly without any fierce looks or any hard feelings against the company.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Then permit us to come in,</q> said Demetrius, <q>and with us a subject which has naturally occurred to us, one which is related to the place and concerns all of us on account of the god; and beware of knitting your brows when you attack it!</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"> <p rend="indent">When, accordingly, we had joined their company and seated ourselves among them and Demetrius had laid the subject before them, up sprang at once the Cynic Didymus, by nickname Planetiades, and, striking the ground two or three times with his staff, cried out, <q>Aha! a difficult matter to decide and one requiring much investigation is that which you have come bringing to us! It is indeed a wonder, when so much wickedness has been disseminated upon earth that not only Modesty and Righteous Indignation, as Hesiod<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 199.</note> said long ago, have deserted the life <pb xml:id="v.5.p.369"/> of mankind, but that Divine Providence also has gathered up its oracles and departed from every place! Quite the contrary, I propose that you discuss how it happens that the oracle here has not also given out, and Heracles for a second time, or some other god, has not wrested away the tripod<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 387 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and the note.</note> which is constantly being occupied with shameful and impious questions which people propound<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 408 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> to the god, some of whom try to make a test of him as though his wisdom were an affectation, while others init questions about treasures or inheritances or unawful marriages; so Pythagoras<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 169 e.</note> is proved to be utterly wrong in asserting that men are at their best when they approach the gods. Thus those maladies and emotions of the soul which it would be good to disclaim and conceal in the presence of an older man, they bring naked and exposed before the god.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent">He would have said more, but Heracleon seized hold of his cloak, and I, being about as intimate with him as anybody, said, <q>Cease provoking the god, my dear Planetiades; for he is of a good and mild disposition, <quote rend="blockquote">And towards mortal men he hath been judged the most gentle,</quote> as Pindar<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> 394 a and 1102 e; Pindar, Frag. 149 (ed. Christ).</note> says. And whether he be the sun<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 386 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and the note.</note> or the lord and father of the sun and of all that lies beyond our vision,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The language is reminiscent of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπέκεινα τῆς οὐσίας</foreign> (Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title> 509 b).</note> it is not likely that he should deny his utterance to people of the present day because of <pb xml:id="v.5.p.371"/> their unworthiness, when he is responsible for their birth and nurture and their existence and power to think; nor is it likely withal that Providence, like a benign and helpful mother, who does everything for us and watches over us, should cherish animosity in the matter of prophecy only, and take away that from us after having given it to us at the beginning, as if the number of wicked men included among a larger population were not larger at that earlier time when the oracles were established in many places in the inhabited world! Come, sit down again and make a <q>Pythian truce<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The sacred truce, made throughout the Greek world, for the duration of the Pythian games.</note> </q> with evil, which you are wont to chastise with words every day, and join us in seeking some other reason for what is spoken of as the obsolescence of oracles; but keep the god benign and provoke him not to wrath.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent">What I had said was so far effective that Planetiades went out through the door without another word. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"> <p rend="indent">There was quiet for a moment, and then Ammonius, addressing himself to me, said, <q>See what it is that we are doing, Lamprias, and concentrate your thoughts on our subject so that we shall not relieve the god of responsibility. The fact is that the man who holds that the obsolescence of such of the oracles as have ceased to function has been brought about by some other cause and not by the will of a god gives reason for suspecting that he believes that their creation and continued existence was not due to the god, but was brought about in some other way. For prophecy is something created by a god, and certainly no greater or more potent force exists to abolish and obliterate it. Now I do not like what Planetiades said, and one of the reasons is the inconsistency which it creates regarding the god, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.373"/> who in one way turns away from wickedness and disavows it, and again in another way welcomes its presence; just as if some king or despot should shut out bad men at certain doors and let them in at others and have dealings with them. Now moderation, adequacy, excess in nothing, and complete selfsufficiency are above all else the essential characteristics of everything done by the gods; and if anyone should take this fact as a starting-point, and assert that Greece has far more than its share in the general depopulation which the earlier discords and wars have wrought throughout practically the whole inhabited earth, and that to-day the whole of Greece would hardly muster three thousand men-at-arms, which is the number that the one city of the Megarians sent forth to Plataeae<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ix. 21 and 28.</note> (for the god’s abandoning of many oracles is nothing other than his way of substantiating the desolation of Greece), in this way such a man would give some accurate evidence of his keenness in reasoning. For who would profit if there were an oracle in Tegyrae, as there used to be, or at Ptoiim, where during some part of the day one might possibly meet a human being pasturing his flocks? And regarding the oracle here at Delphi, the most ancient in time and the most famous in repute, men record that for a long time it was made desolate and unapproachable by a fierce creature, a serpent; they do not, however, put the correct interpretation upon its lying idle, but quite the reverse; for it was the desolation that attracted the creature rather than that the creature caused the desolation. But when Greece, since God so willed, had grown strong in cities and the place was thronged with people, they <pb xml:id="v.5.p.375"/> used to employ two prophetic priestesses who were sent down in turn; and a third was appointed to be held in reserve. But to-day there is one priestess and we do not complain, for she meets every need. There is no reason, therefore, to blame the god; the exercise of the prophetic art which continues at the present day is sufficient for all, and sends away all with their desires fulfilled. Agamemnon,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ii. 96.</note> for example, used nine heralds and, even so, had difficulty in keeping the assembly in order because of the vast numbers; but here in Delphi, a few days hence, in the theatre you will see that one voice reaches all. In the same way, in those days, prophecy employed more voices to speak to more people, but to-day, quite the reverse, we should needs be surprised at the god if he allowed his prophecies to run to waste, like water, or to echo like the rocks with the voices of shepherds and flocks in waste places.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"> <p rend="indent">When Ammonius had said this and I remained silent, Cleombrotus, addressing himself to me, said, <q>Already you have conceded this point, that the god both creates and abolishes these prophetic shrines.</q> </p>

	<p rend="indent"><q>As for death among such beings, I have heard the words of a man who was not a fool nor an impostor. The father of Aemilianus the orator, to whom some of you have listened, was Epitherses, who lived in our town and was my teacher in grammar. He said that once upon a time in making a voyage to Italy he embarked on a ship carrying freight and many passengers. It was already evening when, near the Echinades Islands, the wind dropped, and the ship drifted near Paxi. Almost everybody was awake, and a good many had not finished their after-dinner wine. Suddenly from the island of Paxi was heard the voice of someone loudly calling Thamus, so that all were amazed. Thamus was an Egyptian pilot, not known by name even to many on board. Twice he was called and made no reply, but the third time he answered; and the caller, raising his voice, said, <q type="unspecified" >When you come opposite to Palodes, announce that Great Pan is dead.</q> On hearing this, all, said Epitherses, were astounded and reasoned among themselves whether it were better to carry out the order or to refuse to meddle and let the matter go. Under the circumstances Thamus made up his mind that if there should be a breeze, he would sail past and keep quiet, but with no wind and a smooth sea <pb xml:id="v.5.p.403"/> about the place he would announce what he had heard. So, when he came opposite Palodes, and there was neither wind nor wave, Thamus from the stern, looking toward the land, said the words as he had heard them: <q>Great Pan is dead.</q> Even before he had finished there was a great cry of lamentation, not of one person, but of many, mingled with exclamations of amazement. As many persons were on the vessel, the story was soon spread abroad in Rome, and Thamus was sent for by Tiberius Caesar. Tiberius became so convinced of the truth of the story that he caused an inquiry and investigation to be made about Pan; and the scholars, who were numerous at his court, conjectured that he was the son born of Hermes and Penelopê.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, ii. 145.</note> </p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"> <p rend="indent">Demetrius said that among the islands lying near Britain<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Presumably the Scilly islands; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 941 a - 942 a.</note> were many isolated, having few or no inhabitants, some of which bore the names of divinities or heroes. He himself, by the emperor’s order, had made a voyage for inquiry and observation to the nearest of these islands which had only a few inhabitants, holy men who were all held inviolate by the Britons. Shortly after his arrival there occurred a great tumult in the air and many portents; violent winds suddenly swept down and lightning-flashes darted to earth. When these abated, the people of the island said that the passing of someone of the mightier souls had befallen. <q>For,</q> said they, <q>as <pb xml:id="v.5.p.405"/> a lamp when it is being lighted has no terrors, but when it goes out is distressing to many,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the interesting account which Plutarch gives in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 941 a ff., and Lucretius’s statement that a smouldering lamp may cause apoplexy.</note> so the great souls have a kindling into life that is gentle and inoffensive, but their passing and dissolution often, as at the present moment, fosters tempests and storms, and often infects the air with pestilential properties.</q> Moreover, they said that in this part of the world there is one island where Cronus is confined, guarded while he sleeps by Briareus; for his sleep has been devised as a bondage for him, and round about him are many demigods as attendants and servants. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"> <p rend="indent">Cleombrotus here took up the conversation and said, <q>I too have similar stories to tell, but it is sufficient for our purpose that nothing contravenes or prevents these things from being so.

	<p rend="indent"><q>As for the scoffing and sneers of the Epicureans<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">H. Usener, <title rend="italic">Epicurea</title> (Leipzig, 1887), 394.</note> which they dare to employ against Providence also, calling it nothing but a myth, we need have no fear. We, on the other hand, say that their <q>Infinity</q> is a myth, which among so many worlds has not one that is directed by divine reason, but will have them all produced by spontaneous generation and concretion. If there is need for laughter in philosophy, we should laugh at those spirits, dumb, blind, and soulless, which <pb xml:id="v.5.p.407"/> they shepherd for boundless cycles of years, and which make their returning appearance everywhere, some floating away from the bodies of persons still living, others from bodies long ago burned or decayed, whereby these philosophers drag witlessness and obscurity into the study of natural phenomena; but if anyone asserts that such demigods exist, not only for physical reasons, but also for logical reasons, and that they have the power of self-preservation and continued life for a long time, then these philosophers feel much aggrieved.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"> <p rend="indent">After these remarks Ammonius said, <q>It seems to me that Theophrastus was right in his pronouncement. What, in fact, is there to prevent our accepting an utterance that is impressive and most highly philosophical? For if it be rejected, it does away with many things which are possible but cannot be proved; and if it be allowed as a principle, it brings in its train many things that are impossible or non-existent.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Some editors would insert a negative in the last sentence.</note> The one thing that I have heard the Epicureans say with reference to the demigods introduced by Empedocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. 267, Empedocles, no. b 115.</note> is that it is not possible, if they are bad and sinful, that they should be happy and of long life, inasmuch as vice has a large measure of blindness and the tendency to encounter destructive agencies, so that argument of theirs is silly. For by this reasoning Epicurus will be shown to be a worse man than Gorgias the sophist, and Metrodorus worse than Alexis the comic poet; for Alexis lived twice as long as Metrodorus and Gorgias more than a third as long again as Epicurus. It is in another <pb n="v.5.p.409"/> sense that we speak of virtue as something strong, and vice as something weak, not with reference to permanence or dissolution of the body. For example, many of the animals that are sluggish in movement and slow in their reactions and many that are lascivious and ungovernable live a longer time than the quick and the clever. Therefore they do not well who make God’s eternal existence to be the result of watchfulness and the thrusting aside of destructive agencies. No, immunity from emotion and destruction ought to reside in the blessed Being, and should require no activity on His part. Perhaps, however, to speak thus with reference to people that are not present does not show great consideration. So it is right that Cleombrotus should resume the topic which he discontinued a few moments ago about the migration and flight of the demigods.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"> <p rend="indent">Then Cleombrotus continued, <q>I shall be surprised if it does not appear to you much more strange than what has already been said. Yet it seems to be close to the subject of natural phenomena and Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 421 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> has given the key-note for it, not by an unqualified pronouncement, but as the result of a vague concept, cautiously suggesting also the underlying idea in an enigmatic way; but, for all that, there has been loud disparagement of him on the part of other philosophers. But there is set before us for general use a bowl of myths and stories combined, and where could one meet with more kindly listeners for testing these stories, even as one tests coins from foreign lands? So I do not hesitate to favour you with a narrative about a man, not a Greek, whom I had great difficulty in finding, and then only by dint of long wanderings, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.411"/> and after paying large sums for information. It was near the Persian Gulf that I found him, where he holds a meeting with human beings once every year; and there I had an opportunity to talk with him and met with a kindly reception. The other days of his life, according to his statement, he spends in association with roving nymphs and demigods. He was the handsomest man I ever saw in personal appearance and he never suffered from any disease, inasmuch as once each month he partook of the medicinal and bitter fruit of a certain herb. He was practised in the use of many tongues; but with me, for the most part, he spoke a Doric which was almost music. While he was speaking, a fragrance overspread the place, as his mouth breathed forth a most pleasant perfume. Besides his learning and his knowledge of history, always at his command, he was inspired to prophesy one day in each year when he went down to the sea and told of the future. Potentates and kings’ secretaries would come each year and depart. His power of prophecy he referred to the demigods. He made most account of Delphi and there was none of the stories told of Dionysus or of the rites performed here of which he had not heard; these too he assert ed were the momentous experiences of the demigods and so, plainly, were those which had to do with the Python. And upon the slayer of that monster was not imposed an exile of eight full years,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 293 b-c.</note> nor, following this, was he exiled to Tempê; but after he was expelled, he fared forth to another world, and later, returning from there, after eight cycles of the Great Years, pure and truly the <q>Radiant <pb n="v.5.p.413"/> One,</q> he took over the oraele which had been guarded during this time by Themis. Such also, he said, were the stories about Typhons and Titans<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 360 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note>; battles of demigods against demigods had taken place, followed by the exile of the vanquished, or else judgement inflicted by a god upon the sinners, as, for example, for the sin which Typhon is said to have committed in the case of Osiris, or Cronus in the case of Uranus; and the honours once paid to these deities have become quite dim to our eyes or have vanished altogether when the deities were transferred to another world. In fact, I learn that the Solymi, who live next to the Lycians, paid especial honour to Cronus. But when lie had slain their rulers, Arsalus, Dryus, and Trosobius, he fled away from that place to some place or other, where they cannot say; and then he ceased to be regarded, but Arsalus and those connected with him are called the <q>stern gods,</q> and the Lycians employ their names in invoking curses both in public and in private. Many accounts similar to these are to be had from theological history. But, as that man said, if we call some of the demigods by the current name of gods, that is no cause for wonder; for each of them is wont to be called after that god with whom he is allied and from whom he has derived his portion of power and honour. In fact, among ourselves one of us is Dïus, another Athenaeus, another Apollonius or Dionysius or <pb n="v.5.p.415"/> Hermaeus; but only some of us have, by chance, been rightly named; the majority have received names derived from the gods which bear no relation to the persons, but are only a travesty.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"> <p rend="indent">Cleombrotus said nothing more, and his account appeared marvellous to all. But when Heraeleon inquired in what way this was related to Plato and how he had given the key-note for this topic, Cleombrotus said, <q>You well remember that he summarily decided against an infinite number of worlds, but had doubts about a limited number; and up to five<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 55 c-d; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 389 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and 430 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> he conceded a reasonable probability to those who postulated one world to correspond to each element, but, for himself, he kept to one. This seems to be peculiar to Plato, for the other philosophers conceived a fear of plurality,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Caelo</title>, i. 8 (276 a 18).</note> feeling that if they did not limit matter to one world, but went beyond one, an unlimited and embarrassing infinity would at once fasten itself upon them.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>But,</q> said I, <q>did your far-away friend set a limit to the number of worlds, as Plato did, or did you not go so far as to sound him on this point when you had your interview with him ?</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Was it not likely,</q> said Cleombrotus, <q>that on anything touching these matters, if on nothing else, I should be an inquisitive and eager listener, when he so graciously put himself at my disposal and gave me the opportunity? He said that the worlds are not infinite in number, nor one, nor five, but one hundred and eighty-three,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Proclus on Plato, <title rend="italic" >Timaeus</title>, p. 138 b.</note> arranged in the form of a triangle, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.417"/> each side of the triangle having sixty worlds; of the three left over each is placed at an angle, and those that are next to one other are in contact and revolve gently as in a dance. The inner area of the triangle is the common hearth of all, and is called the Plain of Truth, in which the accounts, the forms, and the patterns of all things that have come to pass and of all that shall come to pass rest undisturbed; and round about them lies Eternity, whence Time, like an ever-flowing stream, is conveyed to the worlds. Opportunity to see and to contemplate these things is vouchsafed to human souls once in ten thousand years if they have lived goodly lives; and the best of the initiatory rites here are but a dream of that highest rite and initiation; and the words of our philosophic inquiry are framed to recall these fair sights there — else is our labour vain. This,</q> said he, <q>is the tale I heard him recite quite as though it were in some rite of mystic initiation, but without offering any demonstration or proof of what he said.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"> <p rend="indent">Then I, addressing Demetrius, said, <q>How do the verses about the suitors run, when they are marvelling at Odysseus as he handles the bow?</q> And when Demetrius had recalled them to my mind, I said, <q>It occurs to me to say this of your far-away friend: <quote rend="blockquote">Surely he liked to see, or else was given to filching<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> xxi. 397.</note> </quote> beliefs and tales of all sorts. He had ranged widely in literature and was no foreigner, but a Greek by birth, and replete with Greek culture to a high degree. The number of his worlds convicts him, since it is not <pb n="v.5.p.419"/> Egyptian nor Indian, but Dorian and from Sicily, being the idea of a man of Himera named Petron. Petron’s own treatise I have never read nor am I sure that a copy is now extant; but Hippys<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 6, Müller, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat" >Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> vol. ii. p. 14.</note> of Rhegium, whom Phanias<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 22, Müller, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> vol. ii. p. 300.</note> of Eresus mentions, records that this was the opinion and the account of it given by Petron: that there are one hundred and eighty-three worlds in contact with one another according to element; but what this is, <q>to be in contact according to element,</q> he does not explain further nor subjoin any plausible proof.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent">Demetrius, joining in, said, <q>What plausible proof could there be in matters of this sort in which even Plato, without stating anything reasonable or plausible, simply set down his own account?</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>But,</q> said Heracleon, <q>we hear you grammarians attributing this view to Homer on the ground that he distributed the universe into five worlds<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 390 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xv. 187.</note>: the heavens, the water, the air, the earth, and Olympus. Of these he leaves two to be held in common, the earth for all below and Olympus for all above, and the three that lie between were assigned to the three gods. In this wise Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 31 a, and 55 c; <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 390 a and 887 b.</note> also, apparently, associated the fairest and foremost forms and figures with the different divisions of the universe, and called them five worlds, one of earth, one of water, one of air, one of fire, and last of all, the one which includes all these, the world of the dodecahedron, of wide expanse and many turnings, to which he assigned a form appropriate to the cycles and movements of the soul.</q> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.421"/> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Why,</q> said Demetrius, <q>do we call up Homer in the present instance? Enough of legends! Plato, however, is very far from calling the five different divisions of the world five different worlds; and in those passages again, in which he contends against those who postulate an infinite number of worlds, he says that his opinion is that this world is the only-begotten and beloved of God, having been created out of the corporeal whole, entire, complete, and sufficient unto itself. Wherefore one might well be surprised that he, in stating the truth himself, has supplied others with a source for a doctrine that is unconvincing and lacking in reason. For not to defend the idea of a single world implied somehow an assumption of the infinity of the whole universe; but to make the worlds definitely just so many, neither more nor less than five, is altogether contrary to reason and devoid of all plausibility — unless,</q> he added, with a glance at me, <q>you have anything to say.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>It appears,</q> said I, <q>that we have already discontinued our discussion about oracles, feeling it to be completed, and are now taking up another topic just as large.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>Not discontinued that topic,</q> said Demetrius, <q>but not passing over this one which claims our attention. We will not spend much time on it, but only touch upon it long enough to inquire into its plausibility; and then we will follow up the original proposition.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"> <p rend="indent"> <q>In the first place, then,</q> said I, <q>the considerations that prevent our making an infinite number of worlds do not preclude our making more than one. For it is possible for God and prophecy <pb xml:id="v.5.p.423"/> and Providence to exist in more worlds than one, and for the incidence of chance to be reduced to the very smallest limits, while the vast majority of things and those of the highest importance attain to genesis and transmutation in a quite orderly sequence, none of which things does infinity, by its nature, admit. Then again it is more consistent with reason that the world should not be the only-begotten of God and quite alone. For He, being consummately good, is lacking in none of the virtues, and least of all in those which concern justice and friendliness; for these are the fairest and are fitting for gods. Nor is it in the nature of God to possess anything to no purpose or for no use. Therefore there exist other gods and other worlds outside, in relation with which He exercises the social virtues. For not in relation with Himself nor with any part of Himself is there any exercise of justice or benevolence or kindness, but only in relation with others. Thus it is not likely that this world, friendless, neighbourless, and unvisited, swings back and forth in the infinite void, since we see that Nature includes individual things in classes and species, like seeds in pods and envelopes. For there is nothing in the whole list of existing things for which there is not some general designation, nor does anything that does not possess certain qualities, either in common with others or solely by itself, obtain such an appellation. Now the world is not spoken of as having qualities in common with others. It has its qualities, therefore, solely by itself, by virtue of the difference when it is compared with other things which are akin to it and similar in <pb xml:id="v.5.p.425"/> appearance, since it has been created with such qualities as it possesses. If in all creation such a thing as one man, one horse, one star, one god, one demigod does not exist, what is there to prevent creation from having, not one world, but more than one? For he who says that creation has but one land and one sea overlooks a matter which is perfectly plain, the doctrine of similar parts<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"/>; for we divide the earth into parts which bear similar names, and the sea likewise. A part of the world, however, is not a world, but something combined from the differing elements in Nature. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"> <p rend="indent"><q>Again, as for the dread which some people especially have felt, and so use up the whole of matter on the one world, so that nothing may be left over outside to disturb the structure of it by resisting or striking it—this fear of theirs is unwarranted. For if there are more worlds than one, and each of them has received, as its meet portion, substance and matter having a restricted measure and limit, then there will be nothing left unplaced or unorganized, an unused remnant, as it were, to crash into them from the outside. For the law of reason over each world, having control over the matter assigned to each, will not allow anything to be carried away from it nor to wander about and crash into another world, nor anything from another world to crash into it, because Nature has neither unlimited and infinite magnitude nor irrational and disorganized movement. Even if any emanation is carried from some worlds to others, it is certain to be congenial, agreeable, and to unite peaceably with all, like the rays of starlight and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.427"/> their blending; and the worlds themselves must experience joy in gazing at one another with kindly eyes; and for the many good gods in each, they must provide opportunities for visits and a friendly welcome. Truly in all this there is nothing impossible or fabulous or contrary to reason unless, indeed, because of Aristotle’s<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Caelo</title>, i. 7 (276 a 18).</note> statements some persons shall look upon it with suspicion as being based on physical grounds. For if each of the bodies has its own particular place, as he asserts, the earth must of necessity turn toward the centre from all directions and the water be above it, settling below the lighter elements because of its weight. If, therefore, there be more worlds than one, it will come to pass that in many places the earth will rest above the fire and the air, and in many places below them; and the air and the water likewise, in some places existing in positions in keeping with nature and in other places in positions contrary to nature. As this, in his opinion, is impossible, the inference is that there are neither two worlds nor more, but only this one, composed of the whole of matter and resting firmly in keeping with Nature, as befits the diversity of its bodies. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">All this, however, has been put in a way that is more plausible than true. Look at it in this way, my dear Demetrius,</q> said I; <q>when he says of the bodies that some have a motion towards the centre and downwards, others away from the centre and upwards, and others around the centre and in a circular path, in what relation does he take the centre?<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 925 b and 1054 b.</note> Certainly not in relation to the void, for according to him it does not exist. And according to those for whom it does exist, it has no centre, just as it has no point where it begins or where it ends; <pb xml:id="v.5.p.429"/> for these are limitations, and the infinite has no limitations. And if a man could force himself, by reasoning, to dare the concept of a violent motion of the infinite, what difference, if referred to this, is created for the bodies in their movements? For in the void there is no power in the bodies, nor do the bodies have a predisposition and an impetus, by virtue of which they cling to the centre and have a universal tendency in this one direction. It is equally difficult, in the case of inanimate bodies and an incorporeal and undifferentiated position, to conceive of a movement created from the bodies or an attraction created by the position. Thus one conclusion is left: when the centre is spoken of it is not with reference to any place, but with reference to the bodies. For in this world of ours, which has a single unity in its organization from numerous dissimilar elements, these differences necessarily create various movements towards various objects. Evidence of this is found in the fact that everything, when it undergoes transformation, changes its position coincidently with the change in its substance. For example, dispersion distributes upwards and round about the matter rising from the centre and condensation and consolidation press it down towards the centre and drive it together. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"> <p rend="indent"><q>On this topic it is not necessary to use more words at present. The truth is that whatever cause one may postulate as the author of these occurrences and changes, that cause will keep each of the worlds together within itself; for each world has earth and sea, and each has its owTn centre and occurrences that <pb xml:id="v.5.p.431"/> affect its component bodies; it has its own transmutations and a nature and a power which preserves each one and keeps it in place. In what lies beyond, whether it be nothing or an infinite void, no centre exists, as has been said; and if there are several worlds, in each one is a centre which belongs to it alone, with the result that the movements of its bodies are its own, some towards it, some away from it, and some around it, quite in keeping with the distinctions which these men themselves make. But anyone who insists that, while there are many centres, the heavy substances are impelled from all sides towards one only,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 928 a-b.</note> does not differ at all from him who insists that, while there are many men, the blood from all shall flow together into a single vein and the brains of all shall be enveloped in a single membrane, deeming it a dreadful thing in the case of natural bodies if all the solids shall not occupy one place only and the fluids also only one place. Such a man as that will be abnormal, and so will he be who is indignant if everything constituting a whole has its own parts, of which it makes use in their natural arrangement and position in every case. For that would be preposterous, and so too if anybody called that a world which had a moon somewhere inside it<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Instead of revolving around it.</note>; as well call that a man who carries his brains in his heels or his heart in his head!<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Demosthenes, <title rend="italic">Oration</title> vii. 45.</note> But to make more worlds than one, each separate from the other, and to delimit and distinguish the parts belonging to each to go with the whole is not preposterous. For the land and the sea and the heavens in each will be placed to accord with nature, as is fitting; and each of the worlds has its above and below and its round <pb xml:id="v.5.p.433"/> about and its centre, not with reference to another world or the outside, but in itself and with reference to itself. </q></p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"> <p rend="indent"> <q>Yes,</q> said I, <q>Theodorus of Soli<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 1027 d.</note> seems to follow up the subject not ineptly in his explanations of Plato’s mathematical theories. He follows it up in this way: a pyramid, an octahedron, an icosahedron, and a dodecahedron, the primary figures which Plato predicates, are all beautiful because of the symmetries and equalities in their relations, and nothing superior or even like to these<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The five solids of which each has the same number of sides on all its faces, and all its solid angles made up of the same number of plane angles. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 53 c - 56 c, and Grote’s <title rend="italic">Plato</title>, iii. 269.</note> has been left for Nature to compose and fit together. It happens, however, that they do not all have one form of construction, nor have they all a similar origin, but the pyramid is the simplest and smallest, while the dodecahedron is the largest and most complicated. Of the remaining two the icosahedron is more than double the octahedron in the number of its triangles. For this reason it is impossible for them all to derive their origin from one and the same matter. For those that are simple and small and more rudimentary in their structure would necessarily be the first to respond to the instigating and formative power, and to be completed and acquire substantiality earlier than those of large parts and many bodies, from which class comes the dodecahedron, which requires <pb xml:id="v.5.p.443"/> more labour for its construction. Hence it follows that the only primal body is the pyramid, and not one of the others, since by their nature they are outdistanced by it in coming into being. Accordingly, the remedy which exists for this strange state of affairs consists in the division and separation of matter into five worlds, one where the pyramid shall acquire substantiality first, another for the octahedron, and another for the icosahedron; then from the one that first acquires substantiality in each world the rest will have their origin, since a transmutation for everything into everything takes place according to the adaptability of parts to fit together, as Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic" >Timaeus</title>, 55 e ff.</note> himself has indicated, going into the details of nearly all cases. But for us it will suffice to acquire the knowledge in brief form. Since air is formed when fire is extinguished, and when rarefied again gives off fire out of itself, we must observe the behaviour of each of the generative elements and their transmutations. The generative elements of fire are the pyramid,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Does Plutarch (or Plato before him) see an etymological relation between <q>pyramid</q> and <q>pyr</q> (fire)? See also 428 d <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> composed of twenty-four primary triangles, and likewise for air the octahedron, composed of forty-eight of the same. Therefore one element of air is produced from two corpuscles of fire combined and united; and that of air again, when divided, is separated into two corpuscles of fire, and again, when compressed and condensed, it goes off into the form of water. The result is that in every case the one which first acquires substantiality always affords the others a ready means of coming into being through transmutation; and it <pb xml:id="v.5.p.445"/> is not one alone that first exists, but another in a different environment is endowed with movement, which takes the lead and forestalls the others in coming into being, and thus the name of being first is kept by all.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"> <p rend="indent"> <q>Manfully and zealously,</q> said Ammonius, <q>have these matters been worked out by Theodorus; but I should be surprised if it should not appear that he has made use of assumptions which nullify each other. For he insists that all the five shall not undergo construction at the same time, but the simplest always, which requires the least trouble to construct, shall first issue forth into being. Then, as a corollary to this, and not conflicting with it, he lays down the principle that not all matter brings forth the simplest and most rudimentary form first, but that sometimes the ponderous and complex forms, in the time of their coming into being, are earlier in arising out of matter. But apart from this, five bodies having been postulated as primary, and on the strength of this the number of worlds being put as the same, he adduces probability with reference to four only; the cube he has taken off the board, as if he were playing a game with counters, since, because of its nature, it cannot transmute itself into them nor confer upon them the power of transmutation into itself, inasmuch as the triangles are not homologous triangles. For in the others the common triangle which underlies them all is the half-triangle; but in this, and peculiar to it alone, is the isosceles triangle, which makes no convergence towards the other nor any conjunction that would unify the two. If, therefore, there are five bodies and five worlds, and in each one body only has precedence in coming into being, then where the cube has been the first to come <pb xml:id="v.5.p.447"/> into being, there will be none of the others, since, because of its nature, it cannot transmute itself into any one of them. I leave out of account the fact that they make the element of the dodecahedron, as it is called, something else and not that scalene from which Plato constructs the pyramid and the octahedron and the icosahedron. So,</q> added Ammonius, laughing,<q>either you must solve these problems or else contribute something of your own concerning this difficulty in which we all find ourselves involved.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"> <p rend="indent"> <q>For the present, at least,</q> said I, <q>I have nothing more plausible to offer; but perhaps it is better to submit to examination on views of one’s own rather than on another’s. I repeat, therefore, what I said at the beginning, that if two natures be postulated, one evident to the senses, subject to change in creation and dissolution, carried now here now there, while the other is essentially conceptual and always remains the same, it is a dreadful thing that, while the conceptual nature has been parcelled out and has variety within itself, we should feel indignant and annoyed if anyone does not leave the corporeal and passive nature as a unity knit together and converging upon itself, but separates and parts it. For it is surely fitting that things permanent and divine should hold more closely together and escape, so far as may be, all segmentation and separation. But even on these the power of Differentiation has laid its hand and has wrought in things conceptual dissimilarities in reasons and ideas, which are vaster than the separations in location. Wherefore Plato,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Plato, <title rend="italic">Sophist</title>, 256 c; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 391 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> opposing those who declare for the unity of the whole, says that these five things exist: Being, Identity, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.449"/> Differentiation, and, to crown all, Movement and Rest. Granted, then, that these five exist, it is not surprising if each of these five corporeal elements has been made into a copy and image of each of them respectively, not unmixed and unalloyed, but it is because of the fact that each of them participates most in its corresponding faculty. The cube is patently a body related to rest because of the security and stability of its plane surfaces. In the pyramid everybody may note its fiery and restless quality in the simplicity of its sides and the acuteness of its angles. The nature of the dodecahedron, which is comprehensive enough to include the other figures, may well seem to be a model with reference to all corporeal being. Of the remaining two, the icosahedron shares in the nature of Differentiation mostly, and the octahedron in that of Identity. For this reason the octahedron contributed air, which in a single form holds all being in its embrace, and the icosahedron water, which by admixture assumes the greatest variety of qualities. If, therefore, Nature demands an equal distribution in all things, there is a reasonable probability that the wrorlds which have been created are neither more nor less in number than the patterns, so that each pattern in each world may have the leading rank and power just as it has acquired it in the construction of the primary bodies. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">However, let this be a comfort for him that wonders because we divide Nature into so many classes in its generation and transmutation. But here is another matter<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 387 f ff., <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> which I ask you all to consider, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.451"/> and to give your undivided attention to it: of those numbers which come at the very first (I mean the number one and the indeterminate duality), the second, being the element underlying all formlessness and disarrangement, has been called infinity; but the nature of the number one limits and arrests what is void and irrational and indeterminate in infinity, gives it shape, and renders it in some way tolerant and receptive of definition, which is the next step after demonstration regarding things perceptible. Now these first principles make their appearance at the beginning in connexion with number; rather, however, larger amounts are not number at all unless the number one, created from the illimitability of infinity, like a form of matter, cuts off more on one side and less on the other. Then, in fact, any of the larger amounts becomes number through being delimited by the number one. But if the number one be done away with, once more the indeterminate duality throws all into confusion, and makes it to be without rhythm, bounds, or measure. Inasmuch as form is not the doing away with matter, but a shaping and ordering of the underlying matter, it needs must be that both these first principles be existent in number, and from this has arisen the first and greatest divergence and dissimilarity. For the indeterminate first principle is the creator of the even, and the better one of the odd. Two is the first of the even numbers and three the first of the odd; from the two combined comes five,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 388 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> which in its composition is common to both numbers and in its potentiality is odd. For when the perceptible and corporeal was divided into <pb xml:id="v.5.p.453"/> several parts because of the innate necessity of differentiation, that number had to be neither the first even nor the first odd, but the third number, which is formed from these two, so that it might be produced from both the primary principles, that which created the even and that which created the odd, because it was not possible for the one to be divorced from the other; for each possesses the nature and the potentiality of a first principle. So when the twro were paired, the better one prevailed over the indeterminate as it was dividing the corporeal and checked it; and when matter was being distributed to the two, it set unity in the middle and did not allow the whole to be divided into two parts, but there has been created a number of worlds by differentiation of the indeterminate and by its being carried in varying directions; yet the power of Identity and Limitation has had the effect of making that number odd, but the kind of odd that did not permit Nature to progress beyond what is best. If the number one were unalloyed and pure, matter would not have any separation at all; but since it has been combined with the dividing power of duality, it has had to submit to being cut up and divided, but there it stopped, the even being overpowered by the odd. </q></p> </div>

For example, she has allotted to ourselves five senses and five parts to the soul<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 390 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>; Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 410 b, 440 e - 441 a; and much diffused in <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 70 ff.</note>: physical growth, perception, appetite, fortitude, and reason; also five fingers on each hand, and the most fertile seed when it is divided five times, for there is no record that a woman ever had more than five children together at one birth.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 264 b; Aristotle, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat" >Historia Animalium</title>, vii. 4 (584 b 33); since Plutarch’s time there have been a few authenticated cases of sextuplets.</note> The Egyptians have a tradition<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 355 d-f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> that Rhea gave birth to five gods, an intimation of the genesis of the five worlds from one single Matter; and in the universe the surface of the earth is divided among five zones, and the heavens by five circles, two arctic, two tropic, and the equator in the middle. Five, too, are the orbits of the planets, if the Sun and Venus and Mercury follow the same course. The organization of the world also is based on harmony, just as a tune with us is seen <pb xml:id="v.5.p.457" /> to depend on the five notes of the tetrachord<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 389 e, 1028 f, 1138 f - 1139 e.</note>: lowest, middle, conjunct, disjunct, and highest; and the musical intervals are five: quarter-tone, semitone, tone, tone and a half, and double tone. Thus it appears that Nature takes a greater delight in making all things in fives than in making them round, as Aristotle<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aristotle, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">De Caelo</title>, ii. 4 (286 b 10).</note> has said. </q></p> </div>

If, therefore, we must apply reasonable probability to his conception, let us consider that variations in movement necessarily follow close upon the variations in the bodies and their shapes, as he himself teaches<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 57 c.</note> when he makes it plain that whatever is disunited or united changes its place at the same time with the alteration of its substance. For example, if fire is generated from air by the breaking up of the octahedron and its resolution into pyramids, or again if air is generated from fire by its being forced together and compressed into an octahedron, it is not possible for it to stay where it was before, but it escapes and is carried to some other place, forcing its way out and contending against anything that blocks its course or keeps it back. <pb xml:id="v.5.p.459"/> What takes place he describes more clearly by a simile,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, 52 e.</note> saying that in a manner like to <q>grain and chaff being tossed about and winnowed by the fans and other tools used in cleaning the grain</q> the elements toss matter about and are tossed about by it; and like always draws near1 to like, some things occupying one place and others another, before the universe becomes completely organized out of the elements. Thus, when matter was in that state in which, in all probability, is the universe from which God is absent, the first five properties, having tendencies of their own, were at once carried in different directions, not being completely or absolutely separated, because, when all things were amalgamated, the inferior always followed the superior in spite of Nature.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Some would prefer to make Plutarch say <q>in keeping with Nature.</q></note> For this reason they produced in the different kinds of bodies, as these were carried some in one direction and others in another, an equal number of separate divisions with intervals between them, one not of pure fire, but fiery, another not of unmingled ether, but ethereal, another not of earth by itself alone, but earthy; and above all, in keeping with the close association of air with water, they contrived, as has been said,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 428 d-e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> that these should come away filled with many foreign elements. It was not the Deity who parted substance and caused it to rest in different places, but, after it had been parted by its own action and was being carried in diverse ways in such great disarray, he took it over and set it in <pb xml:id="v.5.p.461"/> order and fitted it together by the use of proportions and means. Then, after establishing Reason in each as a governor and guardian, he creatjed as many worlds as the existing primal bodies. Let this, then, be an offering for the gratification of Plato on Ammonius’s account, but as for myself, I should not venture to assert regarding the number of wbrlds that they are just so many; but the opinion that sets their number at more than one, and yet not infinite, but limited in amount, I regard as no more irrational than either of the others, when I observe the dispersiveness and divisibility implicit by nature in Matter, and that it neither abides as a unit nor is permitted by Reason to progress to infinity. But if in any other place we have recalled the Academy<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 387 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> to our mind, let us do so here as well, and divest ourselves of excessive credulity and, as if we were in a slippery place in our discussion about infinity, let us merely keep a firm footing.</q> </p> </div>

It is, therefore, not at all unreasonable or even marvellous that souls meeting souls should create in them impressions of the future, exactly as we do not convey all our information to one another through the spoken word, but by writing also, or merely by a touch or a glance, we give much information about what has come to pass and intimation of what is to come. Unless it be, Lamprias, that you have another story to tell. For not long ago a rumour reached us about your having had a long talk on these subjects with strangers at Lebadeia, but the man who told of it could recall none of it with exactness.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>You need not be surprised,</q> said I, <q>since many activities and distractions occurring in the midst of it, because it was a day for oracles and sacrifice, made our conversation desultory and disconnected.</q> </p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q>But now,</q> said Ammonius, <q>you have listeners with nothing to distract them and eager to seek and <pb n="v.5.p.465"/> gain information on this point or that; all strife and contention is banished and a sympathetic hearing and freedom of statement, as you observe, is granted for all that may be said.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p rend="indent">As the others also joined in the request, I, after a moment of silence, continued, <q>As a matter of fact, Ammonius, by some chance you happen to be the one who provided the opening and approach for what was said on that occasion. For if the souls which have been severed from a body, or have had no part with one at all, are demigods according to you and the divine Hesiod,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Works and Days</title>, 123.</note> <quote rend="blockquote">Holy dwellers on earth and the guardian spirits of mortals,</quote> why deprive souls in bodies of that power by virtue of which the demigods possess the natural faculty of knowing and revealing future events before they happen? For it is not likely that any power or portion accrues to souls when they have left the body, if they did not possess them before; but the souls always possess them; only they possess them to a slight degree while conjoined with the body, some of them being completely imperceptible and hidden, others weak and dim, and about as ineffectual and slow in operation as persons that try to see in a fog or to move about in water, and requiring much nursing and restoring of the functions that properly belong to them and the removal and clearing away of the covering which hides them. Just as the sun does not become bright when it bursts through the clouds, but is bright always, and yet in a fog appears to us indistinct and dim, even so the soul does not acquire the prophetic power when it goes forth from the body <pb n="v.5.p.467"/> as from a cloud; it possesses that power even now, but is blinded by being combined and commingled with the mortal nature. We ought not to feel surprised or incredulous at this when we see in the soul, though we see naught else, that faculty which is the complement of prophecy, and which we call memory, and how great an achievement is displayed in preserving and guarding the past, or rather what has been the present, since nothing of all that has come to pass has any existence or substantiality, because the very instant when anything comes to pass, that is the end of it — of actions, words, experiences alike; for Time like an everflowing stream bears all things onward. But this faculty of the soul lays hold upon them, I know not how, and invests with semblance and being things not now present here. The oracle given to the Thessalians about Arnê<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Thucydides, i. 12.</note> bade them note <quote rend="blockquote">A deaf man’s hearing, a blind man’s sight.</quote> But memory is for us the hearing of deeds to which we are deaf and the seeing of things to which we are blind. Hence, as I said, it is no wonder that, if it has command over things that no longer are, it anticipates many of those which have not yet come to pass, since these are more closely related to it, and with these it has much in common; for its attachments and associations are with the future, and it is quit of all that is past and ended, save only to remember it. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">Souls therefore, all possessed of this power, which is innate but dim and hardly manifest, nevertheless oftentimes disclose its flower and radiance in <pb n="v.5.p.469"/> dreams, and some in the hour of death,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Apology</title>, 39 b.</note> when the body becomes cleansed of all impurities and attains a temperament adapted to this end, a temperament through which the reasoning and thinking faculty of the souls is relaxed and released from their present state as they range amid the irrational and imaginative realms of the future. It is not true, as Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 674, Euripides, no. 973; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf. </foreign><title rend="italic"> Moralia</title>, 399 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> says, that <quote rend="blockquote">The best of seers is he that guesses well;</quote> no, the best of seers is the intelligent man, following the guidance of that in his soul which possesses sense and which, with the help of reasonable probability, leads him on his way. But that which foretells the future, like a tablet without writing, is both irrational and indeterminate in itself, but receptive of impressions and presentiments through what may be done to it, and inconsequently grasps at the future when it is farthest withdrawn from the present. Its withdrawal is brought about by a temperament and disposition of the body as it is subjected to a change which we call inspiration. Often the body of itself alone attains this disposition. Moreover the earth sends forth for men streams of many other potencies, some of them producing derangements, diseases, or deaths; others helpful, benignant, and beneficial, as is plain from the experience of persons who have come upon them. But the prophetic current and breath is most divine and holy, whether it issue by itself through the air or come in the company of <pb xml:id="v.5.p.471"/> running waters; for when it is instilled into the body, it creates in souls an unaccustomed and unusual temperament, the peculiarity of which it is hard to describe with exactness, but analogy offers many comparisons. It is likely that by warmth and diffusion it opens up certain passages through which impressions of the future are transmitted, just as wine, when its fumes rise to the head, reveals many unusual movements and also words stored away and unperceived. <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For Bacchic rout </l> <l>And frenzied mind contain much prophecy,</l> </quote> according to Euripides,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Bacchae</title>, 298.</note> when the soul becomes hot and fiery, and throw’s aside the caution that human intelligence lays upon it, and thus often diverts and extinguishes the inspiration. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">At the same time one might assert, not without reason, that a dryness engendered with the heat subtilizes the spirit of prophecy and renders it ethereal and pure; for this is <q>the dry soul,</q> as Heracleitus has it.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><q>A dry soul is best (and/or wisest)</q> is the dictum of Heracleitus, which is often quoted; see Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. p. 100, Heracleitus, no. b 118; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 995 e, and <title rend="italic">Life of Romulus</title>, chap. xxviii.

But regarding the Cydnus and the sacred sword of Apollo in Tarsus we used to hear you say, my dear Demetrius, that the Cydnus will cleanse no steel but that, and no other water will cleanse that sword. There is a similar phenomenon at Olympia, where they pile the ashes against the altar and make them adhere all around by pouring on them water from the Alpheius; but, although they have tried the waters of other rivers, there is none with which they can make the ashes cohere and stay fixed in their place. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">It is not, therefore, anything to excite amazement if, although the earth sends up many streams, it is only such as these that dispose souls to inspiration and impressions of the future. Certainly the voice of legend also is in accord with my statement; <pb xml:id="v.5.p.475"/> for they record that here the power hovering about this spot was first made manifest when a certain shepherd fell in by accident and later gave forth inspired utterances, which those who came into contact with him at first treated with disdain; but later, when what he had foretold came to pass, they were amazed. The most learned of the people of Delphi still preserve the tradition of his name, which they say was Coretas. But I incline most to the opinion that the soul acquires towards the prophetic spirit a close and intimate connexion of the sort that vision has towards light, which possesses similar properties. For, although the eye has the power of vision, there is no function for it to perform without light<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See 436 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, and Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 508 a - 509 b.</note>; and so the prophetic power of the soul, like an eye, has need of something kindred to help to kindle it and stimulate it further. Hence many among earlier generations regarded Apollo and the Sun as one and the same god; but those who understood and respected fair and wise analogy conjectured that as body is to soul, vision to intellect, and light to truth, so is the power of the sun to the nature of Apollo; and they would make it appear that the sun is his offspring and progeny, being for ever born of him that is for ever. For the sun kindles and promotes and helps to keep in activity the power of vision in our perceptive senses, just as the god does for the power of prophecy in the soul. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">Those, however, who had reached the conclusion that the two are one and the same god very naturally dedicated the oracle to Apollo and Earth in common, thinking that the sun creates the disposition and temperament in the earth from which the prophet-inspiring <pb xml:id="v.5.p.477"/> vapours are wafted forth. As Hesiod,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Theogony</title>, 117.</note> then, with a better understanding than some philosophers, spoke of the Earth itself as <quote rend="blockquote">Of All the unshaken foundation,</quote> so we believe it to be everlasting and imperishable.

For in the case of lakes and rivers, and even more frequently in hot springs, there have occurred disappearances and complete extinction in some places, and in others a stealing away, as it were, and sinking under ground<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A not uncommon phenomenon in Greece; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign><title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Moralia</title>, 557 e.</note>; later they came back, appearing after a time in the same places or flowing out from below somewhere near. We know also of the exhaustion of mines, some of which have given out recently, as for example the silver mines of Attica and the copper ore in Euboea from which the cold-forged sword-blades used to be wrought, as Aeschylus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag.

Plainly the same sober opinion is to be held regarding the spirits that inspire prophecy; the power that they possess is not everlasting and ageless, but is subject to changes. For excessive rains most likely extinguish them, and they probably are dispersed by thunderbolts, and especially, when the earth is shaken beneath by an earthquake and suffers subsidence and ruinous confusion in its depths, the exhalations shift their site or find completely blind outlets, as in this place they say that there are still traces of that great earthquake which overthrew the city. And in Orchomenos they relate that a pestilence raged and many persons died of it, and the oracle of Teiresias become altogether obsolescent and even to this day remains idle and mute. And if a like fate has befallen those in Cilicia, as we have been told, there is nobody, Demetrius, who could give us more certain information than you.</q> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.481"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"> <p rend="indent"> <q>I do not know,</q> said Demetrius, <q type="unspecified" >the state of affairs there at present; for as you all know, I have been out of the country for a long time now. But, when I was there, both the oracle of Mopsus and that of Amphilochus were still flourishing. I have a most amazing thing to tell as the result of my visit to the oracle of Mopsus. The ruler of Cilicia was himself still of two minds towards religious matters. This, I think, was because his scepticism lacked conviction, for in all else he was an arrogant and contemptible man. Since he kept about him certain Epicureans, who, because of their admirable naturestudies, forsooth, have an arrogant contempt, as they themselves aver,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 395 Usener; Diogenes Laertius, x. 135.</note> for all such things as oracles, he sent in a freedman, like a spy into the enemy’s territory, arranging that he should have a sealed tablet, on the inside of which was written the inquiry without anyone’s knowing what it was. The man accordingly, as is the custom, passed the night in the sacred precinct and went to sleep, and in the morning reported a dream in this fashion: it seemed to him that a handsome man stood beside him who uttered just one word <q>Black</q> and nothing more, and was gone immediately. The thing seemed passing strange to us, and raised much inquiry, but the ruler was astounded and fell down and worshipped; then opening the tablet he showed written there the question: <q>Shall I sacrifice to you a white bull or a black?</q> The result was that the Epicureans were put to confusion, and the ruler himself not only duly performed the sacrifice, but ever after revered Mopsus.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"> <p rend="indent">When Demetrius had told this tale he lapsed into silence. But I, wishing to crown, as it were, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.483"/> the discussion, glanced again towards Philip and Ammonius who were sitting side by side. They seemed to me to be desirous of saying something to us, and again I checked myself. Then Ammonius said, <q>Philip also has some remarks to make, Lamprias, about what has been said; for he himself thinks, as most people do, that Apollo is not a different god, but is the same as the sun.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 376 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and 1130 a, for example.</note> But my difficulty is greater and concerns greater matters. I do not know how it happened, but a little time ago we yielded to logic in wresting the prophetic art from the gods and transferring it merely to the demigods. But now it seems to me that we are thrusting out these very demigods, in their turn, and driving them away from the oracle and the tripod here, when we resolve the origin of prophecy, or rather its very being and power, into winds and vapours and exhalations. For these temperings and heatings and hardenings that have been spoken of serve only the more to withdraw repute from the gods and suggest in regard to the final cause some such conclusion as Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic" >Cyclops</title>, 332-333.</note> makes his Cyclops employ: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The earth perforce, whether it will or no, </l> <l>Brings forth the grass to fat my grazing flocks.</l> </quote> But there is one difference: he says that he does not offer them in sacrifice to the gods, but to himself and to his <q>belly, greatest of divinities,</q> whereas we offer both sacrifices and prayers as the price for our oracles. What possesses us to do so, if our souls carry within themselves the prophetic power, and it is some particular state of the air or its currents which stirs this to activity? And what is the significance of the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.485"/> libations poured over the victims and the refusal to give responses unless the whole victim from the hoofjoints up is seized with a trembling and quivering, as the libation is poured over it? Shaking the head is not enough, as in other sacrifices, but the tossing and quivering must extend to all parts of the animal alike accompanied by a tremulous sound; and unless this takes place they say that the oracle is not functioning, and do not even bring in the prophetic priestess. Yet it is only on the assumption that they ascribe the cause almost entirely to a god or a demigod that it is reasonable for them to act and to believe thus; but on the basis of what you say it is not reasonable. For the presence of the exhalation, whether the victim be excited or not, will produce the inspiration and will dispose the soul auspiciously, not only the soul of the priestess, but that of any ordinary person with whom it may come into contact. Wherefore it is silly to employ one woman alone for the purpose of the oracles and to give her trouble by watching her to keep her pure and chaste all her life. As a matter of fact, this Coretas, who the people of Delphi say was the first, because he fell in, to supply any means of knowing about the power with which the place is endowed, was not, I think, any different from the rest of the goatherds and shepherds, if so be that this is not a fable or a fabrication as I, for one, think it is. When I take into account the number of benefactions to the Greeks for which this oracle has been responsible, both in wars and in the founding of cities, in cases of pestilence and failure of crops, I think it is a dreadful thing to assign its discovery and origin, not to God and Providence, but to chance and accident. But regarding <pb xml:id="v.5.p.487"/> these matters,</q> he added, <q>I wish that Lamprias would say something to us. Will you wait?</q> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>Certainly I will,</q> said Philip, <q type="unspecified" >and so will all who are here. For what you have said has set us all thinking.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"> <p rend="indent">Then I, addressing myself to him, said, <q>Not only has it set me thinking, Philip, but it has filled me with confusion, if, in the presence of so many men such as you all are, I seem, in contradiction to my years, to give myself airs over the plausibility of my argument and to upset or disturb any of the beliefs regarding the Deity which have been conceived in truth and in piety. I shall defend myself by citing Plato as my witness and advocate in one. That philosopher<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plato, <title rend="italic" >Phaedo</title>, 97 b-c.</note> found fault with Anaxagoras, the one of early times, because he was too much wrapped up in the physical causes and was always following up and pursuing the law of necessity as it was worked out in the behaviour of bodies, and left out of account the purpose and the agent, which are better causes and origins. Plato himself was the first of the philosophers, or the one most prominently engaged in prosecuting investigations of both sorts, to assign to God, on the one hand, the origin of all things that are in keeping with reason, and on the other hand, not to divest matter of the causes necessary for whatever comes into being, but to realize that the perceptible universe, even when arranged in some such orderly way as this, is not pure and unalloyed, but that it takes its origin from matter when matter comes into conjunction with reason. Observe first how it is with the artists. Take as our first example the far-famed stand and base for the mixing-bowl here which <pb xml:id="v.5.p.489"/> Herodotus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The stand, dedicated by Alyattes (king of Lydia from 617 to 560 b.c.), was of wrought iron and welded together, not riveted. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, i. 25; Pausanias, x. 16. 1.

And, indeed, the author and creator of these likenesses and portraits here stands recorded in the inscription<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Bergk, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat" >Poet. Lyr. Graec.</title> iii. p. 502, Simonides, no. 160; or Edmonds, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Lyra Graeca</title>, ii. p. 399 (L.C.L.). <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Pausanias, x. 25. 1.</note>: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thasian by race and descent, Aglaophon’s son Polygnotus </l> <l>Painted the taking of Troy, showing her citadel’s sack;</l> </quote> so that it may be seen that he painted them. But without pigments ground together, losing their own colour in the process, nothing could achieve such a composition and sight. Does he, then, who is desirous of getting hold of the material cause, as he investigates and explains the behaviour of the red earth of Sinopê and the changes to which it is subject when mixed with yellow ochre, or of the light-coloured earth of Melos when mixed with lamp-black, take away the repute of the artist? And he that goes into the details of the hardening and the softening of steel, how it is relaxed by the fire, and becomes pliant and yielding for those who forge and fashion it, and then, plunged anew into clear water, is contracted and compacted by the coldness because of the softness and looseness of texture previously engendered <pb xml:id="v.5.p.491"/> by the fire, and acquires a tenseness and firmness which Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> ix. 393.</note> has called <q>the brawn of steel</q> — does such an investigator any the less preserve intact for the artist the credit for the creation of the work? I think not. In fact there are some who question the properties of medicinal agents, but they do not do away with medical science. And thus when Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 433 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, and Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 507 c-d, and 508 d.</note> declared that we see by the commingling of the irradiation from our eyes with the light of the sun, and that we hear by the vibration of the air, he certainly did not mean by this to abrogate the fundamenta! fact that it is according to the design of Reason and Providence that we have been endowed with sight and hearing. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">To sum up, then: while every form of creation has, as I say, two causes, the very earliest theological writers and poets chose to heed only the superior one, uttering over all things that come to pass this common generality: <quote rend="blockquote">Zeus the beginning, Zeus in the midst, and from Zeus comes all being<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Orphic Frag.</title> vi. 10 (21 a, 2); <foreign xml:lang="lat"> cf.</foreign> Mullach, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Frag.

On the other hand the younger generation which followed them, and are called physicists or natural philosophers, reverse the procedure of the older school in their aberration from the beautiful and divine origin, and ascribe everything to bodies and their behaviour, to clashes, transmutations, and combinations. Hence the reasoning of both parties is deficient in what is essential to it, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.493"/> since the one ignores or omits the intermediary and the agent, the other the source and the means. He who was the first to comprehend clearly both these points and to take, as a necessary adjunct to the agent that creates and actuates, the underlying matter, which is acted upon, clears us also of all suspicion of wilful misstatement. The fact is that we do not make the prophetic art godless or irrational when we assign to it as its material the soul of a human being, and assign the spirit of inspiration and the exhalation as an instrument or plectrum for playing on it. For, in the first place, the earth, which generates the exhalation, and the sun, which endows the earth with all its power of tempering and transmutation, are, by the usage of our fathers, gods for us. Secondly, if we leave demigods as overseers, watchmen, and guardians of this tempered constitution, as if it were a kind of harmony, slackening here and tightening there on occasion, taking from it its too distracting and disturbing elements and incorporating those that are painless and harmless to the users, we shall not appear to be doing anything irrational or impossible. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">Nor again, in offering the preliminary sacrifice to learn the god’s will and in putting garlands on victims or pouring libations over them, are we doing anything to contradict this reasoning. For when the priests and holy men say that they are offering sacrifice and pouring the libation over the victim and observing its movements and its trembling, of what else do they take this to be a sign save that the god is in his holy temple? For what is to be offered in sacrifice must, both in body and in soul, be pure, unblemished, and unmarred. Indications regarding the body it is not at all difficult to perceive, but they <pb xml:id="v.5.p.495"/> test the soul by setting meal before the bulls and peas before the boars; and the animal that does not eat of this they think is not of sound mind. In the case of the goat, they say, cold water gives positive proof; for indifference and immobility against being suddenly wet is not characteristic of a soul in a normal state. But for my part, even if it be firmly established that the trembling is a sign of the god’s being in his holy temple and the contrary a sign of his not being there, I cannot see what difficulty in my statements results therefrom. For every faculty duly performs its natural functions better or worse concurrently with some particular time; and if that time escapes our ken, it is only reasonable that the god should give signs of it.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">I think, then, that the exhalation is not in the same state all the time, but that it has recurrent periods of weakness and strength. Of the proof on which I depend I have as witnesses many foreigners and all the officials and servants at the shrine. It is a fact that the room in which they seat those who would consult the god is filled, not frequently or with any regularity, but as it may chance from time to time, with a delightful fragrance coming on a current of air which bears it towards the worshippers, as if its source were in the holy of holies; and it is like the odour which the most exquisite and costly perfumes send forth. It is likely that this efflorescence is produced by warmth or some other force engendered there. If this does not seem credible, you will at least all agree that the prophetic priestess herself is subjected to differing influences, varying from time to time, which affect that, part of her soul with which the spirit of inspiration comes into association, and that she <pb n="v.5.p.497"/> does not always keep one temperament, like a perfect concord, unchanged on every occasion. For many annoyances and disturbances of which she is conscious, and many more unpereeived, lay hold upon her body and filter into her soul; and whenever she is replete with these, it is better that she should not go there and surrender herself to the control of the god, when she is not completely unhampered (as if she were a musical instrument, well strung and well tuned), but is in a state of emotion and instability. Wine, for example, does not always produce the same state of intoxication in the toper,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 406 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> nor the music of the flute the same state of exaltation in the votary; but the same persons are roused now to less, now to more, extravagant conduct by the Bacchic revels or stimulated by the wine, as the temperament within them becomes different. But especially does the imaginative faculty of the soul seem to be swayed by the alterations in the body, and to change as the body changes, a fact which is clearly shown in dreams; for at one time we find ourselves beset in our dreams by a multitude of visions of all sorts, and at another time again there comes a complete calmness and rest free from all such fancies. We ourselves know of Cleon here from Daulia and that he asserts that in all the many years he has lived he has never had a dream; and among the older men the same thing is told of Thrasymedes of Heraea. The cause of this is the temperament of the body, just as that of persons who are prone to melancholy, at the other extreme, is subject to a multitude of dreams and visions; wherefore they have the repute of possessing the faculty of dreaming straight; for since they turn now to this <pb xml:id="v.5.p.499"/> and now to that in their imagery, like persons who shoot many arrows, they often manage to hit the mark. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"> <p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">Whenever, then, the imaginative and prophetic faculty is in a state of proper adjustment for attempering itself to the spirit as to a drug, inspiration in those who foretell the future is bound to come; and whenever the conditions are not thus, it is bound not to come, or when it does come to be misleading, abnormal, and confusing, as we know in the case of the priestess who died not so long ago. As it happened, a deputation from abroad had arrhed to consult the oracle. The victim, it is said, remained unmoved and unaffected in any way by the first libations; but the priests, in their eagerness to please, went far beyond their wonted usage, and only after the victim had been subjected to a deluge and nearly drowned did it at last give in. What, then, was the result touching the priestess? She went down into the oracle unwillingly, they say, and halfheartedly; and at her first responses it was at once plain from the harshness of her voice that she was not responding properly; she was like a labouring ship and was filled with a mighty and baleful spirit. Finally she became hysterical and with a frightful shriek rushed towards the exit and threw herself down, with the result that not only the members of the deputation fled, but also the oracle-interpreter Nicander and those holy men that were present. However, after a little, they went in and took her up, still conscious; and she lived on for a few days. </q></p> 
	<p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">It is for these reasons that they guard the chastity of the priestess, and keep her life free from all <pb xml:id="v.5.p.501"/> association and contact with strangers, and take the omens before the oracle, thinking that it is clear to the god when she has the temperament and disposition suitable to submit to the inspiration without harm to herself. The power of the spirit does not affect all persons nor the same persons always in the same way, but it only supplies an enkindling and an inception, as has been said, for them that are in a proper state to be affected and to undergo the change. The power comes from the gods and demigods, but, for all that, it is not unfailing nor imperishable nor ageless, lasting into that infinite time by which all things between earth and moon become wearied out, according to our reasoning. And there are some who assert that the things above the moon also do not. abide, but give out as they confront the everlasting and infinite, and undergo continual transmutations and rebirths. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"> <p rend="indent"> <q rend="merge">These matters,</q> I added, <q>I urge upon you for your frequent consideration, as well as my own, in the belief that they contain much to which objections might be made, and many suggestions looking to a contrary conclusion, all of which the present occasion does not allow us to follow out. So let them be postponed until another time, and likewise the question which Philip raises about the Sun and Apollo.</q> </p> </div> </div>
