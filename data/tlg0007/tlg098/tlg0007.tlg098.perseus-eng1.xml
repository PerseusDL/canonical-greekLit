            <p>Trials of cases on appeal<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Plutarch is probably referring to the common practice of small states appealing to the greater, Athens or Rhodes, to arbitrate in disputes; the distrust was thus not of all other Greeks but of fellow-citizens. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Schwyzer, <hi rend="italics">Dial. Gr. Exempla</hi>, 83 for an inscription in which Argos regulates the relations between Cnossus and Tylissus <hi rend="italics">circa</hi> 450 b.c.; see also M. N. Tod, <hi rend="italics">International Arbitration among the Greeks</hi> (Oxford, 1913).</note> before special arbitrators and the carrying of cases before foreign courts
					were first devised by the Greeks by reason of their
					mutual distrust, since they had need of the justice
					supplied by others than themselves, like any other
					non-indigenous necessity. Is it thus, then, that
					philosophers also, because of their disagreements
					with each other, refer some of their questions to the
					nature of irrational animals, as though to a foreign
					city, and submit the decision to the emotions and
					character and habits of these creatures as to a court
					that cannot be influenced or bribed? Or is this also
					a common charge against human depravity - that,
					being in doubt about the most necessary and important things, we seek among horses and dogs and
					birds how we ourselves should marry and beget and
					bring up children (as though we had no plain indication of Nature in ourselves) ; and that we term the
					traits which brute beasts have <q>characters</q> and
					<q>emotions,</q> and accuse our life of a great deviation
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.333"/>
					
					and departure from Nature, confused and disordered
					as we are at the very beginning concerning even
					the first principles? For in dumb animals Nature
					preserves their special characteristics pure and unmixed and simple, but in men, through reason and
					habit, they have been modified by many opinions
					and adventitious judgements so that they have lost
					their proper form and have acquired a pleasing
					variety comparable to the variety of perfumes made
					by the pharmacist on the basis of a single oil. And
					let us not wonder if irrational animals follow Nature
					more closely than rational ones ; for animals are, in
					fact, outdone in this by plants, to which Nature has
					given neither imagination nor impulse, nor desire for
					something different, which causes men to shake themselves free from what Nature desires ; but plants, as
					though they were fastened in chains, remain in the
					power of Nature, always traversing the one path along
					which Nature leads them. Yet in wild beasts versatility of reasoning and uncommon cleverness and excessive love of freedom are not too highly developed;
					and though they have irrational impulses and desires
					and often wander about on circuitous paths, they do
					not go far afield, but ride, as it were, at the anchor
					provided by Nature, who points out to them the
					straight way, as to an ass which proceeds under bit
					and bridle. But in man ungoverned reason is absolute master, and, discovering now one way of
					deviation and innovation and now another, has left
					no clear or certain vestige of Nature visible.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">The text of this chapter is exceedingly corrupt: the restorations and suggestions adopted here claim only an approximation to the required thought.</note>

					Are we, then, to believe that Nature has implanted

					rebukes for their insensibility, by citing which they<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the philosophers whose views Plutarch is criticizing.</note>
					disparage human nature as being the only kind that

					how to love without prospect of gain? In our theatres,

					and should revise this speech and say, <q>Dogs do not
						love their pups, nor horses their colts, nor birds their

					this was well and truly spoken. For it is shameful -

					bestowed a love of offspring, though imperfect and
					insufficient as regards the sense of justice and one
					which does not advance beyond utility ; but in the
					case of man, a rational and social animal, Nature, by
					introducing him to a conception of justice and law and
					to the worship of the gods and to the founding of cities
					and to human kindness, has furnished noble and beautiful and fruitful seeds of all these in the joy we have
					in our children and our love of them, emotions which
					accompany their first beginnings ; and these qualities
