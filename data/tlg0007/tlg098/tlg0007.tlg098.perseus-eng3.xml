None of his successors, not even Pohlenz, shows any knowledge of his valuable work.</note> and Weissenberger have shown, in assuming the work to be an epitome. <pb xml:id="v.6.p.329"/> It is best regarded as an unfinished fragment, containing, so far as it goes, the rough and unrevised hand of Plutarch. </p>

<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="1"><p rend="indent">Trials of cases on appeal<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch is probably referring to the common practice of small states appealing to the greater, Athens or Rhodes, to arbitrate in disputes; the distrust was thus not of all other Greeks but of fellow-citizens. <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Schwyzer, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Dial. Gr. Exempla</title>, 83 for an inscription in which Argos regulates the relations between Cnossus and Tylissus <foreign xml:lang="lat">circa</foreign> 450 b.c.; see also M. N. Tod, <title rend="italic">International Arbitration among the Greeks</title> (Oxford, 1913).</note> before special arbitrators and the carrying of cases before foreign courts were first devised by the Greeks by reason of their mutual distrust, since they had need of the justice supplied by others than themselves, like any other non-indigenous necessity. Is it thus, then, that philosophers also, because of their disagreements with each other, refer some of their questions to the nature of irrational animals, as though to a foreign city, and submit the decision to the emotions and character and habits of these creatures as to a court that cannot be influenced or bribed? Or is this also a common charge against human depravity - that, being in doubt about the most necessary and important things, we seek among horses and dogs and birds how we ourselves should marry and beget and bring up children (as though we had no plain indication of Nature in ourselves); and that we term the traits which brute beasts have <q type="emph">characters</q> and <q type="emph">emotions,</q> and accuse our life of a great deviation <pb xml:id="v.6.p.333"/> and departure from Nature, confused and disordered as we are at the very beginning concerning even the first principles? For in dumb animals Nature preserves their special characteristics pure and unmixed and simple, but in men, through reason and habit, they have been modified by many opinions and adventitious judgements so that they have lost their proper form and have acquired a pleasing variety comparable to the variety of perfumes made by the pharmacist on the basis of a single oil. And let us not wonder if irrational animals follow Nature more closely than rational ones; for animals are, in fact, outdone in this by plants, to which Nature has given neither imagination nor impulse, nor desire for something different, which causes men to shake themselves free from what Nature desires; but plants, as though they were fastened in chains, remain in the power of Nature, always traversing the one path along which Nature leads them. Yet in wild beasts versatility of reasoning and uncommon cleverness and excessive love of freedom are not too highly developed; and though they have irrational impulses and desires and often wander about on circuitous paths, they do not go far afield, but ride, as it were, at the anchor provided by Nature, who points out to them the straight way, as to an ass which proceeds under bit and bridle. But in man ungoverned reason is absolute master, and, discovering now one way of deviation and innovation and now another, has left no clear or certain vestige of Nature visible.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The text of this chapter is exceedingly corrupt: the restorations and suggestions adopted here claim only an approximation to the required thought.</note> </p> </div>

And what is more wonderful, the mouth of the nest is so exactly fitted to the size and measure of the king-fisher that no other creature, either larger or smaller, may enter, and, so they say, that it will not admit even the most minute drops of sea-water.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 983 c (<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">De sollertia animalium</title>), Plutarch adds a few details to this description.</note> </p>

<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="3"><p rend="indent">But such a statement is neither true nor worth the hearing. For just as in uncultivated plants, such as wild vines and figs and olives, Nature has implanted the principles, though crude and imperfect, of cultivated fruits, so on irrational animals she has bestowed a love of offspring, though imperfect and insufficient as regards the sense of justice and one which does not advance beyond utility; but in the case of man, a rational and social animal, Nature, by introducing him to a conception of justice and law and to the worship of the gods and to the founding of cities and to human kindness, has furnished noble and beautiful and fruitful seeds of all these in the joy we have in our children and our love of them, emotions which accompany their first beginnings; and these qualities are found in the very constitution of their bodies. For although Nature is everywhere exact and workmanlike <pb xml:id="v.6.p.345"/> with no deficiency or superfluity, <q type="translation">and has,</q> as Erasistratus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A famous physician at the court of Seleucus I and later at Alexandria; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Demetrius</title>, xxxviii.

For in women the amount of blood exceeds the use for it because of the sluggishness and paucity of their breath and, coming to the surface, wanders at large and burdens them; at other times it is Nature’s custom and care to discharge the blood at monthly periods by opening canals and channels for it, to lighten and cleanse the rest of the body and in season to render the womb fertile ground for ploughing, as it were, and sowing. But when the womb receives the seed as it encounters it and enfolds it and it has taken root<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Aristotle, 745 b 25: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφίησιν εὐθὺς οἶον ῥίζαν τὸν ὀμφαλὸν εἰς τὴν ὑστέραν</foreign>, and 493 a 18: (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς γαστρὸς</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥίζα ὀμφαλός</foreign>.</note> there (<q type="translation">for the umbilical cord grows at first in the womb,</q> as Democritus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag.

At that time, then, Nature, more carefully than any gardener or irrigator, turns and changes the blood from one use to another and has in readiness subterranean springs, as it were, of a fresh-flowing stream; and the springs receive the blood in no perfunctory or unemotional manner, but are even able, by the gentle heat and soft womanliness of respiration, to digest, mollify, and change it; for such a disposition and temper does the breast have within it. Yet there are no outflowing streams of milk nor spouts which discharge it all at once,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Aemilius Paulus</title>, xiv.
