But as for us, as though acknowledging that man has won the victory in wretchedness and has been proclaimed the most miserable of animals, let us compare him with himself, dividing body and soul for competition of their individual miseries, a task not unprofitable but even quite necessary, to the end that we may learn whether it is through Fortune or through ourselves that we live more wretchedly. For while disease grows in the body through Nature, vice and depravity in the soul are first the souls own doing, and then its affliction. It will be no slight aid toward tranquillity of mind, if the worse condition be curable, being both lighter to bear and lacking intensity. <pb xml:id="v.6.p.383"/> </p> </div>

Shall we, then, say in our own case, <q type="spoken">Many of your diseases and affections, O man, your body naturally produces of itself, and it receives also many that befall it from without; but if you lay yourself open on the inside, you will find a storehouse and treasury, as Democritus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</title> <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>, vol. ii. p. 172, Frag. 149.</note> says, of all manner of evils and many abnormal states, which do not flow in from outside, but have, as it were, subterranean and earth-born springs, which Vice, being widely diffused and abundantly supplied with those abnormal states, causes to gush forth</q>? And if the diseases in the flesh are detected by the pulse and biliousness, and temperatures and sudden pains confirm their presence, but the evils in the soul escape the notice of most men, they are for this reason worse evils, since they also deprive the sufferer of any awareness of themselves. For although the reason,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</title>, iii. 1.</note> if sound, perceives the diseases <pb xml:id="v.6.p.385"/> which affect the body, yet, being itself afflicted with those of the soul, it can form no judgement of its own afflictions, for it is affected in the very part by which it judges; and, of the souls diseases, one must account as first and greatest ignorance, which causes Vice beyond hope of cure to abide with most men, to cling to them through life, and to die with them. For the beginning of the riddance of disease is awareness which leads the ailing part to the use of what will relieve it; but the man who through disbelief in his ailment does not know what he needs, refuses the remedy, even if it be at hand. For it is true of the diseases of the body also that those are worse which are attended by inability to perceive the body’s condition: lethargies, migraine, epilepsies, apoplexies, and those very fevers which, raising inflammation to the pitch of delirium and confounding consciousness, as on a musical instrument, <quote rend="blockquote">Will touch the heart-strings never touched before.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 456 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> </quote> </p> </div>

For although no one has ever called a fever <q type="emph">health,</q> nor consumption <q type="emph">excellent condition,</q> nor gout <q type="emph">swiftness of foot,</q> nor sallowness a <q type="emph">fresh complexion,</q> yet many call hot temper<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> 462 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> <pb xml:id="v.6.p.387"/> <q type="emph">manliness,</q> and love <q type="emph">friendship,</q> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><quote xml:lang="fre">Si on juge de l’amour par la plupart de ses effets, il ressemble plus a la haine qu’a l’amitie.</quote> - De la Rochefoucauld.</note> and envy <q type="emph">emulation,</q> and cowardice <q type="emph">caution.</q> Again, while men sick in body send for a doctor, since they perceive whom they need to counteract their ailments, yet those that are sick in soul avoid philosophers, for they think that they are doing well in those very matters where they are at fault. The fact is that, if we follow on this line of reasoning, we maintain that defective eyesight is easier to bear than madness and gout than inflammation of the brain! For a man that is sick in body perceives it and calls loudly for a physician, and when he comes, allows him to anoint the eyes or open the veins; but you hear the maddened Agave say,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Bacchae</title>m 1169-1171; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign><title rend="italic">Life of Crassus</title>, xxxiii.

For impulses are the beginning of action, and the soul’s abnormal states are violent impulses. That is the reason why they do not allow the soul to be at rest, but just at the time when man most needs repose and silence and relaxation, then his fits of temper, of contentiousness, of love, of grief, drag him into the open air and strip him bare, and he is forced both to do many lawless things and to give tongue to many things unsuited to the occasion. </p> </div> 
<div subtype="section" type="textpart" n="4"> <p rend="indent">As, therefore, the storm that prevents a sailor from putting into port is more dangerous than that which does not allow him to sail, so those storms of the soul are more serious which do not allow a man to compose or to calm his disturbed reason; but pilotless and without ballast, in confusion and aimless wandering, rushing headlong in oblique and reeling courses, he suffers a terrible shipwreck, as it were, and ruins his life. Consequently for this reason also it is worse to be sick in soul than in body; for men afflicted in body only suffer, but those afflicted in soul both suffer and do ill.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Cicero, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Tusc.
