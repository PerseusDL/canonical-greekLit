            <p>
					The proof that afflictions of the soul are worse than
					diseases of the body is treated in a popular and, in
					chapter 4, dramatic manner. The conclusion is lost.

            <p>
					The same subject was treated in his commonplace

                  <hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> 7 ed. Hobein, 13 ed. DÃ¼bner.</note> who shows no knowledge of Plutarch's oration, nor any relation to his

					For while disease grows in the body through Nature,
					vice and depravity in the soul are first the souls
					own doing, and then its affliction. It will be no
					slight aid toward tranquillity of mind, if the worse

					Shall we, then, say in our own case, <q>Many of your

						produces of itself, and it receives also many that
						befall it from without; but if you lay yourself open
						on the inside, you will find a storehouse and treasury,
						as Democritus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Frag. d. Vorsokratiker</hi>

						abnormal states, which do not flow in from outside,
						but have, as it were, subterranean and earth-born
						springs, which Vice, being widely diffused and abundantly supplied with those abnormal states, causes to
						gush forth</q>? And if the diseases in the flesh are
					detected by the pulse and biliousness, and temperatures and sudden pains confirm their presence, but the
					evils in the soul escape the notice of most men, they
					are for this reason worse evils, since they also deprive
					the sufferer of any awareness of themselves. For
					although the reason,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Tusc. Disp.</hi>, iii. 1.</note> if sound, perceives the diseases
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.385"/>
					
					which affect the body, yet, being itself afflicted with
					those of the soul, it can form no judgement of its
					own afflictions, for it is affected in the very part by
					which it judges ; and, of the souls diseases, one
					must account as first and greatest ignorance, which
					causes Vice beyond hope of cure to abide with most
					men, to cling to them through life, and to die with
					them. For the beginning of the riddance of disease
					is awareness which leads the ailing part to the use
					of what will relieve it; but the man who through
					disbelief in his ailment does not know what he needs,
					refuses the remedy, even if it be at hand. For it is
					true of the diseases of the body also that those are
					worse which are attended by inability to perceive the
					body's condition : lethargies, migraine, epilepsies,
					apoplexies, and those very fevers which, raising inflammation to the pitch of delirium and confounding
					consciousness, as on a musical instrument,

					that defective eyesight is easier to bear than madness
					and gout than inflammation of the brain! For a

					It is true that one who is sick in body gives in at

					one of those who sit by him will say to him gently,

					least at rest. For impulses are the beginning of
					action, and the soul's abnormal states are violent
					impulses. That is the reason why they do not allow
					the soul to be at rest, but just at the time when
					man most needs repose and silence and relaxation,
					then his fits of temper, of contentiousness, of love,
					of grief, drag him into the open air and strip him
					bare, and he is forced both to do many lawless
					things and to give tongue to many things unsuited
