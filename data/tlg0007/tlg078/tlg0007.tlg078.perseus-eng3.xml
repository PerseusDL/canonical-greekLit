<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p rend="indent"> The modern bride will undoubtedly turn up her nose and shake her independent head in disapproval of Plutarch’s suggestions about subordinating herself to her husband, and nobody will attempt to deny that the status of women has changed materially since Plutarch’s time; but, apart from this, she will find in Plutarch’s short essay many suggestions regarding whole-souled co-operation and cheerful intellectual companionship with her husband, which mutatis mutandis hold as good to-day as they did when they were written, nearly two thousand years ago. Nor is the husband neglected; he can find much sound advice regarding his attitude towards his wife and the respect and consideration that is always due to her. </p> <p rend="indent">Plutarch was no mere theorist in these matters. He himself was happily married, and anyone who doubts this should read his letter to his wife (Moralia, 608 a). </p> <p rend="indent">The essay is included in the catalogue of Lamprias (see Vol. I. Introd. p. xviii) and is not infrequently quoted or referred to by later writers, Stobaeus, for example, in his Florilegium, especially lxxiv., and Hieronymus (St. Jerome), Adversus Iovinianum, i. ad fin. It is well worth while, in this connexion, to read Jeremy Taylor’s sermon, The Marriage Ring, to see how a famous preacher served up many of the ideas of a heathen philosopher to a Christian congregation.</p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.2.p.299"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="0"> <p rend="indent"> <emph>From Plutarch to Pollianus and Eurydice, health and prosperity.</emph> </p> <p rend="indent">Following close upon the time-honoured rites which the priestess of Demeter <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> O. Gruppe, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte</title>, p. 1176. A few references are given regarding marriage rites and customs which are here touched upon, but anyone interested in these matters will consult some book like Westermarck, <title rend="italic">The History of Human Marriage</title> (5th ed. 1922).</note> applied to you when you were retiring together to the bridal chamber, a discourse which equally touches both of you and swells the nuptial song will, I think, have a useful effect which will also accord with convention. </p> <p rend="indent">In music they used to call one of the conventional themes for the flute the <q>Horse Rampant,</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 704 F.</note> a strain which, as it seems, aroused an ardent desire in horses and imparted it to them at the time of mating. Of the many admirable themes contained in philosophy, that which deals with marriage deserves no less serious attention than any other, for by means of it philosophy weaves a spell over those who are entering together into a lifelong partnership, and renders them gentle and amiable toward each other. I have therefore drawn up a compendium of what you, who have been brought up in the atmosphere of philosophy, have often heard, putting it in the form of brief comparisons that it may be more easily remembered, and I am sending it as a gift for you both to possess in common; and at the same time I pray that the <pb xml:id="v.2.p.301"/> Muses may lend their presence and co-operation to Aphrodite, and may feel that it is no more fitting for them to provide a lyre or lute well attuned than it is to provide that the harmony which concerns marriage and the household shall be well attuned through reason, concord, and philosophy. Indeed, the ancients gave Hermes <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Hermes as the patron of arts and sciences, including speaking and writing; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign>, for example, the familiar instance in <title rend="italic">Acts</title> xiv. 12.</note> a place at the side of Aphrodite, in the conviction that the pleasure in marriage stands especially in need of reason; and they also assigned a place there to Persuasion and the Graces, so that married people should succeed in attaining their mutual desires by persuasion and not by fighting and quarrelling. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p rend="indent">Solon <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch mentions this again in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 279 F, and in his <title rend="italic">Life of Solon</title>, chap. xx. (p. 89 C).</note> directed that the bride should nibble a quince before getting into bed, intimating, presumably, that the delight from lips and speech should be harmonious and pleasant at the outset. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent">In Boeotia, after veiling the bride, they put on her head a chaplet of asparagus; for this plant yields the finest flavoured fruit from the roughest thorns, and so the bride will provide for him who does not run away or feel annoyed at her first display of peevishness and unpleasantness a docile and sweet life together. Those who do not patiently put up with the early girlish disagreements are on a par with those who on account of the sourness of green grapes abandon the ripe clusters to others. Again, many of the newly married women because of their first experiences get annoyed at their husbands, and find <pb xml:id="v.2.p.303"/> themselves in like predicament with those who patiently submit to the bees’ stings, but abandon the honeycomb. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent">In the beginning, especially, married people ought to be on their guard against disagreements and clashes, for they see that such household vessels as are made of sections joined together are at the outset easily pulled apart by any fortuitous cause, but after a time, when their joints have become set, they can hardly be separated by fire and steel. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent">Just as fire catches readily in chaff, fibre, and hares’ fur, but goes out rather quickly, unless it gets hold of some other thing that can retain it and feed it, so the keen love between newly married people that blazes up fiercely as the result of physical attractiveness must not be regarded as enduring or constant, unless, by being centred about character and by gaining a hold upon the rational faculties, it attains a state of vitality. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"> <p rend="indent">Fishing with poison is a quick way to catch fish and an easy method of taking them, but it makes the fish inedible and bad. In the same way women who artfully employ love-potions and magic spells upon their husbands, and gain the mastery over them through pleasure, find themselves consorts of dull-witted, degenerate fools. The men bewitched by Circe were of no service to her, nor did she make the least use of them after they had been changed into swine and asses, while for Odysseus, who had sense and showed discretion in her company, she had an exceeding great love. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent">Women who prefer to have power over fools rather than to hearken to sensible men, are like persons who prefer to guide the blind on the road <pb xml:id="v.2.p.305"/> rather than to follow persons possessed of knowledge and sight. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"> <p rend="indent">Women will not believe that Pasiphaë, the consort of a king, fell in love with a bull, in spite of the fact that they see some of their sex who feel bored by uncompromising and virtuous men, and take more pleasure in consorting with those who, like dogs and he-goats, are a combination of licentiousness and sensuality. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"> <p rend="indent">Men who through weakness or effeminacy are unable to vault upon their horses teach the horses to kneel of themselves and crouch down. In like manner, some who have won wives of noble birth or wealth, instead of making themselves better, try to humble their wives, with the idea that they shall have more authority over their wives if these are reduced to a state of humility. But, as one pays heed to the size of his horse in using the rein, so in using the rein on his wife he ought to pay heed to her position. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"> <p rend="indent">Whenever the moon is at a distance from the sun we see her conspicuous and brilliant, but she disappears and hides herself when she comes near him. Contrariwise a virtuous woman ought to be most visible in her husband’s company, and to stay in the house and hide herself when he is away. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"> <p rend="indent">Herodotus was not right in saying <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Herodotus, i. 8. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 37 C, and Hieronymus, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Adversus Iovinianum</title>, chap. xlviii. (vol. ii. p. 292 of Migne’s edition).</note> that a woman lays aside her modesty along with her undergarment. On the contrary, a virtuous woman puts on modesty in its stead, and husband and wife bring into their mutual relations the greatest modesty as a token of the greatest love. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"> <p rend="indent">Whenever two notes are sounded in accord the tune is carried by the bass; and in like manner every activity in a virtuous household is carried on <pb xml:id="v.2.p.307"/> by both parties in agreement, but discloses the husband’s leadership and preferences. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"> <p rend="indent">The Sun won a victory over the North Wind.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nos. 306 and 307 of the Fables which pass under the name of Aesop. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Athenaeus, 604 f.</note> For the wind tried by force to rob a man of his cloak, and blew briskly against him, but the man only drew his garment closer, and held it more tightly together. But when the heat of the sun succeeded the wind, the man began to get warm, and later very hot, and ended by stripping off his shirt as well as his cloak. This is the way most women act. When their husbands try forcibly to remove their luxury and extravagance they keep up a continual fight and are very cross; but if they are convinced with the help of reason, they peaceably put aside these things and practise moderation. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"> <p rend="indent">Cato expelled from the Senate <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story is told with more humorous details by Plutarch in his <title rend="italic">Life of Cato Major</title>, chap. xvii. (p. 346 c).</note> a man who kissed his own wife in the presence of his daughter. This perhaps was a little severe. But if it is a disgrace (as it is) for man and wife to caress and kiss and embrace in the presence of others, is it not more of a disgrace to air their recriminations and disagreements before others, and, granting that his intimacies and pleasures with his wife should be carried on in secret, to indulge in admonition, faultfinding, and plain speaking in the open and without reserve? </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"> <p rend="indent">Just as a mirror, although embellished with gold and precious stones, is good for nothing unless it shows a true likeness, so there is no advantage in a rich wife unless she makes her life true to her husband’s and her character in accord with his. If the mirror gives back a gloomy image of a glad man, <pb xml:id="v.2.p.309"/> or a cheerful and grinning image of a troubled and gloomy man, it is a failure and worthless. So too a wife is worthless and lacking in sense of fitness who puts on a gloomy face when her husband is bent on being sportive and gay, and again, when he is serious, is sportive and mirthful. The one smacks of disagreeableness, the other of indifference. Just as lines and surfaces, in mathematical parlance, have no motion of their own but only in conjunction with the bodies to which they belong,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 63 B.</note> so the wife ought to have no feeling of her own, but she should join with her husband in seriousness and sportiveness and in soberness and laughter. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"> <p rend="indent">Men who do not like to see their wives eat in their company are thus teaching them to stuff themselves when alone. So those who are not cheerful in the company of their wives, nor join with them in sportiveness and laughter, are thus teaching them to seek their own pleasures apart from their husbands. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"> <p rend="indent">The lawful wives of the Persian kings sit beside them at dinner, and eat with them. But when the kings wish to be merry and get drunk, they send their wives away, and send for their music-girls and concubines.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 613 A.</note> In so far they are right in what they do, because they do not concede any share in their licentiousness and debauchery to their wedded wives. If therefore a man in private life, who is incontinent and dissolute in regard to his pleasures, commit some peccadillo with a paramour or a maidservant, his wedded wife ought not to be indignant or angry, but she should reason that it is respect for her which leads him to share his debauchery, licentiousness, and wantonness with another woman. <pb xml:id="v.2.p.311"/> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"> <p rend="indent">Kings fond of the arts make many persons incline to be artists, those fond of letters make many want to be scholars, and those fond of sport make many take up athletics. In like manner a man fond of his personal appearance makes a wife all paint and powder; one fond of pleasure makes her meretricious and licentious, while a husband who loves what is good and honourable makes a wife discreet and well-behaved. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"> <p rend="indent">A young Spartan woman, in answer to an inquiry as to whether she had already made advances to her husband, said, <q>No, but he has made them to me.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>. <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 242 B.</note> This behaviour, I take it, is characteristic of the true mistress of the household, on the one hand not to avoid or to feel annoyed at such actions on the part of her husband if he begins them, and on the other not to take the initiative herself; for the one course is meretricious and froward, the other disdainful and unamiable. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"> <p rend="indent">A wife ought not to make friends of her own, but to enjoy her husband’s friends in common with him. The gods are the first and most important friends. Wherefore it is becoming for a wife to worship and to know only the gods that her husband believes in, and to shut the front door tight upon all queer rituals and outlandish superstitions. For with no god do stealthy and secret rites performed by a woman find any favour. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"> <p rend="indent">Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, p. 462 C. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> also Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 484 B and 767 D.</note> asserts that the state is prosperous and happy in which the people hear <q>mine</q> and <q>not mine</q> most rarely uttered, the reason being that the citizens, so far as in them lies, treat all things of real importance as common property. Much more should such expressions be eliminated from the <pb xml:id="v.2.p.313"/> married state; save that, as physicians tell us that blows on the left side of the body record the sensation on the right side, so, in the same way, it is a lovely thing for the wife to sympathize with her husband’s concerns and the husband with the wife’s, so that, as ropes, by being intertwined, get strength from each other, thus, by the due contribution of goodwill in corresponding measure by each member, the copartnership may be preserved through the joint action of both. For Nature unites us through the commingling of our bodies, in order that, by taking and blending together a portion derived from each member of a pair, the offspring which she produces may be common to both, so that neither can define or distinguish his own or the other’s part therein. Such a copartnership in property as well is especially befitting married people, who should pour all their resources into a common fund, and combine them, and each should not regard one part as his own and another part as the other’s, but all as his own and nothing as the other’s. As we call a mixture <q>wine,</q> although the larger of the component parts is water, so the property and the estate ought to be said to belong to the husband even though the wife contribute the larger share. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"> <p rend="indent">Helen was fond of wealth and Paris of pleasure; Odysseus was sensible and Penelope virtuous. Therefore the marriage of the latter pair was happy and enviable, while that of the former created an <q>Iliad of woes</q> for Greeks and barbarians. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"> <p rend="indent">The Roman,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Life of Aemilius Paulus</title>, chap. v.

For, as physicians have more fear of fevers that originate from obscure causes and gradual accretion than of those which may be accounted for by manifest and weighty reasons, so it is the petty, continual, daily clashes between man and wife, unnoticed by the great majority, that disrupt and mar married life. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"> <p rend="indent">King Philip was enamoured of a Thessalian woman who was accused of using magic charms upon him. Olympias accordingly made haste to get the woman into her power. But when the latter had come into the queen’s presence and was seen to be beautiful in appearance, and her conversation with the queen was not lacking in good-breeding or cleverness, Olympias exclaimed, <q>Away with these slanders! You have your magic charms in yourself.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Much the same story is told of the wife of Hystaspes by Satyrus in his Life of Euripides (<title rend="italic">Oxyrhynchus Papyri</title>, ix. p. 157).</note> And so a wedded and lawful wife becomes an irresistible thing if she makes everything, dowry, birth, magic charms, and even the magic girdle <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xiv. 214.</note> itself, to be inherent in herself, and by character and virtue succeeds in winning her husband’s love. </p> </div>

So too it is an admirable thing for the mistress of the household, whenever she holds her mirror in her hands, to talk with herself—for the ill-favoured woman to say to herself, <q>What if I am not virtuous?</q> and the beautiful one, <q>What if I am virtuous as well?</q> For if the ill-favoured woman is loved for her character, that is something of which she can be very proud, far more than if she were loved for her beauty. </p> </div>

So too the mistress of the household, just because she avoids and deprecates everything extravagant, meretricious, and ostentatious (and she does well to do so), ought all the more, in the graces of her character and daily life, to employ all artistry upon her husband, habituating him to what is honourable and at the same time pleasant. However, if a woman is naturally uncompromising, arbitrary, and unpleasant, the husband must be considerate, and do as Phocion did when Antipater prescribed for him a dishonourable and unbecoming course of action.

So is it with women also; if they subordinate themselves to their husbands, they are commended, but if they want to have control, they cut a sorrier figure than the subjects of their control. And control ought to be exercised by the man over the woman, not as the owner has control of a piece of property, but, as the soul controls the body, by entering into her feelings and being knit to her through goodwill. As, therefore, it is possible to exercise care over the body without being a slave to its pleasures and desires, so it is possible to govern a wife, and at the same time to delight and gratify her. </p> </div>
