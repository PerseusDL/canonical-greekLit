					nor is it easy to extract the hook of flesh-eating, entangled as it is and embedded in the love of pleasure.
					And, like the Egyptians e who extract the viscera of
					the dead and cut them open in view of the sun, then
					throw them away as being the cause of every single
					sin that the man had committed, it would be well
					for us to excise our own gluttony and lust to kill and
					become pure for the remainder of our lives, since it
					is not so much our belly that drives us to the pollution

					of slaughter ; it is itself polluted by our incontinence.
					Yet if, for heaven's sake, it is really impossible for us
					to be free from error because we are on such terms
					of familiarity with it, let us at least be ashamed of
					our ill doing and resort to it only in reason. We shall
					eat flesh, but from hunger, not as a luxury. We shall
					kill an animal, but in pity and sorrow, not degrading
					or torturing it - which is the current practice in many
					cases, some thrusting red-hot spits into the throats
					of swine so that by the plunging in of the iron the
					blood may be emulsified and, as it circulates through
					the body, may make the flesh tender and delicate.
					Others jump upon the udders of sows<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Nat. Hist.</hi> xi. 210-211 is not quite so gruesome.</note> about to give

            <p>From these practices it is perfectly evident that
					it is not for nourishment or need or necessity, but
					out of satiety and insolence and luxury that they
					have turned this lawless custom into a pleasure.
					Then, just as with women who are insatiable in
					seeking pleasure, their lust tries everything, goes
					astray, and explores the gamut of profligacy until at
					last it ends in unspeakable practices ; so intemperance in eating passes beyond the necessary ends of
					nature and resorts to cruelty and lawlessness to give

					variety to appetite. For it is in their own company
					that organs of sense are infected and won over and
					become licentious when they do not keep to natural
					standards. Just so the art of hearing has fallen sick,
					corrupting musical taste. From this our luxury and
					debauchery conceives a desire for shameful caresses
					and effeminate titillations. These taught the sight
					not to take pleasure in warlike exercises<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">See Plato, <hi rend="italics">Laws</hi>, 816 b.</note> or gesticulations or refined dances or statues and paintings, but
					to regard the slaughter and death of men, their
					wounds and combats, as the most precious sort of
					spectacle.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Referring to the gladiatorial combats which came to be substituted for the more refined exhibitions of an earlier age. Plutarch urges the expulsion of such practices from the State in <hi rend="italics">Mor.</hi> 822 c; for further examples of this kind of opposition to Roman policy see H. Fuchs, <hi rend="italics">Der geistige Widerstand gegen Rom</hi>, p. 49, n. 60.</note> Just so intemperate intercourse follows
					a lawless meal, inharmonious music follows a shameful debauch, barbarous spectacles follow shameless
					songs and sounds, insensitivity and cruelty toward
					human kind follow savage exhibitions in the theatre.
					It was for this reason that the godlike Lycurgus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
