And, like the Egyptians e who extract the viscera of the dead and cut them open in view of the sun, then throw them away as being the cause of every single sin that the man had committed, it would be well for us to excise our own gluttony and lust to kill and become pure for the remainder of our lives, since it is not so much our belly that drives us to the pollution <pb xml:id="v.12.p.565"/> of slaughter; it is itself polluted by our incontinence. Yet if, for heaven’s sake, it is really impossible for us to be free from error because we are on such terms of familiarity with it, let us at least be ashamed of our ill doing and resort to it only in reason. We shall eat flesh, but from hunger, not as a luxury. We shall kill an animal, but in pity and sorrow, not degrading or torturing it - which is the current practice in many cases, some thrusting red-hot spits into the throats of swine so that by the plunging in of the iron the blood may be emulsified and, as it circulates through the body, may make the flesh tender and delicate. Others jump upon the udders of sows<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pliny, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Nat. Hist.</title> xi. 210-211 is not quite so gruesome.</note> about to give birth and kick them so that, when they have blended together blood and milk and gore (Zeus the Purifier!) and the unborn young have at the same time been destroyed at the moment of birth, they may eat the most inflamed part of the creature. Still others sew up the eyes of cranes<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pliny, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Nat. Hist.</title> x. 60.</note> and swans,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Wyttenbach reasonably suggested <q>geese,</q> but see Athenaeus, 131 f; 393 c-d.</note> shut them up in darkness and fatten them, making the flesh appetizing with strange compounds and spicy mixtures. </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent">From these practices it is perfectly evident that it is not for nourishment or need or necessity, but out of satiety and insolence and luxury that they have turned this lawless custom into a pleasure. Then, just as with women who are insatiable in seeking pleasure, their lust tries everything, goes astray, and explores the gamut of profligacy until at last it ends in unspeakable practices; so intemperance in eating passes beyond the necessary ends of nature and resorts to cruelty and lawlessness to give <pb xml:id="v.12.p.567"/> variety to appetite. For it is in their own company that organs of sense are infected and won over and become licentious when they do not keep to natural standards. Just so the art of hearing has fallen sick, corrupting musical taste. From this our luxury and debauchery conceives a desire for shameful caresses and effeminate titillations. These taught the sight not to take pleasure in warlike exercises<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See Plato, <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, 816 b.</note> or gesticulations or refined dances or statues and paintings, but to regard the slaughter and death of men, their wounds and combats, as the most precious sort of spectacle.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Referring to the gladiatorial combats which came to be substituted for the more refined exhibitions of an earlier age. Plutarch urges the expulsion of such practices from the State in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 822 c; for further examples of this kind of opposition to Roman policy see H. Fuchs, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Der geistige Widerstand gegen Rom</title>, p. 49, n. 60.</note> Just so intemperate intercourse follows a lawless meal, inharmonious music follows a shameful debauch, barbarous spectacles follow shameless songs and sounds, insensitivity and cruelty toward human kind follow savage exhibitions in the theatre. It was for this reason that the godlike Lycurgus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Life of Lycurgus</title>, xiii. 5-6 (47 b-c); <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 189 e, 227 c, 285 c; <title rend="italic">Comment. on Hesiod</title>, 42 (Bernardakis, vii, p. 72).</note> gave directions in certain <foreign xml:lang="lat">rhetrae</foreign> <note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Or <q>unwritten laws</q>; the mss. here say <q>in the three <foreign xml:lang="lat">rhetrae</foreign>.</q> </note> that the doors and roofs of houses should be fashioned by saw and axe alone and no other tool should be used-not of course because he had a quarrel with gimlets and adzes and other instruments for delicate work. It was because he knew that through such rough-hewn work you will not be introducing a gilded couch, nor will you be so rash as to bring silver tables and purple rugs and precious stones into a simple house. The corollary <pb xml:id="v.12.p.569"/> of such a house and couch and table and cup is a dinner which is unpretentious and a lunch which is truly democratic; but all manner of luxury and extravagance follow the lead of an evil way of life <quote rend="blockquote">As new-weaned foal beside his mother runs.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Semonides, frag. 5; see <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 446 e and the note.</note> </quote> </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent">For what sort of dinner is not costly for which a living creature loses its life? Do we hold a life cheap? I do not yet go so far as to say that it may well be the life<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, <q>the reincarnated life.</q> </note> of your mother or father or some friend or child, as Empedocles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">As in frag. B 137 (Diels-Kranz, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> i, p. 275).</note> declared. Yet it does, at least, possess some perception, hearing, seeing, imagination, intelligence, which last every creature receives from Nature to enable it to acquire what is proper for it and to evade what is not. Do but consider which are the philosophers who serve the better to humanize us: those<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">S.V.F.</title> iii, p. 186.</note> who bid us eat our children and friends and fathers and wives after their death,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, they tell us to eat meat without compunction, because human beings are only mortal, and their souls are not reincarnated in animals.</note> or Pythagoras<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 993 a <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>. The argument is somewhat weakened by the fact (certainly well known to Plutarch, <foreign xml:lang="lat">e.g.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 286 d-e) that Pythagoras placed an even more stringent taboo on beans than he did on meat.</note> and Empedocles who try to accustom us to act justly toward other creatures also? You ridicule a man who abstains from eating mutton. But are we, they<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pythagoras and Empedocles.</note> will say, to refrain from laughter when we see you slicing off portions from a dead father or mother and sending them to absent friends and inviting those who are at hand, heaping their <pb xml:id="v.12.p.571"/> plates with flesh? But as it is, perhaps we commit a sin when we touch these books of theirs without cleansing our hands and faces, our feet and ears - unless, by Heaven, it is a purification of those members to speak on such a subject as this, <q>washing,</q> as Plato<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, 243 d; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 627 f, 706 e, 711 d.</note> says, <q>the brine from one’s ears with the fresh water of discourse.</q> If one should compare these two sets of books and doctrines,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, of the two schools of philosophy mentioned above in 997 e.</note> the former may serve as philosophy for the Scyths and Sogdians and the Black Cloaks, whose story as told by Herodotus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch seems to have confused the Black Cloaks (Herodotus, iv. 20, but <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> iv. 107) with the Issedones (iv. 26); and perhaps the Sogdians (iii. 93) with the Padaei (iii. 99); <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> also i. 216 and iii. 38.</note> gains no credit<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">But this clause looks like a semi-learned addition.</note>; but the precepts of Pythagoras<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 964 e-f <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> and Empedocles were the laws for the ancient Greeks, along with their diet of wheat <gap reason="lost" rend="..."/><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">There seems to be a lacuna here followed by an interpolation from chapter 6 or 7.</note> [Because there is no question of justice between us and the irrational animals.] </p> </div>

For the circumstances of his death see Lysias’ oration <title rend="italic">Against Eratosthenes</title>. It is, however, somewhat unlikely that Plutarch should call Polemarchus <q>the philosopher</q> even though he appeared in the <title rend="italic">Republic</title> and his philosophic bent was mentioned in the <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> (257 b); so that, once again, we may be faced with interpolation.</note> Just so, at the beginning it was some wild and harmful animal that was eaten, then a bird or fish that had its flesh torn. And so when our murderous instincts had tasted blood and grew practised on wild animals, they advanced to the labouring ox and the well-behaved sheep and the house-warding cock; thus, little by little giving a hard edge to our insatiable appetite, we have advanced to wars and the slaughter and murder of human beings. Yet if someone once demonstrates that souls in their rebirths make use of common bodies and that what is now rational reverts to the irrational, and again what is now wild becomes tame, and that Nature changes everything and assigns new dwellings <quote rend="blockquote">Clothing souls with unfamiliar coat of flesh<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels-Kranz, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Frag. der Vorsok.</title> i, p. 362; Empedocles, frag. 126.</note>;</quote> will not this deter the unruly element in those who have adopted the doctrine from implanting disease and indigestion<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Mor.</title> 128 b-e.</note> in our bodies and perverting our souls to an ever more cruel lawlessness, as soon as we are broken of the habit of not entertaining a guest or celebrating a marriage or consorting with our friends without bloodshed and murder? <pb xml:id="v.12.p.575"/> </p> </div>
         <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent">Yet even if the argument of the migration of souls from body to body is not demonstrated to the point of complete belief, there is enough doubt to make us quite cautious and fearful.

The latter course you will declare to be shocking. Consider also Merope<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title> p. 500, frag. 456 from the <title rend="italic">Cresphontes</title>.

Now suppose one old man stood beside her saying, <q>Hit him! He’s your enemy,</q> and another who said, <q>Don’t strike! He is your son</q>: which would be the greater misdeed, to omit the punishment of an enemy because of the son, or to slay a child under the impulse of <pb xml:id="v.12.p.577"/> anger against an enemy? In a ease, then, where it is not hate or anger or self-defence or fear for ourselves that induces us to murder, but the motive of pleasure, and the victim stands there under our power with its head bent back and one of our philosophers says, <q>Kill it! It’s only a brute beast</q>; but the other says, <q>Stop! What if the soul of some relative or friend has found its way into this body?</q> - Good God! Of course the risk is equal or much the same in the two cases - if I refuse to eat flesh, or if I, disbelieving, kill my child or some other relative! </p> </div>
