	<head>ADVICE ABOUT KEEPING WELL (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE TUENDA SANITATE PRAECEPTA</foreign>)</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="indent">Plutarch had more than a casual interest in medicine, for, besides this essay on keeping well, his other works abound in references to the behaviour of the sick and their treatment, and the medical practices of his day. Long before the time of Plutarch the art of medicine, always empirical, had been put on a solid foundation, and the acute observations of Hippocrates and his school had been set down in writing; and this body of Hippocratic medical writings, along with others, was in circulation, and had undoubtedly been read by Plutarch. </p>

<p rend="indent">That medicine has made very great advances since Plutarch’s time is, of course, self-evident; <q>aseptic,</q> <q>antiseptic,</q> and <q>sterilize</q> are now household words, and the germ theory of disease has, in recent times, shed light on much which before was dark. But Plutarch is not dealing with the technical side of medicine; he is only giving some common-sense advice on rational living, and much that he has to say in regard to rest, exercise, and diet is in accord with the best medical practice of the present day. In fact, it is doubtful if any physician would take exception to anything that Plutarch advises (his advice is meant for men whose work is done with their heads rather than their hands), and one might name men in public life to-day, well on in years, who have followed many of his suggestions, unwittingly, no doubt, but to their own advantage. </p>

<pb xml:id="v.2.p.215"/><p rend="indent">The essay seems, at the first glance, to be put in the form of a dialogue, but it is about as much of a dialogue as Quiller-Couch’s <title rend="italic">Foe-Farrell</title>. The dialogue form is merely a literary subterfuge to present an essay in a slightly more attractive form, and the third person of the dialogue, only occasionally recalled to the reader by the parsimonious interjection of <q>he said,</q> may be presumed to be Plutarch, the author. The two speakers in the brief dialogue at the beginning of the essay are Moschion, a physician, whom Plutarch introduces also into the <title rend="italic">Symposiacs</title> (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 658 a), and Zeuxippus, a friend of Plutarch’s, who is introduced also as a speaking character in two other essays of Plutarch’s (<title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 748 e and 1086 c), besides being mentioned several times in other essays. </p>

<p rend="indent">That the essay was written some time after a.d. 81 is clear from the reference to the death of the Roman Emperor Titus (123 d). </p>

<p rend="indent">The title of the essay is included in Lamprias’ list of Plutarch’s works, and Stobaeus, in his <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Florilegium</title>, has several quotations from it, sometimes with a slightly different reading, but none of these readings changes the meaning of the passage at all, and rarely is one to be preferred to the reading found in the mss. of Plutarch (see Vol. I. Introd. p. xxi). </p>

<p rend="indent">Indeed, the text of this essay has suffered more at the hands of modern editors than from the ancient copyists, for a glance at the foot-notes in Bernardakis’s edition will show that the gratuitous and unnecessary changes introduced into the text by modern editors outnumber their corrections of the minor errors in spelling, and the like, made by the ancient copyists. </p> </div><pb xml:id="v.2.p.217"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Moschion"><label>MOSCHION.</label> So, Zeuxippus, yesterday you drove away Glaucus, the physician, when he wished to join in your philosophical discussions.</said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> No, my dear Moschion, I did not drive him away, nor did he wish to join in philosophical discussion, but I avoided him and feared giving an opening to a man fond of contention. In medicine the man is, as Homer <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xi. 514.</note> puts it, Worth many others together, but he is not kindly disposed towards philosophy, and there is always a certain harshness and ill-nature inherent in his remarks. And just then he was coming at us full tilt, crying out, even before he came near us, that it was no small or suitable task, amounting in fact to a confusion of all bounds, which had been boldly assumed by us in discussing a healthful manner of living. For he asserted that the subjects of philosophy and medicine are as <q>far remote</q> from each other as <q>are the boundaries of</q> any <q>Mysians and Phrygians</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Proverbial; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Nauck, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title>, Adespota, No. 560.</note>; and thereupon, as he had at the tip of his tongue some statements of ours, which, though not very carefully formulated, are certainly not without utility, he proceeded to tear them to pieces.</said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Moschion"><label>MOSCHION.</label> Well, in this and in other matters, <pb xml:id="v.2.p.219"/> Zeuxippus, I should be very glad to be your attentive listener. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> That is because you, Moschion, have a natural gift for philosophy, and you feel incensed at the philosopher who does not take an interest in medicine, and you are indignant that such a man should imagine it more becoming for him, in the eyes of mankind, to profess some knowledge of geometry, logical discussion, and music, than to desire to seek out and know <quote rend="blockquote">All that of evil and good may have chanced to betide in the dwelling <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> iv, 392.</note> </quote> which is his own body. And yet you will see a larger number of spectators in the theatres where money to pay for admission is distributed to those who gather together, as at Athens; and of the liberal arts medicine is inferior to none in elegance, distinction, and the satisfaction which it yields, and it gives to its students admission to something of very great importance — the preservation of their life and health. Consequently, the charge of trespass ought not to lie against philosophers if they discuss matters of health, but rather should they be blamed if they do not consider it their duty to abolish all boundarylines altogether, and to make a single field, as it were, of all honourable studies, and therein to cultivate them in common, thus aiming in their discussion at both the pleasant and the essential. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Moschion"><label>MOSCHION.</label> Well, Zeuxippus, let us say no more about Glaucus, who is so self-important that he wants to be a law unto himself, needing no help from philosophy; but do you tell us in detail the whole discussion; or, if you prefer, just those statements <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, Od. iv. 392.</note><pb xml:id="v.2.p.221"/> which you first referred to as not altogether carefully formulated, which you say Glaucus seized upon. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> Well, our companion <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch himself presumably.</note> asserted that he had heard somebody say that keeping the hands always warm, and never allowing them to get cold, is in no small measure conducive to health, and, conversely, the chilling of the extremities, by concentrating the warmth in the interior of the body, creates, as it were, a habit or a predisposition towards feverishness; and for a man to divert the substances in his body toward the surface, and to conduct and distribute them, along with the warmth, to all parts of his body, is healthful. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 635 C.</note> If therefore we happen to be doing something with our hands and using them, the motion itself brings the warmth to these parts, and keeps it there; but when not engaged in such activities we must by no means allow the cold to find lodgement in our extremities. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> This, then, was one of the things ridiculed. The second, I think, concerned the food which you people serve to the sick. For he urged that we should partake of it and taste it from time to time, and get ourselves used to it in time of health, and not abhor and detest such a regimen, like little children, but gradually make it familiar and congenial to our appetites, so that in sickness we may not be disaffected over our fare as if it were so much medicine, and may not show impatience at receiving something simple, unappetising, and savourless. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat"> Moralia</title>, 661 B.</note> For this reason, too, omitting the bath now and then before going to a meal is not a thing to be avoided, nor drinking only water when wine is at hand, nor drinking anything lukewarm in the summer-time when there is snow on the table; and while dismissing <pb xml:id="v.2.p.223"/> once for all time the ostentatious and studied abstinence from such things and the bragging over it, we should silently, by our own selves, habituate the appetite to be obedient to expediency with all serenity, and long beforehand we must rid our soul of its squeamishness in times of sickness about such trifles, and its lamentation thereat, as it deplores how it has been driven away from great and fond pleasures to an ignoble and humiliating way of living. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> Well has it been said, <q>Choose the life that is best, and constant habit will make it pleasant,</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A precept of Pythagoras according to Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 466 F, and other writers who quote it; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> also <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 602 B.</note> and, in particular, it is profitable for a man, experimenting with each several department of life and especially with those which have to do with the practices which affect the body, to inculcate a fixed habit during periods of soundest health, so thus to make these things agreeable, familiar, and congenial to his nature, <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, p. 797 E.</note> bearing in mind how some men feel and act in times of sickness, being angry and fretful when hot water and gruel, or plain bread, is served to them, calling these things abominable and unpleasant, and abominable and hard-hearted also those who would force such things upon them. A bath has proved to be the death of many men who at the outset had not much the matter with them, save only that they could not and would not bear to taste food unless they had first had their bath; of whom Titus the Emperor <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">There are varying accounts regarding the manner of Titus’s death, poisoning or drowning being also alleged.</note> was one, as those who attended him in his illness affirm. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> Something, moreover, was said to this effect, that, while the less expensive things are always more healthful for the body, we ought especially to guard against excess in eating and drinking, and against <pb xml:id="v.2.p.225"/> all self-indulgence when we have immediately on hand some festival or a visit from friends, or when we are expecting an entertainment of some king or high official with its unavoidable social engagements; and thus we should, as it were, in fair weather make our body trim and buoyant against the oncoming wind and wave. It is indeed a hard task, in the midst of company and good cheer, to keep to moderation and one’s habits and at the same time to avoid the extreme disagreeableness which makes one appear offensive and tiresome to the whole company. Therefore, to avoid adding fire to fire (as the proverb has it),<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The proverb may be found in Plato’s <title rend="italic">Laws</title>, p. 666 A, and often repeated in other writers.</note> and gorging to gorging, and strong drink to strong drink, we ought with all seriousness to imitate the polite joke of Philip. It was in this wise <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The story is repeated by Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 178 D, and referred to, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 707 B.</note>: A man had invited Philip to dinner in the country, assuming that he had but a few with him, but when later the host saw Philip bringing a great company, no great preparations having been made, he was much perturbed. Philip, becoming aware of the situation, sent word privately to each of his friends to <q>leave room for cake.</q> They, following the advice, and looking for more to come, ate sparingly of what was before them, and so the dinner was ample for all. In this manner, then, we ought to prepare ourselves in anticipation of our imperative round of social engagements by keeping room in the body for elaborate dishes and pastry, and, I dare to say it, for indulgence in strong drink also, by bringing to these things an appetite fresh and willing. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> If, however, such imperative occasions suddenly confront us when we are overloaded and in no condition for taking part — if, for instance, we receive an invitation from a high official, or guests appear, so <pb xml:id="v.2.p.227"/> that we are constrained by a false sense of shame to join company with men who are in fit condition and to drink with them — then especially, in order to combat <q>shame which works mischief for men</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The reference may be to Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> xxiv. 45 (<foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Hesiod, <title rend="italic">Works and Days,</title> 318).</note> (or rather I would call it shamefacedness), we should summon to our defence the words which Creon speaks <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Euripides, <title rend="italic">Medea</title>, 290, quoted also in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 530 C.</note> in the tragedy: <quote rend="blockquote">’Twere better, friend, to gain your hatred now Than be soft-hearted and lament anon.</quote> For to be so afraid of being thought ill-bred as to plunge oneself into a pleurisy or brain-fever is proof that one is in very truth ill-bred, possessed of neither sense nor the reason which knows how to consort with men without the wine-glass and the savour of food.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 612 F.</note> For a request to be excused, if characterized by cleverness and wit, is no less agreeable than joining in the round of gaiety; and if a man provides a banquet in the same spirit in which he provides a burnt-offering which it is forbidden to taste, and personally abstains when the wine-cup and the table are before him, at the same time volunteering cheerfully some playful allusion to himself, he will create a pleasanter impression than the man who gets drunk and gormandizes for company. Of the men of earlier times he <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Presumable Plutarch again.</note> mentioned Alexander,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. lxxv. (p. 706 C); Diodorus, xvii. 117; Athenaeus, 434 C; Arrian, <title rend="italic">Anabasis</title>, vii. 25. 1; Quintus Curtius, x. 4; Justin, xii. 13.</note> who, after a prolonged debauch, was ashamed to say no to the challenges of Medius, and abandoned himself to a fresh round of hard drinking, which cost him his life; and of the men of our time he mentioned Regulus the prize-fighter. For when Titus Caesar called him to the bath at daybreak, <pb xml:id="v.2.p.229"/> he came and bathed with him, took but one drink, they say, and died immediately from a stroke of apoplexy. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> These are the teachings which Glaucus in derision quoted aggressively to us as pedantic. The rest he was not eager to hear, nor we to tell him. But I beg that you will examine each of the several statements. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> First there is Socrates,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Memorabilia</title>, i. 3. 6; <foreign xml:lang="lat">cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title> 513 C, 521 E, and 661 F.</note> who, in urging us to be on our guard against such things to eat as persuade us to eat when we are not hungry, and such things to drink as persuade us to drink when we are not thirsty, did not absolutely forbid the use of these things; but he was instructing us to use them only if we needed them, and to make the pleasure in them serve our necessity, just as our statesmen do who turn to military uses their funds for amusements.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Perhaps a reference to Demosthenes, lix. 4, which says that in time of war all surplus funds are to be devoted to the army.</note> For that which is pleasant, in so far as it is a nutritive element, is congenial to our nature, and it is by remaining still hungry that we ought to get enjoyment from the necessary or the pleasant foods; but we should not stir up in ourselves a second and separate set of appetites after we have appeased the usual ones. And here is another consideration. Just as Socrates <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Symposium</title>, ii. 17-20; again referred to <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, 130 E and <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 711 E.</note> found dancing a not unpleasant exercise, so the man for whom pastry and sweets serve as a meal and as food suffers less injury. But when a man has satisfied the moderate demands of his nature, and has had his fill, he ought to exercise the very greatest vigilance against helping himself to such things. And in such matters, while we should be on guard against love of pleasure and gluttony, yet we should be no less on guard against vulgarity and love of notoriety. For these latter often help to persuade people to eat <pb xml:id="v.2.p.231"/> something when they are not hungry, and to drink when they are not thirsty,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Supra</foreign>, 124 D.</note> by suggesting utterly sordid and cheap conceits — that it is absurd not to take advantage of the presence of some rare and expensive thing, as, for example, sow’s udder,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">For the cruelties practised in the preparation of this highly esteemed delicacy see Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 997 A.</note> Italian mushrooms, Samian cake, or snow in Egypt. For things of this sort do indeed often induce people to use what is renowned and rare, since they are led on by empty repute as by an attractive savour, and compel their body to do its share, although it feels no need, so that they may have a tale to tell to others, and may be envied for their enjoyment of things so hard to obtain and so uncommon. Quite similar is their behaviour toward notorious women. There are times when they repose in quiet with their own wives who are both lovely and loving, but when they have paid money to a Phryne or a Laïs, although their body is in sorry state and is inclined to shirk its task, they rouse it forthwith to action, and call in licentiousness to minister to pleasure, all because of empty repute. In fact, Phryne herself, in her advancing years, said that she got a better price for her remnants because of her repute. </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> It is a great marvel if we get off unscathed, when we concede to the body only as much of pleasures as Nature in her need finds a place for, but still more so when we battle with it vigorously to thwart its appetites, and keep putting them off, and finally consent to some negotiation with such as will not be denied, or, as Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">The quotation does not appear in Plato, but Plutarch is probably summing up from memory an account of a contest with the passions such as may be found, for example, in the <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, pp. 254 ff.</note> says, <q>yield when the body bites and strains.</q> But when the case is reversed, <pb xml:id="v.2.p.233"/> and the desires descend from the mind to the body and force it to be subservient to the mind’s emotions, and to join in their excitements, there is no way to prevent their leaving as a residue the most violent and serious injuries as the aftermath of feeble and evanescent pleasures. Least of all ought the body to be stirred to pleasures by the mind’s desire, since such an origin is unnatural. Just as tickling the arm-pits so affects the mind as to produce laughter which is not natural, or even mild or happy, but convulsive and harsh, so whatsoever pleasures the body achieves through being prodded and disturbed by the mind are deranging and disturbing and foreign to Nature. Whenever, then, someone of those rare and notorious means of enjoyment is afforded us, we ought to take more pride in abstinence than in enjoyment, remembering that just as Simonides <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Repeated in more or less similar form, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 10 F and 514 F.</note> used to say that he had never been sorry for having kept silent, but many a time for having spoken, so we have never been sorry either for having put a dainty to one side, or for having drunk water instead of Falernian wine, but the opposite; not only ought Nature not to be forced, but if anything of this sort is offered her even when she has need of it, the appetite ought to be often diverted from it towards the plain and familiar food for the sake of habituation and training. <quote rend="blockquote">If one must needs do wrong,</quote> are the words of the Theban,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Eteocles in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Phoenissae</title> of Euripides, i. 524; quoted by Plutarch also in <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 18 D.</note> who is not correct in saying, far best it were <quote rend="blockquote">To do it for a kingdom’s sake.</quote><pb xml:id="v.2.p.235"/> But we can improve on this by saying that if we must needs seek repute in such matters as food and drink, <q>far best it were</q> by continence for the sake of health. Nevertheless stinginess and greediness constrain some persons, who repress and reduce their desires in their own homes, to stuff themselves and enjoy themselves with expensive things at others’ houses as though they were engaged in ruthless foraging in an enemy’s country; then they go away much indisposed, and for the next day they have an attack of indigestion to pay for their insatiable appetite.

For diseases do not take from us and spoil for us so many of our enterprises or hopes or travels or pastimes as they do of our pleasures. Hence contempt for health is least profitable for those who make pleasure their chief aim. For infirmities allow many persons to be philosophers, or actually even generals or kings, but the pleasures and enjoyments of the body in some cases do not come to life at all in time of disease, and those that come to life yield but a brief part of what they properly should, and even that is not pure, but contaminated with much that is foreign, and marked, as it were, by the beatings of surge and storm.

But when we find ourselves in this plight we try hard to stifle the thought of our wrongdoings, setting ourselves against their remembrance, and, as is the way of most people who object to this or that air or this or that locality as insalubrious when they say that they dread travelling, we exclude our intemperance and self-indulgence from the cause of our illness.

For the sting caused by such reflections keeps the memory raw, so that, like a scar that remains when the body is in health, it makes us more circumspect about our way of living. For the healthy body will not, to any immoderate extent, breed desires that are vehement, intractable, unwonted, and hard to dispossess; nay, we can boldly and confidently oppose the appetites which would fain go beyond all bounds and assault our enjoyments, knowing that their whining and whimpering is a trivial and childish manifestation, and that later, when the table is removed, they will cease repining and make no complaint nor feel themselves aggrieved, but, on the contrary, untainted and cheerful rather than dulled and nauseated by over-indulgence, await the morrow. The remark which Timotheus <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">That this story had acquired almost a fixed phraseology in the source from which Plutarch took it may be seen by comparing this passage and Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 686 A, Aelian, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Varia Historia</title>, ii. 18, Athenaeus, p. 419 d, and Cicero, <title rend="italic">Tusculan Disputations</title>, v. 35 (100).</note> made, the day after he had dined with Plato at the Academy on the simple fare of the scholar, is in point here: <q>Those who dine with Plato,</q> he said, <q>get on pleasantly the next day also.</q> And it is reported that Alexander said <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plutarch, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Moralia</title>, 180 A, 1099 C, and <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. xxii.

Without such material none of these things would cause any trouble, but they would readily fade away and be dissipated, if clear blood and an unpolluted spirit are at hand to meet the disturbance; but in a mass of superfluous food a sort of turbulent sediment, as it were, is stirred up, which makes everything foul and hard to manage and hard to get rid of. Therefore we must not act like those much admired (!) ship-masters who for greed take on a big cargo, and thenceforth are continually engaged in baling out the sea-water. So we must not stuff and overload our body, and afterwards employ purgatives and injections, but rather keep it all the time trim, so that, if ever it suffer depression, it shall, owing to its buoyancy, bob up again like a cork. </said></p> </div>

Nevertheless, some men, although their body itself all but resists and would fain drag them to their beds and their rest, are led by gluttony and self-indulgence to rush off to the baths and eagerly to join in the drinking-bouts, as if they were laying in provisions for a siege and were fearful lest the fever seize them before they have had luncheon. Others, less gross than these, are not indeed caught in this folly, but very stupidly, just because they are ashamed to admit having a headache or indigestion, and to keep their clothes on all day, when a crowd on their way to the gymnasium invite them to come along, they get up and go, strip with the others, and go through the same exercises as do those who are in sound health. But as for the majority, Hope, backed by a proverb which well accords with incontinence and weakness of purpose, persuades and induces them to get up and go recklessly to their accustomed haunts, thinking to expel and dispel wine with wine, and headache with headache.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><q>Similia similibus curentur.</q> The proverb as not been handed down in this form, but Plutarch may have in mind the proverb found in Pollux, ix. 120 (see Kock, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Com.

For if there <pb xml:id="v.2.p.247"/> is anything the matter with us, failure to take proper precaution and to put a check on ourselves will do us harm; and if nothing is the matter, it will do no harm for the body to be subjected to some restrictions and cleared of some of its encumbrances. But that childish person who is afraid to let his friends and servants discover that he is in a state of discomfort from excessive eating or drinking, will, if he is ashamed to admit having indigestion to-day, tomorrow admit having diarrhoea or fever or gripes.

For just exactly as some persons, when they are voyaging and a storm is raging, are ashamed to tarry on shore, and so they put out to sea, and then are in most shameful case, shrieking and sea-sick, so those who regard it as ignoble, amidst suspicious premonitory symptoms of their body, to spend one day in bed, and not to take their meals at table, keep to their bed most shamefully for many days, under purging and poulticing, servile and attentive to physicians, asking for wine or cold water, and suffering themselves to do and to utter many extravagant and ignoble things because of their distress and fear. </said></p>

Otherwise, just as drunken revellers who force their way into a house of mourning provide no cheerfulness or pleasure, but only cause weeping and wailing, so in a body that is in a bad condition and out of harmony with Nature, the pleasures of love, elaborate food, baths and wine, when combined with such elements in the body as are unsettled and tainted, set up phlegm and bile and bring on an upset, besides being unduly exciting, while they yield no pleasure to speak of, nor any enjoyment like what we expected. </said></p> </div>

A man ought to handle his body like the sail of a ship, and neither lower and reduce it much when no cloud is in sight, nor be slack and careless in managing it when he comes to suspect something is wrong, but he should rather ease the body off and lighten its load, as has already been said, and not wait for indigestions and diarrhoeas, nor heightened temperatures nor fits of drowsiness. And yet some people wait until a fever is already at their doors and then, being as excited as if a message or a summons to court had come, just manage to restrict themselves; whereas they ought, while these things are still afar off, to be cautious <quote rend="blockquote">Before the storm, as though along the strand The North wind blew.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="deu">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</title>, ii. p. 88.</note> </quote> </said></p> </div>

Wherefore not merely in the matter of food and exercise do we need to keep watch of our body, to see whether, contrary to its habits, it takes to these reluctantly and without zest, or at another time is thirsty and hungry in an unnatural way, but also, in the matter of sleep, to beware of lack of <pb xml:id="v.2.p.253"/> continuity and of evenness, marked by irregularities and sharp interruptions, and to beware also of the abnormal in dreams, which, if so be that our visions are improper or unwonted, argues an over-abundance or concretion of humours, or a disturbance of spirit within us. And also the emotions of the soul have often given warning that the body is perilously near disease. For instance, irrational discouragements and fears take possession of people oftentimes from no apparent cause, and suddenly extinguish their hopes; in temper they become irascible, sharp, and pained at trifles, and they are tearful and dismayed whenever bad vapours and bitter exhalations encounter and unite with the <q> rotations of the soul,</q> as Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><title rend="italic">Timaeus</title>, p. 47 D.</note> has it.

It is not a bad thing, either, to take a look at our own way of living; for if we have been engaged in a bout of drinking and eating, or in some hardships and other irregularities, and the body presents no suspicious or premonitory symptoms, nevertheless we ought to be watchful of ourselves and forestall any trouble by means of rest and quiet when fresh from the pleasures of love, or when fatigued; also by drinking water after the free use of wine and after social gaiety, and especially, after indulging in a heavy diet of meat or multifarious foods, to eat lightly, and leave no mass of superfluous residue in the body.

For it is wonderful what an exercise is the daily use of the voice in speaking aloud, conducing, not only to health, but also to strength — not the strength of the wrestler which lays on flesh and makes the exterior solid like the walls of a building, but a strength which engenders an all-pervasive vigour and a real energy in the most vital and dominant parts. That breathing gives strength the athletic trainers make clear in telling the athletes to brace themselves against the rubbing and stop their breath meantime, and keep tense the portions of the body that are being kneaded and massaged. Now the voice is a movement of the breath, and if it be given vigour, not in the throat, but, as it were, at its source in the lungs, it increases the warmth, tones down the blood, clears out every vein, opens every artery, and does not permit of any concretion or solidifying of superfluous fluid like a sediment to take place in the containing organs which take over and digest the food. For this reason we ought especially to make ourselves habituated and used to this exercise by continual speaking, or, if there be any suspicion that our body is not quite up to the mark or is somewhat fatigued, then by reading aloud or declaiming. For reading stands in the same relation to discussion as riding in a carriage to active exercise, and as though upon the vehicle of another’s words it moves softly, and carries the voice gently this way and that. But discussion adds contention and vehemence, as the mind joins in the encounter along with the body. We must, however, be cautious about passionate and convulsive vociferations. For <pb xml:id="v.2.p.259"/> spasmodic expulsion and straining of the breath produces ruptures and sprains. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> After reading or discussion, before going to walk, one should make use of rubbing with oil in a warm room to render the flesh supple, extending the massage so far as practicable to the inward parts, and gently equalizing the vital spirit and diffusing it into the extremities. Let the limits of the amount of this rubbing be what is agreeable to the senses and not discomforting. For the man who thus composes the inward disquiet and tension in his vital spirit manages the superfluous in his body without discomfort, and if unfavourable weather or some engagement prevent his going to walk, it does not matter, for Nature has received her proper due. Wherefore neither travelling nor stopping at an inn ought to be made an excuse for silence, nor even if everybody there deride one. For where it is not disgraceful to eat it is certainly not disgraceful to take exercise; nay, it is more disgraceful to feel timid and embarrassed before sailors, muleteers, and innkeepers, who do not deride the man who plays ball and goes through the movements of sparring alone, but the man who speaks, even though in his exercises he instruct, question, learn, and use his memory. Socrates said <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Xenophon, <title rend="italic">Symposium, 2. 18.</title> </note> that for a man’s movements in dancing a room that would accommodate seven persons at dinner was large enough to take exercise in, but for a man who takes his exercise through singing or speaking every place affords him adequate room for this exercise both when standing up and when lying down. But we must observe this one caution — not to strain our voices too hard <pb xml:id="v.2.p.261"/> when we are conscious of a fullness, venery, or fatigue. This is the experience of many of the public speakers and sophists, some of whom are led on by repute and ambition, others on account of emoluments or political rivalries, to competition in excess of what is best for them. Our Niger, when he was giving public lectures in Galatia, happened to swallow a fish bone. But, as another sophist from abroad had made his appearance and was lecturing, Niger, dreading to give the impression that he had yielded to his rival, still lectured although the bone was sticking in his throat; unable to bear the distress from the great and stubborn inflammation that arose, he submitted to a deep incision from the outside, and through the opening the bone was removed; but the place grew sore and purulent and caused his death. But comment on these matters may well be postponed to a later occasion. <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">Perhaps <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, 135 D.</note> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> To take a cold bath after exercising is ostentatious and juvenile rather than healthful. For the power of resistance to external influences and the hardiness which it seems to create in the body really produces a more evil effect on the inward parts by stopping up the pores, causing the fluids to collect together, and condensing the exudations which are always wanting to be released and dispersed. Besides, those who insist upon taking cold baths have to make a further change into that exact and strictly ordered way of living which we are trying to avoid, and they have to be always taking heed not to transgress this, since every shortcoming is at once bitterly brought to book. On the other hand, warm baths have much to offer by way of excuse. For they do not detract so much from vigour and strength as <pb xml:id="v.2.p.263"/> they help towards health by rendering the food yielding and soft for the digestion, and by providing for the painless dispersion of whatever escapes digestion, at least if it do not remain altogether crude and high up, and soothing any latent feelings of fatigue. However, when Nature affords us a sense of a moderate and comfortable condition in our body, the bath had better be left alone. A gentle rubbing with oil beside a fire is better, if the body require warming, for it can take for itself the requisite amount of such warmth; but the sun permits the use of its warmth at neither higher nor lower temperature than is determined by the temperature of the air. So much will suffice in regard to exercise. </said></p> </div>

It is best to accustom the body not to require meat in addition to other food. For the earth yields in abundance many things not only for nourishment but also for comfort and enjoyment, some of which it grants to our use just as they are with no trouble on our part, while others we may make savoury by all sorts of combination and preparation. But since custom has become a sort of unnatural second nature, our use of meat should not be for the satisfaction of appetite, as is the case with wolves or lions; but while we may put it in as a sort of prop and support of our diet, we should use other foods and relishes which for the body are more in accord with nature and less dulling to the reasoning faculty, which, as it were, is kindled from plain and light substances. </said></p> </div>

One ought to accustom oneself, therefore, in the course of the daily routine to partake of two or three glasses of water, thus both making the potency of the wine milder, and making the drinking of water habitual with the body, so that, whenever it comes to be in need of water, it may not feel strange towards the drink, and refuse it. For the fact is that some people feel most impelled towards wine when the drink which they most need is water. For after being exposed to the sun, and again when chilled, and after speaking more earnestly and thinking more intently than usual, and, in general, after exertions and strivings, they think they ought to drink wine, feeling that Nature requires for the body some comfort and change after labours. But Nature does not require comfort, if comfort is only a name for self-indulgence, but she does require a change, a change which puts the body in a state midway between pleasure and pain. Therefore in such circumstances there should not only be some reduction in food, but wine should be either altogether eliminated or else partaken of between times very diluted and practically engulfed by the drinking of water. For wine, being truculent and keen, intensifies the disturbances of the body, and exacerbates and irritates the contused parts, which are in need of the comfort and alleviation that water best supplies. For if, in spite of the fact that we are not thirsty, we drink hot water after undergoing exertion, strain, or heat, we are sensible of a relaxing and soothing effect within us; for the aqueous fluid is mild and does not quicken the pulse, <pb xml:id="v.2.p.269"/> whereas that of wine has great impetuosity and a potency that is not kindly or humanely disposed toward recent affections. As for the acerbities and bitterness which some say fasting engenders in the body, if anybody fears them, or if, childlike, he thinks it a dreadful thing not to have a meal served before the fever which he suspects is coming, the drinking of water is a very fitting middle course. In fact we frequently make to Dionysus himself offerings which include no wine, thus habituating ourselves quite properly not to be always looking for strong drink. Minos, too, because of grief, abolished the flute and garland from the sacrifice.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Apollodorus, <title rend="italic" xml:lang="lat">Bibliotheca</title>, iii. 15. 7.</note> Yet we know that a grieving soul is not affected either by garlands or by flute.

But as for ourselves, we shall follow the advice of the physicians who recommend always to let some time intervene between dinner and sleep, and not, after jumbling our victuals into our body and oppressing our spirit, to hinder our digestion at once with the food that is still unassimilated and fermenting, but rather to provide for it some respite and relaxation; just as those who think it is the right thing to keep their bodies moving after dinner do not do this by means of foot-races and strenuous boxing and wrestling, but by gentle walking and decorous dancing, so we shall hold that we ought not to distract our minds after dinner either with business or cares or pseudo-learned disputations, which have as their goal an ostentatious or stirring rivalry. But many of the problems of natural science are light and enticing, and there are many stories which contain ethical considerations and the <q> soul’s satisfaction,</q> as Homer has phrased this, and nothing repellent.

In view of the two opinions a man might appear properly to attain both results who after dinner keeps his body warm and quiet, and does not let his mind sink at once into sleep and idleness, but, as has been previously suggested, <note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Supra</foreign> 130 A-E.</note> lightly diverts and enlivens his spirits by talking himself and listening to another on one of the numerous topics which are agreeable and not acrimonious or depressing. </said></p> </div>

The harmfulness in all this is manifest; for both procedures give rise to disorders and convulsive movements in the <pb xml:id="v.2.p.277"/> body. What is peculiarly bad in the use of an emetic is that it increases and fosters an insatiate greediness. For the feelings of hunger become rough and turbulent, like rivers that are interrupted in their course, and they gulp the food down violently, always ravening and resembling not appetites that need victuals, but inflammations that need medicines and poultices. For this reason the pleasures that lay hold upon such persons are swift in their action and imperfect, and attended by much palpitation and agitation while being experienced, and these are succeeded by distensions and sharp pains in the passages, and retention of gases, which cannot wait for the natural movements, but stay in the upper part of the body as in water-logged ships which require the jettisoning of their cargo, not merely of their surplus. The violent disturbances lower down in the bowels resulting from medication, by decomposing and liquefying the existing contents, increase rather than relieve the overcrowding. Just imagine that anybody, feeling much troubled at the crowd of Greeks living in his city, should fill up the city with Arab and Scythian immigrants! Yet it is just this radical mistake that some people make in connexion with the expulsion of the surplus of habitual and familiar foods, when they introduce into the body from the outside Cnidian berries, scammony, or other incongruous and drastic agents, which have more need of being purged away than power of purging our nature. It is best, therefore, by moderate and temperate living to make the body constantly selfsufficient and well adjusted as regards filling the stomach and emptying it. </said></p>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> If ever absolute necessity befall us, vomiting <pb xml:id="v.2.p.279"/> should be induced without medication and a great ado, and without causing any disturbance beyond merely avoiding indigestion by at once allowing the excess to be peacefully ejected. Just as linen cleansed with lye and washing powders wears out faster than that washed in plenty of water, so vomitings with drugs maltreat and ruin the body. If the bowels are getting sluggish, there is no medicine like some sorts of food that afford a mild stimulus to the inclinations and gently dissolve the cause of trouble. Experience with these is familiar to all, and their use is not attended by discomfort. But if it will not yield to these, the drinking of water for several days, or fasting, or an enema, should be tried next rather than disturbing and pernicious dosing to which most people hurriedly resort, after the manner of licentious women who employ drugs and instruments to produce abortion for the sake of the enjoyment of conceiving again. </said></p> </div>

However, to speak once again of those too exact persons who interject set periods of fasting according to a fixed schedule, they are wrong in teaching their nature to feel a need of restraint when not in need of it, and in making necessary the unnecessary retrenchment at a time which makes demand for what is customarily required. It is better to apply such discipline to the body with a certain freedom, and, if there be no premonitory or suspicious symptoms, to keep, as has been already suggested,<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Supra</foreign>, 128 E.</note> our general mode of life responsive to changes so as to meet whatever may befall it, and not to let it be enslaved or bound to one formula of life, which has trained itself to be guided by certain <pb xml:id="v.2.p.281"/> seasons, or numbers, or schedules. For it is not safe, nor easy, nor befitting a citizen or a man, but like the life of an oyster or the trunk of a tree — this immutability and forced compliance in the matter of food and abstinence, movement and rest; it is fitting only for men who have reduced and restricted themselves to a retired, idle, solitary, friendless, and inglorious life, far removed from the duties of citizenship. <q>No,</q> said he, <q>it fits not with my opinion.</q> <note place="unspecified" anchored="true">A paraphrase of Homer, <title rend="italic">Il.</title> ix. 108.</note> </said></p> </div>

For a man in good health could not devote himself to any better object than to numerous humane activities. Least of all is it to be assumed that laziness is healthful, if it destroys what health aims at; and it is not true either that inactive people are more healthy. For Xenocrates did not keep in better health than Phocion, nor Theophrastus than Demetrius, and the running away from every activity that smacked of ambition did not help Epicurus and his followers at all to attain their much-talked-of condition of perfect bodily health. But we ought, by attention to other details, to preserve the natural constitution of our bodies, recognizing that every life has room for both disease and health. </said></p>

At any rate, the body reaps the fruit of more evils from the soul than the soul from the body, inasmuch as the soul uses the body unreasonably, and the body does not get the care that it deserves.

But, on the other hand, in the soul the licentious and unmannerly element, immediately after undergoing hardships, is carried away, as sailors are, by wantonness to pleasures and enjoyments, and, after the pleasures, it is again coerced to tasks and business; and the result is that it does not allow Nature to attain the composure and calm which she needs most, but deranges and disturbs her because of this irregularity. But people who have sense are least given to proffering pleasures to the body when it is busied with labours. For they have absolutely no need, nor even recollection, of such things, inasmuch as they are keeping their thoughts intent on the good to be accomplished by their activity; and by the joy or earnestness in their souls they completely dwarf their other desires. There is a jocose remark attributed to Epameinondas in regard to a good man who fell ill and died about the time of the battle of Leuctra: <q>Great Heavens! How did he find time to die when there was so much going on?</q> This may be repeated with truth in the case of a man who has in hand some public activity or philosophic meditation: <q>What time has this man now for indigestion or drunkenness or carnal desires?</q> But when such men find themselves again at leisure following upon their activities, they compose and rest their bodies, guarding against and avoiding useless toils, and more especially unnecessary pleasures, on the ground that they are inimical to Nature. </said></p> </div>

<p rend="indent"><said who="#Zeuxippus" rend="merge"><label>ZEUXIPPUS.</label> In regard to food and drink it is expedient to note what kinds are wholesome rather than what are pleasant, and to be better acquainted with those that are good in the stomach rather than in the mouth, and those that do not disturb the digestion rather than those that greatly tickle the palate. For to inquire of a physician what is hard or easy for oneself to digest, and what is constipating or laxative, is no less disgraceful than to inquire what is sweet and what is bitter and what is sour. But nowadays people correct the chefs, being expert at detecting what dish has in it more sweetening or salt or sourness than is proper; but they do not themselves know what, when taken into their own bodies, will be light and painless and beneficial. Therefore, a mistake is not often made in seasoning a soup at their houses, but by their vile and pernicious seasoning of themselves every day they provide a plentiful business <pb xml:id="v.2.p.291"/> for the physicians. Now such persons do not regard the sweetest soup as the best, but they mix in also bitter and pungent flavourings; on the other hand, they inject into the body numerous cloying pleasures, partly from ignorance, and partly because they do not remember that to whatever is healthful and beneficial nature adds a pleasure which causes neither pain nor repentance.
