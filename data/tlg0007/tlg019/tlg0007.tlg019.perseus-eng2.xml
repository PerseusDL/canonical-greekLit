<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The first chapter has been transposed to serve as Introduction to both the <title>Timoleon</title> and the<title>Aemilius Paulus</title>.</note> That the Aemilii were one of the ancient and patrician houses at Rome, most writers agree. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And that the first of them, and the one who gave his surname to the family, was Mamercus, a son of Pythagoras the philosopher, who received the surname of Aemilius for the <gloss>grace</gloss><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch suggests the identity of the Latin Aemilius with the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱμύλιος</foreign> (<gloss>winning</gloss>). Cf. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.56"> <title>Odyssey</title>, i. 56.</bibl> </note> and charm of his discourse, is the statement of some of those writers who hold that Pythagoras was the educator of Numa the king.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the <bibl n="Plut. Num. 1.2"> <title>Numa</title>, i. 2 f.</bibl> </note> </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Now, most of this family who rose to distinction by their cultivation of virtue, were blessed with good fortune; and in the case of Lucius Paulus, his misfortune at Cannae gave testimony alike to his wisdom and valour. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For when he could not dissuade his colleague from giving battle, he took part with him in the struggle, though reluctantly, but would not be a partner in his flight; nay, though the one who had brought on the peril left him in the lurch, he himself kept his post and died fighting the enemy.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">See the <bibl n="Plut. Fab. 14.1"> <title>Fabius Maximus</title>, chapters xiv.</bibl> and <bibl n="Plut. Fab. 16.1">xvi.</bibl> </note> </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>This Paulus had a daughter, Aemilia, who was the wife of Scipio the Great, and a son, Aemilius Paulus, whose Life I now write. He came of age at a time which abounded in men of the greatest reputation and most illustrious virtue, and yet he was a conspicuous figure, although he did not pursue the same studies as the young nobles of the time, nor set out on his career by the same path. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>For he did not practise pleading private cases in the courts, and refrained altogether from the salutations and greetings and friendly attentions to which most men cunningly resorted when they tried to win the favour of the people by becoming their zealous servants; not that he was naturally incapable of either, but he sought to acquire for himself what was better than both, namely, a reputation arising from valour, justice, and trustworthiness. In these virtues he at once surpassed his contemporaries. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>At all events, when he sued for the first of the high offices in the state, the aedileship, he was elected over twelve competitors,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 192 B.C.</note> all of whom, we are told, afterwards became consuls. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Moreover, when he was made one of the priests called Augurs, whom the Romans appoint as guardians and overseers of the art of divination from the flight of birds and from omens in the sky, he so carefully studied the ancestral customs of the city, and so thoroughly understood the religious ceremonial of the ancient Romans, that his priestly function, </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>which men had thought to be a kind of honour, sought merely on account of the reputation which it gave, was made to appear one of the higher arts, and testified in favour of those philosophers who define religion as the science of the worship of the gods. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For all the duties of this office were performed by him with skill and care, and he laid aside all other concerns when he was engaged in these, omitting nothing and adding nothing new, but ever contending even with his colleagues about the small details of ceremony, and explaining to them that, although the Deity was held to be good-natured and slow to censure acts of negligence, still, for the city at least it was a grievous thing to overlook and condone them; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>for no man begins at once with a great deed of lawlessness to disturb the civil polity, but those who remit their strictness in small matters break down also the guard that has been set over greater matters. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>Furthermore, he showed a like severity in scrutinising and preserving his country’s military customs and traditions also, not courting popular favour when he was in command, nor yet, as most men did at this time, courting a second command during his first by gratifying his soldiers and treating them with mildness; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>but, like a priest of other dread rites, he explained thoroughly all the details of military custom and was a terror to disobedient transgressors, and so restored his country to her former greatness, considering the conquest of his enemies hardly more than an accessory to the training of his fellow-citizens. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>After the Romans had gone to war with Antiochus the Great, and while their most experienced commanders were employed against him, another war arose in the West, and there were great commotions in Spain. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For this war Aemilius was sent out as praetor,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 191 B.C.</note> not with the six lictors which praetors usually have, but adding other six to that number, so that his office had a consular dignity. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Well, then, he defeated the Barbarians in two pitched battles, and slew about thirty thousand of them; and it would seem that his success was conspicuously due to his generalship, since by choosing favourable ground and by crossing a certain river he made victory easy for his soldiers; moreover, he made himself master of two hundred and fifty cities, which yielded to him of their own accord. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>He left the province in peace and bound by pledges of fidelity, and came back to Rome, nor was he richer by a single drachma from his expedition. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And, indeed, in all other ways he was a rather indifferent money-maker, and spent generously and without stint of his substance. But this was not large; indeed, after his death it barely sufficed to meet the dowry due to his wife. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>He married Papiria, a daughter of Maso, who was a man of consular dignity, and after he had lived with her a long time he divorced her, although she had made him father of most glorious sons; for she it was who bore him that most illustrious Scipio, and Fabius Maximus. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>No documentary grounds for the divorce have come down to us, but there would seem to be some truth in a story told about divorce, which runs as follows. A Roman once divorced his wife, and when his friends admonished him, saying: </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><q type="spoken">Is she not discreet? is she not beautiful? is she not fruitful?</q> he held out his shoe (the Romans call it <foreign xml:lang="lat">calceus</foreign>), saying: <q type="spoken">Is this not handsome? is it not new? but no one of you can tell me where it pinches my foot?</q> </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For, as a matter of fact, it is great and notorious faults that separate many wives from their husbands; but the slight and frequent frictions arising from some unpleasantness or incongruity of characters, unnoticed as they may be by everybody else, also produce incurable alienations in those whose lives are linked together. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>So then Aemilius, having divorced Papiria, took another wife; and when she had borne him two sons he kept these at home, but the sons of his former wife he introduced into the greatest houses and the most illustrious families, the elder into that of Fabius Maximus, who was five times consul, while the younger was adopted by the son of Scipio Africanus, his cousin-german, who gave him the name of Scipio. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Of the daughters of Aemilius, one became the wife of the son of Cato, and the other of Aelius Tubero, a man of the greatest excellence, and one who, more than any other Roman, combined the greatest dignity with poverty. For there were sixteen members of the family, all Aelii; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>and they had a very little house, and one little farm sufficed for all, where they maintained one home together with many wives and children. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Among these wives lived also the daughter of that Aemilius who had twice been consul and twice had celebrated a triumph, and she was not ashamed of her husband’s poverty, but admired the virtue that kept him poor. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Brethren and kinsmen of the present day, however, unless zones and rivers and walls divide their inheritances and wide tracts of land separate them from one another, are continually quarrelling. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>These, then, are considerations and examples which history presents to those who are willing to profit by them. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Aemilius, then, having been appointed consul,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 182 B.C.</note> made an expedition against the Ligurians along the Alps, whom some call also Ligustines, a warlike and spirited folk, and one whose proximity to the Romans was teaching it skill in war. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For they occupy the extremities of Italy that are bounded by the Alps, and those parts of the Alps themselves that are washed by the Tuscan sea and face Africa, and they are mingled with Gauls and the Iberians of the coast. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>At that time they had also laid hold of the sea with piratical craft, and were robbing and destroying merchandise, sailing out as far as the pillars of Hercules. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Accordingly, when Aemilius came against them, they withstood him with a force of forty thousand men; but he, with eight thousand men all told, engaged their fivefold numbers, and after routing them and shutting them up in their walled towns, gave them humane and conciliatory terms; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>for it was not the wish of the Romans to extirpate altogether the Ligurian nation, since it lay like a barrier or bulwark against the movements of the Gauls, who were always threatening to descend upon Italy. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Accordingly, putting faith in Aemilius, they delivered their ships and cities into his hands. Their cities he restored to them, either doing them no harm at all, or simply razing their walls; but he took away all their ships, and left them no boat that carried more than three oars; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>he also restored to safety those whom they had taken captive by land or sea, and these were found to be many, both Romans and foreigners. Such, then, were the conspicuous achievements of this first consulship. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>Afterwards he often made it clear that he was desirous of a second consulship, and once actually announced his candidacy, but when he was passed by and not elected, he made no further efforts to obtain the office, giving his attention to his duties as augur, and training his sons, not only in the native and ancestral discipline in which he himself had been trained, but also, and with greater ardour, in that of the Greeks. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>For not only the grammarians and philosophers and rhetoricians, but also the modellers and painters, the overseers of horses and dogs, and the teachers of the art of hunting, by whom the young men were surrounded, were Greeks. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>And the father, unless some public business prevented, would always be present at their studies and exercises, for he was now become the fondest parent in Rome. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As to public affairs, that was the period when the Romans were at war with Perseus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">171-168 B.C.</note> the king of Macedonia, and were taking their generals to task because their inexperience and cowardice led them to conduct their campaigns ridiculously and disgracefully, and to suffer more harm than they inflicted. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For the people which had just forced Antiochus, surnamed the Great, to retire from the rest of Asia, driven him over the Taurus mountains, and shut him up in Syria, where he had been content to buy terms with a payment of fifteen thousand talents; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>which had a little while before set the Greeks free from Macedonia by crushing Philip in Thessaly; and which had utterly subdued Hannibal, to whom no king was comparable for power or boldness; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>this people thought it unendurable that they should be compelled to contend with Perseus as though he were an even match for Rome, when for a long time already he had carried on his war against them with the poor remains of his father’s routed army; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>for they were not aware that after his defeat Philip had made the Macedonian armies far more vigorous and warlike than before. This situation I will briefly explain from the beginning. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Antigonus, who was the most powerful of Alexander’s generals and successors, and acquired for himself and his line the title of King, had a son Demetrius, and his son was Antigonus surnamed Gonatas. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>His son in turn was Demetrius, who, after reigning himself for a short time, died, leaving a son Philip still in his boyhood. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>The leading Macedonians, fearing the anarchy which might result, called in Antigonus, a cousin of the dead king, and married him to Philip’s mother, calling him first regent and general, and then, finding his rule moderate and conducive to the general good, giving him the title of King. He received the surname of Doson, which implied that he was given to promising but did not perform his engagements. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>After him Philip succeeded to the throne, and, though still a youth, flowered out in the qualities which most distinguish kings, and led men to believe that he would restore Macedonia to her ancient dignity, and that he, and he alone, would check the power of Rome, which already extended over all the world. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>But after he was defeated in a great battle at Scotussa by Titus Flamininus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 197 B.C. The battle is usually named from a range of hills near Scotussa called Cynoscephalae. See the <bibl n="Plut. Flam. 3.1"> <title>Flamininus</title>, chapters iii.</bibl> and <bibl n="Plut. Flam. 4.1">iv.</bibl> </note> for a time he took a humble posture, entrusted all his interests to the Romans, and was content to come off with a moderate fine. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Afterwards, however, his condition oppressed him, and thinking that to reign by favour of the Romans was more the part of a captive satisfied with meat and drink than of a man possessed of courage and spirit, he turned his thoughts to war, and made his arrangements for it in secrecy and with cunning. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Thus, those of his cities which lay on the highroads and the seashore he suffered to become weak and rather desolate, so as to awaken contempt, while in the interior he was collecting a large force; he also filled the fortresses, strongholds, and cities of the interior with an abundance of arms, money, and men fit for service, in this way preparing himself for the war, and yet keeping it hidden away, as it were, and concealed. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Thus, he had arms to equip thirty thousand men laid up in reserve, eight million bushels of grain had been immured in his strongholds, and a sum of money sufficient to maintain for ten years ten thousand mercenaries fighting in defence of the country. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>But Philip, before he could put these plans and preparations into effect, died of grief and anguish of mind<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 179 B.C.</note>; for he came to know that he had unjustly put to death one of his sons, Demetrius, on false charges made by the other, who was his inferior. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>The son, however, whom he left, Perseus, along with his father’s kingdom, inherited his hatred of the Romans, but was not equal to the burden because of the littleness and baseness of his character, in which, among all sorts of passions and distempers, avarice was the chief trait. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>And it is said that he was not even a true-born son, but that Philip’s wife took him at his birth from his mother, a certain sempstress, an Argive woman named Gnathaenion, and passed him off as her own. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>And this was the chief reason, as it would seem, why he feared Demetrius and compassed his death, lest the royal house having a true-born heir to the throne, should uncover his own spurious birth. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>However, although he was ignoble and mean, the strength of his position led him to undertake the war, and he kept up the struggle for a long time, repulsing Roman commanders of consular rank with great armies and fleets, and actually conquering some of them. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Publius Licinius, for example, who was the first that invaded Macedonia, he routed in a cavalry battle, slew twenty-five hundred good men, and took six hundred prisoners besides; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>then he made an unexpected attack upon the Roman fleet which was lying at anchor near Oreus, seized twenty ships of burden with their cargoes, and sank the rest together with the grain that filled them; he also made himself master of four quinqueremes. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>He fought a second battle, too, in which he repulsed the consul Hostilius as he was trying to force his way into Macedonia at Elimiae; and after Hostilius had broken into the country undetected by way of Thessaly, he gave him a challenge to battle which he was afraid to accept. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Furthermore, as a side issue of the war, he made an expedition against the Dardanians, implying that he ignored the Romans and that time hung heavy on his hands; he cut to pieces ten thousand of the Barbarians and drove off much booty. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>He also secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Bisternae, an equestrian host and warlike; and he invited the Illyrians, through Genthius their king, to take part with him in the war. And a report prevailed that the Barbarians had been hired by him to pass through lower Gaul, along the coast of the Adriatic, and make an incursion into Italy. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>When the Romans learned of these things, they decided that they would bid good-bye to the favours and promises of those who wanted to be generals, and themselves summon to the leadership a man of wisdom who understood how to manage great affairs. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>This man was Paulus Aemilius, now advanced in life and about sixty years of age, but in the prime of bodily vigour, and hedged about with youthful sons and sons-in-law, and with a host of friends and kinsmen of great influence, all of whom urged him to give ear to the people when it summoned him to the consulship. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>At first he was for declining the appeals of the multitude, and tried to avert their eager importunities, saying that he did not want office; but when they came daily to his house and called him forth into the forum and pressed him with their clamours, he yielded; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>and when he presented himself at once among the candidates for the consulship, he did not appear to come into the Campus in order to get office, but as one who brought victory and might in war and offered them to the citizens. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>With such eager hopes did all receive him, and they made him consul for the second time,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 168 B.C.</note> and did not permit a lot to be cast for the provinces, as was the custom, but at once voted him the conduct of the Macedonian war. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>It was the custom for those who obtained the consulship to return thanks, as it were, for the great favour in a friendly speech to the people from the rostra; but Aemilius, having gathered an assembly of the citizens, said he had sued for his first consulship because he himself wanted office, but for his second because they wanted a general; </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>wherefore he was under no obligation to them; on the contrary, if they thought the war would be carried on better by another, he resigned the conduct of it; but if they had confidence in him they must not make themselves his colleagues in command, nor indulge in rhetoric about the war, but quietly furnish the necessary supplies for it, since, if they sought to command their commander, their campaigns would be still more ridiculous than they were already. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>By these words he inspired the citizens with great reverence for himself, and with great expectations of the future, and all were glad that they had passed by the flatterers and chosen a general who had resolution and frankness of speech. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Now, that Aemilius Paulus, after setting out upon his campaign, had a fortunate voyage and an easy passage and came speedily and safely to the Roman camp, I attribute to the favour of Heaven; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>but when I see that the war under his command was brought to an end partly by his fierce courage, partly by his excellent plans, partly by the eager assistance of his friends, and partly by his resolute adoption of fitting conclusions in times of danger, I cannot assign his remarkable and brilliant success to his celebrated good fortune, as I can in the case of other generals. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Unless, indeed, it be said that the avaricious conduct of Perseus was good fortune for Aemilius, since it utterly subverted the great and brilliant prospects of the Macedonians for the war (wherein their hopes ran high), because Perseus played the coward with his money. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For there came to him from the Bisternae, at his request, ten thousand horsemen with ten thousand men to run at their sides, all professional soldiers, men who knew not how to plough or to sail the seas, who did not follow the life of herdsmen, but who were ever practising one business and one art, that of fighting and conquering their antagonists. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And when these had encamped in Maedica and mingled with the soldiers of the king,—men of lofty stature, admirable in their discipline, great boasters, and loud in their threats against their enemies,—they inspired the Macedonians with courage and a belief that the Romans could not withstand them, but would be utterly terrified by their looks and movements, which were strange and repulsive. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But after Perseus had disposed the feelings of his men in this way and filled them with so great hopes, upon being asked to pay each captain of the mercenaries a thousand pieces, he was bewildered and crazed at the amount of gold required, and out of parsimony renounced and abandoned the alliance, as if he were a steward, rather than a foe, of the Romans, and was to give an exact account of his expenditures for the war to those against whom he waged it; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>and yet he had his foes to give him lessons, for, apart from their other preparations, they had a hundred thousand men assembled and ready for their needs. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>But he, though contending against so large a force, and in a war where such large reserves were maintained, measured out his gold and sealed it up in bags, as afraid to touch it as if it had belonged to others. 
</p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>And this he did although he was no Lydian or Phoenician born, but laid claim to a share in the virtues of Alexander and Philip, whose descendant he was,—men who mastered the world through their belief that empire was to be bought with money, not money with empire. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>At all events, it was a common saying that the cities of Greece were taken, not by Philip, but by Philip’s money. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>But Perseus would not consent to pour out his gold upon himself, his children, and his kingdom, and thus purchase salvation with a small part of his treasures, but chose to be carried with many treasures as the wealthy captive, and to show the Romans how much he had saved and watched for them. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>For he not only sent away the Gauls after playing them false, but also, after inducing Genthius the Illyrian, on payment of three hundred talents, to assist him in the war, he showed to the king’s messengers the money all counted out, and suffered them to put their seals upon the bags; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>then, when Genthius, convinced that he had the price he had asked, committed a dreadful and impious deed, arresting and imprisoning a Roman embassy that had been sent to him, Perseus, thinking that the money was no longer needed to make Genthius an enemy of Rome, since before getting it he had given a lasting earnest of his hatred and had involved himself in the war by the great wrong which he had done, </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But Aemilius was a man who clung to his purpose, and tested every plan and method of attack; seeing, however, that his army, by reason of their former license, was impatient of delay, and inclined to dictate to their general many impracticable things, he rebuked them, and instructed them to take no thought or concern for anything, except how each man might keep himself and his armour in readiness for action, and ply his sword in Roman fashion, when their general gave them the opportunity. </p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Furthermore, he ordered the night watchmen to keep watch without their spears, with the idea that they would be more on the alert and would struggle more successfully against sleep, if they were unable to defend themselves against their enemies when they approached. </p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But his men were annoyed especially by the lack of drinking water, since only a little of it issued forth and collected in pools at the very edge of the sea, and that was bad. Aemilius, therefore, seeing that the lofty and wooded mountain of Olympus lay near, and judging from the greenness of its trees that there were veins of water coursing under ground, dug a number of vents and wells for them along the foot of the mountain. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>At all events, those places which are dug open gush and flow more freely in response to such manipulation, just as the breasts of women do in response to sucking, because they moisten and soften the vapours; </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Among those present at the council, Scipio, surnamed Nasica, a son-in-law of Scipio Africanus, and afterwards of the greatest influence in the senate, was first to offer himself as leader of the enveloping force.

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>But when his soldiers had taken supper and darkness had come, he told his chief officers his real design, and then led his forces by night in the opposite direction, away from the sea, and halted below the Pythium, where he gave his army a rest. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Though Perseus was confounded at this, he did not move his camp, but sent out ten thousand foreign mercenaries and two thousand Macedonians under Milo, with orders to make haste and occupy the passes. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>In the number of his men, then, he was superior where he was, and they would fight with great ardour in defence of their wives and children, and with their king beholding all their actions and risking life in their behalf. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>After this, he ordered his foremost troops, who were in sight of the enemy, to form into cohorts and give the appearance of a battle line, while the others, wheeling to the rear, dug trenches and marked out a camp. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>The Romans, according to their custom, tried to call her light back by the clashing of bronze utensils and by holding up many blazing fire-brands and torches towards the heavens; the Macedonians, however, did nothing of this sort, but amazement and terror possessed their camp, and a rumour quietly spread among many of them that the portent signified an eclipse of a king. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Now, Aemilius was not altogether without knowledge and experience of the irregularities of eclipses, which, at fixed periods, carry the moon in her course into the shadow of the earth and conceal her from sight, until she passes beyond the region of shadow and reflects again the light of the sun; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>however, since he was very devout and given to sacrifices and divination, as soon as he saw the moon beginning to emerge from the shadow, he sacrificed eleven heifers to her. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>And as soon as it was day, he sacrificed as many as twenty oxen to Hercules without getting favourable omens; but with the twenty-first victim the propitious signs appeared and indicated victory if they stood on the defensive. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>First the Thracians advanced, whose appearance, Nasica says, was most terrible,—men of lofty stature, clad in tunics which showed black beneath the white and gleaming armour of their shields and greaves, and tossing high on their right shoulders battle-axes with heavy iron heads. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Next to the Thracians, the mercenaries advanced to the attack; their equipment was of every variety, and Paeonians were mingled with them. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>And with such boldness and swiftness did they advance that the first to be slain fell only two furlongs from the Roman camp. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As the attack began, Aemilius came up and found that the Macedonian battalions had already planted the tips of their long spears in the shields of the Romans, who were thus prevented from reaching them with their swords. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And when he saw that the rest of the Macedonian troops also were drawing their targets from their shoulders round in front of them, and with long spears sat at one level were withstanding his shield-bearing troops, and saw too the strength of their interlocked shields and the fierceness of their onset, amazement and fear took possession of him, and he felt that he had never seen a sight more fearful; often in after times he used to speak of his emotions at that time and of what he saw. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But then, showing to his soldiers a glad and cheerful countenance, he rode past them without helmet or breastplate. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>The king of the Macedonians, on the other hand, according to Polybius, as soon as the battle began, played the coward and rode back to the city, under pretence of sacrificing to Heracles, a god who does not accept cowardly sacrifices from cowards, nor accomplish their unnatural prayers. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For it is not in the nature of things that he who makes no shot should hit the mark exactly, or that he who does not hold his ground should win the day, or, in a word, that he who does nothing should be successful in what he does, or that a wicked man should be prosperous. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But the god listened to the prayers of Aemilius, who kept wielding his spear as he prayed for might and victory, and fought as he invited the god to fight with him. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>However, a certain Poseidonius, who says he lived in those times and took part in those actions, and who has written a history of Perseus in several books, says it was not out of cowardice, nor with the excuse of the sacrifice, that the king went away, but because on the day before the battle a horse had kicked him on the leg. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>He says further that in the battle, although he was in a wretched plight, and although his friends tried to deter him, the king ordered a pack-horse to be brought to him, mounted it, and joined his troops in the phalanx without a breastplate; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>and that among the missiles of every sort which were flying on all sides, a javelin made entirely of iron smote him, not touching him with its point, indeed, but coursing along his left side with an oblique stroke, and the force of its passage was such that it tore his tunic and made a dark red bruise upon his flesh, the mark of which remained for a long time. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>This, then, is what Poseidonius says in defence of Perseus. </p></div></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The Romans, when they attacked the Macedonian phalanx, were unable to force a passage, and Salvius, the commander of the Pelignians, snatched the standard of his company and hurled it in among the enemy. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Then the Pelignians, since among the Italians it is an unnatural and flagrant thing to abandon a standard, rushed on towards the place where it was, and dreadful losses were inflicted and suffered on both sides. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For the Romans tried to thrust aside the long spears of their enemies with their swords, or to crowd them back with their shields, or to seize and put them by with their very hands; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>while the Macedonians, holding them firmly advanced with both hands, and piercing those who fell upon them, armour and all, since neither shield nor breastplate could resist the force of the Macedonian long spear, hurled headlong back the Pelignians and Marrucinians, who, with no consideration but with animal fury rushed upon the strokes that met them, and a certain death. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>When the first line had thus been cut to pieces, those arrayed behind them were beaten back; and though there was no flight, still they retired towards the mountain called Olocrus, </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>so that even Aemilius, as Poseidonius tells us, when he saw it, rent his garments. For this part of his army was retreating, and the rest of the Romans were turning aside from the phalanx, which gave them no access to it, but confronted them as it were with a dense barricade of long spears, and was everywhere unassailable. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>But the ground was uneven, and the line of battle so long that shields could not be kept continuously locked together, and Aemilius therefore saw that the Macedonian phalanx was getting many clefts and intervals in it, as is natural when armies are large and the efforts of the combatants are diversified; portions of it were hard pressed, and other portions were dashing forward. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Thereupon he came up swiftly; and dividing up his cohorts, ordered them to plunge quickly into the interstices and empty spaces in the enemy’s line and thus come to close quarters, not fighting a single battle against them all, but many separate and successive battles. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>These instructions being given by Aemilius to his officers, and by his officers to the soldiers, as soon as they got between the ranks of the enemy and separated them, they attacked some of them in the flank where their armour did not shield them, </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>These made a goodly number of brave men, and making their way with one impulse through the rest, they put themselves under his lead and fell upon the enemy. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>All the rest were met by their servants with torches and conducted with joyful shouts to their tents, which were ablaze with light and adorned with wreaths of ivy and laurel; but Aemilius their general was a prey to great sorrow. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And all this is made credible by that which has happened in our time.

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>When, however, the author of the story was sought, none could be found, but it eluded all pursuit from one man to another, and finally disappeared in the limitless throng, as in a yawning sea, and was seen to have no sure source.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26"> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>But to resume, Gnaeus Octavius, the admiral of Aemilius, came to anchor off Samothrace, and while he allowed Perseus to enjoy asylum, out of respect to the gods, he took means to prevent him from escaping by sea. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For day was beginning to dawn, and so, bereft of every hope, he fled back to the fortress with his wife, before the Romans could prevent him, though they saw him. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para" resp="editor"/>Accordingly, having most confidence in Nasica, he called for him; but since Nasica was not there, after bewailing his misfortune and carefully weighing the necessity under which he lay, he gave himself into the power of Gnaeus, thus making it most abundantly clear that his avarice was a less ignoble evil than the love of life that was in him, and that led him to deprive himself of the only thing which Fortune cannot take away from the fallen, namely, pity. </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>For when at his request he was brought to Aemilius, Aemilius saw in him a great man whose fall was due to the resentment of the gods and his own evil fortune, and rose up and came to meet him, accompanied by his friends, and with tears in his eyes; </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>but Perseus, a most shameful sight, after throwing himself prone before him and then clasping his knees, broke out into ignoble cries and supplications.

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p><q type="spoken">Why, wretched man, dost thou free Fortune from thy strongest indictment against her, by conduct which will make men think that thy misfortunes are not undeserved, and that thy former prosperity, rather than thy present lot, was beyond thy deserts?</q> </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Then he began to discourse of Fortune and of human affairs, saying: <q type="spoken">Is it, then, fitting that one who is mortal should be emboldened when success comes to him, and have high thoughts because he has subdued a nation, or a city, or a kingdom? or should his thoughts dwell rather on this reversal of fortune, which sets before the warrior an illustration of the weakness that is common to all men, and teaches him to regard nothing as stable or safe?</q> </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Or, when the succession of Alexander, who attained the highest pinnacle of power and won the greatest might, has fallen in the space of a single hour and has been put beneath your feet, or when you see kings who but just now were surrounded by so many myriads of infantry and thousands of cavalry, receiving from their enemy’s hands the food and drink requisite for the day, can you suppose that we ourselves have any guarantee from Fortune that will avail against the attacks of time?</q> </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Many such words were uttered by Aemilius, we are told, and he sent the young men away with their vainglorious insolence and pride well curbed by his trenchant speech, as by a bridle. </p></div></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>It was only the books of the king that he allowed his sons, who were devoted to learning, to choose out for themselves, and when he was distributing rewards for valour in the battle, he gave Aelius Tubero, his son-in-law, a bowl of five pounds weight. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36"> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Aemilius, notwithstanding, rightly considering that men have need of bravery and courage, not only against arms and long spears, but against every onset of Fortune as well, so adapted and adjusted the mingled circumstances of his lot that the bad was lost sight of in the good, and his private sorrow in the public welfare, thus neither lowering the grandeur nor sullying the dignity of his victory. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>He said, namely, that he had never dreaded any human agency, but among agencies that were divine he had ever feared Fortune, believing her to be a most untrustworthy and variable thing; and since in this war particularly she had attended his undertakings like a prosperous gale, as it were, he had never ceased to expect some change and some reversal of the current of affairs. </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">But I distrusted Fortune because the current of my affairs ran so smoothly, and now that there was complete immunity and nothing to fear from hostile attacks, it was particularly during my voyage home that I feared the reversal of the Deity’s favour after all my good fortune, since I was bringing home so large a victorious army, such spoils, and captured kings.</q> </p></div> 
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><q type="spoken" rend="merge">Nay more, even when I had reached you safely and beheld the city full of delight and gratulation and sacrifices, I was still suspicious of Fortune, knowing that she bestows upon men no great boon that is without alloy or free from divine displeasure.</q> </p></div>

	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>And they made this manifest by conferring upon him, along with his other honours, that of the censorship,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">In 164 B.C.</note> which is of all offices most sacred, and of great influence, both in other ways, and especially because it examines into the lives and conduct of men. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Accordingly, the number of citizens registered under Aemilius was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand four hundred and fifty-two; he also declared Marcus Aemilius Lepidus first senator, a man who had already held this presidency four times, and he expelled only three senators, men of no note, and in the muster of the knights a like moderation was observed both by himself and by Marcius Philippus his colleague. </p></div></div>
