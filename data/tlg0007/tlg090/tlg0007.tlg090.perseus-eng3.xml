	<pb xml:id="v.5.p.194"/> <head>THE E AT DELPHI (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE E APUD DELPHOS</foreign>) <lb/></head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="indent">Plutarch, in this essay on the E at Delphi, tells us that beside the well-known inscriptions at Delphi there was also a representation of the letter E, the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet. The Greek name for this letter was EI, and this diphthong, in addition to being used in Plutarch’s time as the name of E (which denotes the number five), is the Greek word for <q>if,</q> and also the word for the second person singular of the verb <q>to be</q> (thou art). </p> <p rend="indent">In searching for an explanation of the unexplainable it is only natural that the three meanings of EI (<q>five,</q> <q>if,</q> <q>thou art</q>) should be examined to see if any hypothesis based on any one of them might possibly yield a rational explanation; and these hypotheses constitute the skeleton about which is built the body of Plutarch’s essay. From it we gain some interesting delineations of character and an engaging portrayal of the way in which a philosopher acts, or reacts, when forced unwillingly to face the unknowable. </p> <p rend="indent">Plutarch puts forward seven possible explanations of the letter: </p> <p rend="indent">(1) It was dedicated by the Wise Men, as a protest against interlopers, to show that their number was actually five and not seven (EI = E, five). <pb xml:id="v.5.p.195"/> </p> <p rend="indent">(2) EI is the second vowel, the Sun is the second planet, and Apollo is identified with the sun (EI = E, the vowel). </p> <p rend="indent">(3) EI means <q>if</q>: people ask the oracle IF they shall succeed, or IF they shall do this or that (EI=<q type="unspecified" >if</q>). </p> <p rend="indent">(4) EI is used in wishes or prayers to the god, often in the combination <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴθε</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ γάρ</foreign> (EI = <q>if</q> or <q>if only</q>). </p> <p rend="indent">(5) EI, <q>if,</q> is an indispensable word in logic for the construction of a syllogism (EI = <q>if</q>). </p> <p rend="indent">(6) Five is a most important number in mathematics, physiology, philosophy, and music (EI = E, <q>five</q>). </p> <p rend="indent">(7) EI means <q>thou art</q> and is the address of the consultant to Apollo, to indicate that the god has eternal being (EI = <q>thou art</q>).<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">This explanation is accepted by Poulsen (<title rend="italic">Delphi</title>, p. 149), but is open to very serious objections.</note> </p> <p rend="indent">Attempts to explain the letter have been also made in modern times by Göttling, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Berickte der Sacks</title>. <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Gesell. der Wiss.</title> I. (1846-47) pp. 311 if., and by Schultz in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Philologus</title> (1866), pp. 214 if. Roscher, in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Philologus</title> (1900), pp. 21 if.; (1901), pp. 81 if.; (1902), pp. 513 if.; <title rend="italic">Hermes</title> (1901), pp. 470 ff. (comment also by C. Robert in the same volume, p. 490), and the <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Philologische Wochenschrift</title> (1922), col. 1211, maintains that EI is an imperative from <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶμι</foreign>, <q>go,</q> addressed to the person who carne to consult the oracle, and that it means <q>go on,</q> <q>continue</q> into the temple. The value of this explanation is somewhat doubtful, since EI in this word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶμι</foreign>) is a true diphthong, and so is not generally spelled with simple E except in the Corinthian alphabet. Although <pb xml:id="v.5.p.196"/> Roscher cites a few examples from inscriptions in other dialects where the true diphthongal EI seems to be represented by simple E, his evidence is not convincing. </p> <p rend="indent">O. Lagercrantz, in <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxxvi. (1901) pp. 411 if., interprets the E as meaning <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ</foreign> <q>he said.</q> To this, of course, Roscher objects and suggests that Lagercrantz might have thought also of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ</foreign> <q>verily.</q> Thus all the various possibilities of interpretation have in turn been suggested, and rejected by others. </p> <p rend="indent">W. N. Bates, in the <title rend="italic">American Journal of Archaeology</title>, xxix. (1925) pp. 239-246, tries to show that the E had its origin in a Minoan character E associated with <foreign>(\e</foreign> (as is shown by the evidence of a Cretan gem in the Metropolitan Museum of New York) and later transferred to Delphi. Since the character was not understood, it, like other things at Delphi, came to be associated with Apollo. This character has been found on the old omphalos discovered in 1913 at Delphi in the temple of Apollo.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">It might also be recorded that J. E. Harrison, in <title xml:lang="fre" rend="italic">Comptes Rendus du Congres International d’Archeologie</title> (Athens, 1905), thinks that the E was <q>originally three betyl stones or pillars placed on a basis and representing the three Charites</q>! Moreover, C. Fries, in <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Rheinisches Museum für Philologie</title>, lxxix. (1930) 343-344, offers as <q>nodi explicatio</q> the fact that in Sumerian inscriptions E means house or temple, and so may be connected with Babylonian ritual (note the Chaldean in chap. iv.)!</note> </p> <p rend="indent">Interesting are the two coins reproduced in Imhoof-Blumer and P. Gardner, <title rend="italic">A Numismatic Commentary on Pausanias</title>, plate x. nos. xxii. and xxiii. (text, p. 119), which show the E suspended between the middle columns of the temple. Learned scholars should note that the letter represented is E, not EI: therefore <pb xml:id="v.5.p.197"/> such explanations as are based on the true diphthong are presumably wrong. </p> <p rend="indent">The title of the essay is included in the catalogue of Lamprias, where it appears as No. 117. It is not infrequently quoted or referred to by later writers. It has been separately edited by Bernardakis in the volume of essays in honour of Ernst Curtius, Leipzig, 1894. Of interest is also <title rend="italic">The Delphic Maxims in Literature</title>, by Eliza Gregory Wilkins, Chicago, 1929. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.199"/>

		<p rend="indent">Not long ago, my dear Sarapion,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">A poet living at Athens in Plutarch’s day; see <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 396 d ff. and 628 a.</note> I carne upon some lines, not badly done, which Dicaearchus thinks Euripides<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag. Graec. Frag.</title>, Euripides, no. 969.</note> addressed to Archelaüs: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I will not give poor gifts to one so rich, </l> <l>Lest you should take me for a fool, or I </l> <l>Should seem by giving to invite a gift.</l> </quote> For he does no favour who gives small gifts from scanty means to wealthy men; and since it is not credible that his giving is for nothing, he acquires in addition a reputation for disingenuousness and servility. Observe also how, as far as independence and honour are concerned, material gifts fall far below those bestowed by literary discourse and wisdom; and these gifts it is both honourable to give and, at the same time, to ask a return of like gifts from the recipients. I, at any rate, as I send to you, and by means of you for our friends there, some of our Pythian discourses, an offering of our first-fruits, as it were, confess that I am expecting other discourses, both more numerous and of better quality, from you and your friends, inasmuch as you have not only all the advantages of a great <pb xml:id="v.5.p.201"/> city,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">At this time Athens had been for several centuries a university city.</note> but you have also more abundant leisure amid many books and all manner of discussions. </p> <p rend="indent">It seems that our beloved Apollo finds a remedy and a solution for the problems connected with our life by the oracular responses which he gives to those who consult him; but the problems connected with our power to reason it seems that he himself launches and propounds to him who is by nature inclined to the love of knowledge, thus creating in the soul a craving<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 673 b.</note> that leads onward to the truth, as is clear in many other ways, but particularly in the dedication of the E.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 426 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> For the likelihood is that it was not by chance nor, as it were, by lot that this was the only letter that carne to occupy first place with the god and attained the rank of a sacred offering and something worth seeing; but it is likely that those who, in the beginning, sought after knowledge of the god either discovered some peculiar and unusual potency in it or else used it as a token with reference to some other of the matters of the highest concern, and thus adopted it. </p> <p rend="indent">On many other occasions when the subject had been brought up in the school I had quietly turned aside from it and passed it over, but recently I was unexpectedly discovered by my sons in an animated discussion with some strangers, whom, since they purposed to leave Delphi immediately, it was not seemly to try to divert from the subject, nor was it seemly for me to ask to be excused from the discussion, for they were altogether eager to hear something about it. I found them seats, therefore, near the temple, and I began to seek some answer myself and to put questions to them; influenced as I was by the place and the conversation itself, I remembered <pb xml:id="v.5.p.203"/> what, when Nero was here some years ago, I had heard Ammonius and others discussing, when the same question obtruded itself in a similar way. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent">That the god is no less a philosopher than a prophet Ammonius seemed to all to postulate and prove correctly, with reference to this or to that one of his several titles<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 393 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>; Cornutus, chap. xxxii.; von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</title>, i. 543 (p. 123); and <q>Apollo</q> in the Index thereto.</note>; that he is the <q>Pythian</q> (<title rend="italic">Inquirer</title>) for those that are beginning to learn and inquire; the <q>Delian</q> (<title rend="italic">Clear</title>) and the <q>Phanaean</q> (<title rend="italic" >Disclosing</title>) for those to whom some part of the truth is becoming clear and is being disclosed; the <q>Ismenian</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch’s attempt to connect Ismenian with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδ-</foreign>- (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδα</foreign>) can hardly be right.</note> (<title rend="italic">Knowing</title>) for those who have knowledge; and the <q>Leschenorian</q> (<title rend="italic" >Conversationalist</title>) when people have active enjoyment of conversation and philosophic intercourse with one another. <q>Since,</q> he wrent on to say, <q type="unspecified" >inquiry is the beginning of philosophy, and wonder and uncertainty the beginning of inquiry,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic" >Theaetetus</title>, 155 d.</note> it seems only natural that the greater part of what concerns the god should be concealed in riddles, and should call for some account of the wherefore and an explanation of its cause. For example, in the case of the undying fire, that pine is the only wood burned here, while laurel is used for offering incense; that two Fates have statues here,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Pausanias, x. 24. 4.</note> whereas three is everywhere the customary number; that no woman<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Euripides, <title rend="italic">Ion</title>, 222.</note> is allowed to approach the prophetic shrine; the matter of the tripod; and the other questions of this nature, when they are suggested to persons who are not altogether without mind and reason, act as a Iure and an invitation to investigate, to read, and to <pb xml:id="v.5.p.205"/> talk about them. Note also these inscriptions<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 164 b, 408 e, 511 a.</note> here, <q>Know thyself</q> and <q>Avoid extremes,</q> how many philosophic inquiries have they set on foot, and what a horde of discourses has sprung up from each, as from a seed! And no less productive of discourse than any one of them, as I think, is the present subject of inquiry.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent">When Ammonius had said this, Lamprias, my brother, said, <q>As a matter of fact, the account that we have heard is simple and quite brief. For they say that those wise men who by some are called the <q>Sophists</q> were actually five in number: Chilon, Thales, Solon, Bias, and Pittacus. But when Cleobulus, the despot of the Lindians, and later Periander of Corinth, who had no part or portion in virtue or wisdom, but forcibly acquired their repute through power and friends and favours, invaded this name of the Wise Men, and sent out and circulated throughout Greece certain sentiments and sayings very similar to those famous utterances of the Wise Men, these, naturally, did not like this at all, but were loath to expose the imposture or to arouse open hatred over a question of repute, or to carry through a contest against such powerful men; they met here by themselves and, after conferring together, dedicated that one of the letters which is fifth in alphabetical order and which stands for the number five, thus testifying for themselves before the god that they were five, and renouncing and rejecting the seventh and the sixth as having no connexion with themselves. That this account is not beside the mark anyone may realize who has heard those connected with the shrine <pb xml:id="v.5.p.207"/> naming the golden E the E of Livia, Caesar’s wife, and the bronze E the E of the Athenians, while the first and oldest one, made of wood, they still call to this day the E of the Wise Men, as though it were an offering, not of one man, but of all the Wise Men in common.</q> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent">Ammonius smiled quietly, suspecting privately that Lamprias had been indulging in a mere opinion of his own and was fabricating history and tradition regarding a matter in which he could not be held to account. Someone else among those present said that all this was similar to the nonsense which the Chaldean visitor had uttered a short time before: that there are seven vowels in the alphabet and seven stars that have an independent and unconstrained motion; that E is the second in order of the vowels from the beginning, and the sun the second planet after the moon, and that practically all the Greeks identify Apollo with the Sun.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 1130 a or 381 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>, or 393 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> <q>But all this,</q> said he, <q>has its source in slate and prate<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">An expression as obscure in the Greek as in the English.

For what he had said no one of the Delphians knew anything about; but they were used to bring forward the commonly accepted opinion which the guides give, holding it to be right that neither the appearance nor the sound of the letter has any cryptic meaning, but only its name. </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p rend="indent"><q>For it is, as the Delphians assume,</q> - and on this occasion Nicander, the priest, spoke for them and said, <q>the figure and form of the consultation of the god, and it holds the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.209"/> first place in every question of those who consult the oracle and inquire if they shall be victorious, if they shall marry, if it is to their advantage to sail the sea, if to take to farming, if to go abroad.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the long list of questions thus introduced in Hunt and Edgar, <title rend="italic">Select Papyri</title> (in the L.C.L.), i. pp. 436-438 (nos. 193-195).</note> But the god in his wisdom bade a long farewell to the logicians who think that nothing real comes out of the particle <q>if</q> combined with what the consultant thinks proper to undertake, for the god conceives of all the inquiries subjoined to this as real things and welcomes them as such. And since to inquire from him as from a prophet is our individual prerogative, but to pray to him as to a god is common to all, they think that the particle contains an optative force no less than an interrogative. <q>If only I could,</q> is the regular expression of a wish, and Archilochus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true" >Bergk, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Poet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent">When Nicander had expounded all this, my friend Theon, whom I presume you know, asked <pb xml:id="v.5.p.211"/> Ammonius if Logical Reason had any rights in free speech, after being spoken of in such a very insulting manner. And when Ammonius urged him to speak and come to her assistance, he said, <q>That the god is a most logical reasoner the great majority of his oracles show clearly; for surely it is the function of the same person both to solve and to invent ambiguities. Moreover, as Plato said, when an oracle was given that they should double the size of the altar at Delos<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 579 b-d; and on the doubling of the cube, T.

Heath, <title rend="italic">A Manual of Greek Mathematics</title> (Oxford, 1931), pp. 154-170.</note> (a task requiring the highest skill in geometry), it was not this that the god was enjoining, but he was urging the Greeks to study geometry. And so, in the same way, when the god gives out ambiguous oracles, he is promoting and organizing logical reasoning as indispensable for those who are to apprehend his meaning aright. Certainly in logic this copulative conjunction has the greatest force, inasmuch as it clearly gives us our most logical form, the syllogism. Must not the character of the hypothetical syllogism be of this sort: granted that even wild animals have apperception of the existence of things, yet to man alone has Nature given the power to observe and judge the consequences? That <q>it is day</q> and that <q>it is light</q> assuredly wolves and dogs and birds perceive by their senses; but <q>if it is day, then it is light,</q> no creature other than man apprehends,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> von Arnim, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</title>, ii. 216 (p. 70) and 239 (p. 78).</note> for he alone has a concept of antecedent and consequent, of apparent implication and connexion of these things one with another, and their relations and differences, from which our demonstrations derive their most authoritative inception. Since, then, philosophy is concerned with truth, and the illumination <pb xml:id="v.5.p.213"/> of truth is demonstration, and the inception of demonstration is the hypothetical syllogism, then with good reason the potent element that effects the connexion and produces this was consecrated by wise men to the god who is, above all, a lover of the truth.</q> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>The god, moreover, is a prophet, and the prophetic art concerns the future that is to result from things present and past. For there is nothing of which either the origin is without cause or the foreknowledge thereof without reason; but since all present events follow in close conjunction with past events, and all future events follow in close conjunction with present events, in accordance with a regular procedure which brings them to fulfilment from beginning to end, he who understands, in consonance with Nature, how to fathom the connexions and interrelations of the causes one with another knows and can declare <quote rend="blockquote">What now is, and in future shall be, and has been of aforetime.<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> i. 70.</note> </quote> Very excellently did Homer place first in order the present, then the future and the past, for the syllogism based on hypothesis has its source in what is; for example, <q>if this is, then that has preceded,</q> and again, <q>if this is, then that shall be.</q> The technical and rational element here, as has been stated, is the knowledge of consequences; but the senses provide the argument with its premise. Therefore, even if it be a poor thing to say, I shall not be turned aside from saying it, that this is the tripod of truth, namely, argument, which lays down the consequent relation of the conclusion to the antecedent, and then, premising the existent condition, induces the completion of the demonstration. Therefore, if the Pythian god <pb xml:id="v.5.p.215"/> plainly finds pleasure in music and the songs of swans and the sound of lyres, what wonder is it that, because of his fondness for logical reasoning, he should welcome and love that portion of discourse of which he observes philosophers making the most particular and the most constant use?</q> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>Heracles, before he had released Prometheus or had conversed with the sophists that were associated with Cheiron and Atlas, when he was young and a thorough Boeotian,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">The Greek equivalent of <q>Philistine.</q> </note> would do away with logical reasoning;. he ridiculed the <q>if the first, then the second,</q> and resolved to carry off the tripod by force<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 413 a, 557 c, 560 d; Pausanias, x. 13. 4; Apollodorus, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Bibliotheca</title>, ii. 6. 2 (with Frazer’s note in L.C.L. edition); Roscher, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Lexikon der gr. und röm.

Moreover, each when applied to itself and made composite with itself shows the difference. For no even number united with even gives an odd number, nor does it ever show any departure from its own distinctive nature, being impotent through its weakness to produce the other number, and having no power of accomplishment; but odd numbers combined with odd produce a numerous progeny of even numbers because of their omnipresent generative function. It would not be timely at this moment to enumerate the other potent properties and divergences of numbers; let it suffice to say that the Pythagoreans called Five a <q>Marriage</q> on the ground that it was produced by the association of the first male number and the first female number.</q> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>There is also a sense in which it has been called <q>Nature,</q> since by being multiplied into itself it ends in itself again. For even as Nature receives wheat in the form of seed and puts it to its use, and creates in the interim many shapes and forms through which she carries out the process of growth to its end, but, to crown all, displays wheat again, and thus presents as her result the beginning at the end of the whole, so in like manner, while the other numbers when raised to a power end in different numbers as the result of the increase, only the numbers five and six, when multiplied by themselves, repeat themselves and preserve their identity. Thus six times six is thirty-six, and five times five is twenty-five; and furthermore, the number six does this but once, and the single instance is when it is squared; but with five this result is obtained in raising it to any power, and it has a unique characteristic, when added to <pb xml:id="v.5.p.221"/> itself, of producing either itself or ten alternately<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">That is, a number ending in 5 or 0. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 429 d, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> as the addition progresses, and of doing this to infinity, since this number takes its pattern from the primal principle which orders the whole. For as that principle by changes creates a complete universe out of itself, and then in turn out of the universe creates itself again, as Heracleitus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. p. 95, Heracleitus, no. b 90.</note> says, <q>and exchanges fire for all and all for fire, as gold for goods and goods for gold,</q> so, in like manner, the conjunction of five with itself is determined by Nature’s law to produce nothing incomplete or foreign, but it has strictly limited changes; it produces either itself or ten, that is to say, either its own characteristic or the perfect whole. </q></p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"> <p rend="indent"><q>But these remarks have been extended somewhat beyond what the occasion requires. However, it is clear that men make Five an attribute of the god, which at one time of itself creates itself, like fire, and at another time out of itself creates ten, like the universe. And in music, which is especially pleasing to him, do we imagine that this number plays no part? For the main application of harmony, so far as it can be put into words, is concerned with chords. That these are five, and no more, reason convinces anyone who wishes, by perception alone without <pb xml:id="v.5.p.227"/> employing reason, to pursue these matters on the strings and stops<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic" >Republic</title>, 530 d - 531 c.</note>; for they all have their origin in numerical ratios.

The extra chord which the writers on harmony introduce, naming it the octave and the fourth <emph xml:lang="lat">extra metrum</emph>, does not deserve acceptance, since we should be favouring the unreasoning element in our sense of hearing contrary to reason, which is as much as to say, contrary to law. Now if I may omit any discussion of the five stops of the tetrachord,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 430 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, and <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 1021 e and 1029 a.</note> and the first five <q>tones</q> or <q>tropes</q> or <q>harmonies,</q> whatever be their right name, from the changes in which, through a greater or a less tension, the remaining lower and higher notes are derived, I must ask whether, although the intervals are numerous, or rather of infinite number, yet the elements of melody are not five only,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 430 a, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> quarter tone, half tone, tone, a tone plus a half tone, and double tone; and there is, in the range of notes, no additional space, either smaller or greater within the limits set by the high and the low, which can yield melody. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p rend="indent"><q>There are many other examples of this sort of thing,</q> said I, <q>which I shall pass over.

Wherefore also Plato, apparently noting the five most beautiful and complete forms among those found in Nature, pyramid, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron, appropriately assigned each to each. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p rend="indent"><q>There are some who associate the senses also, since they are of the same number, with those primal elements, observing that touch functions against something resistant, and is earthly, and that taste, through moisture in the things tasted, absorbs their qualities.

Of the two remaining senses, odour, which the sense of smell has received as its portion, since it is an exhalation and is engendered by heat, bears a resemblance to fire; and in sight, which flashes to its goal owing to its kinship with aether and light, there occurs a combination and coalescence of the two, which behaves as they do. The living being possesses no other sense, nor has the world any other nature single and uncombined; but a marvellous distribution and apportionment each to each has, as it seems, been made of the five to the five.</q> </p> </div>

For those who exalt Four teach us a lesson that is not without value, that by reason of this number all solids have come into being. For since every such solid body exists through the acquisition of depth by length and breadth, and for length must be presupposed a single point assigned to unity, and length without breadth, which is called a line, is also duality, and the movement of the line breadthwise generates a plane in the third instance, and when depth is added, through the four factors the increase progresses to a solid — it is clear to everyone that four, when it has carried Nature forward to the point of completing a solid body and producing a volume that may be felt and that is resistant, has then left Nature lacking in the most important thing of all. For the inanimate thing is, to put it simply, orphaned, incomplete, and good for nothing, unless there be an animating soul to make use of it. The impulse or dispensation that creates the soul therein, a transformation brought about through five factors in all, gives to Nature its due completeness, and is as much more potent than four as the living being differs in worth from the inanimate thing. </q></p> <p rend="indent"><q>Moreover, the symmetry and power of five, rather than that of any other number, has prevailed and has not permitted the animate to progress to unlimited classes of beings, but has produced five forms <pb xml:id="v.5.p.233"/> of all living things.

I infer that these are intended to be figurative expressions corresponding to those just mentioned, generation corresponding to being, the infinite to motion, the definite to rest, the combining principle to identity, and the dissociating principle to divergence.

For not only is it true, as Heracleitus<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. p. 93, Heracleitus, no. 76.</note> used to say, that the death of heat is birth for steam, and the death of steam is birth for water, but the case is even more clearly to be seen in our own selves: the man in his prime passes away when the old man comes into existence, the young man passes away into the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.243"/> man in his prime, the child into the young man, and the babe into the child. Dead is the man of yesterday, for he is passed into the man of to-day; and the man of to-day is dying as he passes into the man of to-morrow. Nobody remains one person, nor is one person; but we become many persons, even as matter is drawn about some one semblance and common mould<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic" >Timaeus</title>, 50 c.</note> with imperceptible movement. Else how is it that, if we remain the same persons, we take delight in some things now, whereas earlier we took delight in different things; that we love or hate opposite things, and so too with our admirations and our disapprovals, and that we use other words and feel other emotions and have no longer the same personal appearance, the same external form, or the same purposes in mind? For without change it is not reasonable that a person should have different experiences and emotions; and if he changes, he is not the same person; and if he is not the same person, he has no permanent being, but changes his very nature as one personality in him succeeds to another. Our senses, through ignorance of reality, falsely tell us that what appears to be is. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"> <p rend="indent"><q>What, then, really is Being? It is that which is eternal, without beginning and without end, to which no length of time brings change. For time is something that is in motion, appearing in connexion with moving matter, ever flowing, retaining nothing, a receptacle, as it were, of birth and decay, whose familiar <q>afterwards</q> and <q>before,</q> <q>shall be</q> and <q>has been,</q> when they are uttered, are of themselves a confession of Not Being. For to speak of that which has not yet occurred in terms of Being, or to say of what has already ceased to be, that it is, is silly and absurd. And as for that on which we most rely to <pb xml:id="v.5.p.245"/> support our conception of time, as we utter the words, <q>it is here,</q> <q>it is at hand,</q> and <q>now</q> — all this again reason, entering in, demolishes utterly. For <q>now</q> is crowded out into the future and the past, when we would look upon it as a culmination; for of necessity it suffers division. And if Nature, when it is measured, is subject to the same processes as is the agent that measures it, then there is nothing in Nature that has permanence or even existence, but all things are in the process of creation or destruction according to their relative distribution with respect to time. Wherefore it is irreverent in the case of that which is to say even that it was or shall be; for these are certain deviations, transitions, and alterations, belonging to that which by its nature has no permanence in Being. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"> <p rend="indent"><q>But God is (if there be need to say so), and He exists for no fixed time, but for the everlasting ages which are immovable, timeless, and undeviating, in which there is no earlier nor later, no future nor past, no older nor younger; but He, being One, has with only one <q>Now</q> completely filled <q>For ever</q>; and only when Being is after His pattern is it in reality Being, not having been nor about to be, nor has it had a beginning nor is it destined to come to an end. Under these conditions, therefore, we ought, as we pay Him reverence, to greet Him and to address Him with the words, <q>Thou art</q>; or even, I vow, as did some of the men of old, <q>Thou art One.</q> </q><pb xml:id="v.5.p.247"/> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>In fact the Deity is not Many, like each of us who is compounded of hundreds of different factors which arise in the course of our experience, a heterogenous collection combined in a haphazard way. But Being must have Unity, even as Unity must have Being. Now divergence from Unity, because of its differing from Being, deviates into the creation of that which has no Being. Wherefore the first of the god’s names is excellently adapted to him, and so are the second and third as well. He is Apollo, that is to say, denying the Many<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 354 b, 381 f, and 388 f, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> and abjuring multiplicity; he is Ieius, as being One and One alone<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Ieius is doubtless derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰή</foreign>, a cry used in invoking Apollo, but Plutarch would derive it from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴα, ἴης</foreign>, an epic word meaning <q>one.</q> </note>; and Phoebus,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 388 f and 421 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> as is well known, is a name that the men of old used to give to everything pure and undefiled; even as the Thessalians, to this day, I believe, when their priests, on the prohibited days, are spending their time alone by themselves outside the temples, say that the priests <q>are keeping Phoebus.</q></q> </p> <p rend="indent"><q>Unity is simple and pure. For it is by the admixture of one thing with another that contamination arises, even as Homer<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> iv. 141.</note> somewhere says that some ivory which is being dyed red is being <q>contaminated,</q> and dyers speak of colours that are mixed as being <q>spoiled</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 436 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>, and <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title> 270 f.</note>; and they call the mixing <q>spoiling.</q><note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic" >Moralia</title>, 725 c.</note> Therefore it is characteristic of the imperishable and pure to be one and uncombined. </q></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"> <p rend="indent"><q>Those who hold that Apollo and the sun are the same,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ibid.</foreign> 1130 a, and 386 b, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> it is right and proper that Ave welcome and love for their goodness of heart in placing their concept of the god in that thing which they honour most of all the things that they know and yearn for. But, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.249"/> as though they were now having a sleepy vision of the god amid the loveliest of dreams, let us wake them and urge them to proceed to loftier heights and to contemplate the waking vision of him, and what he truly is, but to pay honour also to this imagery of him in the sun and to revere the creative power associated with it, in so far as it is possible by what is perceived through the senses to gain an image of what is conceived in the mind, and by that which is ever in motion an image of that which moves not, an image that in some way or other transmits some gleams reflecting and mirroring his kindliness and blessedness. And as for his vagaries and transformations when he sends forth fire that sweeps his own self along with it, as they say,<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 389 c, <foreign xml:lang="lat">supra</foreign>.</note> and again when he forces it down here and directs it upon the earth and sea and winds and living creatures, and, besides, the terrible things done both to living creatures and to growing vegetation — to such tales it is irreverent even to listen; else will the god be more futile than the Poet’s fancied child<note resp="editor" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Homer, <title rend="italic" >Il.</title> xv. 362.</note> playing a game amid the sand that is heaped together and then scattered again by him, if the god indulges in this game with the universe constantly, fashioning the world that does not exist, and destroying it again when it has been created. For, on the contrary, so far as he is in some way present in the world, by this his presence does he bind together its substance and prevail over its corporeal weakness, which tends toward dissolution. And it seems to me right to address to the god the words <q>Thou art,</q> which are most opposed to this account, and testify against it, believing that never does any vagary or transformation take place near him, but that such acts and experiences are related to some <pb xml:id="v.5.p.251"/> other god, or rather to some demigod, whose office is concerned with Nature in dissolution and generation; and this is clear at once from the names which are, as it were, correspondingly antithetic.
