				<head>THE E AT DELPHI (<foreign xml:lang="lat">DE E APUD DELPHOS</foreign>)
					<lb/></head>
				<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro">
					<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
					<p rend="indent"> Plutarch, in this essay on the E at Delphi, tells us that beside the
						well-known inscriptions at Delphi there was also a representation of the
						letter E, the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet. The Greek name for this
						letter was EI, and this diphthong, in addition to being used in Plutarch's
						time as the name of E (which denotes the number five), is the Greek word for
							<q type="unspecified">if,</q> and also the word for the second person
						singular of the verb <q type="unspecified">to be</q> (thou art). </p>
					<p> In searching for an explanation of the unexplainable it is only natural that
						the three meanings of EI (<q type="unspecified">five,</q>
						<q type="unspecified">if,</q>
						<q type="unspecified">thou art</q>) should be examined to see if any
						hypothesis based on any one of them might possibly yield a rational
						explanation; and these hypotheses constitute the skeleton about which is
						built the body of Plutarch's essay. From it we gain some interesting
						delineations of character and an engaging portrayal of the way in which a
						philosopher acts, or reacts, when forced unwillingly to face the unknowable. </p>
					<p> Plutarch puts forward seven possible explanations of the letter: </p>
					<p> (1) It was dedicated by the Wise Men, as a protest against interlopers, to
						show that their number was actually five and not seven (EI = E, five). <pb
							xml:id="v.5.p.195"/>
					</p>
					<p> (2) EI is the second vowel, the Sun is the second planet, and Apollo is
						identified with the sun (EI = E, the vowel). </p>
					<p> (3) EI means <q type="unspecified">if</q>: people ask the oracle IF they
						shall succeed, or IF they shall do this or that (EI=<q type="unspecified"
							>if</q>). </p>
					<p> (4) EI is used in wishes or prayers to the god, often in the combination
							<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴθε</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ
							γάρ</foreign> (EI = <q type="unspecified">if</q> or <q
							type="unspecified">if only</q>). </p>
					<p> (5) EI, <q type="unspecified">if,</q> is an indispensable word in logic for
						the construction of a syllogism (EI = <q type="unspecified">if</q>). </p>
					<p> (6) Five is a most important number in mathematics, physiology, philosophy,
						and music (EI = E, <q type="unspecified">five</q>). </p>
					<p> (7) EI means <q type="unspecified">thou art</q> and is the address of the
						consultant to Apollo, to indicate that the god has eternal being (EI = <q
							type="unspecified">thou art</q>).<note resp="ed" place="unspecified"
							anchored="true">This explanation is accepted by Poulsen (<title
								rend="italic">Delphi</title>, p. 149), but is open to very serious
							objections.</note>
					</p>
					<p> Attempts to explain the letter have been also made in modern times by
						Göttling, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Berickte der Sacks</title>.
							<title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Gesell. der Wiss.</title> I.
						(1846-47) pp. 311 if., and by Schultz in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic"
							>Philologus</title> (1866), pp. 214 if. Roscher, in <title
							xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Philologus</title> (1900), pp. 21 if.;
						(1901), pp. 81 if.; (1902), pp. 513 if.; <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>
						(1901), pp. 470 ff. (comment also by C. Robert in the same volume, p. 490),
						and the <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Philologische
							Wochenschrift</title> (1922), col. 1211, maintains that EI is an
						imperative from <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶμι</foreign>, <q
							type="unspecified">go,</q> addressed to the person who carne to consult
						the oracle, and that it means <q type="unspecified">go on,</q>
						<q type="unspecified">continue</q> into the temple. The value of this
						explanation is somewhat doubtful, since EI in this word (<foreign
							xml:lang="grc">εἶμι</foreign>) is a true diphthong, and so is not
						generally spelled with simple E except in the Corinthian alphabet. Although
							<pb xml:id="v.5.p.196"/> Roscher cites a few examples from inscriptions
						in other dialects where the true diphthongal EI seems to be represented by
						simple E, his evidence is not convincing. </p>
					<p> O. Lagercrantz, in <title rend="italic">Hermes</title>, xxxvi. (1901) pp.
						411 if., interprets the E as meaning <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ</foreign>
						<q type="unspecified">he said.</q> To this, of course, Roscher objects and
						suggests that Lagercrantz might have thought also of <foreign xml:lang="grc"
							>ἦ</foreign>
						<q type="unspecified">verily.</q> Thus all the various possibilities of
						interpretation have in turn been suggested, and rejected by others. </p>
					<p> W. N. Bates, in the <title rend="italic">American Journal of
							Archaeology</title>, xxix. (1925) pp. 239-246, tries to show that the E
						had its origin in a Minoan character E associated with
							<foreign>(\e</foreign> (as is shown by the evidence of a Cretan gem in
						the Metropolitan Museum of New York) and later transferred to Delphi. Since
						the character was not understood, it, like other things at Delphi, came to
						be associated with Apollo. This character has been found on the old omphalos
						discovered in 1913 at Delphi in the temple of Apollo.<note resp="ed"
							place="unspecified" anchored="true">It might also be recorded that J. E.
							Harrison, in <title xml:lang="fre" rend="italic">Comptes Rendus du
								Congres International d'Archeologie</title> (Athens, 1905), thinks
							that the E was <q type="unspecified">originally three betyl stones or
								pillars placed on a basis and representing the three Charites</q>!
							Moreover, C. Fries, in <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Rheinisches
								Museum für Philologie</title>, lxxix. (1930) 343-344, offers as <q
								type="unspecified">nodi explicatio</q> the fact that in Sumerian
							inscriptions E means house or temple, and so may be connected with
							Babylonian ritual (note the Chaldean in chap. iv.)!</note>
					</p>
					<p> Interesting are the two coins reproduced in Imhoof-Blumer and P. Gardner,
							<title rend="italic">A Numismatic Commentary on Pausanias</title>, plate
						x. nos. xxii. and xxiii. (text, p. 119), which show the E suspended between
						the middle columns of the temple. Learned scholars should note that the
						letter represented is E, not EI: therefore <pb xml:id="v.5.p.197"/> such
						explanations as are based on the true diphthong are presumably wrong. </p>
					<p> The title of the essay is included in the catalogue of Lamprias, where it
						appears as No. 117. It is not infrequently quoted or referred to by later
						writers. It has been separately edited by Bernardakis in the volume of
						essays in honour of Ernst Curtius, Leipzig, 1894. Of interest is also <title

						</quote> For he does no favour who gives small gifts from scanty means to
						wealthy men; and since it is not credible that his giving is for nothing, he
						acquires in addition a reputation for disingenuousness and servility.
						Observe also how, as far as independence and honour are concerned, material
						gifts fall far below those bestowed by literary discourse and wisdom; and
						these gifts it is both honourable to give and, at the same time, to ask a
						return of like gifts from the recipients. I, at any rate, as I send to you,
						and by means of you for our friends there, some of our Pythian discourses,
						an offering of our first-fruits, as it were, confess that I am expecting

					<p> It seems that our beloved Apollo finds a remedy and a solution for the
						problems connected with our life by the oracular responses which he gives to
						those who consult him; but the problems connected with our power to reason
						it seems that he himself launches and propounds to him who is by nature
						inclined to the love of knowledge, thus creating in the soul a craving<note

							<foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf</foreign>.<title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic"

						occupy first place with the god and attained the rank of a sacred offering
						and something worth seeing; but it is likely that those who, in the
						beginning, sought after knowledge of the god either discovered some peculiar
						and unusual potency in it or else used it as a token with reference to some
						other of the matters of the highest concern, and thus adopted it. </p>
					<p> On many other occasions when the subject had been brought up in the school I
						had quietly turned aside from it and passed it over, but recently I was
						unexpectedly discovered by my sons in an animated discussion with some
						strangers, whom, since they purposed to leave Delphi immediately, it was not
						seemly to try to divert from the subject, nor was it seemly for me to ask to
						be excused from the discussion, for they were altogether eager to hear
						something about it. I found them seats, therefore, near the temple, and I
						began to seek some answer myself and to put questions to them; influenced
						as I was by the place and the conversation itself, I remembered <pb

						number, and having no power of accomplishment; but odd numbers combined with
						odd produce a numerous progeny of even numbers because of their omnipresent

						lesson that is not without value, that by reason of this number all solids
						have come into being. For since every such solid body exists through the

						presupposed a single point assigned to unity, and length without breadth,
						which is called a line, is also duality, and the movement of the line
						breadthwise generates a plane in the third instance, and when depth is

						clear to everyone that four, when it has carried Nature forward to the point
						of completing a solid body and producing a volume that may be felt and that
						is resistant, has then left Nature lacking in the most important thing of
						all. For the inanimate thing is, to put it simply, orphaned, incomplete, and
						good for nothing, unless there be an animating soul to make use of it. The
						impulse or dispensation that creates the soul therein, a transformation

					<p> <q>Moreover, the symmetry and power of five, rather than that of any other

							<pb xml:id="v.5.p.243"/> man in his prime, the child into the young man,
						and the babe into the child. Dead is the man of yesterday, for he is passed

						now, whereas earlier we took delight in different things; that we love or
						hate opposite things, and so too with our admirations and our disapprovals,
						and that we use other words and feel other emotions and have no longer the
						same personal appearance, the same external form, or the same purposes in
						mind? For without change it is not reasonable that a person should have
						different experiences and emotions; and if he changes, he is not the same
						person; and if he is not the same person, he has no permanent being, but
						changes his very nature as one personality in him succeeds to another. Our

						whose familiar <q>afterwards</q> and <q>before,</q> <q>shall be</q> and <q>has been,</q> when
						they are uttered, are of themselves a confession of Not Being. For to speak

						already ceased to be, that it is, is silly and absurd. And as for that on
						which we most rely to <pb xml:id="v.5.p.245"/> support our conception of
						time, as we utter the words, <q>it is here,</q> <q>it is at hand,</q> and <q>now</q> — all
						this again reason, entering in, demolishes utterly. For <q>now</q> is crowded out
						into the future and the past, when we would look upon it as a culmination;
						for of necessity it suffers division. And if Nature, when it is measured, is
						subject to the same processes as is the agent that measures it, then there
						is nothing in Nature that has permanence or even existence, but all things
						are in the process of creation or destruction according to their relative
						distribution with respect to time. Wherefore it is irreverent in the case of
						that which is to say even that it was or shall be; for these are certain
						deviations, transitions, and alterations, belonging to that which by its
