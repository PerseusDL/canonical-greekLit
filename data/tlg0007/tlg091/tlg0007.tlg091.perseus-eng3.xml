<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="intro"> <head>INTRODUCTION</head> <p> Plutarch’s essay on the changed custom at Delphi is quite as interesting for its digressions as for its treatment of the main topic. Portents, coincidences, history, a little philosophy, stories of persons like Croesus, Battus, Lysander, Rhodope, finally lead up to the statement that many oracles used to be delivered in prose, although still more in early times were delivered in verse; but the present age calls for simplicity and directness instead of the ancient obscurity and grandiloquence. </p> <p rend="indent"> We possess a considerable body of Delphic oracles preserved in Greek literature, as, for example, the famous oracle of the <q>wooden wall</q> (Herodotus, vii. 141). Practically all of these are in hexameter verse. Many more records of oracles merely state that someone consulted the oracle and was told to perform a certain deed, or was told that something would or might happen, often with certain limitations. We have, therefore, no means of determining the truth of Plutarch’s statement, but there is little doubt that he is right. If we possessed his lost work, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χρησμῶν συναγωγή</foreign> (no. 171 in Lamprias’s list), we should have more abundant data on which to base our decision. </p> <p rend="indent"> The essay often exhibits Plutarch at his best. Hartman thinks that Plutarch hoped that the.work <pb xml:id="v.5.p.257"/> would be read at Rome, and therefore inserted the encomium of Roman rule near the end. </p> <p rend="indent"> The essay stands as no. 116 in Lamprias’s catalogue. It is found in only two mss. and in a few places the tradition leaves us in doubt, but, for the most part, the text is fairly clear. </p> <p rend="indent"> The references to the topography and monuments of Delphi have become more intelligible since the site was excavated by the French. Pomtow, in the <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Berliner Pkilologische Wochenschrift</title>, 1912, p. 1170, gives an account of the monuments visited by the company in this essay. </p> </div> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.259"/> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="0"> <p rend="indent">(The persons who take part in the dialogue are Basilocles and Philinus, who serve to introduce the later speakers; Diogenianus, Theon, Sarapion, Boethus, as well as Philinus himself and some professional guides.)</p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"> <p><said who="#Basilocles"><label>BASILOCLES.</label> You people have kept it up till well into the evening, Philinus, escorting the foreign visitor around among the statues and votive offerings. For my part, I had almost given up waiting for you.</said> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Philinus"><label>PHILINUS.</label> The fact is, Basilocles, that wre went slowly, sowing words, and reaping them straightway with strife, like the men sprung from the Dragon’s teeth, words with meanings behind them of the contentious sort, which sprang up and flourished along our way.</said> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Basilocles"><label>BASILOCLES.</label> Will it be necessary to call in someone else of those who were with you; or are you willing, as a favour, to relate in full what your conversation was and who took part in it?</said> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Philinus"><label>PHILINUS.</label> It looks, Basilocles, as if I shall have that to do. In fact, it would not be easy for you to find anyone of the others in the town, for I saw most of them once more on their way up to the Cory ei an cave and Lycoreia<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pausanias, x. 6. 2-3.</note> with the foreign visitor.</said> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.261"/> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Basilocles"><label>BASILOCLES</label>. Our visitor is certainly eager to see the sights, and an unusually eager listener.</said> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Philinus"><label>PHILINUS.</label> But even more is he a scholar and a student. However, it is not this that most deserves our admiration, but a winning gentleness, and his willingness to argue and to raise questions, which comes from his intelligence, and shows no dissatisfaction nor contrariety with the answers. So, after being with him but a short time, one would say, <q>O child of a goodly father!</q> <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Plato, <title rend="italic">Republic</title>, 368 a.</note> You surely know Diogenianus, one of the best of men.</said> </p> <p rend="indent"> <said who="#Basilocles"><label>BASILOCLES.</label> I never saw him myself, Philinus, but I have met many persons who expressed a strong approval of the man’s words and character, and who had other compliments of the same nature to say of the young man. But, my friend, what was the beginning and occasion of your conversation?</said> </p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus"><label>PHILINUS.</label> The guides were going through their prearranged programme, paying no heed to us who begged that they would cut short their harangues and their expounding of most of the inscriptions. The appearance and technique of the statues had only a moderate attraction for the foreign visitor, who, apparently, was a connoisseur in works of art. He did, however, admire the patina of the bronze, for it bore no resemblance to verdigris or rust, but the bronze was smooth and shining with a deep blue tinge, so that it gave an added touch to the sea-captains<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Presumably the thirty-seven statues of Lysander and his officers (erected after the battle of Aegospotami), which stood near the entrance inside the sacred precinct. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Lysander</title>, chap. xviii. (443 a).</note> (for he had begun his sight-seeing with them), as they stood there with the true complexion of the sea and its deepest depths.</said> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.263"/> </p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Was there, then,</q> said he, <q>some process of alloying and treating used by the artizans of early times for bronze, something like what is called the tempering of swords, on the disappearance of which bronze carne to have a respite from employment in war? As a matter of fact,</q> he continued, <q>it was not by art, as they say, but by accident that the Corinthian bronze<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Tempering in the water of Peirene was held to be one important factor in the production of Corinthian bronze. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf. e.g.</foreign> Pausanias, ii. 3. 3. On the whole subject of Corinthian bronze, it is worth while to consult an article by T. Leslie Shear, <q>A Hoard of Coins found in Corinth in 1930,</q> in the <title rend="italic">American Journal of Archaeology</title>, xxv. (1931) pp. 139-151, which records the results of chemical analyses of samples of the bronze.</note> acquired its beauty of colour; a fire consumed a house containing some gold and silver and a great store of copper, and when these were melted and fused together, the great mass of copper furnished a name because of its preponderance.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> Theon, taking up the conversation, said, <q>We have heard another more artful account, how a worker in bronze at Corinth, when he had come upon a hoard containing much gold, fearing detection, broke it off a little at a time and stealthily mixed it with his bronze, which thus acquired a wondrous composition. He sold it for a goodly price since it was very highly esteemed for its colour and beauty. However, both this story and that are fiction, but there was apparently some process of combination and preparation; for even now they alloy gold with silver<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Making the ancient electrum, which was often used for coinage, plate, and similar purposes.</note> and produce a peculiar and extraordinary, and, to my eyes, a sickly paleness and an unlovely perversion.</q> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>What do you think, then,</q> said Diogenianus, <q>has been the cause of the colour of the bronze here?</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> Theon replied, <q>When of the primal and simplest <pb xml:id="v.5.p.265"/> elements in Nature, as they are called and actually are — fire, earth, air, and water — there is none other that comes near to the bronze or is in contact with it, save only air, it is clear that the bronze is affected by this, and that because of this it has acquired whatever distinctive quality it has, since the air is always about it and environs it closely.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Coriolanus</title>, chap. xxxviii. (232 a).</note> Of a truth <quote rend="blockquote">All this I knew before Theognis’ day,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Kock, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Com. Att. Frag.</title> iii. p. 495, Adespota, no. 461. Plutarch quotes this again in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 777 c.</note> </quote> as the comic poet has it. But is it your desire to learn what property the air possesses and what power it exerts in its constant contact, so that it has imparted a colouring to the bronze?</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> As Diogenianus assented, Theon said, <q>And so also is it my desire, my young friend; let us, therefore, investigate together, and before anything else, if you will, the reason why olive-oil most of all the liquids covers bronze with rust. For, obviously, the oil of itself does not deposit the rust, since it is pure and stainless when applied.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Certainly not,</q> said the young man. <q>My own opinion is that there must be something else that causes this, for the oil is thin, pure, and transparent, and the rust, when it encounters this, is most visible, but in the other liquids it becomes invisible.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Well done, my young friend,</q> said Theon, <q>and excellently said. But consider, if you will, the reason given by Aristotle.</q> <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Not to be found in Aristotle’s extant works.</note> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Very well,</q> said he, <q>I will.</q> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.267"/> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Now Aristotle says that when the rust absorbs any of the other liquids, it is imperceptibly disunited and dispersed, since these are unevenly and thinly constituted; but by the density of the oil it is prevented from escaping and remains permanently as it is collected. If, then, we are able of ourselves to invent some such hypothesis, we shall not be altogether at a loss for some magic spell and some words of comfort to apply to this puzzling question.</q> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge">Since, therefore, we urged him on and gave him his opportunity, Theon said that the air in Delphi is dense and compact, possessing a certain vigour because of the repulsion and resistance that it encounters from the lofty hills; and it is also tenuous and keen, as the facts about the digestion of food bear witness. So the air, by reason of its tenuity, works its way into the bronze and cuts it, disengaging from it a great quantity of rust like dust, but this it retains and holds fast, inasmuch as its density does not allow a passage for this. The rust gathers and, because of its great abundance, it effloresces and acquires a brilliance and lustre on its surface. </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> When we had accepted this explanation, the foreign visitor said that the one hypothesis alone was sufficient for the argument. <q>The tenuity,</q> said he, <q>will seem to be in contravention to the reputed density of the air, but there is no need to bring it in. As a matter of fact the bronze of itself, as it grows old, exudes and releases the rust which the density of the air confines and solidifies and thus makes it visible because of its great abundance.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> Theon, taking this up, said, <q>My friend, what is there to prevent the same thing from being both <pb xml:id="v.5.p.269"/> tenuous and dense, like the silken and linen varieties of cloth, touching which Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Od.</title> vii. 107. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title rend="italic">Life of Alexander</title>, chap. xxxvi. (686 c); Athenaeus, 582 d.</note> has said Streams of the liquid oil flow off from the close-woven linen, showing the exactitude and fineness of the weaving by the statement that the oil does not remain on the cloth, but runs off over the surface, since the fineness and closeness of the texture does not let it through? In fact the tenuity of the air can be brought forward, not only as an argument regarding the disengaging of the rust, but, very likely, it also makes the colour itself more agreeable and brilliant by blending light and lustre with the blue.</q> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge">Following this a silence ensued, and again the guides began to deliver their harangues. A certain oracle in verse was recited (I think it concerned the kingdom of Aegon the Argive<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Plutarch recounts the story of this oracle in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 340 c.</note>, whereupon Diogenianus said that he had often wondered at the barrenness and cheapness of the hexameter lines in which the oracles are pronounced. <q>Yet the god is Leader of the Muses, and it is right and fair that he should take no less interest in what is called elegance of diction than in the sweetness of sound that is concerned with tunes and songs, and that his utterances should surpass Hesiod and Homer in the excellence of their versification. Yet we observe that most of the oracles are full of metrical and verbal errors and barren diction.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> Sarapion, the poet who was present from Athens, said, <q>Then do we believe these verses to be the <pb xml:id="v.5.p.271"/> god’s, and yet dare to say that in beauty they fall short of the verses of Homer and Hesiod? Shall we not treat them as if they were the best and fairest of poetic compositions, and correct our own judgement, prepossessed as it is as the result of unfortunate habituation?</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> At this point Boëthus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Called the Epicurean in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 673 c.</note> the mathematician entered into the conversation. (You know that the man is already changing his allegiance in the direction of Epicureanism.) Said he, <q>Do you happen to have heard the story of Pauson the painter?</q> <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Aelian, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Varia Historia</title>, xiv. 15. According to the scholium on Aristophanes, <title rend="italic">Plutus</title>, 602, the Pauson mentioned there is probably the same man.</note> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>No,</q> said Sarapion, <q>I have not.</q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>Well, it is really worth hearing. It seems that he had received a commission to paint a horse rolling, and painted it galloping. His patron was indignant, whereupon Pauson laughed and turned the canvas upside down, and, when the lower part became the upper, the horse now appeared to be not galloping, but rolling. Bion says that this happens to some arguments when they are inverted. So some people will say of the oracles also, not that they are excellently made because they are the god’s, but that they are not the god’s because they are poorly made! The first of these is in the realm of the unknown; but that the verses conveying the oracles are carelessly wrought is, of course, perfectly clear to you, my dear Sarapion, for you are competent to judge. You write poems in a philosophic and restrained style, but in force and grace and diction they bear more resemblance to the poems of Homer and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.273"/> Hesiod than to the verses put forth by the prophetic priestess.</q> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>The fact is, Boëthus,</q> said Sarapion, <q>that we are ailing both in ears and eyes, accustomed as we are, through luxury and soft living, to believe and to declare that the pleasanter things are fair and lovely. Before long we shall be finding fault with the prophetic priestess because she does not speak in purer tones than Glaucê,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> the scholium on Theocritus, iv. 31.</note> who sings to the lyre, and because she is not perfumed and clad in purple when she goes down into the inner shrine, and does not burn upon the altar cassia or ladanum or frankincense, but only laurel and barley meal. Do you not see,</q> he continued, <q>what grace the songs of Sappho have, charming and bewitching all who listen to them? But the Sibyl <q>with frenzied lips,</q> as Heracleitus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. p. 96, Heracleitus, no. 92.</note> has it, <q>uttering words mirthless, unembellislied, unperfumed, yet reaches to a thousand years with her voice through the god.</q> And Pindar<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Pindar, Frag. 32 (ed. Christ).</note> says that <q>Cadmus heard the god revealing music true,</q> not sweet nor voluptuous nor with suddenly changing melody.

Richards in the <title rend="italic">Classical Review</title>, xxix. 233.</note> was thrown down here, and the greater part of the evil in her has, apparently, gathered together to flood the ears of men.</q> <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 38 a-b.</note> </said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge">When Sarapion had said this, Theon smiled and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.275"/> said, <q>Sarapion has yielded as usual to his propensity by taking advantage of the incidental mention of Mischief and Pleasure. But as for us, Boëthus, even if these verses be inferior to Homer’s, let us not believe that the god has composed them, but that he supplies the origin of the incitement, and then the prophetic priestesses are moved each in accordance with her natural faculties. Certainly, if it were necessary to write the oracles, instead of delivering them orally, I do not think that we should believe the handwriting to be the god’s, and find fault with it because in beauty it fell short of that of the royal scribes. As a matter of fact, the voice is not that of a god,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> 404 b and 414 e, <foreign xml:lang="lat">infra</foreign>.</note> nor the utterance of it, nor the diction, nor the metre, but all these are the woman’s; he puts into her mind only the visions, and creates a light in her soul in regard to the future; for inspiration is precisely this. And, speaking in general, it is impossible to escape you who speak for Epicurus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Frag. 395.</note> (in fact you yourself, Boëthus, are obviously being borne in that direction); but you charge the prophetic priestesses of old with using bad verse, and those of the present day with delivering their oracles in prose and using commonplace words, so that they may not be liable to render an account to you for their wrong use of a short syllable at the beginning, middle, or end of their lines!<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Instead of the long syllable demanded by the metre. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Athenaeus, 632 d.</note> </q> </said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q>In Heaven’s name,</q> said Diogenianus, <q>do not jest, but solve for us this problem, which is of universal interest.

Yet this is not precisely foretelling, but telling; or rather it is a throwing and scattering of words without foundation into the infinite; and oftentimes Chance encounters them in their wanderings and accidentally falls into accord with them. As a matter of fact, the coming to pass of something that has been told is a different matter, I think, from the telling of something that will come to pass. For the pronouncement, telling of things non-existent, contains error in itself, and it is not equitable for it to await the confirmation that comes through accidental circumstances; nor can it use as a true proof of having foretold with knowledge the fact that the thing came about after the telling thereof, since Infinity brings all things to pass.

But where there is stated not only what shall come to pass, but also how and when and after what and attended by what, that is not a guess about what may perhaps come to pass, but a prognostication of things that shall surely be.

As a matter of fact, we heard them say earlier that when the despotism wras overthrown, the Corinthians wished to inscribe both the golden statue at Olympia and the treasure-house here with the name of their city, and the people of Delphi accordingly granted this as being a fair request, and gave their consent; but the Eleans refused out of ill-will, and the Corinthians voted that the Eleans should not be allowed to take part in the Isthmian Games.

There is in Phocis a shrine of Heracles the Womanhater, and it is the custom that the man who is appointed to the priesthood shall have no association with a woman within the year. For this reason they usually appoint as priests rather old men. By exception, only a few years ago, a young man, not at all bad, but ambitious, who was in love with a girl, gained the office. At first he was able to control himself, and succeeded in keeping out of her way; but when she suddenly carne in upon him as he was resting after drinking and dancing, he did the forbidden thing. Frightened and perturbed in consequence, he resorted at once to the oracle and asked the god about his sin, whether there were any way to obtain forgiveness or to expiate it; and he received this response: <quote rend="blockquote">All things that must be doth the god condone.</quote> <pb xml:id="v.5.p.313"/> </q></said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q rend="merge">However, even if anybody were to grant that no word of prophecy is uttered in our time without being in verse, such a person would be in much more perplexity regarding the oracles of ancient times which gave their responses at one time in verse and at another time without versification.

For pure design cannot be seen by us, and when it is made manifest in another guise and through another medium, it becomes contaminated with the nature of this medium. Wax, for example, and gold and silver I <pb xml:id="v.5.p.315"/> leave out of account, as well as other kinds of material,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Obviously what is left is marble, the less plastic material.</note> which, when moulded, take on the particular form of the likeness which is being modelled; and yet each one of them adds to the thing portrayed a distinguishing characteristic which comes from its own substance; and so also the numberless distortions in the reflected images of one single form seen in mirrors both plane and concave and convex. Indeed, if we contemplate the shining constellations, there is nothing that shows greater similarity in form, or which, as an instrument, is by nature more obedient in use than the moon. Receiving as it does from the sun its brilliant light and intense heat, it sends them away to us, not in the state in which they arrived, but, after being merged with it, they change their colour and also acquire a different potency. The heat is gone, and the light becomes faint because of weakness. </q></said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q rend="merge">I imagine that you are familiar with the saying found in Heraeleitus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Diels, <title xml:lang="deu" rend="italic">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</title>, i. p. 86, Heracleitus, no. b 93.</note> to the effect that the Lord whose prophetic shrine is at Delphi neither tells nor conceals, but indicates. Add to these words, which are so well said, the thought that the god of this place employs the prophetic priestess for men’s ears just as the sun employs the moon for men’s eyes. For he makes known and reveals his own thoughts, but he makes them known through the associated medium of a mortal body and a soul that is unable to keep quietior, as it yields itself to the One that <pb xml:id="v.5.p.317"/> moves it, to remain of itself unmoved and tranquil, but, as though tossed amid billows and enmeshed in the stirrings and emotions within itself, it makes itself more and more restless. </q></said></p> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"> <q rend="merge">For, as the eddies exercise no sure control over the bodies carried round and round in them, but, since the bodies are carried round and round by a compelling force, while they naturally tend to sink, there results from the two a confused and erratic circular movement, so, in like manner, what is called inspiration seems to be a combination of two impulses, the soul being simultaneously impelled through one of these by some external influence, and through the other by its own nature. Wherefore it is not possible to deal with inanimate and stationary bodies in a way contrary to their nature by bringing force to bear upon them, nor to make a cylinder in motion behave in the manner of a sphere or a cube, nor a lyre like a flute, nor a trumpet like a harp. No, the use of each thing artistically is apparently no other than its natural use. And as for the animate, endowed with power to move of itself and with its share of initiative and reason, could anyone treat it in a manner other than in keeping with the condition, faculty, or nature, already pre-existent in it, as, for example, trying to arouse to music a mind unmusical, or to letters the unlettered, or to eloquence one with no observation or training in speeches?

The reason is that Diomedes is a man of great strength and a warrior, Pandarus a bowman and a fool, Odysseus adept at speaking and a man of sense. The fact is that Homer did not have the same idea as Pindar, if it really was Pindar who wrote <q rend="italics" type="unspecified">God willing, you may voyage on a mat;<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">From the <title rend="italic">Thyestes</title> of Euripides: Nauck, <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Trag.

Now this power cannot move to flight that which can only walk or run, nor move a lisp to clear speaking, nor a shrill thin voice to melodious utterance. No, in the case of Battus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Herodotus, iv. 155; Pindar, <title rend="italic">Pythian Odes</title>, v., and the scholium to <title rend="italic">Pythian</title> iv. 10.</note> it was for this reason, when he came to consult the oracle for his voice, that the god sent him as a colonist to Africa, because Battus had a lisp and a shrill thin voice, but also had the qualities of a king and a statesman, and was a man or sense. So in the same way it is impossible for the unlettered man who has never read verse to talk like a poet. Even so the maiden <pb xml:id="v.5.p.321"/> who now serves the god here was born of as lawful and honourable wedlock as anyone, and her life has been in all respects proper; but, having been brought up in the home of poor peasants, she brings nothing with her as the result of technical skill or of any other expertness or faculty, as she goes down into the shrine. On the contrary, just as Xenophon<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Oeconomicus</title>, 7. 4-5.</note> believes that a bride should have seen as little and heard as little as possible before she proceeds to her husband’s house, so this girl, inexperienced and uninformed about practically everything, a pure, virgin soul, becomes the associate of the god. Now we cherish the belief that the god, in giving indications to us, makes use of the calls of herons, wrens, and ravens; but we do not insist that these, inasmuch as they are messengers and heralds of the gods, shall express everything rationally and clearly, and yet we insist that the voice and language of the prophetic priestess, like a choral song in the theatre, shall be presented, not without sweetness and embellishment, but also in verse of a grandiloquent and formal style with verbal metaphors and with a flute to accompany its delivery I </q></said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"> <p><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"><q rend="merge">What statement, then, shall we make about the priestesses of former days?

For the use of language is like the currency of coinage in trade: the coinage which is familiar and well known is also acceptable, although it takes on a different value at different times. There was, then, a time when men used as the coinage of speech verses and tunes and songs, and reduced to poetic and musical form all history and philosophy and, in a word, every experience and action that required a more impressive utterance. Not only is it a fact <pb xml:id="v.5.p.327"/> that nowadays but few people have even a limited understanding of this diction, but in those days the audience comprised all the people, who were delighted with Pindar’s<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Isthmian Odes</title>, i. 68: repeated more fully in <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 473 a.</note> song, <quote rend="blockquote">Shepherds and ploughmen and fowlers as well.</quote> Indeed, owing to this aptitude for poetic composition, most men through lyre and song admonished, spoke out frankly, or exhorted; they attained their ends by the use of myths and proverbs,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Passages from Hesiod, Theognis, and Archilochus might be cited in confirmation of these statements.

(1933) pp. 104-120.</note> and besides composed hymns, prayers, and paeans in honour of the gods in verse and music, some through their natural talent, others because it was the prevailing custom. Accordingly, the god did not begrudge to the art of prophecy adornment and pleasing grace, nor did he drive away from here the honoured Muse of the tripod, but introduced her rather by awakening and welcoming poetic natures; and he himself provided visions for them, and helped in prompting impressiveness and eloquence as something fitting and admirable. But, as life took on a change along with the change in men’s fortunes and their natures, when usa ge banished the unusual and did away with the golden topknots<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> Thucydides, i. 6.</note> and dressing in soft robes, and, on occasion, cut off the stately long hair and caused the buskin to be no longer worn, men accustomed themselves (nor was it a bad thing) to oppose expensive outlay by adorning themselves with economy, and to rate as decorative the plain and <pb xml:id="v.5.p.329"/> simple rather than the ornate and elaborate. So, as language also underwent a change and put off its finery, history descended from its vehicle of versification, and went on foot in prose, whereby the truth was mostly sifted from the fabulous. Philosophy welcomed clearness and teachability in preference to creating amazement, and pursued its investigations through the medium of everyday language. The god put an end to having his prophetic priestess call her own citizens <q>fire-blazers,</q> the Spartans <q>snake-devourers,</q> men <q>mountain-roamers,</q> and rivers <q>mountain-engorgers.</q> When he had taken away from the oracles epic versification, strange words, circumlocutions, and vagueness, he had thus made them ready to talk to his consultants as the laws talk to States, or as kings meet with common people, or as pupils listen to teachers, since he adapted the language to what was intelligible and convincing. </q></said></p> </div>

For the god does not follow Euripides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <title rend="italic">Phoenissae</title>, 958.</note> when he asserts as if he were laying down a law: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>None but Phoebus ought </l> <l>For men to prophesy.</l> </quote> But inasmuch as the god employs mortal men to assist him and declare his will, whom it is his duty to care for and protect, so that they shall not lose their lives at the hands of wicked men while ministering to a god, he is not willing to keep the truth unrevealed, but he caused the manifestation of it to be deflected, like a ray of light, in the medium of poetry, where it submits to many reflections and undergoes subdivisions, and thus he did away with its repellent harshness, There were naturally some things which it was well that despots should fail to understand and enemies should not learn beforehand. About these, therefore, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.335"/> he put a cloak of intimations and ambiguities<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">For example, the famous oracle given to Croesus (Herodotus, i. 53; Aristotle, <title rend="italic">Rhetoric</title>, iii. 5 (1407 a 39)) that if he crossed the river Halys he should overthrow a great kingdom; but the kingdom was his own.</note> which concealed the communication so far as others were concerned, but did not escape the persons involved nor mislead those that had need to know and who gave their minds to the matter. Therefore anyone is very foolish who, now that conditions have become different, complains and makes unwarranted indictment if the god feels that he must no longer help us in the same way, but in a different way. </q></said></p> </div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"><q rend="merge">For my part, I am well content with the settled conditions prevailing at present, and I find them very welcome, and the questions which men now put to the god are concerned with these conditions. There is, in fact, profound peace and tranquillity; war has ceased, there are no wanderings of peoples, no civil strifes, no despotisms, nor other maladies and ills in Greece requiring many unusual remedial forces. Where there is nothing complicated or secret or terrible, but the interrogations are on slight and commonplace matters, like the hypothetical questions in school: if one ought to marry, or to start on a voyage, or to make a loan; and the most important <pb xml:id="v.5.p.339"/> consultations on the part of States concern the yield from crops, the increase of herds, and public health — to clothe such things in verse, to devise circumlocutions, and to foist strange words upon inquiries that call for a simple short answer is the thing done by an ambitious pedant embellishing an oracle to enhance his repute. But the prophetic priestess has herself also nobility of character, and whenever she descends into that place and finds herself in the presence of the god, she cares more for fulfilling her function than for that kind of repute or for men’s praise or blame. </q></said></p> </div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"> <p rend="indent"><said who="#Philinus" rend="merge"><q rend="merge">We also, perhaps, ought to have this frame of mind. But as it is, we act as if we were anxious and fearful lest the place here lose the repute of its three thousand years, and some few persons should cease to come here, contemning the oracle as if it were the lecturing of some popular speaker; and we offer a plea in defence and invent reasons and arguments for matters which we do not understand, and which it is not fitting that we should understand. We try to appease and win over the man who complains, instead of bidding him take his leave for all time, <quote rend="blockquote">Since for himself first of all it will prove to be more distressing,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true">Adapted from Homer, <title rend="italic">Od.</title> ii. 190.</note> </quote> if the opinion which he holds about the god is such that he can accept and admire the maxims<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="true"> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cf.</foreign> <title xml:lang="lat" rend="italic">Moralia</title>, 164 b, 385 d, 511 a.</note> of the Wise Men inscribed here, <q>Know thyself</q> and <q>Avoid extremes,</q> because of their conciseness especially, since this very conciseness contains in small compass a compact and firmly=forged sentiment, <pb xml:id="v.5.p.341"/> and yet he can impeach the oracles because they give nearly all their communications in brief, simple, and straightforward language. Now such sayings as these of the Wise Men are in the same case with streams forced into a narrow channel, for they do not keep the transparency or translucence of the sentiment, but if you will investigate what has been written and said about them by men desirous of learning fully the why and wherefore of each, you will not easily find more extensive writings on any other subject. And as for the language of the prophetic priestess, just as the mathematicians call the shortest of lines between two points a straight line, so her language makes no bend nor curve nor doubling nor equivocation, but is straight in relation to the truth; yet, in relation to men’s confidence in it, it is insecure and subject to scrutiny, but as yet it has afforded no proof of its being wrong. On the contrary, it has filled the oracular shrine with votive offerings and gifts from barbarians and Greeks, and has adorned it with beautiful buildings and embellishments provided by the Amphictyonic Council.
