            <head>CONCERNING TALKATIVENESS
					(DE GARRULITATE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					This charming essay, by far the best in the volume,
					suffers from only one defect, its length. Though
					Plutarch again and again, by his narrative skill and
					na√Øve or unconscious humour, will delight even those
					who have hardened their hearts against him (I mean
					his editors), he cannot at last resist the temptation to
					indulge in what he considered scientific analysis and
					enlightened exhortation. He is then merely dull.
					But, taken as a whole, the essay is surely a success,
					and as organic and skilful a performance as any in
					the <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>.

            <p>It is a troublesome and difficult task that philosophy has in hand when it undertakes to cure garrulousness. For the remedy, words of reason, requires listeners ; but the garrulous listen to nobody,
					for they are always talking. And this is the first
					symptom of their ailment: looseness of the tongue
					becomes impotence of the ears.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">It suits Plutarch's humour in this passage, in which he speaks of garrulity as a disease, to invent one, and possibly two, pseudo-medical terms, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)sighsi/a</foreign>, <q>inability to keep silent,</q> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nhkoi/+a</foreign>, <q>inability to listen.</q> The figure is maintained in <foreign xml:lang="greek">diarre/ousi</foreign> at the end of section d. Rouse suggests: <q>And here is the first bad symptom in diarrhoea of the tongue - constipation of the ears.</q>
               </note> For it is a deliberate
					deafness, that of men who, I take it, blame Nature
					because they have only one tongue, but two ears.b
					If, then, Euripides<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

					it would be more just to say to the garrulous man,
					or rather about the garrulous man,

					and among them the two first and greatest, the

					possibility of attaining their desires, but for babblers
					this is very difficult: they desire listeners and cannot
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.401"/>
					
					get them, since every one runs away headlong. If
					men are sitting in a public lounge or strolling about
					in a portico, and see a talker coming up, they
					quickly give each other the counter-sign to break
					camp. And just as when silence occurs in an assemblage they say that Hermes has joined the company,
					so when a chatterbox comes into a dinner-party or
					social gathering, every one grows silent, not wishing
					to furnish him a hold ; and if he begins of his own
					accord to open his mouth,
					<quote rend="blockquote">As when the North-wind blows along

					suspecting that they will be tossed about and sea-sick,
					they rise up and go out. And so it is a talker's lot
					when travelling by land or sea, to find volunteer
					listeners neither as table-companions nor as tentmates, but only conscripts; for the talker is at
					you everywhere, catching your cloak, plucking your
					beard, digging you in the ribs.
					<quote rend="blockquote">Then are your feet of the greatest value,</quote>
					as Archilochus<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Edmonds, <hi rend="italics">Elegy and Iambus</hi>, ii. p. 182, Frag. 132.</note> says, and on my word the wise Aristotle will agree. For when Aristotle himself was
					annoyed by a chatterer and bored with some silly
					stories, and the fellow kept repeating, <q>Isn't it
						wonderful, Aristotle?</q> 
               <q>There's nothing wonderful about that,</q> said Aristotle, <q>but that anyone with

					if chatterers force their talk upon us, the soul surrenders to them the ears to be flooded from outside,
					but herself within unrolls thoughts of another sort and
					follows them out by herself. Therefore talkers do
					not find it easy to secure listeners who either pay
					attention or believe what they say ; for just as they
					affirm that the seed of persons too prone to lusts
					of the flesh is barren, so is the speech of babblers
					ineffectual and fruitless.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">

					without doors and purses without fastenings are of
					no use to their owners, yet keep their mouths without lock or door, maintaining as perpetual an outflow
					as the mouth of the Black Sea, appear to regard
					speech as the least valuable of all things. They do
					not, therefore, meet with belief,<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 519 d, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> which is the object
					of all speech. For this is the proper end and aim
					of speech, to engender belief in the hearer ; but
					chatterers are disbelieved even if they are telling the
					truth. For as wheat shut up in a jar<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">Or a <q>pit,</q> perhaps; <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 697 d.</note> is found to
					have increased in quantity, but to have deteriorated
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.405"/>
					
					in quality, so when a story finds its way to a chatterer,
					it generates a large addition of falsehood and thereby

					of drunkenness say that it is intoxicated and foolish
					talking ; thus drinking is not blamed if silence attends
					the drinking, but it is foolish talk which converts the
					influence of wine into drunkenness. While it is true
					that the drunken man talks foolishness in his cups,
					the chatterer talks foolishness on all occasions, in the
					market-place, in the theatre, out walking, drunk or
					sober, by day, by night. As your physician, he is
					worse than the disease ; as your ship-mate, more
					unpleasant than sea-sickness ; his praises are more

					A panic naturally arose and the people gathered in
					assembly and tried to come at the origin of the

					questioned ; yet he did not even know the name of
					his informant, but referred the origin to a nameless
					and unknown person. The assembly was enraged
					and cried out, <q>Torture the cursed fellow! Put him

					do not forestall him by taking the answer out of his
					mouth. For perhaps there are other times also when
					it is not seemly, another having been asked, to
					shoulder him aside and volunteer ourselves, since we
					shall seem to be casting a slur both on the man asked,
					as being unable to furnish what is demanded of him,
					and on the asker, as being ignorant of the source from
					which he can get help ; and, in particular, such precipitancy and boldness in answering questions smacks
					of insolence. For one who tries to get in the answTer
					ahead of the man who is questioned suggests, <q>What
						do you need <hi rend="italics">him</hi> for?</q> or <q>What does <hi rend="italics">he</hi> know?</q> or
					<q>When I am present, no one else should be asked
						about these matters.</q> And yet we often ask people
					questions, not because we need an answer, but to elicit
					some friendly word from them, and because we wish
					to draw them on to friendly converse, as Socrates did
					with Theaetetus and Charmides.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italics">Theaetetus</hi>, 143 d, <hi rend="italics">Charmides</hi>, 154 e ff.</note> So to take the
					answer out of another's mouth, to divert another's
					hearing and attract his attention and wrest it from
					some other, is as bad as to run up and kiss someone
					who wished to be kissed by somebody else, or to turn
					toward yourself someone who was looking at another;
					since, even if he who has been asked cannot give the
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.453"/>
					
					information, it is proper to practise restraint and
					conform oneself to the wish of the asker and thus to
					encounter with modesty and decorum the situation,
					an invitation, as it were, given to another. And
					it is also true that if persons who are asked questions
					make mistakes in their answers, they meet with just
					indulgence ; but he who voluntarily undertakes an
					answer and anticipates another is unpleasant even if
					he corrects a mistake, and if he makes a mistake
					himself, he affords a malicious joy to one and all, and
					becomes an object of ridicule.

            <p>Then the second matter for diligent practice
					concerns our own answers ; to these the chatterer
					must pay very close attention : in the first place, that
					he may not inadvertently give a serious answer to
					those who provoke him to talk merely that they may
					insolently ridicule him.<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 547 c.</note> For some persons who require no information, but merely to divert and amuse
					themselves, devise questions and put them to men of
					this sort to set going their foolish twaddle. Against
					this talkers should be on their guard and not leap
					upon a subject quickly, or as though grateful that it
					is offered to them, but should first consider both the
					character of the questioner and the necessity for the
					question. And when it appears that the questioner
					is really anxious to learn, the babbler must accustom
					himself to stop and leave between the question and
					the answer an interval, in which the asker may add
					anything he wishes and he himself may reflect upon
					his reply instead of overrunning and obscuring the
					question by giving a long string of answers in a
					hurry while the question is still being asked. For
					although the Pythian priestess is accustomed to
					
					<pb n="v.6.p.455"/>
					
					deliver some oracles on the instant, even before the
					question is put-for the god whom she serves
					<quote rend="blockquote">Understands the dumb and hears when no man speaks<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Herodotus, i. 47.</note>-</quote>
					yet the man who wishes to make a careful answer
					must wait to apprehend exactly the sense and the
					intent of him who asks the question, lest it befall, as
					the proverb<note resp="#ed" anchored="true">
                  <hi rend="italics">Paroemiographi Graeci</hi>, i. p. 28; Kock, <hi rend="italics">Com. Att. Frag.</hi>, iii. p. 494, ades. 454.</note> has it,
					<quote rend="blockquote">They asked for buckets, but tubs were refused.</quote>
					In any case this ravenous hunger for talking must be
					checked so that it may not seem as though a stream
					which has long been pressing hard upon the tongue
					were being gladly discharged at the instance of the
					question. Socrates, in fact, used to control his thirst
					in this manner-he would not allow himself to drink
					after exercise until he had drawn up and poured out
					the first bucketful, so that his irrational part might
					be trained to await the time dictated by reason.

            <p>Furthermore, there are three kinds of answers
					to questions : the barely necessary, the polite, and
					the superfluous. For example, if someone asks, <q>Is

					And if he wishes to adopt the Laconic style, he may
					omit the <q>At home</q> and only utter the bare negative. So the Spartans, when Philip wrote to ask if
					they would receive him into their city, wrote a large
					<q>No</q> on the paper and sent it back. Another will
					answer more politely, <q>He is not at home, but at the

					aside and diverts it, being unable to give even so
					small a fee as silence, but he works steadily around
					until he drives the conversation into the stale and
					well-worn paths of twaddle. Just so, in my native
					town, there was a man who chanced to have read two

					is either for their own sake, because they need something, or to benefit their hearers, or they seek to
					ingratiate themselves with each other by seasoning
					with the salt of conversation the pastime or business
					in which they happen to be engaged. But if a remark is neither useful to the speaker nor of serious
